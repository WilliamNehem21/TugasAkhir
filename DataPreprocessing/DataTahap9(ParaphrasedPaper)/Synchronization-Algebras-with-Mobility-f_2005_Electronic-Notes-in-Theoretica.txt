In this research paper, we introduce an extension of synchronization algebras that enables the consideration of mobility and local resource management. We demonstrate its applicability in modeling communication primitives for distributed and mobile computations, particularly those utilized in global computing. A formalism for graph transformation within the synchronized hyperedge replacement approach is proposed, which is parametric with respect to the synchronization algebra. This formalism allows for the modeling of complex systems based on chosen communication primitives, unifying different models described in existing literature and facilitating the definition of new ones. Furthermore, we present several examples and a case study on fusion calculus to illustrate how different semantics for it can be derived using different synchronization algebras.

We adopt hypergraphs as the fundamental model for our system, as they offer a clear representation and naturally capture the topology of distributed systems. We interpret edges as processes or subsystems, and nodes as channels or ports through which communication occurs.

Our aim is to model systems using hypergraphs, which extend graphs by allowing hyperedges to connect to any number of attachment nodes. Specifically, we employ hypergraphs with labeled edges, where each edge is an atomic item with a label from a ranked alphabet and has a corresponding number of ordered tentacles. A graph is formed by a set of nodes and labeled edges, where each edge is connected to its attachment nodes by its tentacles. The graph is connected to its environment through an interface, with nodes in the interface being termed free nodes, while others are considered bound. We work with graphs up to isomorphisms that preserve free nodes, edge labels, and connections between edges and nodes.

In our approach, edges represent processes, nodes represent channels, and free nodes denote public channels. It is crucial to note that nodes are initially bound when created and become free (or "extruded") when merged with a free node or when a reference to them is exposed on a free node.

We employ the notations f|s (respectively, f|\s) to denote the restriction of function f to the new domain s (respectively, the complement of s in the domain of f). Additionally, we use v[n] to denote the nth element of vector v and set(v) to denote the set of elements in v.

For example 5.2 (the game of life), we discuss the cellular automaton known as the game of life, in which the grid comprises evolving cells that can be either empty or populated (alive). A living cell dies if it has one or no alive neighbors (loneliness) or if it has four or more alive neighbors (overpopulation), and it survives otherwise. An empty cell becomes alive if it has exactly three alive neighbors. To model the game of life, we utilize edges to represent cells with labels "a" for alive and "e" for empty, which are connected to their eight neighboring cells.

Suppose that processes can only perform the actions "out" and "(in, 1)", with the others being auxiliary. During synchronization, the inputs are merged, and until a certain number "m" of them have joined, the parameter of the output is kept separate. Thus, for the processes performing input to receive the piece of information in the output, at least "m" of them must participate in the synchronization. If there are not enough processes, synchronization occurs, but no data exchange takes place.
