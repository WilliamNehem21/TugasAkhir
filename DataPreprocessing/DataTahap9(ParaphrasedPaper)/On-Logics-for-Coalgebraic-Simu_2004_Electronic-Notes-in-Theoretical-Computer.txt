This academic paper discusses the development of logics for bisimulation in the context of coalgebraic types. The logics proposed are generic and make use of a single modal operator derived directly from the coalgebraic signature. However, it is noted that these logics are challenging to apply in actual specification due to their syntax not reflecting the structure of the underlying types.

The paper introduces a compositional method for defining logics that capture simulation, allowing for the derivation of logics for combinations of coalgebraic types from logics for the individual types involved. This approach ensures that the structure of the underlying types is reflected in the modal operators employed by the resulting logics.

The authors draw parallels to previous work on logics capturing bisimulation, highlighting the need for ways to combine notions of simulation for different types and the necessity of tailoring the expressivity condition accordingly.

The paper also explores different approaches to defining a category of relations, discussing the implications of weak monotonic relators extending an endofunctor and the characterization of such relators.

Furthermore, the paper describes an inductive method for defining logics capturing simulation, and demonstrates how various operations on coalgebraic types induce corresponding operations on relators and language constructors, preserving the expressiveness of language constructors with respect to given relators.

The compositional techniques developed in the paper are used to define notions of simulation and logics capturing simulation for various probabilistic system types, ultimately leading to a coalgebraic characterization of simulation on discrete Markov processes and the development of a logic capturing this notion of simulation.
