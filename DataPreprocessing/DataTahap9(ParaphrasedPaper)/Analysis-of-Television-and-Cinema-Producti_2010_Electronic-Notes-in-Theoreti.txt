The aforementioned techniques are all based on similar assumptions, which involve a continuous or fluid approximation of counting processes to compute the number of objects in various states. Despite their approximative nature, these techniques yield highly accurate solutions as the population size increases. More detailed information on the accuracy of such approximations in relation to population size can be found elsewhere.

This paper utilizes mean field analysis to investigate the behavior of users in two distinct contexts: cinema and television. The models incorporate generalized stochastic Petri nets (GSPN) to describe the behavior of different agents. In the case of cinema, Section 3 focuses on the evolution of the number of spectators and available seats in theaters following the release of a new movie. Meanwhile, Section 4 delves into the evolution of the television series audience, taking into account production improvements.

The mean field analysis is primarily employed to handle a large number of interacting components in this study. To simplify the presentation of the models, the behavior of the agents is described using GSPN instead of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC). Additionally, the computation of the transition matrix of the CTMC associated with the GSPN must be performed symbolically to preserve the system's state dependency.

When specifying the state-dependent transition rate, 'r(ti)' is used to denote the rate of transition 'ti'. Furthermore, 'n(p)' represents the number of objects characterized by marking 'p', with 'n(pi)' specifically denoting the number of agents marked with place 'pi'. When expressing dependencies from the controller, '#(pi)' signifies the number of tokens in place 'pi' (in this case, 'pi' must be a place within the GSPN of the controller).

The first model considered aims to analyze the behavior of viewers of a newly released movie. This involves presenting statistical data characterizing the system, describing the proposed model, and subsequently comparing the results and data to appraise the effectiveness of the model.

In the observed trend, denoted as 'c', there is a resurgence in income after the initial decline, likely stemming from positive feedback received from viewers of the film. This positive reinforcement leads to a change of heart in many individuals initially uninterested in the movie, who may decide to watch it based on favorable feedback. It is believed that this resurgence represents a form of positive reinforcement resulting from the unexpectedly strong alignment of the movie's features with audience expectations.

Further exploration through cinemas is conducted. When place 'p6' is marked, the distributor remains idle for 'w1', as represented by transition 't5' with a firing rate of 'r(t5) = 1'. Additionally, when place 'p7' is marked, the distributor makes a decision after 'w2' time, moving the token to place 'p8' (accomplished through the firing of transition 't6' with a rate of 'r(t6) = 1'). This decision is facilitated by two immediate transitions, 't1' and 't2', with specific weightings.

The number of spectators correlates with the actual income, displaying a reasonable correlation. However, some issues are evident at the start of the curves, which are hypothesized to be linked to the non-Markovian nature of most considered transitions. The exponential approximation, even if non-homogeneous, may be insufficient to capture these characteristics.

The study introduces assumptions regarding viewer behavior in response to the quality of the show and improvements in advertising. It is assumed that approximately every 6 days, individuals evaluate whether their quality expectations are met by the next episode ('vq = 6 days'), about every 3 days the show's advertising can influence their decision ('vl = 3 days'), and roughly every day the word-of-mouth influence can persuade them ('vpp = 1 day'). Additionally, after 60% of the total number of episodes, a spectator is presumed to become disinterested in the show.

The focus of the study is on the time frame from 6:00 pm to 8:30 pm, just before the start of primetime in Italy. Given the strong competition between networks during primetime, audience data are less influenced by the outcome of a single channel.

Finally, the model is adapted to prioritize either quality ('gq') or advertising ('gl'). The results from the previous section are adjusted to account for days instead of weeks, with an assumed system evolution time of 28 days in both cases.
