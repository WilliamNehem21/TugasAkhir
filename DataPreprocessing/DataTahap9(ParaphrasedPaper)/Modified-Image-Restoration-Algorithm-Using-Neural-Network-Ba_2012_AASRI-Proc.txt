The initial algorithm used a regular distribution of elements and the connection weights matrix calculation was simplified, reducing space complexity to o(n) from o(n^2) and improving time complexity, representing a significant advancement. Initially proposed by Zhou et al. in 1988, the neural network for image restoration model associated image restoration with a Hopfield neural network through an energy function, leading to the optimization problem of neural network calculation. However, this approach had drawbacks, such as a large network model and slow network state updates. Seeking to address these limitations, Paik et al. proposed an improved Hopfield neural network model for grayscale image restoration in 1992, which was subsequently refined by various scholars to enhance the network model and convergence rate. Building on the Paik algorithm, Wu (2006) introduced a neural network algorithm based on the harmonic model and regularization term.

Based on the above, we determined that there was no need to generate the Toeplitz matrix H during the algorithm. Instead, specific numerical values could be calculated according to a rule. This approach offers substantial improvements in both space and time complexity. Accordingly, we outlined the algorithm for calculating W.

This paper first examined the complexity of the original algorithm and then conducted a detailed analysis of the connection weight matrix calculation process, identifying internal structural features. The findings were summarized in Theorems 1 and 2, which were then applied to the original algorithm. Subsequently, a new improved algorithm was proposed to save time and space. Finally, a data simulation experiment was conducted to deepen understanding of the algorithm and illustrate the advantages of the improved algorithm.
