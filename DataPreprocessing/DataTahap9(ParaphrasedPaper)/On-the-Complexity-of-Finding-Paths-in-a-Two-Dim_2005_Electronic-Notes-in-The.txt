The domain constructed in theorem 4.3 meets property (b) but is not simply connected, and in fact it contains an infinite number of holes. Whether the construction can be modified to create a simply connected domain or a multiply connected domain (i.e., a domain with a finite number of holes) is an intriguing open question. The result of theorem 4.1 also applies to the k-path problem for k > 1, so we have a less stringent lower bound for simply connected domains satisfying either property (a) or property (b).
