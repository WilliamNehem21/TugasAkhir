Regrettably, while it is possible to determine the reachability between terms in prefix rewriting systems (PRS), the problem becomes undecidable for ordered prefix rewriting systems (O-PRS) due to the associativity of operations. Despite this challenge, our paper focuses on addressing the reachability problem between two (infinite) sets of terms. As process terms can be viewed as trees, we examine representations of sets of terms based on tree automata with a bottom-up approach. To circumvent the issue of undecidability, we take the following steps: creating better underapproximations. Additionally, if the computed underapproximations are the same for k and k+1, then we can infer that an exact representation of the reachability set has been computed. It should be noted that the underapproximations we derive are exact if the ordered processes are only capable of a finite number of communications. This condition is applicable to our case study, which represents a real-world example.
