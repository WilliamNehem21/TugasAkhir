The paper presents a novel wireless electronic scale utilizing an MSP430 microprocessor, which enables wireless communication for downloading commodity information from a personal computer, storing sales data, uploading to a PC, and obtaining commodity prices using commodity codes. The control core of the system is the MSP430F135 mixed signal microcontroller, and it processes the output signal of the strain sensor through instrumentation and inverting amplifiers, followed by analog-to-digital conversion using the integrated ADC module. The ADC result and relevant information are managed in flash memory (AT45DB081) by the MSP430F135.

The weighing result is displayed using LED driven by a 74HC373 chip, and the sales data is transmitted via a wireless communication module (PTR2000). The PTR2000 communicates with the host computer through a serial port communication chip (MAX232), and the receiving program is developed in VB language.

The output voltage after conditioning is 0~3.3V, matched with the ADC module in MSP430F135. The 12-bit sigma-delta ADC operated using an external resistor divider to provide the reference voltage, implementing a VCC-independent, ratio metric measurement principle. Real-time clock and data information are sourced from the PCF8563, a low power consumption CMOS real-time clock/calendar with serial data transfer via a bidirectional I2C-bus.

After multiple measurements and adjustments, the paper outlines the conversion of 0~5kg weight to 0~3.3V voltage which is sampled by the 12-bit sigma-delta ADC module. A moving average filter method is employed to improve precision.

The electronic scale not only measures the weight of the commodity but also facilitates the upload of detailed transaction information to the host PC and the download of commodity information through wireless and serial port communication. The scale has a maximum load capacity of 5kg with a 1g resolution. The application of INA326 and OPA2234 resolves issues related to amplifying weak signals and interfacing. Furthermore, the combination of MSP430 and PTR2000 effectively communicates with the host PC, and MAX232 handles level conversion. The user interface allows users to conveniently modify commodity prices and analyze consumer habits. Additionally, the paper suggests that incorporating multiple slave electronic scales into the system could further enhance its capabilities.
