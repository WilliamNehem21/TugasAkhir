The Internet of Things (IoT) has become a widely discussed and applied concept in various fields in recent years. Its core idea is to interconnect all devices, such as those embedded with RFID and sensors, in order to enable people to utilize the information from these devices to enhance their daily lives. Given that these things are constantly located in different places at different times, and the information associated with them may have varying access rights at different locations and times, it is crucial for IoT access control mechanisms to incorporate location and temporal constraints to bolster the security of applications.

Current access control schemes for IoT primarily focus on authentication and overlook more general models. While Benenson et al. offer a solution for defending against node capture through sensor node collaboration, Shen proposes three access control schemes utilizing one-way key chains and Merkle hash trees. Notably, there is a lack of attention to more general access models for IoT, with specialized schemes taking precedence.

In this paper, we present a model known as the Location-Temporal Access Control (LTAC) model, which integrates location, time, and security level to regulate access to information within the sensing layer of IoT. The key principle of the LTAC model is its utilization of a lattice approach to reduce the size of policy bases. We demonstrate how the components of the model are related to location and how this location information can be leveraged to determine a subject's access to a given object.

We further introduce the concept of calendar times (CT), where any two calendar times are always comparable, and discuss various types of time constraints in IoT, such as the earliest access time (EAT) and the latest finish time (LFT), to formalize time constraints within the IoT context.
