In recent times, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become integral to various daily activities, utilizing Internet connectivity to link computing devices and enable users to perform tasks. IoT applications rely on sensing devices to gather and share data wirelessly, leading to a significant amount of data flow, thus making it a data-intensive domain.

This study aims to enhance data availability and system performance for IoT applications by reducing energy and latency costs. The proposed approach, called ifogrep, involves intelligent data replication and placement using fog computing. The first contribution is a dynamic placement mechanism that uses machine learning to allocate sensing devices to optimal owner nodes, minimizing system latency. The second contribution is an intelligent replication protocol that reduces the quantity of transmitted data and minimizes access latency by employing an adaptive prediction technique.

The remainder of the paper includes a review of previous work on IoT latency, availability, and inconsistency issues, a presentation of the proposed approach and algorithms for improving IoT placement, replication, and consistency, an experimental evaluation of the proposed approach, and a concluding section.

Additionally, the study introduces a dynamic data placement and replication method, utilizing graph partitioning for efficient storage and implementing support vector machine for data center classification and workload prediction. Moreover, the study emphasizes the need to maintain data consistency among replicas to achieve high data availability, as replica synchronization can add latency to the platform based on the quantity of copies and their locations.

Furthermore, the study discusses the utilization of consumer lists to manage node changes and elaborates on the path miner subcomponent responsible for determining optimized shortest paths between fog nodes. Additionally, it outlines the unique assignment of sensing devices to optimal fog nodes, designating each fog node as the owner of specific data items to ensure efficient data transfer and reduced latency.
