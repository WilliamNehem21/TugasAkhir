In recent years, scientists have conducted research into the practicality of utilizing crop signaling techniques. Despite the growing interest in this area, there has been a lack of comprehensive review papers discussing the use of crop signaling technology for plant identification. This paper aims to fill that gap by providing an overview of the novel concept of crop planting signaling.

The paper begins by outlining the challenges associated with current noncontact methods, such as spectroscopy and imaging techniques (e.g., hyperspectral imaging and multispectral imaging), for distinguishing between crops and weeds. Section 3 of the paper emphasizes recent studies that have explored advanced crop plant signaling through the use of physical, biological, and chemical markers. These markers are employed to simplify and ensure the success of crop and weed detection.

The paper also discusses the advantages, challenges, and future prospects of crop planting signaling for real-time applications. It acknowledges that while it is possible to achieve high accuracies (88% to 94%) in distinguishing between canola and tomato crops and various weeds grown under different sunlight intensities, a significant amount of time and effort is required to effectively remove redundant information contained in the full wavelength range. This is necessary to simplify the model and improve the speed of online detection.
