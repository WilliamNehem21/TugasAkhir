In section 2, we review fundamental concepts pertaining to parity games. Section 3 delves into the discussion of our design pattern, its invariants, and its correctness. Section 4 presents and proves the correctness of three aspects in which our design pattern can be instantiated. Section 5 explores the beneficial interaction of aspects and discusses an approach in aspect a3. We also discuss an incremental approach that enables incremental computation and storage of memoryless winning strategies in our design pattern, although we will not delve into this in the present paper. Incorporating such functionality is a standard procedure.

If a player does not own v1, it follows that games g(v1,v3) and g(v1,v2) must have the same winning regions. However, aspect a3 recognizes that node v0 is won by player 1 in game g(v1,v3), and by player 0 in game g(v1,v2). Consequently, probe(a3) identifies in its initial stage that v1 is won by player 1 in g.\

This paper is built upon preliminary work discussed in the earlier abstract. In the previous publication, neither the aspect transformer nor proofs were provided, but the design pattern (without addressing dead ends and self-loops) and weaker invariants were presented. The previous paper introduced four aspects, of which a1 corresponds to the aspect presented in this current paper, and a3 is formulated non-incrementally. Leveraging the concept of lax parity games, we were able to merge aspects a2 and a4 into the single aspect a2 in this paper.

Furthermore, we utilize the characterization of winning strategies through progress measures, as outlined in [cite], to simplify the problem of solving parity games to satisfiability checks in propositional logic. Additionally, we present initial experimental results for this reduction. This approach currently only determines the winning status of a selected node and needs to be expanded to encompass global reasoning over parity games. It would also be valuable to investigate whether progress measures and their resulting reduction to satisfiability can be formulated as aspects within our framework.
