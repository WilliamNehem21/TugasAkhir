Consequently, researchers have begun utilizing non-contact, rapid field measurement techniques, such as near infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and computer vision, to identify material evidence at crime scenes. Takamura et al. demonstrated a method for detecting dry urine traces using Fourier transform attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy, which revealed the chemical differences between male and female urine donors. Zhao et al. proposed a nondestructive detection method for various liquids, including apple juice, Coca-Cola, coffee, oolong tea, and milk, applied to cotton denim fabrics of different colors and concentrations. The study involved contaminating the fabrics with liquids at different concentrations to investigate their detection using hyperspectral imaging.

To ensure the stability of the calibration process, reference white and dark images were acquired and averaged for correction. Although the spatial information of hyperspectral images could be valuable in practical applications, the study focused only on analyzing the spectral data as the distribution of the liquid on the fabric and the fabric composition were uniform. The study used hyperspectral imaging to collect 2000 spectra for each image, resulting in a total of 10,000 spectra for each material condition.

The study then employed the random forest algorithm, a machine learning method, for data classification. The performance of the classifier was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the data set was divided into training and test sets for model evaluation. The study also detailed the process of developing an optimal classification model based on these evaluations.

The spectrograms of liquids were found to be more complex compared to those of fabrics. A distinct wavelength characteristic was identified for different fabric types, and the study concluded that the first wave crest could differentiate between the fabric types.

In summary, the study developed a hyperspectral imaging system for detecting liquid residue traces at crime scenes. Classification models using support vector machine and random forest algorithms were established, and an optimal combination strategy was selected. The system was effective in classifying liquid categories, liquid concentration, and different liquid categories on denim, achieving positive indicators over 81%, and in some cases, over 91%. The system's performance was particularly strong when classifying liquid category and concentration.
