The early and accurate detection of diseases in plants and agroecosystems is crucial for effective disease management and maintaining the productivity of crops. This study focuses on the development of a lightweight custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model and the use of transfer learning (TL) based models VGG-16 and VGG-19 to classify tomato leaf diseases. The study utilizes eleven classes, including one healthy class, to simulate various tomato leaf diseases and conducts an ablation study to identify the optimal parameters for the proposed model. By applying data augmentation techniques, the proposed model achieves the highest accuracy and recall of 95.00% among all the models. The best-performing model is then deployed to create a web-based and Android-based end-to-end (E2E) system for tomato cultivators to classify tomato leaf disease.

Early blight, late blight, tetranychus urticae (two spotted spider mite), and whiteflies are the most common diseases and pests affecting tomato crops. Detection and classification of these diseases are essential for effective disease management, as they can lead to significant economic losses in the agricultural sector.

Various studies have been conducted on the classification of tomato leaf diseases using deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The use of DL techniques, particularly CNN models, has shown significant improvements in classification accuracy for image-related tasks. Researchers have also used feature extraction and ML algorithms to classify tomato leaf diseases, with different approaches achieving varying levels of accuracy.

The effectiveness of applied models is influenced by the dataset acquisition procedure. Data augmentation techniques have been used to balance the quantity of images across all classes, resulting in improved classification accuracy. Additionally, the deployment of trained models on web or application-based platforms provides an end-to-end solution for farmers to identify and manage suspected diseases in tomato plants.

The proposed study uses the "tomato disease multiple sources" dataset, which contains images of tomato leaf diseases captured from both laboratory and in-the-wild scenes. Data augmentation techniques have been applied to enrich the training dataset, and learning curves have been generated to evaluate the generalization ability of the models. The study demonstrates that the proposed model, with augmentation techniques, achieves the highest accuracy of 95.00% among the employed models, and performs better in terms of the area under the curve (AUC) score and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

The best-performing proposed model has been deployed in a lightweight TensorFlow version compatible with Android applications, allowing users to classify tomato leaf diseases by capturing live images or selecting existing images from their devices. This application provides rapid and accurate results, and can be downloaded from the open access repository provided by the authors.

In summary, this study proposes an effective and lightweight CNN model for tomato leaf disease classification, achieving a high accuracy of 95.00%. The model has been deployed in a web-based and Android-based application, providing a practical tool for tomato cultivators to identify and manage diseases in their crops.
