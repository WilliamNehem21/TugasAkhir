The bioconcentration factor (BCF) is a measure of a chemical's tendency to accumulate in the organic tissues of living organisms, typically fish. It is defined as the ratio of the chemical concentration in the organism to the concentration in the surrounding water at steady-state conditions in the laboratory. This ratio is often adjusted to a fixed lipid content (5%) of the test organism. Common species used for testing BCF include fathead minnow, bluegill sunfish, and rainbow trout.

For model training, experimental BCF data was obtained from Grisoni et al. They compiled BCF values for 1056 compounds by consolidating three datasets used for developing BCF QSAR models, along with 45 compounds with special metabolism or known KOW-BCF relationships (e.g., pyrethroids, organophosphorus compounds, perfluorinated and polychlorinated compounds).

To build the external test set, BCF values were searched in the PPDB (as of 08-03-2022) that were not part of the training dataset or the Meylan model training set. Only entries with an assigned quality level of 4 or 5, indicating that the endpoints have been reviewed and curated by PPDB providers and were used for regulatory purposes in most cases, were included. Molecules containing metal atoms and stereoisomers with a log unit difference in BCF greater than 0.8 between isomers were excluded, and data reliability was cross-checked based on original study reports or public lists of endpoints. This resulted in a final curated test set of 80 molecules.

The BCF data was transformed into 512-dimensional descriptors by CDDD without any pre-processing. Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost were trained on the BCF data using the CDDD embeddings as input features. Nested cluster cross-validation was used for hyperparameter optimizations and model selection.

The BCF model was evaluated using post-hoc perturbation methods, feature ablation, and occlusion to establish a gradient-free method for assessing the importance of individual SMILES characters. While the VEGA read-across model outperformed the XBCF model for molecules within the applicability domain, the XBCF model was evaluated on the full set of molecules and showed promising results for new chemical classes.

Additionally, two input perturbation methods were introduced to obtain signed atom-level sensitivity scores, allowing for the inspection of model predictions for each input molecule. These methods are gradient-free, making them widely applicable regardless of the downstream modeling algorithm used.

The sensitivity scores were found to be context-dependent, varying based on the input SMILES notation. Different visualization methods were compared for their usefulness in interpreting molecular structures, with the character substitution method being slightly more useful for visualizing molecular structures due to its robustness with respect to symmetry.

The study explored the effects of functional groups on BCF predictions and compared group sensitivity scores to the correction factors of the KOWWIN model and QSARpy modulators. It demonstrated that the data-driven approach could be used for exploring effects of functional groups, providing a new explanation method with smiles token sensitivity scores that serve as local explanations for each prediction.

Overall, the new explanation method was found to be useful for understanding the predictions of the model based on its internal representation, and it can potentially assist with molecular design and mechanistic understanding of bioaccumulation processes. However, it was noted that the sensitivity scores should not be confused with incremental contribution factors that sum up to the total prediction for the molecule.
