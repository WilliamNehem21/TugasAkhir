The interaction between heavy metal ions and ap and aac was investigated using various analytical methods. The study evaluated the impact of factors such as contact time, algal dose, pH, and initial metal ion concentration on the adsorption process. It was determined that the most effective adsorption occurred at pH 5.0, a contact time of 60 minutes, an adsorbent dose of 0.8 g/L, and an initial concentration of 60 mg/L. The maximum removal efficiency for heavy metals, such as paint pigments, batteries, mining operations, and the agriculture sector, was observed at these optimal conditions. 

Due to their toxicity, most heavy metals can lead to various health issues, including kidney damage, brain disorders, and nervous system deterioration. Common symptoms of heavy metal poisoning include insomnia, irritability, anemia, dizziness, and muscle weakness.

In examining the effect of pH, the study maintained the initial metal concentration, algal dosage, and shaking time at 10 mg/L, 0.1 g, and 120 minutes, respectively. The effects of pH were tested at pH values ranging from 2 to 8.

The experiment aimed to investigate the influence of biomass weight on the sorption process. Different weights of biomass (ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 g/L) were mixed and shaken with a solution of 10 mg/L at pH 5 for 120 minutes.

For the study of contact time, fixed weights of ap and aac (0.4g) were introduced to a 10 mg/L heavy metal solution. Contact times were set at 5, 10, 20, 60, and 120 minutes. The solutions were filtered after each contact time and analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer.

The study utilized SEM and nitrogen adsorption to identify the presence of porosity on the KOH-activated carbon more than its precursor powder, as well as TGA to demonstrate thermal instability in the case of U. lactuca compared to KOH-activated carbon. FTIR analysis illustrated the presence of chemical functional groups on both adsorbents. The findings indicated that the optimal conditions for adsorption were at a pH of approximately 5.0, a contact time of 60 minutes, an adsorbent dose of 0.8 g/L, and an initial concentration of 60 mg/L. It was also observed that KOH-activated carbon was more efficient than algal powder in removing heavy metals. Ultimately, the study concluded that KOH-activated carbon based U. lactuca could be an effective technology for the removal of metal ions from contaminated environments.
