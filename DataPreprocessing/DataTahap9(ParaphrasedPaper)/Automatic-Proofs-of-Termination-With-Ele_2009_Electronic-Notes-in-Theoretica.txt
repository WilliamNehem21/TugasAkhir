The paper outlines a method for generating reduction orderings, with a focus on allowing for the specification of monotonicity conditions that must be met by the orderings. This approach offers a more adaptable framework that can be applied to a wider range of scenarios. For example, by imposing such restrictions, it becomes feasible to demonstrate the termination of various types of term rewriting, such as context-sensitive rewriting, infinitary rewriting, innermost rewriting, and outermost rewriting.

A second aspect of the work involves establishing a rule-based transformation system for addressing elementary constraints, regardless of the primary application focus on program termination. This system is designed to handle elementary constraints that arise from diverse problems, and it is discussed in sections 5, 6, and 7 of the paper. The rules presented in the system are based on well-established arithmetic properties related to addition, product, and exponentiation over the real numbers. The paper also provides an example that demonstrates the generation of coefficients for a given term rewriting system, offering parametric interpretations for the function symbols based on the principles outlined in the paper.
