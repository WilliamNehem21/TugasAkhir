In the subsequent sections of this paper, we first present the formal definition of an untyped variation of the calculus (section 2), and subsequently, we illustrate its expressive capabilities with several examples (section 3). Following this, we establish the definition of a typed version of the calculus (section 4), for which we present a soundness result. Illustrative examples of typing are presented in section 5, and in the concluding section, we deliberate on related and prospective research endeavors. 

Here's a rephrased version of the code:

All instances of the checkedmixin will inherit sqrt as the prototype:
```javascript
chk_sqrt = new checkedmixin("sqrt", "check_arg", "checked_sqrt")

chk_sqrt.sqrt(-4) // results in nan
chk_sqrt.checked_sqrt(4) // results in 2
chk_sqrt.checked_sqrt(-4) // throws "illegal argument"
```
