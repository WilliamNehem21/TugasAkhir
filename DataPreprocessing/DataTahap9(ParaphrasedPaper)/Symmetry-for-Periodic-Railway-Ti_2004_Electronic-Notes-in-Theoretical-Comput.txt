In the context of periodic timetabling for railway networks, a line-plan is provided, which contains information on running times of the lines, passenger demand for various connections, infrastructure details, and the period time of the lines (e.g. sixty minutes). Nachtigall is referenced for potential extensions.

In the planning of the German ICE/IC network, focusing on zero hubs can enhance control over interfaces with both international and regional networks. However, this approach has the peculiar consequence of initiating the planning of the German ICE/IC network from Zurich, which is a zero hub within the Swiss railway network.

Nevertheless, such systems may risk becoming highly rigid. For instance, there may be minimal incentive to reduce the current running time of 54 minutes between the two zero hubs Basel and Zurich by just five minutes, as improvements within such a system would need to be of a much larger scale. Consequently, gradual improvements may be impeded, and maintenance work leading to even a minor increase in running time could cause major disruptions to the entire system.

To summarize, the Periodic Event Scheduling Problem (PESP) lends itself to an immediate graph-theoretic interpretation. Some solution approaches proposed for the PESP benefit significantly from this interpretation, particularly in identifying short cycles within the associated digraph of a PESP instance. Therefore, a graph-theoretic interpretation seems to be crucial for periodic timetabling.

Considering a scenario where two gray lines intersect between 9 and 1, and black lines intersect between 1 and 3, along with the specific waiting times at different stations, further computations were conducted on a railway network with eleven pairs of directed lines. The analysis factored in 44 stopping activities with the potential for additional stopping time, focusing on the 55 most crucial connections and penalizing vehicle waiting time. The resulting digraph, after removing redundancies, comprised 56 nodes and 231 arcs. However, due to asymmetric passenger demand, certain connections only appear in one direction, further justifying the introduction of symmetry through additional arcs linking the endpoints of the lines to the artificial event modeling time zero.

On one hand, introducing symmetry accelerates the optimization process. Conversely, the downside for practitioners is that, in the examples examined, the current feasible solution for the symmetric instance is often inferior to the feasible solution for the more general problem. Hence, the speed-up in the complete optimization process may not necessarily lead to the rapid generation of good (symmetric) solutions for the general problem.
