We propose a straightforward global computing framework focused on code migration, with a primary emphasis on membranes that regulate interactions between a site's computing body and its external environment. Sites are structured with two key components: a computing body and a membrane, acting as a filter that controls access to the site and relies on the notion of trust between sites. We develop a basic theory to express and enforce security policies through these membranes. Initially, these policies only control the actions that incoming agents intend to perform locally. We then extend the theory to encompass more sophisticated policies, such as controlling the number and order of actions an agent wants to perform.

The paper presents a progression of the theory from controlling the specific actions an agent can perform within a site, to also regulating the quantity and order of actions, and ultimately to overseeing the overall computation taking place at a site. The paper concludes with a comparison to related work and notes that the theoretical results are proven in the full paper.

The second possibility of controlling the quantity and order of agent actions relies on a trust management framework for systems, which is an active area of current research. For the purpose of this paper, it is assumed that each site contains a record of the level of trust it has in other sites, with trust levels categorized as lbad, loc, and lgood.

It is mentioned that the trust level information is recorded in the membranes, with a defined ordering over trust levels. The paper lays out the relationship between trust levels and actions in coherent systems, emphasizing that trustworthy sites should act in a trustworthy manner and that code running at a trusted site must have satisfied the entry policy.

The full paper discusses the efficient establishment of the enforcement predicate and the decidability of DFA satisfaction. It is also suggested that verifying digests is preferable to inspecting the full code from a computational complexity perspective. The paper presents a notion of well-formed systems and discusses policies that describe the permitted behavior of agents during execution at a site.

Furthermore, an example is presented to illustrate the application of the theory to a specific scenario involving a server distributing licenses for a software product. The paper also addresses related work, positioning the proposed framework as a contribution to the research on distributed systems with code mobility, particularly in the context of access control.

In addition, the paper discusses the concept of membranes as filters and contrasts it with other approaches where membranes are computationally capable objects. This work distinguishes membranes as simple tools for verifying incoming agents rather than as actively evolving and communicating components within a node.
