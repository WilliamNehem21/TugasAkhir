The use of hypertextbooks in computer science curriculum offers a promising approach to enhancing learning experiences and incorporating algorithm animations into educational materials. In this study, we have developed a prototype to integrate functionalities of hypertextbooks into the established Moodle learning management system (LMS). This paper outlines the objectives and implementation of this module, along with a demonstration.

Our initial prototype, Vizcosh, is built within the well-known Moodle LMS. The paper details the development goals in Section 2, the strategies employed to achieve these goals in Section 3, and provides a brief showcase of the resulting content pages in Moodle in Section 4. Section 5 offers a concise evaluation of the module and concludes the paper.

It is important to note certain limitations of the module, such as the lack of support for sub-chapters or deeper levels of structure, and the absence of interactivity which prevents integration of forums, chats, etc. However, external links to these elements can be incorporated into the content pages.

The ability to print the current chapter along with the thumbnails is a valuable feature, achieved by rendering the page content as a web page in a new browser window without navigation elements. However, dynamic visualization elements are represented as static images when the content is printed on paper.

We are open to collaboration with researchers and educators interested in utilizing the module, particularly for incorporating other algorithm animation or visualization systems that use Java WebStart. Additionally, while the module is designed for Moodle, it can be adapted for use with other learning content management systems or content management systems, such as Drupal, Plone, or TYPO3. The main Moodle-specific aspect lies in the connection to user management and the database, which would need to be customized for each platform.
