Allocation is unrestricted as long as the channel is not already allocated. Initially, allocated channels are private. Making a channel public allows communication, but only if it is already public, and communication is only allowed over an allocated channel. A channel received from the environment and unknown locally becomes public, while a locally-known channel received from the environment cannot have been private.
