Section 3 establishes the formal underpinnings by defining and proving the accuracy of the reflective construction. Section 4 outlines the reflective design of an LTLR model checker based on these foundations. Section 5 demonstrates the application of the model checker using a specific example. Lastly, Section 6 explores related research and presents conclusions.

Section 6 provides an introduction to basic notation on term rewriting, including the representation of positions in a term as strings of nonzero natural numbers and their interpretation as tree positions. It introduces notions of subterm and replacement in the context of term rewriting, and offers an illustrative example. Additionally, the paper highlights the syntactic and semantic relationships between LTLR and other logics, including their containment and generality. It presents observations on how Kripke structures and labeled transition systems can be viewed as special instances of rewrite theories.
