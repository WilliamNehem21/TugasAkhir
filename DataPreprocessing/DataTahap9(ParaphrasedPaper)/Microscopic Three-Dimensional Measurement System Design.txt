The micro stereo vision system is commonly employed in microscopic research for its precise 3D measurement and positioning through visual feedback. The accurate measurement data enables advanced observation and analysis in scientific research and industrial applications. This study accurately reconstructed three-dimensional object information in microscopic viewing by integrating phase shift technology with optical microscopy techniques. The focus of this paper was on the phase shift technology, for which a system prototype was developed and tested in various fields to verify its accuracy, feasibility, and stability.
