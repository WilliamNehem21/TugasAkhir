The utilization of traffic light control systems (TLCS) is widespread in our everyday lives, making it crucial to ensure their accuracy. This paper focuses on employing bounded model checking (BMC) to validate a straightforward yet practical TLCS. It utilizes propositional projection temporal logic (PPTL) as the property specification language and briefly outlines the process of BMC for PPTL. The paper also presents a description of a TLCS and its corresponding Kripke structure. Subsequently, it verifies two related properties specified by PPTL formulas for the system using the BMC approach. The verification outcome obtained using the bounded model checker, BMC4PPTL, demonstrates that the behavior of the TLCS aligns with the specified requirements.

Recent years have seen a surge in research on techniques for the automatic formal verification of finite state transition systems. The prevailing approach, model checking, has gained widespread adoption for the verification of hardware, software, and communication protocols due to its reliability and automatic verification capability. Model checking involves modeling the system to be verified as a finite state machine and formalizing the specification using temporal logic formulas, with linear-time temporal logic (LTL) and branching-time temporal logic (CTL) being commonly used in practice.

Although LTL and CTL, along with their variations, are the primary temporal logics used in model checking and bounded model checking, their expressiveness is limited for some practical properties. Specifically, LTL and CTL cannot adequately capture certain properties related to time duration and periodic repetition. Propositional projection temporal logic (PPTL) addresses these limitations by enabling the specification and verification of concurrent systems with its full regular expressiveness.

The paper details the use of PPTL as the specification language and introduces the process of BMC for PPTL. It then describes a practical TLCS and provides its corresponding Kripke structure in section 3. The subsequent section verifies two related properties using the BMC approach, with the verification results using BMC4PPTL showcased. The conclusion is presented in section 5.

Additionally, the paper showcases a property illustrating the expressive limitations of LTL, which cannot adequately describe the occurrence of every other state where the green light is on in the east-west direction and the red light is on in the south-north direction. This demonstrates a typical example highlighting the limited expressive power of LTL, which can be effectively addressed using a PPTL formula.
