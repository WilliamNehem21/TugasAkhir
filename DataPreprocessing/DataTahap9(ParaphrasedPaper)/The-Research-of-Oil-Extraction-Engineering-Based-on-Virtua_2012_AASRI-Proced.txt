The paper proposes a hierarchical structure model for organizing and managing complex models in 3dsmax. This model facilitates model tree segmentation, separate modeling, and model integration, leading to improved model utilization and reduced duplication of work. The use of example technology, texture mapping, and level of detail (LOD) technology in model optimization is discussed. By storing only one instance of the same tool in memory and using LOD technology to dynamically select relevant details, the project aims to minimize resource wastage and achieve real-time model simplification without compromising visual results. Additionally, the paper explores the application of technologies such as fracturing, water stopping, acidification, and cutting in enhancing production through simulating the behavior of liquids. The use of virtual reality technology in the wellbore information dynamic processing and display system is also discussed, highlighting its role in providing inquiry and analysis tools for engineering design personnel, guiding construction work, and facilitating real-time data analysis and decision-making.
