The paper begins by discussing security personnel selection and training, security awareness, and operational management processes, which consist of 25 processes such as inventory management, environment patching, security measures, change control, access control, information quality, compliance probing, and forensics.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of existing security maturity models and related work. Section 3 introduces the proposed security maturity model. Section 4 applies the proposed security maturity levels to two case studies: the retirement department and the public telecommunication corporation in Yemen. Section 5 discusses gaps in existing models and frameworks in comparison to the proposed model, and Section 6 concludes the paper with an outlook for future work.

Choiss distinguishes between various organizations, indicating that to achieve a high maturity level, an organization must address a tailored set of focus areas and capabilities. Another study focused solely on data security associated with confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) while overlooking the digital security process of assessing risks and vulnerabilities for each level of capability in the maturity model (CMM).

A study assessing information security maturity for Malaysian public sectors compared the system security engineering-capability maturity model (SSE-CMM), Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT), and the Information Security Management Maturity Model (ISM3), clarifying the relationships between these models and identifying and testing their technical factors.

The authors of the COBIT 2019 framework explained capability levels for processes based on schemes ranging from 0 to 5, which are a measure of how well a process is implemented and performing, with a focus on classifying organizations into five levels based on processes.

Another study evaluated master data to derive concepts and best practices, creating a master data maturity assessment using a maturity matrix relating to 13 areas and specifying and validating 65 capabilities. The study developed an assessment questionnaire to assess master data management maturity, emphasizing master data but neglecting security maturity across the entire organization.

ISM3 specifies organizational levels based on the controls applied through daily operations, ranging from a lack of controls to fully automated controls, and reflects the level of security maturity in the organization, from non-existent to optimized. Cybersecurity auditors must learn how to classify organizations based on the security maturity model to complete the auditing process.

The study involves evaluating and assessing security maturity levels in two types of organizations based on four categories: general, operational, tactical, and strategic security maturity. Additionally, it discusses the findings.

The retirement organization in Yemen is a public service organization serving over 100 thousand people with main departments including information technology, finance, control and audit, and pension administration. The study evaluated the security level to address security gaps based on the security maturity model's controls, noting a limited number of processes performing daily operations.

The Public Telecommunication Corporation (PTC) in Yemen is a government service provider for internet and telecommunication, with 21 branches and over 50 centers serving millions of customers. The study found that PTC is at a defined level of maturity and is beginning to automate its processes, applying the ISO 27001 standard in the payment card industry for its security controls.

In conclusion, the retirement organization operates at an ad hoc level with no regular controls, while PTC operates at a defined level of maturity with good security controls, applying ISO 27001 standard and automating its processes.
