This paper introduces a new approach, known as the Gaussian Mixture Approximation (GMA) smoother, for estimating the state of a nonlinear system. The implementation of the smoother involves the computation of Gaussian weighted integrals, leading to the development of the GMA-URTSS algorithm through the application of unscented transformation (UT). Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

Drawing inspiration from the higher accuracy of GMA compared to GA, we introduce the GMA smoother for tracking the ballistic reentry problem. The paper is structured as follows: Section II formulates the problem and reviews the standard GA filter and smoother, while Section III derives the GMA smoother based on the standard GA estimators. Section IV presents simulation results for the reentry tracking problem, and Section V offers concluding remarks.

It is worth noting that the GA smoother begins with the initial density P_{GA} (x_n|y_n), and similarly, the GMA smoother is based on the GA smoother, with its initialization as described in equation (7).

Taking into consideration the superior accuracy of GMA compared to GA, we propose a general GMA smoother based on the standard GA filter and smoother to estimate the nonlinear state during the tracking of a ballistic reentry target. Furthermore, we develop the GMA-URTSS algorithm using UT for numerically computing the Gaussian weighted integrals in the GMA smoother. Simulation results indicate that the proposed GMA-URTSS algorithm outperforms the corresponding GA-URTSS algorithm in terms of estimation accuracy.
