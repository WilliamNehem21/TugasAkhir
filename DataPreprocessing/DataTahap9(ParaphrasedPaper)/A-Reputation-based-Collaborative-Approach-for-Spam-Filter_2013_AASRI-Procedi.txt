The academic paper discusses two primary categories of anti-spam techniques: those based on expert knowledge (EK) and those based on machine learning (ML). EK-based methods, such as rule-based filtering using whitelists, blacklists, challenge-response, and enhanced protocol, have seen multiple implementations, including sender policy framework (SPF), sender-ID, and domain keys identified mail (DKIM). ML-based anti-spam techniques involve probability-based filtering, linear classifiers, the Rocchio method, nearest neighbor method, logic-based methods, and data compression models.

The concepts of fingerprint and fingerprint recognition originally stem from the field of biometric identity authentication. While traditionally used in biometrics, these concepts are now being applied to information retrieval. In this context, a fingerprint refers to a concise identifier for a large body of data. Fingerprinting techniques offer the advantage of being able to detect identical or nearly identical duplicate documents with slight variations by comparing and matching their hash values.
