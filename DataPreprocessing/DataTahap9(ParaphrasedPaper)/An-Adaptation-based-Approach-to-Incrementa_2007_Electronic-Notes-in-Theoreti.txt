The use of software components in system development has become widespread, but incompatibilities between their behavioral interfaces can hinder their integration. To address this issue, the focus of software adaptation is to automatically create corrective connectors or components to compensate for these incompatibilities. Constructing component-based systems from scratch is challenging, particularly when components need to be adjusted to work with each other. Therefore, incremental construction methods are crucial for managing the complexity of adaptation. In this paper, we propose an incremental approach for building component-based systems, which involves automatically generating adaptors to overcome behavioral incompatibilities. This adaptation process can be automated by providing an abstract mapping that formalizes the properties of the system to be adapted.

The paper goes on to discuss the formal model of components and the architectural style used, as well as the mechanisms for checking if adaptation is needed, computing adaptors, and assessing them. It also presents an approach for incrementally constructing component-based systems, outlining how the system is updated automatically when a component is added or removed. The paper further illustrates the incremental approach through several case studies and concludes with a discussion of the findings.

The paper also discusses behavioral mismatch in the context of software adaptation and software architecture analysis, emphasizing the importance of deadlock-freedom as a commonly accepted definition of behavioral mismatch. It explains how the absence of deadlocks can be checked using a specific tool and outlines the process of generating adaptors to address behavioral mismatch. Additionally, the paper describes methods for assessing the new system and ensuring that it still provides all the expected services after adaptation.

Furthermore, the paper addresses scenarios where the addition of a component may or may not require protocol adaptation, and discusses the management of mappings during the system-building process. It also includes detailed case studies, such as the dining philosophers problem, to demonstrate the application of the proposed approach.

Overall, the paper proposes an approach for incrementally building component-based systems and automating the adaptation process to address behavioral incompatibilities, providing various techniques and case studies to illustrate the proposed methods.
