By proposing alternative movement capabilities, the paper introduces various variants of the ambient calculus, such as mobile safe ambients (SA), robust ambients (ROAM), safe ambients with passwords (SAP), the push and pull ambient calculus (PAC), controlled ambients (CA), and the version of boxed ambients with passwords (NBA). The term "ambient calculus" (AC) is used to refer to all of these variants.

One major open question from previous work is whether a pure form of AC without the capability to dissolve ambients can be Turing complete. This question is particularly interesting given the decision by Bugliesi, Castagna, and Crafa to forgo ambient opening when proposing their calculus of boxed ambients. They advocate for communication between ambients where one is contained in the other, as opposed to the same-ambient communication of mobile ambients. The paper also provides an encoding of counter machines into pure mobile ambients without restriction or the open capability, showing that this fragment is Turing complete. It also demonstrates that both termination and the observation of weak barbs are undecidable problems in this context.

The authors are interested in finding the minimal Turing complete fragments of AC. They discuss various Turing complete languages with and without the open capability, and show that certain fragments of capabilities have decidability properties for non-terminating computations.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses various operators and capabilities of the ambient calculus, along with their associated reduction notions. Section 3 focuses on various Turing complete languages, with and without the open capability. Section 4 discusses specific fragments of capabilities and their decidability properties.

The authors establish that pure mobile ambients can encode Turing machines, and further show that counter machines can be encoded in pure mobile ambients without movement capabilities but with restriction. The paper also discusses the encoding of instruction processes and registers, and explores the computational strength of languages based on the application of replication to capabilities or ambients.

Overall, the paper investigates the computational strength and decidability properties of various fragments of the ambient calculus, aiming to pinpoint minimal Turing complete languages while considering different capabilities and restrictions.
