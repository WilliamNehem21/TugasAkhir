In an alloy model, facts must hold true. Understanding the meaning of a program is straightforward once the definition of "t" is known, and the query logic "l" for alloy comprises sentences in first-order logic with transitive closure types. The satisfaction relation |= interprets queries over models. For instance, a scenario might inquire about the possibility of generating an implementation of "p" where the first object has at least one method and its type encompasses all other classes as subtypes, while a second object is of a different type. The scenario's analysis involves implicit existential quantification of its parameters, and the invocation ^subtype specifies the transitive closure of subtype.

We establish representation theorems for finite distributive AC semi-lattices and De Morgan lattices, with a focus on finite distributive structures due to their significance in applications such as multiple-valued and viewpoint-based reasoning. These theorems are concerned with the non-distributive case, which is detailed in section 5. The computational implications of these findings enable efficient implementations of the algebraic operations of such orders using their prime elements. Additionally, these results identify De Morgan lattices as AC lattices with an internal symmetry. Readers interested in model-checking issues may proceed directly to section 6 on page 14.
