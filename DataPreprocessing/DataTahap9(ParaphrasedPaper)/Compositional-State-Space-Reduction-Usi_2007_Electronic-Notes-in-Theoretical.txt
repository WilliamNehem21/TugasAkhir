In simpler terms, the paper discusses the concept of untangled actions in discrete event systems and their application in reducing the state space of complex systems, such as tree arbiters in asynchronous circuits. The authors propose that untangled actions, which do not conflict with other actions and only contribute to system dynamics through causality, can be used to simplify the exploration of state spaces. They introduce a compositional technique for analyzing untangledness at a local level, which can then be applied to reduce the state space of global systems.

The paper provides a detailed explanation of untangled actions, their properties, and their significance in state space reduction algorithms. It also presents experimental results and outlines a reduction procedure called chase+ that exploits untangledness to reduce state spaces efficiently. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach using FDR2, showing significant improvements in checking time and memory usage for verifying tree arbiters.

Furthermore, the paper addresses issues related to divergence and compositionality, proposing solutions to handle these challenges while maintaining the visibility of certain types of actions. Finally, the authors show how their reduction procedure can be integrated into refinement or model checking processes, offering a simpler and more efficient implementation for reducing state spaces and avoiding state explosion.
