This scholarly article delves into an exploration of the computational implications of a particular theorem, namely the Riesz representation theorem for locally compact Hausdorff spaces. The study employs the representation approach (tte), which has proven to be especially intuitive and adaptable among the different methodologies for investigating computability in analysis and its associated domains [6,4,3,15].
