Additionally, the design of the energy collector is crucial in capturing and transmitting the energy utilized by wireless sensor nodes (citations 7 and 8). Various design structures, including metamaterial absorbers, antenna arrays, and rectennas, have been suggested (citations 9 and 10). Metamaterials are materials whose electromagnetic properties are determined by their structure rather than their chemical composition.

Moreover, the proposed design dimensions and the back-side coated copper are 15 mm x 15 mm and 0.0009, respectively. The design includes five split ring resonators (SRRs) positioned at a 45-degree angle to each other in order to enhance performance. This orientation has the potential to improve the coupling mechanisms between neighboring resonators. The diagonal arrangement enables effective interaction between the electric and magnetic field components, which could lead to a more robust interconnection among adjacent SRRs, resulting in superior resonance characteristics and increased electromagnetic reactivity. These resonators are made of annealed copper with a thickness of 0.035 and conductivity of 2.2.
