With the advancement of computer science, there is an increasing emphasis on exploring the mathematical underpinnings, a shared interest among mathematicians and computer scientists. Domain theory (DT), formal concept analysis (FCA), and rough set theory (RST) represent significant interdisciplinary areas that rely on relations (orders) and have connections to topology, algebra, logic, and other fields, furnishing mathematical frameworks for computer science and information science.

Domain theory, introduced by Scott for the denotational semantics of programming languages, revolves around the concepts of partial information and successive approximation. It addresses various posets, approximate orders, and operational models of computing, offering a mathematical foundation for programming language design, definition, and implementation.

Formal concept analysis, an order-theoretic approach to the mathematical analysis of scientific data, was proposed by Wille and others in 1982. Concept lattices form the crux of this theory, defining a partially ordered set consisting of formal concepts, each representing a subset of objects (called extent) and a subset of attributes (called intent). Over the years, FCA has evolved into a potent tool for clustering, data analysis, information retrieval, and knowledge discovery.

Rough set theory, initiated by Pawlak, provides a new mathematical tool for handling imprecise, uncertain, or vague knowledge. Its fundamental concepts include approximation spaces and approximation operators, enabling the expression of hidden knowledge in decision rules through lower and upper approximations. RST has garnered widespread attention from researchers and practitioners and has found practical applications in medicine, information analysis, data mining, and industrial control.

The paper by Yao discusses the relationships between various types of concept lattices and their isomorphism. It highlights that rough set theory and formal concept analysis each capture distinct aspects of data, and their combination yields the rough concept lattice of a given context. The study delves into the properties of rough concept lattices from the perspective of domain theory, particularly investigating their algebraicity and complete distributivity. Furthermore, it introduces the concept of definable sets for a context and explores their algebraic properties, establishing new connections among FCA, RST, and domain theory, thereby enhancing our understanding of these theories and providing avenues for future research.
