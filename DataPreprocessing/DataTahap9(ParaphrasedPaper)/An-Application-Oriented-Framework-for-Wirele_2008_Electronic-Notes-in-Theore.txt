Although the specific characteristics of wireless sensor networks can vary significantly, it is generally acknowledged that they typically consist of small, low-cost, battery-powered sensing devices equipped with wireless transmitters. These devices can be distributed across a space to form an ad hoc network. However, due to limitations in energy, computational power, and memory, the sensors have constraints in communication capabilities. Wireless sensor networks have been proposed for a wide range of applications, including disaster relief operations, seismic data collection, wildlife monitoring, and military intelligence gathering. The sensors are deployed in the application environment to establish a network for data exchange and forwarding.

Since sensor networks typically lack infrastructure and the sensors have limited computational ability, key predistribution is the predominant method for key establishment, with keying material stored in sensor memory before deployment. A comprehensive survey of key establishment schemes based on key predistribution is provided extending to March 2005. The focus of the survey is on the mathematical construction techniques employed, rather than on the properties of the networks for which the schemes are designed.

The framework of this study is primarily designed to encompass key establishment schemes based on key predistribution, assuming that sensors have keying material stored in their memories before deployment by a trusted authority, but no further access to this authority after deployment. The study specifically excludes schemes reliant on a base station that can always communicate securely with the sensors, as well as schemes dependent on public-key techniques.

The study also confines itself to schemes based on the global passive adversary model, which allows compromising any node, extracting keys or other secret data from its memory, and intercepting wireless communication within the network.

The communication structure in a sensor network involves subsets of sensors of size t. The most common communication structure within this class is pairwise complete (2-complete). Such a communication structure is particularly suitable for networks with no control over deployment location.

After identifying the appropriate set of categories for a particular sensor network application, specific parameters define instances of key establishment solutions. These parameters tend to be closely related and include range, which determines the communication range over which a sensor can contact other sensors, and key, which impacts the scalability and connectivity of the scheme.

In terms of specific schemes, various approaches have been described in the literature, including closest-pairwise schemes, regionally 2-complete schemes, and hierarchical schemes. These different schemes adapt to the varying capabilities and constraints of the sensor network.

The paper also highlights the challenges in designing key establishment schemes for heterogeneous sensor networks and emphasizes the importance of considering the wide range of applications and networking environments that fall under the umbrella term of wireless sensor networks.
