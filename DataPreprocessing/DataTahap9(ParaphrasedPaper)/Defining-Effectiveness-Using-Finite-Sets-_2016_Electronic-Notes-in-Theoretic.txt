Although effectiveness reached its peak in the 20th century, it has long been established in various domains of human knowledge since ancient times. Many of our daily routines are influenced by cultural heritage, while others are universally pervasive across different cultures, suggesting that they are natural aspects of human life. For instance, arithmetic is a universal aspect present in all known civilizations and has historically constituted a significant part of our cognitive activities, involving the learning and development of algorithms for basic operations with natural numbers and other number systems.

Classical problems such as squaring the circle or trisecting an angle using a finite number of straightedge and compass operations can be viewed as attempts to solve problems through specialized algorithms. However, it has been demonstrated that these particular problems are impossible to solve using the tools of mathematics, a conclusion that is unique to the field. Subsequent investigations have revealed that constructions with straightedge and compass, combined with the standard algorithms for the four basic arithmetic operations, are insufficient representations of effectiveness in such problems.

Effectiveness can be regarded as a relationship between inputs and outputs. Over the past century, significant progress has been made in characterizing which functions from a set of inputs a to a set of outputs b are considered effective. A few decades after this effort began, partial functions, as opposed to total ones, were incorporated into the domain of effective functions. Additionally, there has been a recent realization that the set of natural numbers, when presented as a numeral system, should be treated as the universe for the aforementioned subsets a and b.

This article adopts a model-theoretical approach to defining effectiveness, offering an alternative presentation of effective functions using category theory. Our proposal differs from the effective topos and from the work presented in a series of articles by Prof. Robert Walters. In the following section, we delve into the main motivations behind our alternative approach to the study of effectiveness.
