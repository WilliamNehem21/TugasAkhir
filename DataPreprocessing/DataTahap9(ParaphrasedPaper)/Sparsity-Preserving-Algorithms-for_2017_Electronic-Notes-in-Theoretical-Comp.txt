The existing algorithms for manipulating octagons do not maintain their sparsity, resulting in typically quadratic or cubic time and space complexities even when all variables are bounded. In this paper, we introduce new algorithms that use and produce octagons represented as weakly closed difference bound matrices, preserving the sparsity of the input while performing better when the input is sparse. We demonstrate that these algorithms are as precise as the known algorithms.

Prior work, such as the implementation of the octagon abstract domain by Singh et al., has focused on optimizing representations for sparse cases. However, these approaches do not address the issue of denseness when interval bounds are known for many variables, leading to low sparsity. In contrast, our proposed algorithms operate on a sparse representation for octagons, allowing the cost of analyzing independent sets of variables to be the sum of the costs of analyzing each set separately. This approach maintains precision while addressing the sparsity issue in the representation.

Our main idea involves using weakly closed difference bound matrices, which do not necessarily result in dense representations, thus enabling the use of sparse data structures. We demonstrate that certain algorithms can be retained to work on weakly closed difference bound matrices without sacrificing precision, and we propose new algorithms for other operations. This approach offers benefits by simplifying constraints and enabling the study of octagon abstract domains in irregular environments.

We also introduce weaker closedness conditions over difference bound matrices, which allow for improved algorithms without sacrificing precision. By maintaining weakly closed difference bound matrices, we can avoid introducing spurious finite values and breaking the sparsity of the operands. Additionally, we provide a join operation for weakly closed difference bound matrices, ensuring that relational information is preserved without compromising sparsity.

Our presented algorithms for the octagon abstract domain maintain sparsity in the representation of octagons and are as precise as traditional approaches. These algorithms can be applied in both rational or real environments and in the context of integer environments.
