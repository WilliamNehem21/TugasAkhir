The cloud platform should offer an adaptable and user-friendly communication platform for both medical professionals and patients. The system features an instant messenger based on XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) within a cloud server. XMPP, as an open standard and protocol, can help reduce development time and costs. Additionally, due to the distributed nature of the XMPP network and the absence of a central master server, the medical system can easily and flexibly incorporate new functionalities on top of XMPP. Furthermore, XMPP servers can be isolated to manage the registration of doctors and patients, which is crucial for ensuring system privileges and verifying the qualifications of doctors.
