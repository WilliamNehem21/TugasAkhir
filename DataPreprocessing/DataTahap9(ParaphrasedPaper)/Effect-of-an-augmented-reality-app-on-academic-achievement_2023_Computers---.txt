The utilization of augmented reality (AR) in education can be particularly advantageous when learning abstract and intangible concepts as it allows students to visualize and interact with the material to enhance learning (Chen, Chi, Hung, & Kang, 2011; Chiu, Dejaegher, & Chao, 2015). Additionally, research indicates that learning such concepts through AR is more effective than using printed materials or desktop software (cf. Radu, 2014).

Numerous studies have revealed that students encounter difficulties in comprehending abstract concepts in subjects such as chemistry. This may be attributed to traditional materials representing chemical concepts in two dimensions, while understanding these concepts necessitates the 3D visualization of molecular structures (Maier & Klinker, 2013). The incorporation of AR technology in chemistry education has demonstrated potential in enhancing students' understanding of spatial molecular structures (Maier, 2013).

Although fixed technology, which pertains to AR technology displayed on computer screens, has certain drawbacks such as lack of portability, it presents an economically feasible alternative. Additionally, it can serve as an ideal introduction to AR learning opportunities in the classroom using existing computer monitors.

For instance, Xiao, Xu, Yu, Cai, and Hansen (2016) introduced the Starry Sky Exploration AR system for teaching astronomy to primary school students. This system includes an observation module where students utilize mobile devices to scan AR identification cards to view distinguishing characteristics of planets and visualize 3D planets using the device's camera. A pilot test demonstrated increased student engagement, and subsequent interviews revealed high student satisfaction.

Singhal et al. (2012) developed an AR system to enhance students' understanding of 3D chemistry modeling and spatial arrangement of molecular structures, reporting positive student responses based on observations during exhibitions.

Furthermore, an investigation by Cai, Wang, and Chiang (2014) examined the impact of an AR tool on high school students' chemistry learning, demonstrating improved quiz scores following the use of the AR tool, along with positive student attitudes toward its utility.

A mobile application was developed to facilitate the acquisition of fundamental biochemistry concepts among university students. The study mode of the app focused on glycolysis, yielding satisfactory test performance among students.

Wojciechowski and Cellary (2013) conducted a study involving secondary school students, finding that student perceptions of usefulness and enjoyment significantly influenced their attitudes toward using AR in chemistry experiments. Similarly, Crandall et al. (2015) reported favorable feedback from students and faculty members following the use of an AR-based game in a chemistry course.

The successful integration of AR technology in education hinges on the acceptance and intention to use the technology by students and educators. Resistance to change from teachers and staff may present a challenge in implementing AR in educational settings (Kerawalla, Luckin, Seljeflot, & Woolard, 2006).

The study developed multiple-choice test items for assessing understanding of carbon bonds and employed a quasi-experimental design with experimental and control groups. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was utilized to evaluate students' perceived usefulness and ease of use of the AR app through a standardized questionnaire.

Furthermore, the process of creating 3D chemical bond models in Blender and subsequently integrating them into an AR scenario using QR codes and Unity was outlined. The study received permissions from relevant authorities and involved the collaboration of chemistry teachers in implementing the intervention.

Regarding the acceptance of the AR app, university students exhibited above-average scores on the TAM questionnaire, suggesting a positive attitude toward its perceived usefulness and ease of use. It was emphasized that the perceived usefulness and ease of use are key predictors of technology adoption and usage.

The pedagogical implications of integrating AR in educational settings were discussed, highlighting its potential impact on physical, cognitive, and contextual dimensions of the learning process. It was acknowledged that the study possesses certain limitations, including the non-random assignment of participants to the experimental and control groups and the limited scope of the intervention.

In summary, the findings underscore the potential of AR technology to enhance understanding and engagement in educational contexts, and emphasize the importance of addressing acceptance and usability to facilitate its effective implementation.
