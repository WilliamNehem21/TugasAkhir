In the realm of competition for academic positions and grants, mathematical disciplines must provide justifications for their existence. Often, the impact of their applications is emphasized as the key criterion from an external perspective. As a result, the titles of academic journals and conferences tend to mirror this emphasis.

Domain theory, when compared to well-established fields such as number theory, differs significantly in terms of historical tradition, its ability to explain concepts to non-mathematicians, and the diversity of methods employed. In contrast, domain theory shares similarities with general topology, as it offers a conceptual framework for fundamental mathematical concepts like space, convergence, nearness, connectedness, and compactness, without being developed to solve specific problems. While every mathematical theory generates its own internal questions, general topology is largely viewed as a backdrop theory, with its recent internal advancements often of little consequence to the external world.

At its inception, domain theory was driven by specific problems awaiting resolution. It provides a framework for phenomena found across various disciplines, combining elements of order and topology, and cannot be wholly justified by its internal issues. Therefore, for domain theory to remain a vibrant area of research, it needs to engage with other domains within and outside of mathematics.

The development of domain theory stemmed from diverse reasons and origins, with five distinct roots, although not all are equally impactful. While these roots are discussed in a particular sequence, they should be viewed as interconnected.

In the 1960s and 1970s, universal algebra was rapidly evolving, leading to the development of a category-theoretical version known as a monad, with notable examples such as the monad of ultrafilters over sets, whose algebras correspond to compact Hausdorff spaces. This naturally led to the consideration of monads of all filters.

Undoubtedly, the work of Scott and its influence on denotational semantics marked a decisive moment in the development of domain theory, driving its rapid expansion from continuous lattices to continuous directed complete posets. Its simultaneous appearances in various fields spurred a swift advancement in the mathematical theory. The optimal encoding of the notion of approximation by relatively finite approximands through the way-below relation and the concept of a continuous domain played a central role in this wide-ranging impact.

In 1998, Th. Mormann published a philosophical paper utilizing basic concepts of domain theory to provide a solution to a problem in the Whiteheadian theory of regions. This solution involved the construction of a topological space from a purely mereological system of regions, with the argument relying on the theories of continuous lattices and pointless topology.

Domain theory appears to be profitably applicable in set-valued analysis as it provides a suitable conceptual framework for formulating problems conveniently, rather than serving as a tool for solving specific problems. Furthermore, it holds promise in the area of idempotent analysis, with a substantial body of literature available as useful sources of information.

In domain theory, the preservation of the way-below relation has primarily been considered in connection with adjoints. This property closely resembles the statement that a function is an open map, where the upper set generated by the image of a Scott-open set is also Scott-open. The category of abstract Cuntz semigroups, along with the related morphisms, is denoted by Cusgr.
