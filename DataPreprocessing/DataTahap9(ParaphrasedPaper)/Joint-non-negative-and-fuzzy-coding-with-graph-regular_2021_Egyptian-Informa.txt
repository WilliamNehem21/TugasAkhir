The paper introduces a novel model called joint non-negative and fuzzy coding with graph regularization (G-JNFC), which leverages non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to perform fuzzy clustering. This model aims to integrate feature learning and recognition stages by jointly determining both the non-negative coefficient representation and fuzzy membership degrees for each data point. The authors propose an optimization method for G-JNFC under the alternating direction optimization framework and conduct experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets to validate its effectiveness.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 1 provides an introduction to G-JNFC, Section 2 discusses related works on NMF and local coordinate coding, Section 3 presents the G-JNFC model formulation, optimization, and analysis, Section 4 details the experimental evaluations, and Section 5 concludes the paper.

Furthermore, the paper demonstrates the convergence of the optimization method for G-JNFC and provides explanations for representative data points in different clustering scenarios. The paper concludes by highlighting the advantages of G-JNFC over existing matrix factorization based clustering methods and presenting extensive experimental evidence to support its effectiveness.
