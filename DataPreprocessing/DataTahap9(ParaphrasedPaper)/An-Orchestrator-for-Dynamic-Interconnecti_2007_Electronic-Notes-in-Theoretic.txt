The paper uses standard mathematical notation commonly found in model-oriented specification methods such as VDM, Z, or B. However, the paper adopts a point-free specification style, which results in more concise descriptions and enhanced computational capability. The mathematical framework used is based on the category of sets and set-theoretic functions that involve composition and.

A key aspect of our approach is the inclusion of a specific coordination connector known as the orchestrator. This orchestrator plays a crucial role in managing the interactions among all other elements within the architectural network. Essentially, the orchestrator serves as an intermediary layer between components and ordinary connectors, acting as a bridge between the two.
