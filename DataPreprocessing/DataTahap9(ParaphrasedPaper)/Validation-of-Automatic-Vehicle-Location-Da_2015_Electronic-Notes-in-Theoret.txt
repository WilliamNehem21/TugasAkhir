Contemporary engineered systems possess self-awareness. They utilize instrumentation and sensors to gather data on their operation and performance, which is then analyzed to ensure their safe and efficient functioning. For example, modern transportation systems utilize data collected by highly-instrumented vehicles, which is transmitted to a central tracking system to provide real-time information to passengers.

Recent advancements in adaptive systems indicate a future where systems are self-organizing and self-healing, guided by their data-gathering subsystems. However, these data-gathering subsystems are complex in themselves, with inherent engineering limitations and potential faults. This complexity becomes apparent when working with these subsystems, particularly when regulators calculate service performance based on the data collected.

Previously, assessing service performance relied on human observers stationed on the roadside, using their judgment and experience to record vehicle departures and interpret events. This ensured that data was thoroughly examined before performance measures were computed. In contrast, when human intelligence is not applied, such as in automated processing of historical automatic vehicle location (AVL) data, errors in interpretation can occur.

AVL data records the position of each bus in a fleet using geographic measurements, and the uncertainty surrounding bus assignments to routes introduces challenges in interpreting the data for metric computation.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: we discuss the visualization of AVL data, the identification and correction of data errors, visualization of headway data, the use of headway measurements in service level agreements, related work using similar data or tools, and finally, conclude the paper.

The visualization tool is limited to rendering measurement data and lacks predictive or logical capabilities. Yet, it proved valuable in identifying significant data errors, which were then systematically removed through a data cleaning process.

Different data perspectives provided varied insights, but identifying collective behavior remained challenging. In scenarios where events depend on aggregate measures obtained from numerous observations, representing individual traces becomes less crucial. More profound insights arise from aggregating individual behaviors to identify trends and patterns.

The limited observations of buses in a specific region and the manual removal of erroneous data points through a visualization tool prepared the dataset for the analysis of performance measures, particularly headway.

For a well-functioning service, ideal spatiotemporal separation between buses is expected over time, but this metric is not among those defined by regulators in this case.

The simulation algorithm, runz, forwards events in time and is guided by an event list, with cases determined by the timing of departure events and the forgetting of past departures.

Our experience from working with data on the Quanticol project suggests that human intelligence is essential for data cleaning before automated processing, as an outlier only becomes apparent when compared to the other data points.
