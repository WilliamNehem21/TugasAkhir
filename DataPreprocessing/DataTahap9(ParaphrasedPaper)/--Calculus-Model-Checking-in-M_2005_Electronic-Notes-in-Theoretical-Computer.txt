The authors proposed the use of maude as a verification platform for model checking, citing its basis in rewriting logic as a reason for its potential efficacy. Rewriting logic has been utilized as a unified formalism for modeling concurrency and as a logical framework, making it possible for researchers from different fields to work within a single formalism. The challenge of performing model verification in rewriting logic has been addressed to some extent, with the verification of an active network protocol at the object level using a meta-level theory to explore all possible behaviors of the model and check it against a property. However, the results were unsatisfactory as only invariant checking was discussed within the proposed framework. The paper also included some notation for a Kripke structure and specified properties for model checking in this context. The work underscored the expressive power of rewriting logic and demonstrated maude's efficacy as a framework for model and property specification, as well as model checking. However, the authors acknowledged that there are still many issues to be addressed for maude to be competitive with other formal verification tools.
