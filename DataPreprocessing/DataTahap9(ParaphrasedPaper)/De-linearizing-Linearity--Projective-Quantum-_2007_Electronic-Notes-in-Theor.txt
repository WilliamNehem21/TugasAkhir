The paper explores the properties of additive types that distribute over the tensor, leading to the development of measurements and the validation of protocols in a modified context. A comprehensive probabilistic calculus is achieved when the trace is linear and satisfies the diagonal axiom, ultimately leading to a significant finding: a characterization of the essential additive structure required for a robust categorical quantum formalism without redundant global phases. The study also demonstrates that when an additive monoidal tensor distributes over a strongly compact closed tensor in a category, that category is always enriched in commutative monoids.

Furthermore, the paper suggests that the ortho-structure only needs to ensure the coherent coexistence of pseudo-projections with the sccc structure. For the remaining qualitative uses of the biproduct structure, the freely added product structure can serve an equivalent purpose without interacting significantly with the sccc structure. In conclusion, the paper decomposes additives into fundamental components: the ortho-structure and a classical branching structure, which can be introduced as a freely added product structure. This classical branching structure can be more complex, such as capturing classical mixing, but it can be added on top of the orthosccc structure and is not inherently essential to the framework.
