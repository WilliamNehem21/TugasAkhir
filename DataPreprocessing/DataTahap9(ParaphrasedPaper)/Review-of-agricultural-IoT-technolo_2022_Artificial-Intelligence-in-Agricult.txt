The application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture has brought about significant changes in agricultural production, leading to increased output and improved product quality, reduced labor costs, increased farm income, and the realization of agricultural modernization and intelligence. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current research status of agricultural IoT. It begins by illustrating the current state of agricultural IoT and summarizing its system architecture. Additionally, the paper discusses in detail the five key technologies of agricultural IoT, as well as introduces applications of agricultural IoT in five representative fields. Furthermore, it analyzes the current issues within agricultural IoT and offers a forecast for its future development.

The widespread use of IoT technology in agriculture, driven by internet development, digital technology, and sensing technology, has resulted in the continuous emergence and development of sensors with new technologies, aimed at being embedded, intelligent, integrated, and miniaturized. At present, the United States, Japan, and Germany are leading in sensor technology and manufacturing processes. Furthermore, agricultural sensors now offer a wide range of functions, including soil sensing, meteorological sensing, water sensing, and plant sensing, which provide substantial support for data collection in agricultural production.

Information processing plays a critical role in agricultural production monitoring, as it involves the collection and analysis of large volumes of real-time and dynamic production data. Leveraging IoT technology, production data can be stored and analyzed, and relevant data patterns can be identified. Cloud computing technology is primarily used for information processing, effectively addressing data storage, calculation, and related processing issues in agricultural production. Several protocols for IoT applications in smart farming have been presented, aiming to enhance communication networks and protocols, and to address security and privacy issues in IoT-based agriculture.

There is ongoing research on identification methods based on radio-frequency identification (RFID), with a focus on accurate location identification, positioning, and navigation using technologies such as Zigbee, Global Positioning System (GPS), and wireless sensor networks (WSN). Additionally, remote sensing technology, which uses various sensors to receive electromagnetic wave information of ground objects from different platforms, has a significant impact on the monitoring and management of large-area open-air agricultural production.

In terms of agricultural product quality, safety, and traceability, IoT is applied in areas such as agricultural product warehousing, logistics, and distribution. Through electronic data exchange, bar codes, RFID electronic tags, and other technologies, automatic identification and input and output of warehouse goods can be achieved. Furthermore, using wireless sensor networks (WSNs), storage workshops and logistics distribution vehicles can be monitored in real-time to ensure traceability of agricultural products.

Challenges include the need for high-speed wireless wide-area network (WAN) for data transmission, and research on the agricultural IoT system structure, as well as the deployment and management of perception nodes. The architecture should be open, distributed, and support resource-service sharing to enable interconnections of various heterogeneous systems and resource sharing, leading to the acquisition of more detailed agricultural information.
