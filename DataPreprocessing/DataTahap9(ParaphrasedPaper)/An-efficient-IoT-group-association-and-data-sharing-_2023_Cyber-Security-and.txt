The internet of things (IoT) devices in this case are able to maintain real-time data sharing with a remote cloud server even in areas where connectivity is not available. Additionally, nearby IoT devices can form randomized data forwarding and delivering networks as needed.

Maintaining user anonymity is crucial, as messages from the same terminal unit (TU) typically exhibit similar patterns, making them potentially identifiable. Anonymity in message delivery is essential to protect the privacy of all participating TUs.

Within our design, the edge infrastructure (EI) plays a critical role in the IoT system, overseeing processes such as system setup, user registration, key management, and verification. The EI is assumed to be resilient against various attacks and consistently authentic. However, its role is undertaken by commercial groups, and thus cannot be entirely trusted. Therefore, the EI is considered trustworthy but still subject to suspicion.

Furthermore, user unlinkability for all participating TUs should be guaranteed to prevent an adversary from linking messages sent by the same TU. The proposed authentication system ensures that TUs are unlinkable and resistant to unauthorized tracing.

The authenticated key management and data transfer process provides conditional privacy preservation for all legitimate TUs. If needed, the central system can reveal the true identities of hostile or compromised entities while maintaining their anonymous identities. In this technique, anonymous session identities are utilized during each session, with the original TU identities kept confidential at all times.

Additionally, each TU selects a random integer as a partial key, valid only for the current session. Impersonation and forgery on a specific TU will fail final validation, thus protecting user privacy. Moreover, message retrieval and identity tracking for selected suspicious TUs can expose malicious user behaviors and patterns. Overall, an effective authentication and key management system is employed to maximize privacy preservation.
