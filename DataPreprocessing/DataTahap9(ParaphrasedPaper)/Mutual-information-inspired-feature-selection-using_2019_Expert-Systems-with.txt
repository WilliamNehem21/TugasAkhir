The remaining sections of the paper are structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of mutual information (MI) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) along with a review of relevant literature. Section 3 introduces the proposed MRMJR-KCCA method and details its implementation. Section 4 presents the experimental results and subsequent discussions. Finally, the conclusions derived from the study are outlined in Section 5.

We assess the performance of MRMJR-KCCA through experiments employing two learning algorithms, specifically support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF), which are chosen due to their demonstrated effectiveness in classification tasks (Alickovic, Kevric, & Subasi, 2018; Chernbumroong, Cang, & Yu, 2014; Sani, Massie, Wiratunga, & Cooper, 2017). The gamma and C parameters in SVM, as well as the number of trees in RF, are determined through individual 10-fold cross-validation processes. The reported results present the average accuracy from 10 tests. Furthermore, we compare our proposed method with other established feature selection methods outlined in Section 1.
