Nevertheless, the aforementioned techniques have certain limitations and drawbacks. For example, there exists a significant disparity in the outcomes derived from dtm. However, as demonstrated in the illustrations, there is a minimal absolute error at individual points between the numerical outcome obtained using rk4 and the precise value. The conventional rk4 method is extensively employed for addressing initial value predicaments and yields estimations that approach the authentic solution as h diminishes[8,9].
