The paper explores the implications of revising the definition of strong normalization to account for the possibility of a term having multiple normal forms. It demonstrates that if a term can be typed in sta+, then each of its normal forms can be reached in a number of reduction steps that is polynomial in the size of the term, provided that the reduction process is conducted carefully. Additionally, the paper shows that it is possible to simulate every non-deterministic polynomial time decision problem using a term that is typable in sta+, indicating that sta+ is correct and complete for nptime.

The structure of the paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 provides a review of soft linear logic, while Section 3 introduces the type assignments system sta and briefly discusses the technical challenges involved in deriving it from sll. Section 4 presents sta, a type assignment system in natural deduction based on sll, which exhibits the subject reduction property and inherits favorable computational properties from sll. The achievement of subject reduction is facilitated by constructing terms linearly, and potential duplications of subterms are generated through rules pertaining to the modality, specifically soft promotion and multiplexor, which is made feasible by restricting the sll formulae as defined in the subsequent section.

Furthermore, the paper suggests that the characterization of fpspace could be attained by enhancing the calculus with boolean strings and augmenting the type assignment system with a new type and rule for handling them. Additionally, the machine could be extended to handle closed terms typed by the type of the boolean strings. It is noted that while this extension does not pose any specific challenges, the technical implementation would be tedious.
