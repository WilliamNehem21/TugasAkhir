This paper introduces a novel approach to business process modeling by proposing a visual notation language called BPSL and its accompanying tool, BPSL modeler, which aims to simplify the representation of business properties and facilitate the formal verification of business processes. The paper outlines the key features and advantages of the BPSL modeler, underscoring its usability, formal semantics, and tailored support for specifying common behaviors in business processes. Furthermore, it discusses the importance of visual extensions for temporal property specification and the potential of leveraging existing logics to optimize the representation of compliance rules in business models.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the framework and basic concepts of the BPSL modeler, while Section 4 elaborates on its features and their alignment with business property specification. Section 5 demonstrates the role of the BPSL modeler in the method of model checking business processes, and Section 6 provides a conclusion.

Moreover, the paper defines the visual representation and properties of Boolean Blocks (BB) and discusses the abortion condition in a transition system (TS). It emphasizes the significance of business property specification as a critical step in ensuring the reliability of business process models and highlights the potential of the BPSL modeler to streamline this process. The paper also mentions future work involving the application of the BPSL modeler in real-world scenarios to further demonstrate its efficacy.
