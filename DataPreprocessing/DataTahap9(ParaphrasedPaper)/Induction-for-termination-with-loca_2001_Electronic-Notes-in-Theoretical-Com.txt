In this context, local strategies on operators are utilized to ensure that the evaluation of expressions terminates. These strategies are supported by languages such as obj3, cafeobj, and maude, and have been the subject of study in this work. These strategies are defined by associating an ordered list of integers with each operator, specifying the positions of the subterms to be evaluated within a given term with the top operator being the specified operator.

To illustrate the application of our method, we focus on demonstrating the termination of constants and terms of various forms, such as f(t), zero(t), ite(t1; t2; t3), h(t), i(t), g(t), and s(t), regardless of the specific values of the ground terms t, t1, t2, and t3. For example, we establish the termination of zero(t) by first normalizing the subterm t to any of its normal forms and then normalizing zero(t#) at the top position. Similarly, we show the termination of h(t) and ite(t1; t2; t3) through a similar process.

Our aim is to present a procedure that implements this reasoning. We provide a background in section 2, introduce the necessary formal concepts in section 3, and outline a rule-based algorithm for mechanizing the proof principle in section 4. Additionally, we establish the correctness of the algorithm and provide examples.

We use the notation "1 followed by 2" to denote the sequence of substitutions. Furthermore, we define ordering constraints on terms and introduce the concept of ls rewriting strategy (ls-strategy) for terms.

We simulate the ls rewriting relation on ground terms by employing a sequence of steps, including ls normalization and abstraction, to track the iterative derivation tree starting from a term. We also introduce the concept of abstraction constraint and discuss its implications.

In addition, we discuss the narrowing process and analyze the conditions under which the induction hypothesis can be applied to a term. We also introduce the notion of usable rules and discuss its relevance in the context of proving termination of ground instances of terms.

We make reference to existing literature, including the work on "Principles of Maude" by M. Clavel, S. Eker, P. Lincoln, and J. Meseguer, as well as the work on "The Evaluation Strategy for Head Normal Form with and without On-Demand Ags" by M. Nakamura and K. Ogata.

Overall, the paper presents a detailed exploration of strategies for ensuring the termination of evaluations and provides valuable insights into the formalization and implementation of such strategies.
