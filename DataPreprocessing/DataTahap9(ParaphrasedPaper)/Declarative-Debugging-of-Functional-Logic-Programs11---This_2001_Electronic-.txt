The paper introduces a more effective methodology based on abstract interpretation to derive a finitely terminating debugging method for static use. The framework presented is flexible with respect to the chosen approximation of the success set. The authors demonstrate the approach using a specific example of approximation and provide an implementation of the debugging system. Experimental results on a wide set of benchmarks show that the system is capable of identifying common errors in user programs.

The methodology of abstract diagnosis is presented in section 6, accompanied by examples illustrating its use. An experimental evaluation of the method on a set of benchmarks is discussed in section 7, while section 8 concludes the paper and explores related work.

To simplify notation, the paper omits the subscript r in several instances. A term s is considered a normal form if there is no term t with s transitioning to t. The program r is described as canonical if the binary one-step rewriting relation defined by r is noetherian and confluent.

The paper discusses strategies to control the selection of redexes in unrestricted narrowing due to its large search space. A narrowing strategy, or position constraint, is defined as a well-defined criterion that limits the search space by allowing narrowing to occur only at specific chosen positions. Such a strategy is formalized as a mapping that assigns a subset of positions to every goal, with an emphasis on the completeness property. The inherited tradeoff between the benefits of outside-in evaluation of orthogonal, nonterminating rules and those of inner or eager evaluation with terminating, non-orthogonal rules is also discussed. The paper points to related work for a survey of results about the completeness of narrowing strategies, simplifying notation with a specific class.

The paper describes innermost and outermost narrowing strategies and formulates a conditional narrower with a specific strategy. Examples are provided to illustrate the computations achieved using the narrowing strategies and the conditional narrower.

The paper also discusses the theory of abstract interpretation and how it provides a formal framework for developing advanced dataflow analysis tools. Abstract interpretation formalizes the concept of "approximate computation," where computation is performed with descriptions of data rather than with the data itself. An abstract substitution is defined as a set of variable-term pairs, and the paper also introduces the concept of abstract xpoint semantics which provides an abstract approximation of the concrete semantics in a finite number of steps.

Strong completeness of the abstract xpoint semantics with respect to the concrete semantics is proved, and the paper also discusses the abstract success set as an overapproximation of the success set of a program, as well as possible underapproximations of the success set. Additionally, the paper presents a method for automatically finding errors in a debugger, and describes the implementation and components of the debugging system.
