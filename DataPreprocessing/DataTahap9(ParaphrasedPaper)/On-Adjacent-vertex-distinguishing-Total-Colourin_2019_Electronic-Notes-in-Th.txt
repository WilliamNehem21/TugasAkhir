It is observed that according to the definition of cd+1, the initial two properties are satisfied. Additionally, as the chromatic neighborhood of each vertex is augmented by only the color d+ 2 resulting from the introduction of the edges {e1,..., em}, the third property is also satisfied. Hence, cd+1 is confirmed to be an avdtc of hd+1.
