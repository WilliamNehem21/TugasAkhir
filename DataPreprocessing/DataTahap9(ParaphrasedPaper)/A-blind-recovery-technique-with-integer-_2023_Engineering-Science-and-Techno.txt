Visible watermarking involves directly modifying image pixels with a watermark, while invisible watermarking techniques discreetly insert watermarks to achieve imperceptibility. Invisible watermarking systems can be classified as fragile, semi-fragile, or robust, each with different capabilities and trade-offs. Fragile watermarking is widely used for verifying the integrity and authenticity of images, while semi-fragile watermarking methods balance reliability and fragility, and robust watermarking strikes a balance between imperceptibility and robustness.

In 2020, Molina et al. proposed a method for fragile authentication and recovery in image watermarking. This method inserted both recovery and authentication bits into each block of the image. The authentication bits were placed in the least significant bit (LSB) of the cover image, while the recovery bits were located in different block positions based on a block mapping. Additionally, an image inpainting process was used to enhance the quality of the recovered image. The approach was effective in detecting tampering, enabling the self-recovery of tampered images, and exhibiting robustness against various attacks.

However, the recovery process may encounter a challenge known as tamper coincidence, where tampering affects the location of the recovery bits, leading to their loss. To address this, Haghighi et al. proposed using multiple sets of recovery data and implementing image inpainting techniques, enabling the recovery of tamper coincidence-affected blocks.

This paper also introduces a method for adding a fragile watermark to images for authentication and blind recovery purposes (BRIWT). The cover image is divided into 2x2 pixels, with authentication bits inserted into the LSB and recovery bits inserted into two random LSB locations using a secret key. The proposed scheme utilizes integer wavelet transform (IWT) to generate recovery data and involves a novel image inpainting technique to restore tampered data. The paper's structure includes sections on current fragile watermarking methods, the newly proposed method, evaluation of tamper localization, and a conclusion.

The document also discusses several other watermarking methods proposed by different researchers, highlighting their strengths and limitations in detecting and recovering from tampering in digital images.
