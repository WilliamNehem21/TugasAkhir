The rats were divided into three groups: those given a 30% w/v sucrose solution in their drinking water, those fed an 8% salt diet, and those given both the sucrose solution and salt diet. After six weeks, the rats were euthanized, and their sperm function was evaluated post mortem. Blood samples were taken from the retro-orbital sinus.

Catalase (CAT) activity was measured by tracking the rate at which hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) disappeared in an enzyme reaction. Testes homogenate was added to a phosphate buffer containing H2O2, and the absorbance was recorded at 240 nm over 2 minutes. A blank sample without the testes homogenate was also taken.

The sucrose and sucrose+ salt-fed rats showed reduced food intake compared to the control and salt-fed rats after the second and third weeks of the study. By the fourth and fifth weeks, the sucrose-fed rats had significantly lower food intake compared to the other groups. Additionally, at the fifth week, the food intake in the sucrose+ salt-fed rats was higher than that of the sucrose-fed rats and lower than that of the control rats.

The rats fed on sucrose and sucrose+ salt had significantly lower body weight compared to the control group at the sixth week, while the salt-fed rats had higher body weights compared to the sucrose+ salt-fed rats. Furthermore, the salt and sucrose+ salt-fed rats had reduced body weight compared to the control rats by the sixth week.

In general, rats fed a high sucrose diet had lower food intake compared to those on a high salt diet throughout most of the study. A high salt diet led to increased food intake compared to sucrose-fed rats. High sucrose consumption resulted in no significant changes in serum electrolyte levels, while a high salt diet or a combination of high salt and sucrose significantly raised serum chloride ion levels.

In summary, the combination of sucrose and salt had a significant impact on food intake and body weight in the rats, and high salt intake led to increased food consumption and elevated serum chloride ion levels.
