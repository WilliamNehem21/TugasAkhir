The paper explores the expansion of mathematical operational semantics to accommodate algebraic effects. It begins with an effect-free coalgebraic operational semantics represented by a natural transformation of syntax over behavior. The extended language's operational semantics are then obtained by distributing program syntax over effects, leading to a coalgebraic operational semantics in the kleisli category for a monad derived from algebraic effects. The final coalgebra in this kleisli category becomes the denotational model, contingent on ensuring the enrichment of the kleisli category over cpos through the inclusion of a possibly infinite terms monad extended with a bottom element.

The study marks a preliminary exploration into the creation of abstract operational semantics for languages with effects. It commences with a pure, effectless language and an operational semantics grounded in a natural transformation. The syntax is expanded with computational effects derived from an algebraic theory, and the operational semantics are extended to accommodate these effects. This expansion generates an effectful operational model through structural recursion.

Furthermore, the study considers the morphing of a specific term, t(f1,...), by replacing its arguments, di, with their images under c. As per the previous approach, the behavior of t(f1,...) is obtained by applying the effectless rules to each leaf of f1, while retaining the conclusions in an effect-tree of the same shape.

In summary, the study initiates with operational specifications supported by premises for multisorted, effectless languages and demonstrates the process of expanding them with purely syntactic effects. This expansion results in an operational model represented as a coalgebra in a kleisli category, provided that the behavior functor has a lifting. Under specific conditions, the final kleisli-coalgebra exists, and the study defines an operational semantics through the unique kleisli-coalgebra morphism into the final kleisli-coalgebra. This coalgebra can serve as the denotational model by endowing it with an algebra structure.
