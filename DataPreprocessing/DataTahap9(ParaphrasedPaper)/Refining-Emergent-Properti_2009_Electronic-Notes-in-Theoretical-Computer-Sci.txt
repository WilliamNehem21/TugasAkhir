The continuous reduction in the size and cost of microprocessors and storage devices is leading to the development of increasingly distributed and decentralized systems. Components of such systems often have limited or no access to global information and rely on local information obtained through interactions with neighboring components. This can result in emergent behavior, where the overall behavior of the system is not determined by the behaviors of individual components in isolation.

There has been a reluctance to use formal methods in engineering such systems, in part due to their similarities with complex systems. Research on complex systems has primarily focused on modeling existing systems, both natural and man-made (e.g., the internet), and predicting their global properties. When modeling an existing system, unknown behavioral discontinuities may not be accounted for, making proof techniques ineffective in uncovering emergent behavior. Additionally, some complex systems, such as the human mind, are said to exhibit strong emergence, making it impossible to construct proofs explaining how their behavior arises.

In their work, Polack and Stepney argue that abstract specifications of emergent behavior, like the movement of a glider in the game of life, cannot be refined to the specific rules of the game. They assert that when an implementation exhibits emergent behavior, the specification, implementation, and even the languages in which they are expressed must be fundamentally different.

As an example, the paper provides a specification and refinement of dynamic patterns, such as a glider, in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional games of life. The approach is illustrated to be the same, with increasing complexity in the two-dimensional game. The paper concludes with a discussion of related work on refining emergent properties and examines how similar approaches could extend to other systems with emergent behavior, such as generalizing cellular automata and systolic algorithms.
