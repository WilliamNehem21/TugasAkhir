The paper examines the performance of a modified protocol in terms of delay, packet loss percentage, and throughput, compared to an existing protocol. The simulation results demonstrate that the modified protocol achieves an average improvement of 93.4% in packet loss percentage over the existing protocol, as well as better performance in terms of throughput and delay.

The paper introduces a protocol called PEACH, which enhances LEACH's lifetime by selecting a proxy node to assume the role of a cluster head with weak power. PEACH is designed based on the consensus of healthy nodes for detecting and managing failure in any cluster head, resulting in a significant improvement in network lifetime by reducing re-clustering overhead.

Another proposed scheme, Energy-Efficient Clustering Scheme (EECS), involves electing a constant number of candidate nodes for the cluster head role with a probability threshold and competing based on residual energy within a specified range. The size of the cluster is adjusted based on the distance between the cluster head and the base station. However, the paper notes that the random selection of candidate nodes for competition may lead to non-optimal cluster head selection.

The paper also discusses the common overload case and emphasizes the importance of protecting against packet loss rather than relying solely on recovery methods. It introduces a modified protocol called Low Loss Energy-Aware Routing Protocol (LLEAP), which uses two techniques to enhance its performance. The first technique focuses on increasing network lifetime by developing a schedule for nodes to conserve energy, while the second technique aims to reduce the occurrence of common causes of packet loss in the existing protocol, thus minimizing the energy consumed in recovery.

Additionally, the paper describes the calculation of metrics and the simulation methodology used to obtain the results, which are based on averaging multiple independent simulation runs with a 95% confidence interval. Each run utilizes a different randomly generated sensor node topology.
