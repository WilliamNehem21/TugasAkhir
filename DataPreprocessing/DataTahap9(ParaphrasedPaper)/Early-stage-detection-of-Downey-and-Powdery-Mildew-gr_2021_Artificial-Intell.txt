Grape downy mildew (caused by Plasmopara viticola) and grape powdery mildew (caused by Uncinula necator (Schw.) Burr.) are significant diseases that affect grapevines worldwide (Guanlin Li and Wang, 2011). These diseases impact both grape leaves and fruits, with downy mildew being particularly severe in conditions of heavy precipitation, high relative humidity, and prolonged moisture on leaves and fruits, while powdery mildew thrives in high humidity and moist weather. To combat these diseases, farmers commonly use fungicides, but their expensive cost and potential ecological impact lead to their use only when there are strong indications of disease presence (Zhao and Pei, 2012).

In the United States and Australia, various systems utilize hourly and daily meteorological conditions to predict the onset of crop diseases, but there is a lack of such systems specifically tailored for grape diseases. A disease model has been developed to calculate daily average temperature and moisture hours in order to propose treatment solutions for ascospore infections, with testing conducted in California's climatic conditions. There is a need for real-time climate monitoring devices to predict the onset of grape diseases, and modern Internet of Things (IoT) mechanisms have been employed to acquire real-time onsite observations for this purpose.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background information, Section 3 details the methodology used to detect downy and powdery mildew in vineyards, Section 4 presents the experimental results and performance insights of the developed system, and Section 5 concludes the work and suggests avenues for future research.

An experimental setup deployed in the field utilizes temperature and rain sensors to measure essential environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Each sensor is managed by a low-cost firmware and development board, NodeMCU, which is designed for IoT-based applications (NodeMCU ESP8266, 2020).

This section discusses the experimental setup in the field and presents real-time data captured from IoT sensors. The captured data is then analyzed using an algorithm to test for the occurrences of downy and powdery mildew. The proposed system is compared with the existing system, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed system in detecting the occurrence of both diseases.

The proposed system effectively identifies grape diseases at an early stage by incorporating a rain sensor along with temperature and humidity sensors. This combined approach significantly enhances the accuracy of disease notification compared to systems without a rain gauge, leading to higher performance in disease recognition.

The results show that 94.4% of recordings were correctly identified for downy mildew and 96% for powdery mildew, leading to a reduction in the use of fungicides on grape plants and an improvement in the quality of grapes.
