This academic paper discusses the concept of anonymity in systems, focusing on the likelihood of user identities being revealed despite efforts to maintain anonymity. The authors propose a notion of weak probabilistic anonymity, which considers the possibility of some probabilistic information being leaked by the system, potentially allowing observers to infer the likelihood of a certain user performing a specific action. The study aims to analyze the level of anonymity that the system can still ensure, even in the presence of information leakage.

The paper explores the dining cryptographers problem (DCP) in the context of biased coins, considering scenarios where imperfections in internal mechanisms can lead to the leakage of probabilistic information. The authors investigate how the biased factor of the coins influences the system's ability to achieve anonymity.

The paper also discusses the use of both probabilistic and nondeterministic choices in systems, providing a brief description of probabilistic automata as a general model. It further introduces a simplified kind of automaton and provides a description of the dining cryptographers problem on a linear graph.

The authors propose two notions of weak probabilistic anonymity for both nondeterministic and probabilistic users and examine their dependencies on the biased factor of the coins in the DCP. They also discuss the coding of the DCP in Prism and the formulation of weak anonymity expressions.

The paper concludes by referencing previous work on probabilistic anonymity and hierarchical notions of anonymity in the context of crowds.
