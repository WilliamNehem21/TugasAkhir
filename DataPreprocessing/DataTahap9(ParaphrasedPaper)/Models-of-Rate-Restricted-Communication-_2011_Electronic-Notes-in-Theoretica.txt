This paper uses examples to show how rate restrictions in creol models can capture the characteristics of radio-based message broadcast and point-to-point communication channels. The channel-based communication focuses on communication between two objects, such as modeling a low-bandwidth connection between hardware systems, while arrival-based restrictions depict a single component with specific limits on accepting communication from any source, thereby capturing interference and resending in the context of radio communication. The paper also demonstrates how system behavior can be simulated using Maude as an interpreter for creol models, varying over rate restrictions.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces timed creol, a timed extension of the creol modeling language, and illustrates it with an example of client-server communication. Section 3 presents a modeling pattern for resource-constrained behavior and introduces a rate-restricted point-to-point communication channel for the client-server example. Section 4 develops a creol model of a bandwidth-restricted wireless sensor network. Section 5 discusses related work, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

Creol is described as an abstract behavioral modeling language for distributed active objects, based on asynchronous method calls and processor release points. This language supports communication between named objects through asynchronous method calls, triggering concurrent activities within the called object. Objects in creol have dedicated processors and exist in a distributed environment with asynchronous and unordered communication. The paper assumes programs are well-typed, meaning that invoked methods are supported by the called object for well-typed programs.

The paper also introduces a modeling pattern for extending a given model with a class parametric in the available resources per time interval. This technique is used to impose rate restrictions on communication between objects. Additionally, the paper discusses fine-tuning bandwidth consumption for different methods and describes the process of receiving and resending messages in the context of a wireless sensor network.

The paper further presents the simulation of randomly-generated network topologies with constant four sensor nodes and six connections, demonstrating how the time for messages to reach the sink increases as the available bandwidth decreases. Finally, the paper discusses techniques and methodologies for predicting or analyzing non-functional properties, such as measurement-based approaches and model-based approaches, as well as the use of experimentation and simulations for understanding the behavior of distributed algorithms in wireless sensor networks. The paper argues that formal models allow for a more systematic and in-depth exploration of the execution space, providing initial insights into the behavior of distributed algorithms without specific assumptions about lower-level layers.
