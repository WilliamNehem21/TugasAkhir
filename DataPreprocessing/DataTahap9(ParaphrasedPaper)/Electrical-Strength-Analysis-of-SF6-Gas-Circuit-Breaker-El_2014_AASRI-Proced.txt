This paper discusses the challenges associated with calculating the electric field and analyzing surface flashovers in node tank SF6 circuit breakers. Specifically, it examines the gap between the grounded tank unit, a filter system, and a conductive system that receives input power. The paper also offers recommendations for modifying the design of SF6 circuit breakers.

The insulation system design of SF6 circuit breakers can be categorized into two types: with a gas gap or along the surfaces of solid dielectrics. The discharge conditions along the surfaces of solid dielectrics are notably different from those in the gas gap and can significantly influence the geometric dimensions of the circuit breaker. During operation, the insulation system must be able to withstand normalized AC voltage and overvoltages.

The findings reveal that the dielectric strength design is inadequate, even for a gap without polluted particles and decomposition products in SF6. The dielectric strength of the gas gap (A-B) is slightly higher than the withstand test voltage, while the discharge voltage along the surface of the solid dielectric (D-E) is 0.77 of the withstand test voltage. Possible discharge paths in the investigated gap are represented by the electric lines of force, but it is indicated that there may be an alternative discharge path along the surface of the dielectric.

The paper provides a calculation of the electric strength of tank circuit breaker discharge based on the criteria for streamer inception. The results suggest that the dielectric strength of this design is insufficient. The theoretical results from testing the insulation during lightning impulses are experimentally confirmed. Currently, the dielectric strength has been improved by varying the gap from 82 to 100 mm.
