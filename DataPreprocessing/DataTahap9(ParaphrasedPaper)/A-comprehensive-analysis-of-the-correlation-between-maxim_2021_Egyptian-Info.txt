The study investigates network science, which involves the analysis of complex real-world and theoretical model-based networks using graph theory. It focuses on node centrality as a measure of the topological importance of nodes within a network. A variety of centrality metrics have been developed, including neighbor-based and shortest path-based measures, such as degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality.

The paper proposes an algorithm to determine the maximal clique size of individual vertices in a graph, aiming to identify highly modular nodes in complex networks. The authors use correlation analysis to examine the relationship between centrality metrics and maximal clique size in various types of networks, including those related to US politics, the C. elegans neural network, the Erdos collaboration network, and the US airports network.

The results indicate that there is a moderately positive correlation between centrality metrics and maximal clique size in fully connected regimes, while in the supercritical regime, degree centrality and closeness centrality metrics exhibit a strong to very strong positive correlation. The study also discusses the results of correlation analysis for scale-free network graphs generated from the Barabasi-Albert model.

Overall, the paper provides a framework for evaluating the levels of correlation between different metrics for complex network graphs and suggests that lightweight centrality metrics, particularly neighbor-based degree and eigenvector centrality, could effectively rank vertices in network graphs in place of the computationally intensive maximal clique size metric, especially for real-world and scale-free networks. However, this replacement is not as effective for random network graphs, where only a moderately positive correlation is observed.
