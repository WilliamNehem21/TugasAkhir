The research paper presents the development of a hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) model and its application in predicting the behavior of channel shear connectors embedded in normal and high-strength concrete. The ANN is created and tested using experimental datasets, demonstrating good agreement between the actual and predicted values. Additionally, the study compares the results of the ANN simulation with other data processing methods such as support vector machine (SVM), partial least squares (PLS), and principal component regression.

The lubricant industry plays a crucial role in the improvement of the machine industry and related sectors. Statistical data indicate that even a slight increase in the production cost for acquiring better lubricants can lead to substantial cost reductions by mitigating additional unwanted expenses. This is attributed to the beneficial effects of using lubricants, which can minimize friction between moving parts, cool the engine and its internal components, reduce thermal stresses, and extend the life of machinery. Lubricants not only seal contact parts to prevent the diffusion of gases and fluid particles but also carry particles due to engine component wear, collecting them in filter walls. In recent years, the utilization of nanomaterials in various engineering fields and industries has gained significant attention from researchers. The dispersion of nanoparticles in a base fluid creates nanofluids, leading to improved performance compared to base fluids.

The research investigates the dependency of nanofluid behavior on temperature and shear rates, revealing newtonian or non-newtonian characteristics in nanofluid suspensions based on different conditions. Additionally, the study examines the rheological properties of various nanofluids, indicating that all nanofluids exhibit pseudo-plastic behavior. The use of a multi-layer ANN with a back propagation learning algorithm is employed to predict the behavior of a specific hybrid nano-lubricant. The results demonstrate a close match between the experimental and simulated values, emphasizing the accuracy of the ANN predictions.

The study also discusses the application of partial least squares regression as an efficient method for regression with multiple explanatory variables that tend to correlate. The method is recommended for its fast and optimal covariance-based regression approach, presenting similarities to principal component regression while differing in the monitoring of the transformation process.
