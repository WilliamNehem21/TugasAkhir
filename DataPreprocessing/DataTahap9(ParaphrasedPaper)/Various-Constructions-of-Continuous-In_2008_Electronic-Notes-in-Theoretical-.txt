In this paper, we present the general power constructions for continuous information systems. We note that it is impractical to expect a power of a continuous information system to remain continuous, as domains do not always exhibit this property. We intend to investigate the types of continuous information systems whose powers remain continuous information systems in a separate study.

We observe that, in general, the induced weak information system is not a continuous information system (see example 4.3). However, if an induced weak information system does happen to be continuous, it must be an algebraic one (see proposition 4.4).

Moving on to (algebraic) retracts, we emphasize that retracts should be defined in terms of retractions, which in turn need to be approximating mappings. Nevertheless, approximating mappings are only defined between continuous information systems. To properly define retractions between (algebraic) continuous information systems, we require propositions 4.8 and 4.13.

The algebraic kernel construction is a robust method, as it always generates algebraic information systems. This construction may prove valuable in representing algebraic domains. Although (algebraic) retracts are somewhat complex and closely linked to approximable mappings, these constructions indeed yield new (algebraic) continuous information systems.
