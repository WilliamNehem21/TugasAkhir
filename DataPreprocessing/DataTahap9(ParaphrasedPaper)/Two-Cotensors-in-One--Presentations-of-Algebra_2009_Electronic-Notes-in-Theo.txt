The category "i" is defined as having finite sets of atoms as objects and injections as morphisms. Throughout this discussion, "i" is used to represent the category of presheaves "seti." The presheaf "a" in "i" is defined by the function a(a) = a.

We proceed to explore fundamental concepts of algebraic theories and Lawvere theories within an enriched context. For more comprehensive information and broader applicability, readers are directed to references [14, 22, 26], as well as a resource on enriched categories. In section 3.4, we examine how this theory relates to the categories "f" and "a" mentioned earlier.

As an illustrative case, we consider the Cartesian structure in example 5.2. Let "c" be any category with an initial object, and let "m" be the set of all isomorphisms in "c." A compatibility structure is established in which all morphisms sharing a common codomain are related. The resulting structure on "setc" is the Cartesian closed structure.
