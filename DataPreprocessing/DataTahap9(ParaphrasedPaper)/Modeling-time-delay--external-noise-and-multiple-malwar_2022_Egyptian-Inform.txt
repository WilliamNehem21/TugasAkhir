Many malware models, such as SEIR, SIR, SIRD, ESIRD, SISL, SIRS-L, SILRD, and others, are based on and derived from the classical SIR model. These models are mathematical representations that make simplified assumptions about critical issues related to malware and network problems. These assumptions are closely associated with the specific malware, network failures, and hacking concerns being studied. Therefore, classical base models like SIR can be used to analyze various critical networks, such as heterogeneous networks, LSTM networks, or machine-to-machine networks. In this study, we introduce a complex network model to demonstrate multiple infections and their corresponding components, including exposed, infectious, recovered, and vaccinated individuals. Specifically, we have extended the original SEIR-V model by adding subclasses, namely the exposed and infectious classes, to create our model.

Wireless sensor network (WSN) environments are typically influenced by various random factors, such as temperature, physical obstructions (e.g., range and distance between devices in the network), and natural disturbances (e.g., latency due to heavy traffic and large data transmission with variable sizes). Apart from deterministic processes, a significant portion of environmental factors involves uncertainties and inherent randomness, as seen in network traffic, unexpected failures, and hacking by malicious actors using malware. Random fluctuations in network processes prompt us to explore how a stochastic environment can impact and determine the dynamics of network systems.
