The analysis of blood cell counts provides crucial information regarding the composition and quantity of cells in the blood, particularly red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This information is essential for identifying symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, bruising, anemia, infection, and various other disorders. Blood cell counting can be performed either manually or automatically. In many developing countries like Ethiopia, manual blood cell counting using microscopic images is common, although this method is laborious, time-consuming, and prone to errors, potentially leading to incorrect diagnoses and treatments.

Automatic blood cell counting devices exist but are expensive and do not provide detailed cell structure information, limiting their ability to diagnose common blood diseases such as malaria, leukemia, and sickle cell disease. However, recent advancements in image processing technology have made it possible to perform blood cell counting from microscopic blood images using computer or mobile phone applications. One challenge in this approach is the initial step of acquiring high-resolution images.

The proposed system described in this paper involves acquiring digitized images of blood samples with a smartphone camera mounted on a microscope. The images are then processed using a developed application to count blood cells and diagnose malaria. The system is designed to be user-friendly, and its mobile application version has been tested and found to yield comparable results to those obtained using a computer.

In addition to its application in medical diagnostics, the system can also facilitate communication and collaboration among healthcare providers and serve as an educational tool for laboratory technicians. Moreover, it can be utilized by research institutes to expedite the sharing of microscopic images and videos for further processing. The authors highlight that the proposed system offers a fast, cost-effective, and accurate method for blood cell counting and malaria diagnosis in low-resource settings, which can be easily implemented in medical facilities with minimal infrastructure. The system is also capable of recognizing and counting overlapping blood cells independently.
