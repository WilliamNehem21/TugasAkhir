The gateway node acts as an intermediary node, while the remaining nodes are ordinary nodes, referred to as dominant forwarding nodes. Cluster heads (CHs) are responsible for maintaining routing and topology information. Active clustering involves mobile nodes periodically exchanging information to elect the cluster head, whereas passive clustering suspends the procedure until data traffic commences, reducing the control overhead but increasing setup latency. On-demand clustering elects the cluster head dynamically to minimize computation and communication costs.

Data offloading plays a crucial role in minimizing bandwidth and traffic in mobile nodes. It involves distributing the load across multiple nodes. Wi-Fi offload, also known as mobile data offload, leverages small cell technologies like Wi-Fi to offer services to end users effectively and economically. Reasons for using Wi-Fi offload include meeting growing mobile data demand, accommodating smart device usage patterns, enhancing end-user experience, and reducing service providers' operating expenses.

This section briefly discusses existing research on clustering and data offloading in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Kaur et al. proposed the Weightage Based Secure Energy Efficient Clustering (WSEEC) algorithm, which outperformed traditional approaches in terms of network lifetime, energy consumption, delay, throughput, and packet delivery ratio. Bokhari et al. surveyed various clustering algorithms and identified the Max-Min D-Cluster as the best algorithm with controlled message complexity. Amani et al. presented an integrated Wi-Fi architecture with software-defined networking (SDN) to alleviate mobile data traffic load by offloading Wi-Fi. Eom et al. explored machine learning techniques for adaptive scheduling in MANET, addressing traffic demands through Wi-Fi offloading, Mobile Smart Loading (MSL), and smart cells. Budiyanto et al. proposed the Genetic Zone Routing Protocol (GZRP) to optimize 3G-Wi-Fi offload and load balancing among nodes.

In addition, the paper investigates the evapotranspiration in Iran, utilizing transfer-based models for predicting crop evapotranspiration under different weather conditions. The study aims to select the best model for estimating crop evapotranspiration in the northern and southern regions of Iran based on temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity.

Following route discovery, the optimal path is selected by predicting faulty nodes to ensure efficient data transmission. This involves computation of end-to-end delay to establish secure communication, authentication of nodes along the optimal path, and consideration of node behavior to prevent misbehavior. Node authentication is implemented using MD5 and SHA1 algorithms.
