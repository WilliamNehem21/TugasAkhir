Currently, there is limited implementation of aerobic composting treatment for domestic sludge. In late October 2002, the sludge disposal field in Pang Gezhuang in the southern suburbs of Beijing was officially completed, accommodating sludge from the Gaobeidian sewage treatment plant at a rate of 160,000 tons per day. It is known that composting can mitigate nitrogen loss during the process, reduce environmental pollution, and enhance the quality of the end product. The degradation of organic matter during composting can bind heavy metals and reduce their bioavailability in the sludge, but the role of immobilizing heavy metals through composting is limited, especially when the sludge has a high heavy metal content. In addition, although organic pollutants in the sludge can degrade significantly during composting, the residue of refractory organic pollutants in the composting products remains high due to the composting time and process conditions. Hence, it is necessary to reinforce measures to protect nitrogen, reduce nitrogen loss, and enhance the immobilization of heavy metals and the rate of organic pollutant degradation in the use of composting technology for sludge. Further research is needed to address these issues.
