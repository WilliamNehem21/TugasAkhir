Biochar aromaticity is often measured using solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which is costly, time-consuming, and available at only a few research-oriented universities. It may be feasible to use mathematical modeling as an alternative to predict biochar aromaticity from more readily accessible parameters, such as elemental composition. This study used genetic programming (GP), an advanced machine learning method, to develop new prediction models, employing an experimental dataset of 98 biochar samples. The GP algorithm revealed an underlying exponential relationship between elemental compositions and the aromaticity of biochars, which offered a clearer and simpler alternative to the polynomial mapping relationships suggested by previous models. A novel exponential model was proposed for predicting biochar aromaticity, offering better prediction accuracy and generalization ability compared to existing polynomial models based on statistical parameter evaluation.

Furthermore, previous studies have indicated a positive correlation between biochar aromaticity and their capacity for adsorbing organic pollutants, as well as a link between the amount of CO2 generated during long-term incubation of biochars and their initial proportion of aromatic carbon. Quantifying the aromaticity of biochar is crucial for their further utilization and could serve as the basis for business models.

To develop prediction models for biochar aromaticity, the experimental dataset was divided into training and testing sets, with 60 samples (approximately 60% of the data) randomly selected as the training set and the remaining 38 samples as the testing set. GP-II and GP-III models outperformed GP-I and Mazumdar-Wang models, demonstrating smaller median values for prediction errors and no outliers, suggesting their superior prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities. These results suggest an exponential relationship between the models, with exponential models showing better predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities compared to polynomial models.

The study also found that the influence of the nitrogen-to-carbon ratio on predicting biochar aromaticity was minimal and could be disregarded. Additionally, the GP-II model was noted to align well with reported research results, demonstrating high predictive accuracy and generalization ability, thus positioning it as an excellent prediction model for biochar aromaticity.
