Complex systems, composed of multiple interacting components, naturally arise in a wide variety of applications. These components may be complex in themselves, with internal logic, databases, inference mechanisms, and planning mechanisms, or they may be simple but still result in complicated compositions due to the need to consider interactions among the components. The verification of such complex systems faces the challenge of state explosion, where the state space grows exponentially with the number of components. Symbolic representations and model checking have expanded the scale of systems that can be verified, but many realistic systems remain too large to be effectively handled. Therefore, it is crucial to develop techniques that can further increase the scale of verifiable systems. One approach is to modularly check properties, i.e. verifying them for individual components, inferring their validity in the interconnected system, and then utilizing them to deduce additional properties of the system. However, not all properties are preserved by interconnection, such as when deadlock-free systems may lead to deadlocks when interconnected. This paper aims to address an important question in verification.

In Example 2.6, we examine a modified version of Example 2.2, where there is no control unit, and all trains have access to information about the positions of all trains. The trains report and move collectively.

We present interpretations for system properties (i.e. statements about states, actions, and behavior) in both concrete (e.g. sets) and sheaf-theoretical categories, and establish connections between the set-theoretical and sheaf-theoretical interpretations for individual systems and their interconnections. These connections are then used to demonstrate the preservation of truth during system interconnections.

We demonstrate that a family of interacting systems, closed under pullbacks, can be equipped with a topology that models their interactions. States, parallel actions, transitions, and behavior can be described as sheaves on this topological space. We then employ geometric logic to determine the types of system properties in this family that are preserved when the systems are interconnected. The key advantage of our approach is its capability to verify properties of complex systems in a modular manner. We illustrate these concepts using a running example involving systems of trains controlled by interacting controllers. In future work, we aim to explore other applications, including geographically distributed systems controlled by geographically overlapping controllers.
