Various key metrics have been utilized to evaluate users' engagement with immersive technology, including presence (Cummings & Bailenson, 2016), engagement, and enjoyment. The achievement emotion theory (Pekrun, 2006) and work by Makransky et al. (2017, 2020) have further conceptualized that learning outcomes in virtual reality (VR) settings arise from the simulated presence of stimuli and feedback embedded in the VR program, along with affective factors, and are influenced by cognitive factors such as self-efficacy. Consequently, it is important to measure the sense of presence and motion frustration and assess their impact on user performance. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the influence of frustration and the presence of fire on learning progress in a VR fire-escape program, and to examine how self-efficacy in gameplay mediates this relationship.

Presence in VR refers to the technology-induced subjective experience of feeling immersed in a simulated environment, mimicking the experience of interacting with real objects. Individuals experiencing a heightened sense of presence while using VR for training may show improved learning efficacy. Students engaged in a high-presence VR environment have displayed increased confidence in using VR. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the roles of presence in virtual environments, which can vary across different disciplinary contexts (Lim & Richardson, 2022). In light of this, the present study examined the role of the presence of fire in VR after participants engaged with a VR fire-escape program.

This study emphasizes the significant role of gameplay self-efficacy in maximizing the potential of VR programs to help learners immerse themselves in a controlled and danger-free virtual world to acquire new life-saving knowledge and skills (Yang & Goh, 2022). The findings indicate that frustration impedes learning progress by diminishing individuals' gameplay self-efficacy. When fundamental physical actions can only be performed through controllers and when visual cues differ from real-life experiences, individuals expend cognitive resources in learning to use gadgets and adapting to the virtually constructed environment. This diversion of attention from the authentic learning task leads to frustration with VR programs, which correlates with lower self-efficacy (Pence, 2022). Despite the numerous strengths of VR educational programs in promoting positive learning outcomes, challenges in operating VR could hinder learning outcomes. Given the importance of gameplay self-efficacy in VR programs, VR-related frustration, as a representation of risks, should be minimized to foster gameplay self-efficacy.

The findings also demonstrate that a vivid representation of the authentic task (i.e., presence) and a lower level of frustration are crucial in developing higher gameplay self-efficacy, even for tasks involving life-threatening events that may influence participants' deep learning. The affective and perceptual experiences appear to have distinct relationships with gameplay self-efficacy, necessitating educators and VR program developers to address both constructs to facilitate meaningful learning.

Based on the findings, our research highlights the value of VR programs in training adolescents to cope with stressful and life-threatening incidents, the importance of realistic presence in fire scenes, and the need to reduce technological barriers for learners. VR remains a valuable tool for training adolescents about fire safety and escape skills, offering a safe and effective alternative despite potential risks and limitations of traditional training methods (Yang & Goh, 2022). Furthermore, the findings suggest that a more authentic presence when using VR may lead to improved gameplay self-efficacy and, ultimately, better learning outcomes. VR program developers should create realistic environments in VR programs to promote self-efficacy and the mastery of life-saving skills. In this regard, program developers should...

Nevertheless, the findings should be interpreted cautiously. First, our quasi-experimental design does not establish a causal relationship between using the VR fire-escape program, gameplay self-efficacy, and mastery of content knowledge and skills due to the absence of a control group. Accordingly, the findings should be interpreted as correlational, and future studies should employ randomized controlled trials to establish causal relationships. Second, the effect size of gameplay self-efficacy on learning progress was small, suggesting the involvement of other variables. It is plausible that the effect size is small because the content may be too basic for high school students, who may have previously learned the fundamentals. Researchers should identify influential predictors of learning outcomes that can be promoted by VR programs, in addition to self-efficacy, or when VR programs serve as a review of previously learned content. Third, we did not compare the learning effectiveness in performance of individuals who practiced the VR fire-escape program with those who did not. Lastly, the results can only be generalized to high school students, necessitating further research involving individuals of different ages to verify the effects of the VR fire-escape program.
