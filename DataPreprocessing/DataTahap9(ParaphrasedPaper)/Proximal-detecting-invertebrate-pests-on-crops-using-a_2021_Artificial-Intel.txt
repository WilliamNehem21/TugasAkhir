The early detection of invertebrate pests on crops is crucial for effective pest management. Traditional methods involving traps and human classification are subjective, error-prone, and labor-intensive. Recently, there has been a shift towards semi-automatic pest detection using computer vision technologies, but these approaches are still too slow for optimized pest management decisions. Precision agriculture requires real-time detection of pests on crops for timely and location-specific actions. In this study, computer vision and machine learning technologies were utilized to detect invertebrates on crops in the field. A novel training pipeline was proposed and a virtual database was generated to train a deep residual CNN with 97.8% accuracy in detecting four species of pests in farming environments. This method can be applied to a robotic system for real-time detection of invertebrate pests on crops.

Invertebrate pests pose a significant challenge to crop management and result in substantial economic losses. They can damage leaves, affect photosynthesis, and spread diseases, leading to annual losses in Australian grain crops. While biological and chemical methods are available for pest control, they come with their own set of challenges, such as pesticide resistance and environmental pollution.

Early detection of pests on crops is crucial for making timely and appropriate management decisions. It provides information on when and where crops are being attacked, enabling real-time actions such as selective spraying, or facilitating more optimal decisions within an IPM system. In this study, computer vision technologies were used to detect common pests on crops in South Australia. Different databases were created to evaluate the performance of CNN models for pest classification, and a standard training pipeline was developed. The models achieved high classification accuracy and can be applied to proximally detect pests on crops.

After evaluating the performance of the CNN models, the model trained on the 10-class database, named m10c, was identified as the best model and the standard training pipeline was defined based on it. This pipeline was then applied to the 5-class database to train another model, m5c, which was tested using independent images collected in real farming environments. The images were taken during the day and night using different lighting conditions and backgrounds containing multiple crops and fruit trees.
