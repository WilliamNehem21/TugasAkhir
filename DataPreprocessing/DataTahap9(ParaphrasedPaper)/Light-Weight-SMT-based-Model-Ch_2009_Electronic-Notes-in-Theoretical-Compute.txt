The initial condition (i) can be relaxed to local finiteness, while the second condition is generally met in practical scenarios, such as when the models of ti consist of finite sets, linear orders, graphs, forests, etc. The assumption of quantifier elimination for te is required to demonstrate closure under pre-image computation, but in this case, we can adopt a more restricted notion for t-formulae and do not need it. 

Now, it's worth examining our formalization of parametrized systems within the context of the stopping failures model. As mentioned in section 2, when control reaches the additional state qcrash, no transition is enabled. This implies that a[s]/= qcrash is a straightforward choice for expressing an activity condition in such systems.
