The concept of picture fuzzy sets (PFS) represents a broadened version of conventional fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets. PFS is characterized by its positive, neutral, and negative membership functions. Due to the significance of similarity measures and their applications in various fields such as data mining, medical diagnosis, decision making, and pattern recognition, numerous studies have been conducted in this area. However, some existing similarity measures do not meet the required axioms of similarity and may yield counterintuitive results. In this paper, we introduce new similarity measures for PFS based on two parameters, t and p, where t indicates the degree of uncertainty and p represents the lp norm. We discuss the properties of these bi-parametric similarity and distance measures and provide counterexamples for existing similarity measures, highlighting the importance and applicability of our proposed similarity measure in pattern recognition problems. Additionally, we demonstrate an application of the proposed similarity measure in medical diagnosis.

Yang et al. introduced the hybrid model of soft sets and PFS, referred to as picture fuzzy soft sets (PFSS). Khan et al. discussed the generalized picture fuzzy soft set (GPFSS) and its applications in decision making. They also utilized the soft discernibility matrix approach for PFSS and GPFSS to address decision-making problems. This approach is particularly valuable when initiating the process with predefined conditions on membership functions, i.e., threshold values. The applications of GPFSS in concept selection were also explored.

In this section, we explore the distance and similarity measures of PFSS and the methods derived from them. These measures are relevant in the fields of data mining, medical diagnosis, decision making, and pattern recognition. Wei introduced the picture fuzzy cross entropy for use in Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) problems. Similarly, similarity measures based on cosine and cotangent functions were employed for strategic decision making. Additionally, an algorithm for PFS was developed and applied to decision-making problems. Other scholars also interpreted various similarity measures for picture fuzzy sets and applied them to pattern recognition problems.

We adopt the generalized model of fuzzy sets (PFS) for medical diagnosis. PFSS presents a relatively new extension of fuzzy sets, allowing for the representation of human opinions with multiple responses such as acceptance, rejection, neutral, and desist, which cannot be accurately reflected in traditional fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSS). PFSS are characterized by three components: the degree of membership, the degree of neutral membership, and the degree of non-membership, where the sum of these three degrees must not exceed one. PFSS play a pivotal role in scenarios involving diverse responses such as no, yes, refusal, and abstention, making them suitable for modeling such situations.

In Section 3, we introduce new distance and similarity measures for PFSS. Section 4 provides an explanation of the parameters p and t, along with the interpretation of the novel distance measure. Section 5 presents counterexamples for existing similarity measures, and Section 6 includes a numerical example of medical diagnosis to support the proposed similarity measure. Comparison analysis and conclusions are provided in Sections 7 and 8.

Our proposed similarity measure is consistent and reliable for all values of p. This demonstrates that varying the value of p produces the same diagnosis (order). Different values of t yield the same diagnosis, but their specific value is dependent on the dataset as t identifies the level of uncertainty and is solely influenced by the provided data.
