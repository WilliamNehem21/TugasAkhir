An approach using a PSO-BP neural network for emitter fusion recognition is suggested in response to the challenge of identifying emitter characteristic parameters within intervals. The method involves training the network using well-structured samples that reflect the parameter distribution within the interval, and utilizing the PSO algorithm to optimize the BP neural network. Simulation experiments are conducted to explore the impact of the network's output coding, training data size, and deviation rate on recognition. The results validate the effectiveness of this approach.

While existing methods such as those based on Bayesian theory, fuzzy pattern recognition, and artificial neural networks have been successful in recognizing radiation sources with scalar parameters, they have not extensively addressed the issue of recognizing radar emitters with interval-type parameters. The proposed method distinguishes itself by focusing on constructing sample data that captures the deviation rate of characteristic parameters from their center and by applying PSO to enhance the BP neural network. The simulation findings demonstrate the efficacy of the PSO algorithm in addressing the limitations of the BP neural network.

Furthermore, the study investigates the influence of neural network output coding and sample data size on recognition rates, affirming the practical value of the proposed recognition method. However, the model's limitation in considering characteristic parameters with discrete values, such as modulation information, is acknowledged, prompting the need for future research to devise a more comprehensive model while maintaining practical applicability.
