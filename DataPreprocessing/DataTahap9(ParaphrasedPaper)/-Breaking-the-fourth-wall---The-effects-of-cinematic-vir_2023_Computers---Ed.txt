The essence of virtual reality lies in the realm of experience. Kolb's experiential learning cycle outlines a process where learners begin by gaining an experience, followed by reflection, and then integrating the newfound knowledge into their learning process. This interaction between the learner and their environment is pivotal, with experience serving as the foundation for learning. The cycle emphasizes the importance of reflecting on information, integrating it with the learner's existing knowledge, and then applying the new understanding through active experimentation (Kolb, 1984, 2015).

Given the diversity in learners' backgrounds and learning styles, Kolb's experiential learning cycle not only accommodates individual needs but also facilitates more engaging and participatory learning experiences. It operates as a continuous spiral, allowing learners to repeat the process multiple times. Throughout this learning spiral, learners utilize their prior experiences as a guide to test new knowledge, thus creating new experiences.

In today's globalized world, the cultivation of empathy holds significant importance. Krznaric (2015) contends that empathy is an inherent capacity that can also be nurtured and developed as a skill. With adolescents demonstrating a 40% decrease in empathy compared to their counterparts from three decades ago, empathy has gained attention in K-12 social and emotional learning programs (CASEL, 2022). This emphasis on empathy is driven by its correlation with reduced aggressive behavior, increased altruism, and the reinforcement of morality (Batson & Shaw, 1991; Hoffman, 2010). As a result, efforts are being made to integrate empathy into core curricular areas throughout the school day to promote children's emotional well-being (Borba, 2017; Gordon, 2009).

During adolescence, individuals are still in the process of developing cognitive and affective empathy skills. Studies indicate gender-based differences in empathy skill levels, with recent research revealing that adolescent females exhibit higher levels of both cognitive and affective empathy skills compared to males.

The impact of virtual reality (VR) on K-12 educational settings, particularly concerning younger individuals, warrants further investigation. Moreover, existing research on VR in K-12 settings tends to conflate 2D VR on computer screens with immersive VR experienced through head-mounted displays (HMDs). It is crucial to acknowledge the distinctions between these technologies and recognize how they engage students differently.

The study, conducted over a two-week period in a public middle school in a suburb of Chicago, was approved by the Office of Research Compliance, Integrity, and Safety at Northern Illinois University with IRB approval number HS22-0200. A total of 80 seventh-grade students were invited to participate, with data analysis including only those students whose parents or guardians did not submit an opt-out form and who provided assent and attended all study activities.

Examining empathy subscales in adolescent students, the Affiliation for Multifaceted Empathy Scale (AMES) revealed distinctions between affective empathy and empathic concern. Furthermore, while physical aggression showed no correlation with cognitive empathy, it presented a negative association with both affective empathy and sympathy, underscoring the unique nature of cognitive empathy.

After calculating gain scores based on pretest and posttest empathy subscale scores, a two-way MANOVA was conducted to explore the effects of gender and film format on these scores. The results revealed significant gender-based differences in empathy subscale scores for students viewing films in computer-generated virtual reality (CVR) format.

The social sphere's influence may have impacted the study results, with prior research indicating that females consistently exhibit higher empathy, sympathy, and prosocial behaviors. Gender stereotypes and social influences contribute to the expectation of greater empathy in females.

It is important to note that this study adhered to the American Psychological Association ethics code for research on human subjects, with written informed assent from participants and informed consent from their parents or guardians. However, supporting data is not available for public sharing as participants did not provide written consent for its dissemination.
