The paper demonstrates how formal notations and models can be developed to account for the relationship between physical actions on devices and their effects on systems. It highlights the importance of considering physical feedback and the influence of physicality on formal models. The authors analyze commonly used artifacts to extract the tacit knowledge of successful designers, emphasizing the embodiment of natural interaction in well-designed devices.

The paper discusses the impact of physical feedback from devices on internal logical systems, as well as the resulting semantic feedback loop perceived by the user. It also addresses the complexity of user actions and their effects on different device states, as well as the challenges of representing bounce-back effects in standard state-transition networks.

Furthermore, the paper points out the immediate and direct semantic feedback in certain interactions, as well as the potential delays or hidden feedback in other cases. It also highlights the non-surjective n-to-m relationship between user actions and device states, considering transitions that may not be directly controllable by the user.

In addition, the paper introduces the concept of bounce-back transitions and the need to extend standard state-transition networks to represent these effects, exposing design issues such as the appropriate use of tension states.
