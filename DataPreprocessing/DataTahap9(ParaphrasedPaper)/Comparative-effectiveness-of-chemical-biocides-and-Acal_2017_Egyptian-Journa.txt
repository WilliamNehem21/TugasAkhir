The sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) is a fruit from the Rutaceae family that comes in varying sizes, colors, shapes, and fruit qualities. Its high nutritional and therapeutic value, including a high content of vitamin C, vitamin A, folate, and fiber, has contributed to its early acceptance in international trade despite its perishable nature. The use of red acalypha for its antimicrobial properties in treating bacterial and fungal infections has yet to be explored for its potential in preventing deterioration in sweet oranges. Additionally, there is a lack of comparative evaluation of its effectiveness with chemical biocides in preventing the activities of fungal deteriogens in sweet oranges.

In a study, lactophenol cotton blue stain was used to examine the mycelium of fungal colonies on glass slides. The extract of red acalypha leaves was prepared and used in the study, and various concentrations of the extract were impregnated onto sterile filter papers. The study found that a specific powdered fungal biocide derived from red acalypha was highly effective against a majority of the fungal deteriogens of sweet oranges, showing potential for field application.

The study identified prevalent deteriogens such as Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp., and Fusarium sp., and noted the high pathogenicity of Aspergillus niger among the fungal isolates. The research aimed to address the challenge of preserving sweet oranges for a longer period, particularly in developing countries with limited access to advanced harvesting and storage facilities. The study compared the effectiveness of selected chemical biocides and red acalypha extract against postharvest fungal deteriogens of sweet oranges for sustainable application.

The research did not receive specific funding from public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors, but the authors expressed gratitude to the Department of Biological Sciences, Osun State University, Osogbo, Nigeria for material support, as well as to Dr. W.F. Sule for proofreading the article.
