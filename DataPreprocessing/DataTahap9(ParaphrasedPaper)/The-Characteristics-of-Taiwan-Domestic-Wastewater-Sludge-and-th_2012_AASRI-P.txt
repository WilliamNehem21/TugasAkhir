The widespread use of municipal sewage systems results in the generation of a significant amount of domestic wastewater sludge, which poses an environmental challenge in terms of treatment and disposal. Although the sludge is nutrient-rich and is often utilized as a fertilizer or soil conditioner in many developed and developing countries, there is growing concern regarding the impact of heavy metals present in the sludge on crop growth and quality when it is reused on farmland for the cultivation of edible crops. This research aims to examine the heavy metal content and bond fractions in municipal sewage sludge and to assess the influence of applying the sludge as a soil additive on crop growth and quality through experimental crop growth trials. The study utilized sludge samples collected from wastewater treatment plants in Taichung Fu-Tien, Taiwan, which contained elevated concentrations of copper, zinc, nickel, and cadmium, exceeding the legal limits for farmland soil. The majority of copper was present in the organic bond fraction, zinc in the iron-manganese oxides bond fraction, nickel in the organic bond fraction, and cadmium in the iron-manganese oxides bond fraction. The results of three batches of plant growth experiments revealed that the growth of plants in the second batch was significantly suppressed, with the extent of influence increasing with higher ratios of sludge applied to the soil.

The municipal wastewater treatment system is a crucial infrastructure for treating domestic wastewater to safeguard the environment and the receiving body. However, it generates a considerable amount of biological wastewater sludge that must be appropriately managed to prevent secondary pollution issues. Many developed and developing nations opt to reuse sludge as fertilizer or soil conditioner, with approximately 60% in the UK and USA, and 53% in Europe. While this method is considered economical and facilitates resource recovery from the sludge, domestic wastewaters contain substantial levels of heavy metals, which pose risks for environmental contamination and potential harm to the food chain. The heavy metal concentrations in municipal wastewater sludge from Hong Kong's Tai Po region exceed the maximum allowable levels for use on farmland to grow edible crops. Notably, cadmium, despite having the lowest concentration among the metals, is the most readily absorbable by plants, and its use on farmland for growing edible crops is strictly regulated. Zinc, with the highest concentration among the metals, also exceeds the allowable maximum concentration for soil used to grow crops, posing risks to soil environmental and plant growth due to its bonding fractions. A similar situation is observed for copper, with 74% of it existing in the organic bond form in the soil, presenting potential risks to soil environment and plant growth.
