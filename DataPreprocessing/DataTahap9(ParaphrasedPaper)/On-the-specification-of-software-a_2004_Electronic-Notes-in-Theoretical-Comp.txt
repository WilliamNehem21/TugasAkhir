The challenge of adapting disparate software components with conflicting interaction behaviors is a fundamental issue in component-based software engineering. This paper aims to contribute to establishing a theoretical basis for software adaptation by providing a formal analysis of adaptor specifications and demonstrating their utility in enabling various forms of flexible adaptations.

The ability to easily adapt pre-existing software components to function effectively within new applications is essential for the advancement of a genuine component marketplace and the widespread deployment of components. Current component-oriented platforms utilize interface description languages (IDLs) to address software interoperability at the signature level.

A notable aspect of the approach presented in this paper is the straightforward notation used to express adaptor specifications, allowing for the clear articulation of desired adaptations through the definition of potential correspondences between the actions of the involved components. While adaptor specifications have been commonly used to address diverse instances of adaptation, a rigorous and precise characterization of these specifications had not been previously developed.

The primary objective of software adaptation is to deploy a specialized software component, referred to as an adaptor, which can serve as an intermediary between two components, P and Q, and facilitate their seamless interoperation. The concrete adaptor can be automatically generated based on the interfaces of the components and a specific adaptor specification, which consists of rules establishing correspondences between the actions of the two components.

Adaptor specifications can be employed to specify the desired adaptation between components with mismatching interaction behaviors. A systematic procedure described in the paper can automatically derive a concrete adaptor, if possible, by exhaustively attempting to construct a component that satisfies the given specification and enables the successful interoperation of the components.

Additionally, the methodology for software adaptation has been expanded to include soft adaptation, with the introduction of the concept of subservice, which acts as a partial surrogate of a service. Soft adaptation may result in a derived adaptor that deviates from the initial adaptor specification by potentially sub-servicing some services.

The paper also discusses the challenges encountered in manually adapting third-party components to suit different contexts and emphasizes the need to develop foundational aspects of component adaptation. Furthermore, it points out limitations in previous approaches, such as expressiveness constraints and the necessity for ex-machina arbitrators to control system evolutions.

In conclusion, the paper suggests potential areas for future research, including the consideration of data dependencies across different actions in adaptor specifications and the exploration of multi-party adaptations. It also acknowledges the support of various projects in enabling the work described in the paper.
