This paper presents an extension of Mignotte's modular secret sharing method to polynomial rings, which are Euclidean and allow for the use of the Chinese remainder theorem. It demonstrates that any access structure can be implemented within this modular framework and establishes limitations on the number of participants in such a secret sharing scheme when using moduli of the same degree. Furthermore, the paper calculates the information rate of the new scheme.

The concept of secret sharing, initially introduced by Shamir, involves dividing a secret value into shares so that only authorized subsets of shares can reconstruct it. Asmuth, Bloom, and Mignotte independently developed the modular approach based on the Chinese remainder theorem in the ring of integers. Asmuth and Bloom also suggested using Euclidean rings other than the ring of integers. All these methods deal with the threshold secret sharing, where any subset of no fewer than k out of t participants can compute the secret.

The proof of the limitation on the number of participants in the threshold secret sharing scheme is derived from a preceding lemma. In order to achieve arbitrary structures, as per Theorem 2.2, no more than 2t different pairwise coprime moduli are required for multiplications (corresponding to the number of all subsets of t participants).

Finally, the information rate of the constructed secret sharing scheme is estimated, defined as the ratio of the length of the secret to the maximal length of the share (in bits). The paper focuses on the significant case of q=2.

Future research will expand on this work. The authors have managed to complete this research after a conference, concluding that the polynomial modular scheme is ideal and perfect using the technique of Quisquater, Preneel, and Vanderwalle. These authors reevaluated the security of the modular scheme in the ring of integers and demonstrated that it is only asymptotically secure.
