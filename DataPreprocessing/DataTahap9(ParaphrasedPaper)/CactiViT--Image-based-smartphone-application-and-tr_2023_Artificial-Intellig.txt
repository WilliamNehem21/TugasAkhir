Certainly! Here's a paraphrased version of the academic paper:

In recent years, deep learning has led to significant progress in the identification of plant diseases using various methods. Beginning with the introduction of AlexNet, the first neural network architecture to surpass the support vector machine (SVM) as a machine learning model, numerous models have been developed and assessed using the public PlantVillage dataset. This involved storing and training the dataset using the Vit model, with regular updates sent to individual users' devices for improved accuracy. Additionally, the system includes a feature for acquiring and classifying new cactus photos, and a new dataset of images of cochineal-infested cacti was also provided. The proposed system has the potential to be a valuable tool for cactus farmers.

The paper is structured as follows: the first section provides a brief overview of the research; the second section describes the dataset, materials used, and the methodology employed; the third section details the experimental procedures; the fourth section presents the results with a discussion; and finally, conclusions are drawn in the last section.

To better understand the semantics in the data, techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) can be utilized to achieve superior results. While convolutional neural networks (CNN) focus on local pixel information, they may overlook crucial data when dealing with multi-feature scenarios, such as early-stage cochineal infestation on cacti with spiny rackets. Achieving high accuracy is crucial, particularly for early detection, and the lower accuracy on damaged, early-stage, and healthy cacti is attributed to shared features. Addressing such challenges is important, as the app needs to identify issues early to prevent disease spread.

For farmers, the app offers a straightforward processâ€”after logging in, they can simply take a picture and receive results. The major advantage of the mobile application is that it uses a serialized model of the original, allowing farmers to obtain results without an internet connection, as all processing is done directly on the phone.
