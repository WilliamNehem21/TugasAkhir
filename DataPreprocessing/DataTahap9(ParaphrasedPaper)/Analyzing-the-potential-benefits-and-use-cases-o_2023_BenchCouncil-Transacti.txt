As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance, more businesses are seeking ways to incorporate AI-led technologies into their operations. One technology that has gained traction among businesses worldwide is chatbots, which are automated systems equipped with natural language processing (NLP) algorithms that simulate conversations with humans to offer instant support and assistance to customers. A prominent chatbot, Chat-Generative Pre-trained (ChatGPT), is a large language model developed by OpenAI that holds potential benefits for businesses. Leveraging a large-scale language model called Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), which was initially introduced by OpenAI in 2018, ChatGPT was trained on a substantial corpus of text data using unsupervised learning techniques to understand the patterns and structures of natural language. Subsequently, ChatGPT was specifically designed to replicate human-like dialogues, drawing from a diverse dataset of online interactions to master the nuances of human language and generate high-quality responses across various queries.

The paper emphasizes the potential advantages of integrating ChatGPT into business operations, particularly in terms of enhancing customer experience (ECE) and facilitating greater human-computer collaboration (GHC). To provide a more comprehensive understanding, the paper introduces the use of the PSI and COPRAS methodologies for prioritizing the potential benefits and use cases of ChatGPT. By giving an in-depth explanation of these approaches, the paper aims to elucidate their functionality, application to the context of ChatGPT, and their contribution to the analysis. Highlighting the strengths of these methodologies would bolster the rationale behind their selection and enhance the clarity and detail of the methodology employed.

The remainder of the paper consists of a detailed literature review and research methodology in sections 2 and 3, respectively. Section 4 presents data analysis and results, followed by a discussion of findings in section 5, along with the implications of the study. Section 6 outlines the conclusions, limitations, and future scope of the research.

An analytical approach for prioritization, the PSI method, developed by Zavadskas and Kaklauskas in 1996, is introduced for comparing alternatives and determining superiority. On the other hand, the COPRAS method is employed to rank and assess choices in descending order based on their importance and utility. The steps outlined in the COPRAS method involve calculating the relative significance measure and the utility value of each option, allowing for the comprehensive ranking of competing alternatives based on their utility ratings.

The study underscores the importance of ChatGPT in boosting business operations through enhanced customer service, multitasking capability, and operational cost savings. It also emphasizes the need for thorough analysis before integrating ChatGPT into enterprises, considering factors such as domain-specific training data and potential errors in outcomes. By utilizing the PSI and COPRAS methodologies, the study provides a structured approach for evaluating the benefits of ChatGPT deployment by drawing on existing literature on chatbots, massive language models, and artificial intelligence to identify potential deployment areas.

The study also acknowledges several limitations, such as the omission of potential difficulties that may arise during the implementation of ChatGPT in business processes, the absence of a complete cost-benefit analysis of ChatGPT implementation, and the oversight of potential risks associated with using ChatGPT to automate customer support.

Finally, the study declares that all authors have contributed significantly to the manuscript and have consented to its submission for publication.
