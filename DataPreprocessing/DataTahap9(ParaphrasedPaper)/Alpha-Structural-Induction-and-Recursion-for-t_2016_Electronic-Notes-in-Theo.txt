Inductive types can be defined in the typical manner by listing their constructors, but they can also be parameterized by objects of other types. This characteristic allows type theory to incorporate families of types that depend on a base type, commonly referred to as dependent types.

This feature enables type theory to be viewed as a form of constructive logic. More specifically, this is accomplished by representing propositions as inductive types, with their constructors serving as the introduction rules, or direct proof methods, for the respective propositions.
