The latter part of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a summary of related existing work. Section 3 presents an overview of perturbation techniques. The metrics used for privacy and utility analysis are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 describes the proposed approaches nos2r and nos2r2. Section 6 includes experimental analysis and comparative performance evaluation. In the final section, the research is concluded.

The paper introduces a method for dispersing the burden of privacy preservation across a distributed ecosystem with resource-constrained devices and high-performance computers, exploiting the asymmetry of resources. However, it is noted that this method is limited to horizontally partitioned data and may not maintain the trade-off between utility and privacy for vertically partitioned data.

For sensitive data mining, Paul et al. proposed a data perturbation method called nrorem, which involves four stages: normalization, geometric rotation, linear regression, and scalar multiplication. The exploratory study of privacy protection, attack resistance, information entropy analysis, data utility, and error analysis indicates that nrorem effectively protects individual privacy and data utility. However, the use of scalar multiplication for enhanced privacy may alter the data set size, leading to decreased utility in some cases.

A method based on distance matrix is proposed for securing commonly shared comparable data among multiple organizations, particularly when data is limited within each organization and substantial data bias exists. This method robustly integrates dispersed data of similar quality and can be employed with noise-corrupted data while still allowing the calculation of statistics of the original data, thus necessitating a more robust privacy protection method.

A Bayesian-based privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) approach for classification is introduced, which provides algorithm-independent data perturbation allowing the use of perturbed data by traditional classification methods. Additionally, a semi-supervised privacy-preserving clustering approach is proposed, which learns a large margin nearest cluster metric and applies multiplicative perturbation on the original data to protect privacy while ensuring good data usability.

Existing methods for privacy preservation often struggle to balance privacy and utility, and a trade-off between the two has been observed. The proposed approaches in this paper use a combination of normalization and different transformations, with normalization aiding in maintaining the balance between privacy and utility.

The perturbation approaches are typically evaluated using privacy and data utility metrics. Effective perturbation strategies aim to protect privacy while maintaining data utility. In this study, different criteria were used to quantify data utility and privacy.

We evaluated the privacy-preserving performance of nos2r and nos2r2 using specific metrics and determined their effectiveness in preserving privacy against attacks. Our results indicate that both nos2r and nos2r2 offer better privacy across all data sets compared to existing methods.

Additionally, the attack resistance of nos2r and nos2r2 against independent component analysis (ICA) attacks was evaluated. Our analysis reveals that nos2r offers higher resistance against ICA attacks than existing methods, and nos2r2 demonstrates greater resistance than nos2r as well as other methods.

Our proposed nos2r and nos2r2 perturbation approaches offer increased privacy compared to existing methods across different datasets. Furthermore, the accuracy of nos2r and nos2r2 compared to the original data is significantly closer than that of existing methods, demonstrating their effectiveness in maintaining data utility while preserving individual privacy.

In conclusion, our proposed perturbation approaches, nos2r and nos2r2, achieve a significant increase in privacy and maintain data utility to a larger extent compared to existing methods. The work presented in this paper can be extended to include feature reduction in multiparty clustering scenarios.
