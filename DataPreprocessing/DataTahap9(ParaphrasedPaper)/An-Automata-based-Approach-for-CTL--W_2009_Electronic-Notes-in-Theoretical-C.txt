In model-checking, temporal logics are commonly used to specify properties on symbolic representations of computing systems. The basic elements of these logics typically consist of propositional variables, whose truth value is determined by the states of the symbolic system. While this enables the specification of properties on these states, it does not address the data utilized in some models such as clocks, counters, and strings. To address this limitation, various expansions of the linear-time logic (LTL) incorporating constraints on the data have been explored in existing literature [19, 2, 14]. However, comparatively less is known about their branching-time extensions.

For instance, there are various approaches to establishing symbolic valuation abstractions, with the region abstraction of timed automata being a well-known example. Numerous studies on extensions of LTL across concrete domains also lean on symbolic valuation abstractions [2, 7, 3], wherein the symbolic valuations are often characterized by sets of constraints.
