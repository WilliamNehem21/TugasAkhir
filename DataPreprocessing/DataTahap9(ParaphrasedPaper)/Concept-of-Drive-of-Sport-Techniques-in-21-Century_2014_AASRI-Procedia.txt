Title: Enhanced Control of Variable Transmission Systems for Modern Sports Techniques

The modern sports techniques, such as cars, motorcycles, and bicycles, are propelled using transmissions with a controlled variable transfer ratio, enabling variable speed of movement depending on external loading. These modern transmissions typically feature a step transfer ratio with 45 steps, each characterized by a constant transfer ratio, with the speed of movement regulated by changes in engine power. Achieving maximum speed of movement requires optimal control of step switching and engine power adjustments.

However, control of step switching, whether manual or automatic, does not always yield the best results. The timing of switching steps may lag or advance the optimum time depending on the controlled power of the engine. Consequently, achieving maximum speed of movement depends significantly on the individual abilities of the driver, and even significant practical experience may not guarantee the best results.

While tooth gearing is reliable and durable, it does not provide stepless transfer. Automatic gearboxes, which offer only automatic switching of steps, are not optimal and are heavy and bulky, making them unsuitable for installation on motorcycles or bicycles.

Further research has demonstrated that an adaptive gear transmission in the form of a gear differential mechanism with a closed contour provides the best control variant for sports transport, with the adaptive tooth gearing continuously adjusting vehicle speed to movement resistance without the need for a control system. This automatic adjustment leads to the achievement of maximum speed of movement, eliminating subjective factors and providing an ideal conformity to a variable mode of movement.
