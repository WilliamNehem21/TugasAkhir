Fungal keratitis, a significant cause of severe eye complications and vision loss, is prevalent globally but more frequently found in tropical and subtropical areas. In Egypt, there has been a reported increase in the incidence of fungal keratitis, which appears to be associated with changes in climate such as higher minimum temperatures and increased atmospheric humidity.

In developing nations, the microscopic examination of corneal scrapings is the most crucial and rapid method for identifying fungal elements. As a result, there is a demand for a staining technique that is quick, easy to perform, and highly sensitive for diagnosing fungal keratitis in clinical settings.

Methylene blue (MB) is a commonly used dye and biological staining agent in medical facilities. It has been proven effective in detecting various medical conditions, including gonococci, early cancer cells, and metastasized cancer cells in lymph nodes. A study investigating the efficacy of MB for diagnosing fungal keratitis found it to be a rapid and effective method for early diagnosis. This study aims to confirm the effectiveness of MB staining for the rapid detection of fungal keratitis and to compare its positive rates, sensitivity, and specificity with those of a 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH)-based smear and calcofluor white (CW).

Upon confirmation of fungal filaments in corneal scrapings through microscopic examination, all cases were promptly initiated on topical therapy with amphotericin B at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. The amphotericin B solution, prepared from the intravenous formulation (Fungizone, Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY) diluted in distilled water, was applied as hourly drops for one week, followed by every two hours for three weeks, and then adjusted based on the keratitis activity until the ulcers resolved. In cases where patients did not respond to medical therapy, additional surgical procedures, such as therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (PK), anterior chamber wash with amphotericin B, or evisceration, were considered.
