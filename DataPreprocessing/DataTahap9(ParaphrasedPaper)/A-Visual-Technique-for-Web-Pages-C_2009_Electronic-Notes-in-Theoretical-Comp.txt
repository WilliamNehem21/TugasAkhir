The quantification of visual similarity between web pages has the potential to enable querying of a document database using a documental pattern as the query. The response to such a query could identify the most visually similar document in the database or the most similar document from a predefined set, which could be utilized for classification purposes. Additionally, the significance of visual features of web pages is increasingly relevant in the context of search engine optimization.

The proposed methodology for visual comparison involves segmenting a web page image into multiple regions through image processing and representing the result as a graph. Similarity is then evaluated using a graph matching algorithm, without considering structure based on the tags. The paper also outlines a method for compressing web pages and defines a measure of similarity between two web pages based on the tree edit distance algorithm.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background information and introduces web page descriptions, while Section 3 presents a transformation of HTML code to obtain a clear visual structure of a web page. Section 4 introduces a compression technique for web pages, which combines repetitive structures and shrinks non-visually influential chains of tags. Furthermore, Section 5 defines a measure of similarity between web pages based on the tree edit distance algorithm, and Section 6 describes the main features of a prototypical implementation. Finally, Section 7 concludes and discusses avenues for future work.

The visual structure of a web page is more discernible to users compared to the underlying HTML code. However, different segments of HTML code can convey the same visual impression. The importance of considering the visual effect of HTML tags for accurate comparison between web pages is highlighted.

In Section 3.1, an abstraction of web pages is presented, which translates each web page to a canonical representative based on its visual structure. Two compression functions, horizontal compression (hrz) and vertical compression (vrt), are introduced to drastically reduce the size of individual web pages by packing together repetitive structures and shrinking non-visually influential chains of tags. Marked terms and their representations are also discussed for compression purposes.

In Definition 4.5, conditions for preserving or disregarding repetitions, as well as maintaining information of the term, are outlined. Operators for horizontal and vertical compression are described, and a general operator for overall compression of a term is defined.

Finally, a quantitative measure of similarity between two web pages is assigned in Definition 5.2, providing a real number between 0 and 1. The choice of cost values for single operations in the tree edit distance algorithm is also discussed, with identical cost assigned to insertion, deletion, and relabeling. The mixture of semantic content, page structure, and layout in HTML presents a challenge for web page comparison, which has implications ranging from search engines to web data mining.

The proposed approach is described in context of "Document Page Similarity Based on Layout Visual Saliency: Application to Query by Example and Document Classification" by V. Eglin and S. Bres at the Seventh International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR '03) in 2003.
