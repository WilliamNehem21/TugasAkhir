The human brain, located in the cranial cavity, consists of the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum, which are partially separated by the cerebral falx and the cerebellar tentorium. The intracranial space is divided into the supratentorial space and the infratentorial space by the tentorium. The falx is often used to represent the intact mid-sagittal plane, and the cerebral hemispheres connect at the subfalcine space. The tentorial incisura, an opening at the center of the tentorium, provides the only communication between the supratentorial space and the infratentorial space, with the midbrain occupying the middle incisural space.

Previous methods have been proposed for automatically measuring midline shift using symmetry-based and landmark-based methods, which were clinically verified. However, there is currently no biomechanical model dedicated to simulating brain herniation in the literature. This study aims to develop a simple 3-dimensional geometric model based on computed tomographic images of patients to simulate brain deformation, particularly brain herniation occurring at the supratentorial space caused by a supratentorial intracranial mass.

Each computed tomography (CT) image used in this study had a size of 512x512 pixels, resulting in a resolution of 0.49 mm per pixel. To rule out the diagnosis of intracranial hematoma, the original CT density values were transformed to 8-bit gray values in a specific value range. A global gray level histogram was obtained for each CT data set, and pixels with bone density in all CT slices were automatically tagged using a threshold derived from the histogram.

An algorithm was developed to automatically differentiate intracranial regions from extracranial ones. However, it was challenging to separate the supratentorial space from the infratentorial space within the intracranial space due to the thin and similar gray levels of the cerebellar tentorium. Therefore, the boundary between the supratentorial space and the infratentorial space was manually labeled, as well as the regions on the computer screen.

Using the planimetry method, the volume of a given region was calculated as its area multiplied by the slice thickness. The total intracranial volume, the volume of the supratentorial space, and the volume of the infratentorial space of each patient were measured. The sizes of the subfalcine space and the tentorial incisura, as well as the dimensions of the midbrain, were also measured.

Based on craniometric data, a simple model of the supratentorial space was constructed. The model assumes the shape of the upper half of a sphere with specific dimensions. The volume and dimensions of this model were compared to previously measured craniometric data.

The study found a correlation between the volumes of the supratentorial space and the infratentorial space and the intracranial volume. There were observed variations in these volumes based on the gender and individual characteristics of the patients. The study also did not find any relationship between the degree of gantry tilt and the variables measured. Based on these findings, the constructed model was considered applicable to most patients.
