After 24 hours of exposure, mortality rates of 0.228-0.378% and 0.161-0.630% were observed. The initial report from this investigation indicated that the rapid biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles using A. nilagirica leaf filtrate could serve as an effective and environmentally friendly larvicide for controlling mosquito populations during their developmental stages. 

Although various methods such as the use of Knema attenuata, Acalypha alnifolia, microbial insecticide Metarhizium anisopliae, essential oils, and nereistoxin from marine annelid Lumbriconereis heteropoda have been employed to combat adult and developmental stages of Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex mosquitoes, these treatments have demonstrated limitations such as lower efficacy, development of resistance, chronic effects on non-target organisms, and long-term residual accumulation in the environment, leading to ecological imbalances and harm to animals and humans. Hence, there continues to be a pressing need for the development of biologically active larvicides from natural products that are biodegradable.

The vectors used in this study were obtained and reared as per the methods described by Sundaravadivelan et al. They were collected from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Mettupalayam, Coimbatore, and were maintained in laboratory enamel trays containing distilled water at room temperature.

Fresh and healthy leaves of A. nilagirica were collected near the UPASI Tea Research Institute, Valparai, Coimbatore, and identified by Prof. R. Gopalan from the Department of Botany at Karpagam University, Coimbatore. The leaves were washed and filtered to obtain an aqueous leaf extract, which was considered as a 1% stock solution. From this stock solution, concentrations ranging from 0.2% to 1.0% were prepared for effective bioassay.

At an initial concentration of 0.25%, which was the aqueous leaf extract treatment alone, only 52% pupa mortality was observed after 24 hours of exposure. Conversely, no mortality was observed in the control group, and the chi-square value was found to be significant at p < 0.05.

Several researchers have investigated the control of human vector populations using botanicals, including leaf extracts, essential oils, isolated compounds, and, more recently, synthesized silver nanoparticles. In this study, silver nanoparticles synthesized using the aqueous leaf filtrate of A. nilagirica were evaluated for their bioactivity against larvae and pupae of two vector species, Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti. The rapid color change from pale yellow to brown within 60 minutes in the reaction mixture strongly indicates the formation of biosilver due to effective reduction with active compounds.

With reference to Sintubin et al., silver nanoparticles synthesized from plants, algae, yeasts, fungi, and bacteria possess varied sizes and shapes. Similarly, the morphology of phyto-synthesized silver nanoparticles was examined using scanning electron microscopy, which revealed that the particles were relatively spherical to irregular in shape, indicating uniform distribution in colloidal form.
