In recent years, the fields of software, system, and enterprise architecture have become established disciplines in industry and academia. Architecture models play a crucial role in facilitating communication among various stakeholders and enhancing the understanding of complex systems. Part of this understanding involves the ability to derive new knowledge from these models, such as the ability to analyze them. For example, by examining an architecture model encompassing enterprise services and their relationships, one can infer potential interoperability issues, such as a protocol mismatch, even if these issues are not explicitly stated in the model.

This paper builds upon previous research in architecture analysis, focusing on the formalism based on Bayesian statistics for analyzing architecture models. This approach enables the analysis of various system properties, including interoperability, information security, and software system availability. Specifically, this paper utilizes enterprise service interoperability analysis as a case study.

The paper discusses the need to define the joint distribution and respective conditional probabilities in order to specify the architecture model. Utilizing Bayesian networks allows for addressing questions such as the probability of a variable being in a certain state given other variables' values.

The concept of abstract models is introduced as a framework for specifying the information required to conduct analyses of different variables. Once the relevant information is gathered, it is instantiated into concrete models.

Services are described as independent building blocks representing an application environment, each responsible for its domain and limited in scope to support specific business functions. The quality of services is influenced by attributes such as correctness and availability, which are specified in service descriptions. Additionally, services utilize a service bus as a communication medium for managing message and transaction traffic, and service orchestration descriptions control the interaction of services.

The paper emphasizes the importance of analyzing service clusters in terms of their interoperability, which is measured based on various factors such as service protocol compatibility, service bus compatibility, and service orchestration language compatibility.

The challenge of collecting evidence for a large number of attributes in a concrete model is discussed. The authors propose a strategy for cost-effective evidence collection, suggesting that it is not necessary to collect all evidence and instead accept a level of uncertainty in assessment results.

The paper also outlines a practical problem associated with collecting a large number of pieces of evidence, addressing the cost of evidence collection. A strategy for determining which piece of evidence to collect next is proposed to minimize evidence collection cost and maximize the diagnostic value of the collected information.

An example implemented in Genie demonstrates the potential of the diagnosis algorithm in reducing the cost of data collection and thus lowering the overall cost of performing system quality analyses.
