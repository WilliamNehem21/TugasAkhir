Cancer-related illness and death present a significant concern in healthcare. Developing effective, non-toxic, sustainable, and affordable anti-cancer treatments is an important aspect of alternative medicine. In this research, we investigated an aqueous natural extracts mixture (NE mix) made from common spices turmeric, ginger, and garlic for its ability to scavenge free radicals and its anti-cancer properties against human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, ZR-75, and MDA-MB 231). We conducted a qualitative analysis of the bioactive constituents from turmeric, ginger, and garlic using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). To the best of our knowledge, the anti-cancer potential of NE mix, with and without tamoxifen, has not been previously tested. Our results showed that NE mix induced apoptosis in all breast cancer cell lines, with a more significant effect observed in MCF-7 and ZR-75 cell lines compared to MDA-MB 231. The extent of apoptosis due to combined treatment with NE mix and tamoxifen was higher than with tamoxifen alone, suggesting a potential role of NE mix in sensitizing the estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells to tamoxifen. Our data, supported by MTT assay and cell cycle analysis, as well as RT-PCR results, demonstrate that the NE mix, tamoxifen, and the combination of NE mix and tamoxifen altered the expression of apoptotic markers (p53 and caspase 9), ultimately leading to apoptosis in all three cell lines. This suggests that our NE mixture could be a potential alternative therapeutic approach for certain types of cancer.

Breast cancer is a significant global health issue, particularly affecting women, with its incidence on the rise in countries such as India, Japan, and other Asian countries. Even in Western countries where the incidence rate of breast cancer is stable or declining, it continues to contribute significantly to cancer-related morbidity and mortality. This rising incidence in younger (premenopausal) women worldwide underscores the need for developing alternative preventive and intervention strategies for breast cancer.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is believed to play a crucial role in preventing tumor development, primarily through initiating apoptosis. Studies have shown that loss of p53 activity accelerates tumor formation, and the mutation status of p53 determines its activity in different stress-induced signaling pathways. Given the low mutation rate of p53 in breast cancer compared to other solid tumors, understanding its role and integrity is essential in developing effective intervention strategies.

In our study, we employed acetonitrile, formic acid, and methanol of suitable grades for our analytical procedures. We measured the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of the different plant extract fractions using the fenton reaction. Our findings suggest that the aqueous natural extracts of turmeric, ginger, and garlic, which are commonly used in Indian cuisine and have been a part of traditional Indian medicine, have the potential to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, our study indicates that these extracts may sensitize cancer cells to hormone therapy drugs such as tamoxifen, highlighting the possibility of developing natural extracts to target breast cancer while also providing insights into their mechanism of action.

In conclusion, our research findings suggest that the aqueous natural extracts mixture can induce apoptosis and reduce the proliferation of breast cancer cells, possibly sensitizing them to tamoxifen. This opens up the possibility of developing natural extracts as potential treatments for breast cancer and warrants further investigation into their specific mechanisms of action.
