In this research, a study was conducted on a group of 14 rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and a group of 7 rats fed a control diet. After eight weeks, half of the rats from the HFD group were switched to a niacin-supplemented diet (HFND) while the rest continued on the HFD for an additional 6 weeks. The results revealed that obese rats fed the HFD exhibited a significant increase in body weight, reduced glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, heightened adiposity, and altered lipid profile compared to the control group. However, rats supplemented with niacin showed reduced weight gain and body weight despite no significant difference in food intake. They also showed improved glucose control and insulin sensitivity, as indicated by lower area under curve (AUC) values for glucose curves, and their plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels returned towards control values. These findings suggest that niacin has a beneficial effect on adiposity, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, plasma lipids, and specifically modulates the level of serum adiponectin under obese conditions.

Obesity involves an excessive increase in adipose tissue mass, with the adipose tissue secreting various bioactive substances known as adipocytokines. Adiponectin is the most abundant of these and is known for its anti-inflammatory, antiatherogenic, and insulin-sensitizing properties. It plays a crucial role in regulating metabolic processes such as glucose regulation and fatty acid oxidation, and in suppressing metabolic derangements that lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

The obese group had significantly higher plasma cholesterol levels than the control rats, while niacin-supplemented rats showed a significant decrease in cholesterol concentration compared to HFD-induced obese rats. Obese rats also had significantly elevated triglyceride levels compared to normal rats, and niacin supplementation did not attenuate the development of hypertriglyceridemia. Additionally, HFD-fed obese rats exhibited a significant increase in LDL concentration compared to control rats, but niacin treatment modestly improved glucose control by lowering the cumulative AUC during oral glucose tolerance test in a rodent model of obesity and T2DM. However, conflicting results were observed between studies involving obese and non-obese subjects, suggesting that responses to niacin treatment may depend on specific pathophysiological conditions.

Niacin supplementation was found to enhance insulin sensitivity in obese rats, leading to increased glucose tolerance and reduced plasma insulin concentration, likely due to improved insulin sensitivity and a lower degree of disorder of lipid metabolism. Dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and increased LDL, typically precedes glucose intolerance and decreased insulin sensitivity. Controlling dyslipidemia with niacin therefore appears to be an attractive target for addressing the metabolic deficits resulting from adverse hormonal effects of adipose tissue, thereby restoring insulin sensitivity and achieving glucose homeostasis under obese conditions.

Furthermore, in this study, niacin supplementation significantly increased the serum adiponectin levels in HFD-induced obese rats, suggesting that the improvements in glucose control and insulin sensitivity attributed to niacin may partly result from the alteration of adiponectin signaling. Adiponectin is known to exert insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic actions, and there is a negative correlation between various hormones associated with insulin resistance and obesity, and adiponectin secretion. Therefore, niacin may indirectly moderate insulin secretion via its effect on adiponectin.
