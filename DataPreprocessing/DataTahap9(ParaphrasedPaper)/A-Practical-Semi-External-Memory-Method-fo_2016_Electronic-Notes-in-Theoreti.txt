The suffix tree is a foundational data structure for text indexing, but its high space consumption makes it impractical for indexing large strings. The suffix array, on the other hand, is a space-efficient alternative that has been widely used to address string processing problems effectively in terms of both time and space. 

An extension of the suffix array through direct comparisons has proven to be highly effective. This approach makes more efficient use of computer resources, particularly with regard to cache memory, due to its improved locality of reference compared to the classical variation based on range minimum queries (RMQs). 

The LV dmin variation, which is enhanced with information about longest common prefixes (LCPs), employs direct comparisons only when the distance in the suffix array between the suffixes pl[i]+1 and ti+l[i]+1 is sufficiently large (as close suffixes tend to share more symbols). Otherwise, it uses a linear scan to find the minimum LCP value between these two suffixes, eliminating the need for RMQs in this variation.

In the experiments, each pattern of length 50 was randomly selected from the text and the experiment was executed three times with the lowest wall clock time chosen. Detailed statistical analyses were not performed, as the time differences between the Landau-Vishkin variations were orders of magnitude apart. Errors in the set{0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 20} were considered, and prefix files from the corpora were also included. Memory usage was measured using the malloc count 9 tool.

Potential improvements to the semi-external memory method include representing the alphabet in a more concise way, such as using only 2 bits per symbol for a DNA alphabet instead of a full byte, or employing bit packing to perform multiple comparisons at once when packing several symbols under a single integer. Compressing texts while maintaining random access to them could also be beneficial for manipulating large texts that exceed the capacity of main memory.
