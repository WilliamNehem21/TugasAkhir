In the context of a left-skew closed category (c, i, ()) and a lax closed monad t on c, it is equivalent to asserting that t is both left-strong and right-strong, with the left-strength cst and right-strength cstr forming a bi-strength and obeying commutation. Furthermore, given that t is left-strong, the composition b(t c) should be equivalent to b (t c). Specifically, if (c, i, ()) is left-normal, then by extension, (kl(t), i, (t)) is also left-skew closed. 

However, it was attempted to demonstrate in example 4.7 that the left-skew closed category (kl(t), i, (t)) with the property b(t c) = b (t c) was normal, based on the assumptions made in example 3.5, but this line of reasoning was not successful.
