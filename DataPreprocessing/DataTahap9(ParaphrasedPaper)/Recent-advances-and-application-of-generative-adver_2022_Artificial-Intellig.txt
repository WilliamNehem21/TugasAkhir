An increasing body of research indicates that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods are becoming integral in the drug discovery and design process. Advanced deep learning algorithms, developed in response to recent advancements in computer technology, are playing a key role in creating therapeutically relevant medications for various medical conditions. This review focuses on recent developments in using generative deep learning techniques, such as generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks, for drug design and discovery. Specifically, it explores the application of GAN methodologies in molecular de novo design, dimension reduction of single-cell data in preclinical stages, as well as de novo peptide and protein creation. The review also discusses the limitations of past research in this area and offers insights into future research prospects and challenges.

The use of deep learning algorithms, which have a wide range of applications in drug design and discovery, requires advanced computer technologies such as general-purpose computing on graphics processing units. These technologies are crucial for addressing the complex challenges faced in drug development. Various applications of deep learning frameworks in drug design and discovery, including molecular de novo design, dimension reduction of single-cell data, compound property and activity prediction, reaction analysis, synthesis prediction, and biological image analysis, have been highlighted.

Machine learning models, designed to mimic the human mind by learning from the environment and experiences, aim to minimize learning errors using algorithms such as gradient descent and backpropagation. These models are applied in diverse fields such as computer vision, entertainment, spacecraft engineering, finance, and computational biology.

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) draw inspiration from deep Boltzmann machines, utilizing two distinct processes â€“ a positive phase to load data and a negative phase to draw and make samples less likely. GANs aim to iteratively train the model to generate samples closer to the distribution the model represents. The GAN's discriminator distinguishes real and fake data, providing feedback to the generator to improve the generated data until convergence is achieved.

The evolution of GAN architectures, such as the introduction of Laplacian GAN (LAPGAN) and Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN), has enabled the generation of high-resolution images and faster convergence. SAGAN's attention-driven approach allows it to generate data with details across the entire high-resolution feature map, improving performance with the ImageNet dataset.

While GANs offer significant benefits in drug discovery, there are challenges related to exploring chemical space. Research is focusing on innovative solutions, such as fully quantum GANs, to address these limitations. Additionally, approaches like GCWGAN (Guided Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network) are being explored for peptide folding applications.

Using adaptive training data and recombination techniques, GANs can counteract decline in new molecule generation during training, enhancing molecule discovery for drug development. GANs have also been utilized for protein similarity and simile identification through convolutional regression models, enabling sample classification and feature extraction.

Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) models have been applied for de novo designing target-specific compounds, leveraging a combination of fingerprints and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to generate potential target-specific compounds.

However, challenges such as instability in optimizing discriminator and generator simultaneously, and mode collapse limiting the diversity of generated outcomes, need to be addressed. Moreover, completing data frameworks and ensuring reproducibility and transparency in computational drug discovery are critical for the advancement of this field.

The use of open-source implementations and common workflow language, in combination with public computing infrastructures, can improve the transparency and reproducibility of drug discovery research. Integrating workflow systems with container and virtual machine infrastructure can also enhance repeatability and service delivery in drug discovery.

As drug discovery increasingly relies on AI and ML methods, addressing these challenges will be crucial for advancing the field and ensuring the reproducibility and reliability of research findings.
