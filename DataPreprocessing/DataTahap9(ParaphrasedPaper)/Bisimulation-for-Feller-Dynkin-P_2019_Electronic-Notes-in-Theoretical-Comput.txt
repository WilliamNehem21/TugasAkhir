This study aims to develop a comprehensive theory of bisimulation for stochastic systems with continuous-time evolution. The focus is specifically on fellerdynkin processes, a class of systems with well-established mathematical foundations and which represent the most general form of markov processes operating on continuous state spaces with continuous time evolution. These systems encompass various forms of brownian motion.

In the system under consideration, there are two atomic propositions (referred to as p and q on the diagram) that are satisfied by the final state of certain branches. The process involves moving at a constant speed to the right and, upon reaching a fork, it moves to either branch with a 50% probability and stops upon encountering an atomic proposition.

The study demonstrates that this is the most significant bisimulation by examining two different states, x and y. Similar to the method used for standard brownian motion, the cases where x=0 (and y≠ 0) or y=0 (and x≠ 0) can be ruled out by examining the function obs.

Furthermore, the study explores the concept of fixed-point metrics obtained from certain operators on jump processes as described in existing literature. It is noted that some details in the referenced work may be inaccurate, and the intention is to rectify these issues and adapt similar ideas to the present framework.
