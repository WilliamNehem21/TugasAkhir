The concept of open science has been leveraged to create numerous chemoinformatics applications and advancements, including educational resources and research tools. Undoubtedly, fostering a more inclusive approach to science would enhance global connections between research teams and students across all academic levels. Being aware of studies conducted in various locations around the world would facilitate easier linkages between different geographical regions. To this end, our Latin American group presented a perspective on chemical informatics in 2018. Additionally, computational studies extend beyond chemoinformatics to encompass tools related to pharmacoinformatics, molecular dynamics, and biophysics. While web servers and tools in chemoinformatics are primarily tailored for drug discovery and lead candidate development, they can also be applied to other research areas, as discussed in Section 2.1.

Moreover, there is a need to predict the macroscopic pKa of compounds as well as the pKa of various microstates to forecast experimental observables. However, predictive techniques utilizing machine learning approaches were not feasible due to the absence of experimental values of microstates. Submissions for this purpose predominantly came from the physical category based on first-principles methods, although some also conducted conformational analysis using open chemoinformatics tools such as open babel. Notably, Latin American groups achieved excellent performance, with one group obtaining the second best-ranked submission.

While some research groups in Latin America are well established, in-person or hybrid meetings, which are also beneficial, could be organized and funded through collaborations within the region. Such interactions could lead to the formation of consortia capable of undertaking multi-center projects in Latin America, thereby garnering the interest of financing agencies, whether public or private. Furthermore, the advantages of online and live conferences and webinars have made it increasingly convenient to host meetings and conferences, saving time and reducing organizational and attendance costs. Additionally, continued involvement in editorial boards of peer-reviewed publications is advantageous. Currently, several Latin American researchers are actively participating in the editorial boards of journals such as the Journal of Chemoinformatics, Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, and eLife. Moreover, there is a growing trend among some scientific publishers to include early career researchers in review boards, offering opportunities for scientists in Latin America to contribute to editorial boards where their representation is currently limited.
