This academic paper discusses the current state of educational virtual reality (VR), with a focus on its application in the cultural heritage sector and the introduction of the concept of "sense of presence." The authors describe their experience in developing a VR application, outlining the requirements, overall structure, main components, and control conditions. They also discuss the questionnaire designed to evaluate the VR experience and the feedback received. The paper presents the results of the experiments, draws conclusions, and suggests future research directions.

The authors compare the embodied cognition theory to previous theories, emphasizing the role of the body in learning. They discuss how the VR experience in their work is based on the constructivist theory, emphasizing the sensory feedback provided to the user.

The paper also delves into the definitions of immersion and sense of presence, and how these concepts are measured in VR experiences. It highlights the need to prevent cybersickness and the strategies employed to minimize its effects. The paper presents the findings of the study, including the impact of the VR experience on learning outcomes and the sense of presence.

The study's methodology is described, including the experimental design and the use of different conditions for the study participants. The paper concludes by discussing the limitations of the study and suggesting potential future research directions, such as expanding the sample size, assessing the application in diverse settings, and exploring different modes of interaction in VR.

In summary, the paper provides insights into the development and evaluation of a VR application for educational purposes, highlighting its potential benefits and areas for further exploration.
