Cities are increasingly relying on automated cyber-physical infrastructures to supply power, water, and gas. Given the critical dependence of society on these infrastructures, it is important to pay more attention to assessing their survivability. This paper provides an overview of the survivability assessment of cyber-physical infrastructures, focusing on gas, water, and electricity infrastructures. It also discusses recent modeling and evaluation approaches and the challenges associated with them.

The concept of survivability, which is not limited to infrastructural systems, is found in various domains such as military devices and agriculture. The literature offers diverse definitions of survivability, emphasizing aspects like fault detection, defense against attacks, and recovery from disasters. This paper focuses on the behavior of a system after a disaster has occurred and presents a slightly generalized version of the existing definition, acknowledging the complexities involved in assessing survivability.

Various approaches have been proposed in the literature for quantitatively determining the survivability of infrastructures, most of which are model-based. These approaches suggest measures for evaluating system behavior and its evolution following a disaster, with the choice of an appropriate measure being left to the evaluator.

The paper highlights that survivability addresses the evolution of the system after a disaster and does not necessarily include the process leading to the disaster. This is advantageous as establishing the exact occurrence process and probabilities is often challenging. The paper distinguishes between "good models" for survivability, which are for given occurrences of disasters, and "rude models," in which disaster occurrences are explicitly modeled.

The paper compares and contrasts different modeling and evaluation approaches for gas, water, and electricity infrastructures, including a hybrid Petri net-based approach to address scalability issues. It also discusses the use of stochastic time logic for computing complex measures over time and presents specific examples, such as the modeling of a real waste water treatment facility and the transient behavior of a gas distribution network.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the assessment of power grid survivability and the application of different modeling and evaluation approaches in the context of power systems reliability. It also mentions the integration of demand response with failure recovery to improve reliability and reduce energy not supplied after a failure.

Overall, the paper emphasizes the importance of assessing the survivability of cyber-physical infrastructures and provides insights into various modeling and evaluation approaches for different types of infrastructures.
