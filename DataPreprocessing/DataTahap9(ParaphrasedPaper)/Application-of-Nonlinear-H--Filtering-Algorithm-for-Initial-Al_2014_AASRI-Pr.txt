The discrepancy in positioning accuracy within navigation systems is known as posture error, which pertains to the angular misalignment between the platform coordinate system and the navigation coordinate system. In an inertial navigation system (INS), a quaternion is employed to characterize the transformational connection between the carrier coordinate system (denoted as system b) and the navigation coordinate system (denoted as system n). As a result, the calculation error of the quaternion can be utilized to determine the misalignment angle of the carrier.
