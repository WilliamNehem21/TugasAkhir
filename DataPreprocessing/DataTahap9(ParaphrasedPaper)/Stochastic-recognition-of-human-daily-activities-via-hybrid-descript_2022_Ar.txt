Modern wearable devices, such as smartwatches and smartphones equipped with integrated sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, offer new possibilities for continuously monitoring human activities in real time. While there is growing interest in using these wearable sensors for monitoring human activities, there is still a need for a system that can accurately recognize and monitor various activities with limited contextual information. To address this need, activity data collected from multiple dimensions are analyzed in order to identify and monitor different motion patterns and behaviors. This capability is particularly important for applications in smart homes and elderly care, where the recognition of activities like walking, standing, sleeping, and cooking is of great significance. However, it is important to note that current systems might not always provide accurate results.

The advancement of wearable-based inertial sensors has transformed various aspects of human life, from healthcare to personal comfort. These sensors play a crucial role in enabling access to environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and thermostat settings. Furthermore, the continuous development of wearable sensors has led to an increased demand for research in areas such as healthcare, security and surveillance, wellbeing, and biofeedback systems. These sensors, when integrated into systems for elderly care and childcare, provide valuable real-time information about the well-being of vulnerable individuals. Similarly, security and surveillance systems equipped with wearable sensors can quickly detect unusual events and promptly alert emergency response teams. In the realm of fitness tracking, wearable inertial sensors have also contributed to enhanced monitoring and personalized feedback.

The availability of various inertial sensors, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, has significantly improved our ability to detect changes in the environment. When these sensors are combined, they can provide essential information about complex human body movements in three-dimensional space. For example, accelerometers can measure both static (e.g., gravity) and dynamic (e.g., vibrations) acceleration forces, providing valuable data for detecting complex motion patterns. The gyroscope, on the other hand, measures angular velocity, while magnetometer sensors analyze changes in magnetic field intensity and provide compass calibration information. The fusion of these sensors enhances the capability of monitoring human activities and is referred to as an inertial sensor or inertial measurement unit (IMU).

The utilization of wearable sensors has enabled the development of systems for recognizing human physical activities, such as walking, standing, and ascending or descending stairs. However, these systems may face challenges when dealing with dynamic activities, and it is essential to address issues such as signal interference and noise during the data processing phase. To optimize the recognition and detection of distinct human motion patterns, advanced signal processing techniques, such as the Haar wavelet transform, are employed. Additionally, the integration of feature descriptors with optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent and random forest, has been effective in enhancing the accuracy of activity recognition systems.

In order to achieve accurate and efficient recognition of physical activities, it is important to optimize the feature selection process and utilize suitable classification algorithms. The random forest classifier, in particular, has demonstrated high accuracy and rapid training capabilities when classifying human physical activities. Experimental results using public benchmark datasets have shown promising recognition rates over other existing methods.

Overall, the proposed human daily activity recognition (HDAR) framework aims to achieve high recognition accuracy by extracting features from different body locations and utilizing a hybrid set of features. Through denoising of inertial signals and optimization of feature descriptors, the HDAR system has shown promising results in accurately classifying physical activities from various benchmark datasets.
