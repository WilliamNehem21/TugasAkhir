When dealing with knowledge, it is intrinsically connected to the intricate mental processes of the human mind. These processes are inherently uncertain and exhibit a wide range of potential solutions, making them incredibly complex and sophisticated. This complexity poses challenges for computer-based support in data processing, information management, and knowledge manipulation. While there are numerous specialized approaches and mining techniques for knowledge processing, a universal approach or software application is yet to be developed.
