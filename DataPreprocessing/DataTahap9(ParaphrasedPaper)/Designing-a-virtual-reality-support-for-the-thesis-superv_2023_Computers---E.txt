To address the challenges inherent in thesis supervision, some scholars have proposed using virtual reality (VR) to enhance the supervision experience. The potential for implementing VR in higher education has been noted in previous research (Altbach, 2009). For example, Li et al. (2022) studied the effectiveness of using VR applications for distance learning calligraphy, while Chen et al. (2021) developed a VR-based remote education platform focusing on rendering improvements. Ying et al. (2017) introduced VREX, a VR-based educational platform designed to support education in various disciplines. While much of the existing literature has focused on the use of VR for individual student learning or remote collaborative learning, the specific collaborative experience between supervisors and students in situations such as thesis supervision has been overlooked. In response to this gap, our research's primary focus is on examining the user experience of supervisors and students and customizing a VR application for thesis supervision meetings to investigate methods for improving the design of VR applications tailored to this specific use case. Our primary research question is: "How can VR applications be utilized to support collaborative supervision in thesis work?" We find that designing VR applications for thesis supervision necessitates an understanding of the work practices of teachers and students, with particular attention to cultural and power dynamics, as these elements play a significant role in supervision and indirectly influence the user experience of the VR application. Our study aims to contribute to a shift in the design of VR applications for specific domains. To achieve this, the rest of the paper will be structured as follows: Section 2 offers a review of the relevant literature, Section 3 presents the case study conducted for this work, Section 4 describes the empirical setting, and Section 5 introduces the methodology that guided our research throughout the paper. The findings are presented in Section 6, followed by a detailed discussion of the results in Section 7. Section 8 provides an implementation for design and opens a room for sharing lessons learned.

Before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote thesis supervision was primarily utilized for part-time international students, particularly with the substantial diversity and cultural differences among students significantly impacting their outcomes (Gray & Crosta, 2019; Buckley, 2013). However, due to the global spread of COVID-19 at the end of 2020, remote thesis supervision has become a common necessity in higher education. Most studies on remote thesis supervision have focused on exploring the challenges and issues encountered by teachers and students in the remote supervision process. However, these studies often provided an overview of all available tools on the market, with extensive asynchronous interaction, typically characterized by a delay between sending and receiving information (Serdyukov, 2020). Many typical asynchronous interactive communication applications are already available on the market, such as email, forums, shared network disks, and shared online calendars. While much research has been conducted on asynchronous work tools for thesis supervision, the needs of students and teachers working together in a VR environment go beyond asynchronous interaction. Synchronous interaction, involving real-time exchange of information, allows participants to experience a greater sense of social presence and become more active and engaged. In the context of thesis supervision, synchronous interaction is essential for tasks such as exploring 3D models, highlighting contexts, and expressing emotions, demanding synchronous interaction within VR. Face-to-face communication is widely accepted as the most effective channel for information exchange; however, the impact of COVID-19 has heightened the demand for synchronous collaboration technology (Augustsson & Jaldemark, 2014). While much research has concentrated on similar systems or directly explored experiences of typical applications available on the market, there has been minimal research that specifically focuses on synchronous collaboration.

The use of fully immersive virtual environments (IVE) has gained predominant focus in recent research, as they provide the highest level of immersion and offer users a more realistic and engaging experience. Fully immersive VR systems aim to create a sense of presence and transport users into a virtual world where they can interact with virtual objects and environments in a natural and intuitive way. With the advancement of communication technologies, the interactivity of VR has expanded to support multiple users collaborating in the same virtual space, known as the collaborative virtual environment (CVE). While much of the research on using VR in higher education has focused on single-student learning experiences in fully immersive virtual environments (IVEs), only a few studies have begun to explore multiplayer remote learning in IVEs. Jackson and Fagan (2000), for instance, conducted qualitative research on the cognitive and social dispositions of pairs of learners in an immersive virtual environment for geography education; however, the study was conducted in a laboratory setting with randomly recruited groups of participants. Despite simulating communication scenarios through specific laboratory tasks, the real-life applicability and usefulness of these applications remain under exploration. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and potential of such collaborative virtual environments in educational settings.

The current study presents the procedure of the research, including the instruments, artefacts, the participants, and study procedures. The supervision work commenced in August 2022 and concluded in April 2023, involving a total of 22 rounds of supervision meetings, each lasting about 1 hour, between teachers and five students in a VR space. An essential aspect to mention is that both teachers collaboratively worked on the thesis supervision, given the interdisciplinary nature of the thesis work crossing domains. One teacher provided domain-specific knowledge and guidance to support the students in completing their thesis work, while the other teacher primarily focused on evaluating the quality of the thesis and offering academic support. Documentation and interpretation is essential in understanding the experiences of thesis supervision from the perspectives of both teachers and students and facilitating an iterative design process for continuous improvement of the VR application. During the fieldwork, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the participants to gather information about their thesis project schedules and previous experiences with thesis supervision, including the environment and process they used before using the VR-based application. Thematic analysis was employed during the data analysis phase to gain insights and understand the set of experiences, ideas, and behaviors across the datasets.

The thematic analysis revealed a series of issues associated with the VR application in thesis supervision, including translating supervision work into virtual, hidden interests of supervision, emotional interaction and collaboration, and the emphasis on supervision efficiency. These themes were identified through a detailed examination of user experiences, needs, and challenges, leading to insights into the specific design improvements needed to enhance the VR application for thesis supervision.
