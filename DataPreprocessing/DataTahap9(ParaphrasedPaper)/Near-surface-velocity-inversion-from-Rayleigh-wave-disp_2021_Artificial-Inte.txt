We present the block coordinate descending (BCD) method as an enhancement to the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm for the simultaneous optimization of multiple parameters. The improved SA algorithm allows the inversion of multiple parameters, such as the layer thickness (h) and shear wave velocity (Vs) for each layer in a multilayered model.

While higher-order modes have been utilized in recent studies, the fundamental-order Rayleigh wave is commonly employed in exploration due to its high energy and ease of observation. In this research, the dispersion curve of the fundamental-order Rayleigh wave is utilized to invert the near-surface Vs and h values for each layer. We employ an improved fast generalized reflection-transmission coefficient method to compute dispersion curves for various models.

During the inversion process, the ranges for Vs and h in each layer typically span from 0.5 to 1.5 times their true values to enhance accuracy. In practical scenarios, the search ranges for these two parameters can be limited. Furthermore, the investigation depth of the Rayleigh wave is set to half of the maximum wavelength. The model range for Vs is determined as 0.5 to 1.5 times the minimum to maximum phase velocity, and the layer thickness is greater than 0, with the sum of layer thicknesses being less than the maximum wavelength.

We introduce Gaussian noise of 20 dB to the dispersion curve to assess the performance of the BCDESA and SA algorithms under noisy conditions. The termination error of BCDESA is set to 12, given that the mean square error (E) of the noisy data and clean data falls between 10 and 11. The other parameters remain unchanged.

The inversion of Vs profiles from Rayleigh wave dispersion curves poses a typical nonlinear inverse problem characterized by multiple inversion parameters and high dimensionality. Traditional nonlinear inversion techniques, such as the SA algorithm, may struggle to handle such problems due to errors in high-dimensional nonlinear problems resulting from an increase in the number of layers. Building upon the SA algorithm, we propose the BCDESA algorithm, where the high-dimensional nonlinear SA parameter inverse problem is addressed by the BCD algorithm. Through the utilization of population evolution and optimal control attributes of the Differential Evolution (DE) technique, the SA algorithm is transformed to control the entire iterative process with error, thus averting the instability of the inversion algorithm. This approach also holds promise for resolving other nonlinear inverse problems in the future.
