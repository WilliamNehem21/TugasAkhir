Thermo-responsive linear and cross-linked copolymers made from 2-hydroxyethylacrylate and 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate were synthesized and their physical and chemical properties were analyzed. The copolymer solutions were found to have a lower critical solution temperature (LCST), and copolymer hydrogels of specific compositions exhibited a sharp collapse with increasing temperature. The interaction of copolymers with surfactants was also investigated, showing that the swelling behavior of copolymers in surfactant solutions depended on various factors such as copolymer composition and surfactant concentration, and their influence on copolymer hydrogels was discussed. Additionally, it was observed that an increase in the amplitude of thermo-induced collapse of cross-linked polymers was caused by the interaction of some nonionic hydrogels with ionic surfactants in aqueous solutions.

To modify existing thermo-responsive polymers and manipulate the conditions of the phase transition, complexation with ionic surfactants was suggested, which can be achieved through hydrophobic interaction. This modification typically results in the appearance of ionic groups in the polymer, enhancing its solubility in aqueous solutions. Higher surfactant concentrations were found to yield more pronounced results. The hydrophobicity of the polymer and surfactant as well as their structure were shown to influence the effectiveness of the interaction between non-ionic polymers and ionic surfactants.

A lower critical solution temperature (LCST) diagram was obtained through the turbidity method using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, and the swelling ratio was calculated from the volume of the gel at ambient conditions and its volume at the time of synthesis. Temperature-dependent measurements were conducted in a thermostated water bath.

The thermo-collapse of hydrogels in water was studied, and the swelling ratio was considered as a function of temperature, with a temperature increasing interval of about 3-5 degrees. The hydrogels were allowed to stabilize for 30 minutes at each experimental point before measurements were taken.

PEGDMA was used as a cross-linker to enhance the swelling degree of HEA-HEMA hydrogels. The copolymerization was carried out in an ethanol:water mixture instead of in bulk, with the aim of achieving the same effect. It was found that even though HEA and HEMA differ in structure by only one methyl group, this minor change results in the appearance of a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) in aqueous solutions of HEA-HEMA.

In summary, for a hydrogel to exhibit a significant thermo-collapse, it should swell considerably in water while simultaneously having a sufficiently high content of hydrophobic groups along its polymer backbone to provide strong hydrophobic interaction. The interaction of non-ionic polymers containing hydrophobic moieties with ionic surfactants was identified as an effective method to increase the solubility of the polymers due to electrostatic repulsion between likely charged surfactant heads attached along the polymer backbone, while maintaining a high concentration of hydrophobic groups in the copolymer composition. This method was employed in the present study to enhance the stimuli-sensitive properties of HEA-HEMA copolymers, using cationic cetyl pyridinium bromide (CPB) and anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as surfactants.

The presence of gained network charges and the counterions resulted in extra osmotic pressure on the network, causing the polymer conformation to resemble an expanded coil, leading to hydrogel swelling. On the other hand, at low concentrations of surfactants, such interaction led to the formation of additional junctions, caused by surfactant micelles formed in the hydrogel acting as additional cross-linking aggregates, resulting in the contraction of the hydrogel. The dominance of either of these factors led to the swelling behavior of copolymer hydrogels in surfactant solutions.

In this study, HEA-HEMA copolymers were synthesized via free radical copolymerization, and their physical and chemical properties were investigated using NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation technique. The interaction of copolymers with surfactants was studied, and it was observed that the thermo-sensitive parameters of the water swelling copolymers HEA-HEMA were greatly improved after interacting with ionic CPB and SDS, with hydrogels treated with surfactant solutions undergoing sharp thermo-induced collapse with a high amplitude.
