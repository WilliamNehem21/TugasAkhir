Various algorithms such as breed, flux, and brood have proven to be valuable for identifying pharmacologically relevant regions by analyzing essential substructures (fragments) of known bioactive compounds. However, the compounds generated by these methods are often limited to a narrow chemical space, as they involve attaching different chemical moieties to a restricted number of compound scaffolds. Furthermore, these approaches heavily rely on exhaustive or stochastic search algorithms. Therefore, there is a need for new fragment-based techniques that can rapidly design a large number of compounds with high structural novelty and specific target characteristics.

A tool called delinker has been developed to connect two fragments in a three-dimensional manner, while a transformer model called syntalinker has been introduced to link terminal fragment pairs extracted from the chembl database. Recent reports have demonstrated that deep generative models can be tailored to specific targets through transfer learning, particularly with focused subsets of bioactive compounds. Building on this concept, a workflow named syntalinker-hybrid has been proposed for target-specific molecular generation by leveraging transfer learning and fragment hybridization.

Syntalinker is a deep generative model based on a transformer architecture with multiple encoder-decoder stacks, each of which includes a multi-head self-attention sub-layer and a position-wise feedforward network sub-layer. To train the model, compound structures from the training set have been prepared using the ligprep module, with the docking site defined by a box centered on the crystal ligand using the receptor grid generation module. The chemical space has been characterized using various descriptors such as the MACCS fingerprint, and kernel density estimation analysis has been utilized to calculate the statistical probability distribution of docking scores and shape similarity.

Considering the computational cost, a subset of fragment pairs has been randomly selected for model sampling, with ten molecules generated for each pair. The percentage of valid molecules among the generated molecules is comparable to that obtained by previous model evaluation, and the uniqueness values have shown improvement for all targets. Additionally, most targets have over 40% unique valid molecules containing the input terminal fragments, which are referred to as matched molecules.
