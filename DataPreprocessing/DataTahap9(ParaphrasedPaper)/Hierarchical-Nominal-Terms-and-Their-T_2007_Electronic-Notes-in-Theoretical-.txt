Regarding the remainder of the syntax, it is a generalization where f(t1,..., tn) is a term transformer applied to some terms. The subscripts on t, u, and v are solely for identification purposes and do not relate to levels. Examples will be provided later; for now, this is sufficient.

Our approach in the development of hierarchical nominal rewriting is to ensure that it can encompass meta-levels and instantiation. We opted to use atoms for representing variable symbols. Therefore, our primary objective is to utilize the rewriting framework to establish a means by which atoms can be instantiated to terms.

These are axiom schemes for all i and j, as well as every n, and for every term-former f (if desired). It is conceivable to forgo these schemes by enhancing the syntax of rewrite rules, but this does not appear to be worthwhile in this context. We always presume at least an axiom (subsub).

We are of the belief that our rewrite system is confluent, although proving this is challenging, particularly in the two-level scenario. The hurdle lies in issue (1) above, which is undirected and results in terms growing larger syntactically. Although these challenges have been studied and addressed (refer to the brief discussion in section 7), delving into them in this paper is beyond its scope.
