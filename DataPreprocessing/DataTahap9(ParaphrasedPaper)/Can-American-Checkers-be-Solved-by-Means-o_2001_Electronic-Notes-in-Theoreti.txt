Symbolic model checking has proven effective in verifying large finite state systems comprising over 1020 states. The method relies on the efficient representation of extremely large sets using propositional formulas. Many tools employ binary decision diagrams (BDDs) to implement these formulas, making BDDs a crucial data structure in modern VLSI CAD systems.

In the game of American checkers, single pieces known as "men" move forward diagonally, capturing opposing checkers by jumping over them to an adjacent free square. Jumping can continue as part of the same move as long as there are adjacent opposing pieces with a free square beyond them. Men are not allowed to jump over pieces of their own color.

To represent the current state and the next states in the transition relation of the Kripke structure, a copy of each variable is required. This means that the total number of binary variables is twice the number of variables used to represent the game states. Additionally, it is observed that there are at most 23(n2+1)+1 possible game situations.

Each state in the Kripke structure corresponds to a possible value assignment to a set of variables. Consequently, the state set of the Kripke structure is defined as the set of all possible value assignments that can be made to the chosen set of variables, although it is impractical to explicitly list all these combinations. The initial state's variable assignments reflect the starting position of the game, with "m" indicating that black has to play.

In symbolic model checking, problems with regular structures are often best encoded with regular variable orderings. This observation applies to American checkers, as the game exhibits regularity due to its regular board and the involvement of only a small number of adjacent squares in each individual move, with consistent rules for each move, except for the potential promotion of a man to a king. Therefore, the diagonal variable ordering is also regular in this context.
