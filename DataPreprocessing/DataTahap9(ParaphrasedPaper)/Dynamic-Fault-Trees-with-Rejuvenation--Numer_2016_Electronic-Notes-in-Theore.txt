This paper extends a recently introduced methodology for analyzing dynamic fault trees (DFTs) by incorporating maintenance operations to improve system availability. The methodology involves obtaining discrete failure time distributions for system components based on measurements, and numerically analyzing the gate outputs in a DFT using these distributions. The paper introduces a significant extension by considering maintenance operations in which some components are replaced to enhance system availability.

Fault trees are comprised of leaves representing system components and gates that are connected to the leaves or to the outputs of other gates. The leaves have boolean values indicating whether the component is down or operational. The fault tree's topology, unless there are replicated events, forms a tree with a boolean value at the root representing system failure. The fault trees contain three types of gates: OR, AND, and k/n (k out of n, or voting) gates, which are logical gates. The introduction of an FDEP (Functional Dependency) gate alters the tree topology. The DFT is represented by a structure function that evaluates to true when the system is down and false when it is operational.

The paper utilizes empirical failure time distributions of the components without fitting to theoretical models and extends the methodology to include the rejuvenation of components through an external maintenance process. The paper provides algorithms for numerically computing the failure time distribution of a DFT or a stochastic bound of this distribution. It also demonstrates how the method can be adapted to consider rejuvenation of some components with illustrative examples.

Unlike the state-based models in the literature, the proposed model does not assume exponential transitions to build a Markov chain and uses discrete random variables to model the distribution of the time to failure of the components. The paper also addresses the issue of replicated events and presents an algorithm to compute the availability of the system under such conditions. Additionally, it discusses the computation of stochastic bounds for the reliability of a system modeled by a DFT and defines static and dynamic leaves in the context of gate evaluation.

The maintenance of dynamic gates by dynamic-compliant agents is discussed, and algorithms for analyzing DFTs with rejuvenation are presented. A case study involving maintenance agents acting on system components is also described. The paper concludes by outlining future avenues for research in this area.
