Many current methods for learning to rank do not take into account the relationships between ranking features, which could be utilized to improve the performance of these methods. In response to this issue, this paper presents a new approach to learning to rank, named *GAN-LTR, which combines a multi-head self-attention mechanism with conditional generative adversarial nets (CGAN). The proposed approach enhances the design ideas of the Information Retrieval Generative Adversarial Networks (IRGAN) framework for web search and constructs a new network model by integrating various technologies such as convolution layer, multi-head self-attention layer, residual layer, fully connected layer, batch normalization, and dropout into the generator and discriminator of CGAN. Additionally, a convolutional neural network is used to extract the ranking feature representation of the hidden layer and capture the internal correlations and interactive information between features. The multi-head self-attention mechanism is used to fuse feature information in multiple vector subspaces and capture the attention weight of features to assign appropriate weights to different features. Experimental results on the MQ2008-semi learning to rank dataset demonstrate that *GAN-LTR outperforms IRGAN in various performance indicators.

Search and recommendation are widely used methods for accessing information in the internet era, and learning to rank plays a crucial role in these processes. Learning to rank, which uses machine learning methods to train ranking models and solve ranking problems, is an active area of research in information retrieval and machine learning, and is important for practical applications such as search engines and recommendation systems.

The Information Retrieval Generative Adversarial Network (IRGAN) proposed by Wang et al. was a pioneering work that integrated generative and discriminative retrieval models in information retrieval modeling by using a confrontation training approach. Inspired by IRGAN and the attention mechanism, this paper aims to integrate them to design the learning to rank method *GAN-LTR. This method improves upon the IRGAN framework applied to web search by incorporating a multi-head self-attention mechanism and conditional generative adversarial nets (CGAN) and making various modifications to the network model. The experimental results show that *GAN-LTR achieves better performance compared to IRGAN in various performance indicators.

In summary, by addressing the limitations of existing learning to rank methods and leveraging the multi-head self-attention mechanism and conditional generative adversarial nets, the proposed *GAN-LTR method represents an improvement over IRGAN in the context of learning to rank.
