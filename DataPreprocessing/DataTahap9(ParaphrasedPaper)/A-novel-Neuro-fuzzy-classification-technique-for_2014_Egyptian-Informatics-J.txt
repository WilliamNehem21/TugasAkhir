In this study, we introduced a new approach to neuro-fuzzy classification for data mining by applying a generalized bell-shaped membership function to fuzzify the input data. Our proposed method involved using a fuzzification matrix to associate input patterns with degrees of membership to different classes, allowing patterns to be attributed to specific categories based on their degree of membership. We evaluated the performance of our method on ten benchmark data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and compared it to the performance of two established supervised classification algorithms, namely the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Our analysis, which included measures such as accuracy, root-mean-square error, kappa statistic, true positive rate, false positive rate, precision, recall, and f-measure, consistently demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method over RBFNN and ANFIS in every aspect.

Furthermore, we discussed the significance of analyzing large real-world databases to gain a deeper understanding of different large-scale datasets and its relevance to effective knowledge development and decision-making processes. We also provided an overview of data classification as a method for constructing a classifier to predict the class of entities with unknown labels and highlighted the various preprocessing steps involved in the classification procedure.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews related works in this area, Section 3 describes our proposed neuro-fuzzy classification method, Section 4 explains the detailed procedure, Section 5 discusses the performance analysis and results, and Section 6 presents the conclusion. Additionally, we referenced the work of Kuncheva, Abonyi et al., and other researchers who have explored fuzzy pattern recognition, hybrid soft computing systems, and computational intelligence techniques for data mining applications.

Finally, we detailed the experimental setup in which the proposed neuro-fuzzy system and the comparative RBFNN and ANFIS classifiers were trained and tested on ten benchmark datasets, and we reported the performance metrics for each classifier. Our results consistently showed the superior performance of the neuro-fuzzy system over the other classifiers across the various performance measures, indicating its potential to significantly advance conventional classification methods in the field of data mining research. Nonetheless, we acknowledged the need for further experimental validation and the exploration of additional interestingness measures in future research.
