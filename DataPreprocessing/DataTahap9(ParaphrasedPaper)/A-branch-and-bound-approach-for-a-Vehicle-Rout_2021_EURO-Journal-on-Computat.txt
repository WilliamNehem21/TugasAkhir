Railway maintenance management involves the crucial task of scheduling tamping operations, taking into account factors such as crew and machinery travel costs, as well as time-dependent costs caused by poor track condition. The authors of a specific study outline a planning problem for tamping operations, referred to as a vehicle routing problem with additional customer costs, which is more challenging to solve using conventional methods due to its specific objective function. To address this, they introduce a branch-and-bound approach based on a partition and permutation model, presenting two branching strategies and analyzing their advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, the study compares different lower bounds for customer costs and travel costs, assesses the performance of the branch-and-bound method, and compares it with a commercial solver.

The paper introduces a new variant of the vehicle routing problem, known as the vehicle routing problem with customer costs, which incorporates time-dependent customer costs to account for penalties related to railway service restrictions. Unlike traditional VRPs, this variant focuses on minimizing not only travel costs but also costs associated with the timing of job executions, and does not include capacity constraints.

The branch-and-bound method is a widely used approach for solving complex combinatorial problems, involving the iterative subdivision of the solution space into subsets (branches) and the calculation of lower bounds for the objective function to discard certain subsets and reduce the solution space. The study reviews existing branch-and-bound methods developed for problems related to the VRP-CC, such as those for the traveling salesman problem (TSP), and discusses the use of lower bounds for travel costs in branch-and-bound approaches.

The paper provides a detailed discussion of two integration strategies for jobs, comparing their computational performance and effectiveness through computational experiments. Additionally, it highlights the potential improvement of lower bounds for customer costs and travel costs as areas for further research.

The study concludes by comparing the performance of the branch-and-bound algorithms with a commercial solver, highlighting the superior ability of the branch-and-bound approaches to handle time-dependent customer costs with significantly lower computation times. The paper also suggests potential areas for further research, including the development of improved bounds for customer costs and the exploration of lower bounds for the entire problem considering both travel costs and customer costs.
