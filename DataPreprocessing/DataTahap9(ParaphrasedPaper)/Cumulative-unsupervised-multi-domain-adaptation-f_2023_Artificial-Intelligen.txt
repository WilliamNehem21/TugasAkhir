However, the cost of annotating every cow in each farm is prohibitive. The goal is to develop re-identification methods that can be applied to both labeled and unlabeled farms, accommodating new individuals and diverse environments. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques have been used to transfer knowledge from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, but these methods have mainly been designed for pedestrian and vehicle re-identification applications.

In this study, we introduce a cumulative unsupervised multi-domain adaptation (cumDA) method to address the challenges of limited identity diversity and diverse farm appearances. CumDA accumulates knowledge from all domains, enhancing specialization in known domains and improving generalization to unseen domains. Our contributions include a cumDA method that adapts to multiple unlabeled target domains while preserving source domain performance. We conducted extensive cross-dataset experiments on three cattle re-identification datasets, which demonstrate significant improvements in source preservation, target domain specialization, and generalization to unseen domains.

The re-identification paradigm has expanded beyond pedestrian tracking to encompass a broader range of real-world applications, including vehicle re-identification for traffic surveillance and animal re-identification for monitoring cattle.

Our work also addresses the challenges of limited identity diversity and diverse farm appearances. We propose a cumulative unsupervised multi-domain adaptation approach to address these challenges. This approach accumulates knowledge from all domains, enhancing specialization in known domains and improving generalization to unseen domains. We conducted extensive experiments on three cattle re-identification datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in source preservation, target domain specialization, and generalization to unseen domains.

Overall, our method aims to enhance specialization and cross-domain re-identification performance through knowledge accumulation. We anticipate that the cumulative unsupervised multi-domain adaptation model, through the accumulation of knowledge from diverse target domains, can enhance its generalization to previously unseen domains.

We also discuss the impact of using domain-specific batch normalization layers and emphasize the importance of handling differences in domain statistics when computing batch normalization statistics.

Furthermore, we present details of the datasets used in our experiments, including the HolsteinCattleRecognition dataset, which features RGB and infrared images of 1237 individuals, and the CowFishEye dataset, which includes RGB images of 78 individuals acquired from a single farm using fisheye cameras.

In conclusion, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in addressing the challenges of limited identity diversity and diverse farm appearances. We also discuss the importance of calibration in addressing issues related to highly different numbers of shots per identity in animal datasets.

Our study sheds light on the significance of understanding the domain gap in cattle re-identification and emphasizes the importance of shape information, rather than color information, in addressing the challenges of pseudo-labeling for cow re-identification.

Overall, our findings contribute to a better understanding of unsupervised domain adaptation methods and their applications in cattle re-identification tasks. We also discuss the importance of handling differences in domain statistics and the influence of pseudo-labeling methods on unsupervised domain adaptation.
