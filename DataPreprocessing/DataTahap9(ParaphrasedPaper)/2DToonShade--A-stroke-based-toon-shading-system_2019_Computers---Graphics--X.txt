The underlying motivation for our concept stems from the observation that while contemporary automatic shading techniques typically involve a complex pipeline, manual shading, which is still aesthetically appealing, is often relatively straightforward. The process of creating a 3D model from 2D art for each frame, followed by rendering using 3D global illumination and subsequently simplifying the rendered shadows to match hand-drawn animation styles, is deemed overly intricate for the task at hand. Through the reliance solely on 2D-based algorithms instead of 3D models or normal map estimation, our system bypasses the prominent state-of-the-art workflow, striving to preserve the intuition-based creative process of hand-drawn animation while generating appealing and plausible self-shadows and shades.

Let c denote our set of potential candidates, s the shade to be propagated from frame n, a the corresponding region around s, and a+1 the related region in the subsequent frame n+1. The candidates in c exhibit a high likelihood of being present in a+1. Nevertheless, it is only necessary to identify one seed point in a+1 for the propagation.

In general, within state-of-the-art techniques relying on geometric models, the quality of the toon shading outcome is intricately linked to the level of geometric intricacy in the 3D model/normal map. One crucial advantage of our system is the user's autonomy in selecting where to create shades. Additionally, rather than providing a rendered result, shades can be individually edited and modified. Moreover, artists can meticulously choose shading colors to achieve the most aesthetically pleasing outcome, as opposed to a physically realistic one.

This paper introduces 2Dtoonshade, a comprehensive system for the semi-automatic generation of shading and self-shadowing. While prior efforts were centered on reconstructing 3D models or normal maps from 2D artwork, our tool aims to directly construct animation-style shade lines while remaining within the natural 2D drawing environment. The system produces believable cartoon-style shades and self-shadows, significantly reducing the manual labor associated with drawing shades and self-shadows. It also provides users with greater flexibility, allowing for retrospective adjustment of lighting. We have also introduced a novel method for positioning a light in 3D space without departing from the 2D realm, which received positive feedback from experienced users. Furthermore, we compared our approach to the state of the art and two widely employed software packages for professional animation, underlining its potential to inspire future research on the non-physical manipulation of shading and shadows.
