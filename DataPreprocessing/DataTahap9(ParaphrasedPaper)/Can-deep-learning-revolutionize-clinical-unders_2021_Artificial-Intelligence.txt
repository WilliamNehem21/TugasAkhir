Artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of neuro-ophthalmology is an emerging area, and AI algorithms have demonstrated high accuracy in the detection of neuro-ophthalmic diseases such as papilledema and glaucoma. These algorithms are designed to monitor the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and changes in the optic disc using fundus and OCT images for detecting neuro-ophthalmic diseases. This technological advancement holds promise for expanding its application in inherited optic neuropathies, particularly Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). This review explores the current uses and recent advancements of AI in ophthalmology, as well as the potential role of AI-based models in inherited optic neuropathies.

Furthermore, advances in image recognition and classification have facilitated the identification of retinal pigment changes, choroidal neovascularization, drusen, hemorrhage, exudation, and atrophy, particularly in individuals over the age of 50. Color fundus images serve as data for interpretation in deep learning (DL) methods. In the case of cataracts, which cause lens opacification in the eye, early diagnosis is challenging through clinical observation. DL has found application in cataracts through the development of convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms for slit-lamp images to diagnose the early stages of cataracts. However, the DL model's performance in cataracts compared to traditional clinical grading has only achieved 70% accuracy. Another DL model for pediatric cataracts has facilitated the automatic localization of the region of interest in the lens for identification using CNN, with image preprocessing enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of the DL model up to 97% and enabling the classification and grading of cataracts. Additionally, a study has reported the prediction of the risk of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) using AI with 87% accuracy.

Trials are currently underway to expand AI platforms through digital innovations in the Internet of Things, 5th generation telecommunications networks, and the creation of a self-reliant ecosystem, which presents opportunities to advance the latest models related to ophthalmology to address various challenges. Telemedicine has enabled clinicians to evaluate patients from any location, and AI and telemedicine are continuously improving by incorporating extensive information about disease progression, longitudinal data usage, and real-time incidence calculation in the real world. The application of AI can facilitate data collection and storage of large patient datasets, with digital innovations ranging from diagnostics to assisting in the treatment of eye diseases. AI has significantly expanded its applications in ophthalmological issues such as diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), glaucoma, and myopia through tele-screening.

While AI offers numerous benefits, there is a risk of minor errors that may hinder the operation and disease diagnosis process. Addressing the challenges of data gathering and analysis, including legal formalities, is critical for the development of AI systems. AI utilizes different approaches to assign ground labels as reference standards, and these approaches are subject to human error, leading to a high risk of biased assessment by the Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies (MINORS), which has not yet been fully utilized due to limited testing. Every new AI system and algorithm must undergo extensive testing and trials, which is time-consuming and involves numerous approvals, as the entire system relies on a trial-and-error process.
