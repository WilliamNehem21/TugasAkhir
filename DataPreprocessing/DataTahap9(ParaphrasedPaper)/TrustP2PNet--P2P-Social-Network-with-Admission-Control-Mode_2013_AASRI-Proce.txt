The internet provides significant benefits for work, education, leisure, and other aspects of life. In an ideal situation, individuals can access information from any location willing to provide it. However, this is not always the case for various reasons. While it is understandable that websites with inappropriate content, such as those containing sexual or violent material, are prohibited for the greater good of society, it is regrettable that certain websites presenting academic discussions are also inaccessible for political reasons. Additionally, certain pathways may become unavailable, preventing access to specific websites for some people, even though they could still be visited by others.

A peer-to-peer (P2P) work style offers substantial advantages to the system. Firstly, it makes the internet more accessible to users, potentially making previously banned websites available to those who were previously unable to access them due to political or technical restrictions. Moreover, the absence of a central node responsible for authenticating or transferring data among all nodes in the system helps to avoid bottlenecks. Central servers, which incur significant economic and technical burdens, can adversely affect system performance when handling large volumes of data. Additionally, all nodes in the system have equal significance and functionality, ensuring robustness so that the failure of a single node does not have catastrophic consequences for the system. In the absence of disasters, multiple pathways allow nodes to find better ways to enhance system performance.

Current popular P2P software methods do not offer an effective means for nodes to join the system. For instance, the widely used approach in systems like BitTorrent allows all nodes to join the network without initially verifying whether a node is honest or malicious. Although methods are in place to assess and incentivize node behavior, these means can sometimes be too weak to be meaningful.

When nodes within the system seek to access services, they may not know the best choice. The nodes with the highest evaluation in the system do not necessarily offer the best service for every other node and may even be unavailable to some.

To address these issues, the proposed TrustP2Pnet system is a proxy operating in the application layer on top of the physical internet network. It is composed of nodes and their accessible parts of the internet. When a node wishes to visit an inaccessible location, it encodes the destination in a datagram and sends it to nodes that might reach the destination. When another node receives the datagram, it extracts the destination and transfers the data back to the original node.

The TrustP2Pnet and its P2P work style have significant benefits, including increased accessibility to the internet for users, potentially enabling previously restricted websites to become accessible for political or technical reasons. In this system, the absence of a central node responsible for authenticating or transferring data among all nodes avoids bottlenecks and the economic and technical burdens associated with maintaining central servers. All nodes in the system have equal significance and functionality, ensuring robustness, and in the presence of multiple pathways, nodes are able to enhance system performance.

The issue of trust and reputation in P2P systems has been a prominent subject, and existing mechanisms are based on an accumulative credit system. These mechanisms do not refuse any peers, honest or malicious, from joining the system, but restrict their behaviors based on their scores. This approach causes delays in addressing malicious nodes. Furthermore, it often relies on a central server to record and update peer credit scores, introducing additional risks of attacks on the central server by malicious peers seeking to inflate their scores to gain more services.

To overcome these drawbacks, a trust system based on social networks is proposed. The model assumes that people trust their friends, whose opinions they rely on for evaluating unknown individuals. The initial users of the system are always honest, and when malicious peers are detected, other users are willing to inform their friends to remove them. This model is then applied to the TrustP2Pnet project, where every node in the system acts as a proxy that relays traffic voluntarily. Each node in the TrustP2Pnet comprises four subsystems: the functional module for transferring traffic and performing other functions, the calculation engine for admission control, the friends list to record trust values, and the evaluation engine to estimate recommendations.
