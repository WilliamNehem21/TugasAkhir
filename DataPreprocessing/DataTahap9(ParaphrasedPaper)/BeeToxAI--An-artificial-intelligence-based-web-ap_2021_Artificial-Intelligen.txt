The paper presents a comprehensive approach for evaluating the risks posed to honey bees by pesticides in both the short and long term. It outlines the various routes of pesticide exposure to honey bees, including direct contact during application, oral intake from contaminated water or food, and indirect contact through plant surfaces. The authors emphasize the importance of conducting acute contact and oral toxicity studies for pesticide registration when there is potential exposure to honey bees based on the proposed use pattern.

The study used classificatory quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to analyze toxicological outcomes and curated datasets for contact and oral exposure to pesticides. The datasets were processed to remove duplicates, resulting in 382 compounds for contact exposure and 169 compounds for oral exposure. QSAR models were developed using support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) algorithms, and their performance was optimized through hyperparameter tuning using a Bayesian approach.

The Bayesian optimization process involved visualizing the fragments and atoms contributing to acute contact and oral toxicities, and the resulting weights were used to create topography-like maps. These maps highlighted the atoms and fragments that either positively or negatively contributed to toxicity, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of toxicity.

Furthermore, regression models were developed using curated datasets containing 218 compounds for contact exposure and 142 compounds for oral exposure. The models were validated using both internal and external datasets, and their performance was compared with models developed by other researchers.

The paper also discusses the financial support and acknowledgments for the research, including funding agencies, corporate support, and individuals who contributed to the study. Additionally, potential competing interests of the authors, including financial interests and personal relationships, are declared. The authors express their gratitude to those who supported the research and contributed to the manuscript.

Overall, the study provides a detailed methodology for assessing pesticide risks to honey bees and offers valuable insights into the development and performance of QSAR models for predictive toxicology. The findings and methodology presented in the paper hold significance for future research and regulatory decision-making regarding pesticide use and honey bee health.
