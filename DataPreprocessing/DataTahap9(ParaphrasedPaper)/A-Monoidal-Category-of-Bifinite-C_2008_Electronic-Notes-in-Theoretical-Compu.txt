The tensor product of two monics in category C may not necessarily result in a monic. Moreover, the behavior of the tensor product varies significantly across different subcategories of C. For instance, in the category IE, the tensor product of two extensional Chu spaces remains extensional, and according to proposition 2.2, the tensor product of two monics is still a monic. However, in the category B, the tensor product of two biextensional Chu spaces may not retain its biextensional property, as demonstrated by the possibility of the attribute set of the tensor product being empty, as illustrated in the following example.
