Machining is a crucial process used in the manufacturing of critical components for the automotive and aerospace sectors. While new manufacturing technologies have emerged, broaching continues to be the preferred process for many applications due to its efficiency and precision. However, broaching is costly, so efforts are focused on minimizing force, temperature, tool wear, and the risk of workpiece damage.

Tool wear directly contributes to increased temperature. Previous research has utilized simulation techniques to understand variables such as cutting temperature. While some studies have examined cutting forces and temperature during broaching, limited research exists on the influence of cutting-edge radius (microgeometry) on these factors. However, other works on milling and turning operations have shown the significant impact of cutting-edge radius through sensitivity analyses, simulations, and high-speed experiments.

Researchers have experimentally verified the Zorev shear stress distribution, which plays a role in the tool-chip contact, considering adhesion and sliding friction zones. Friction is not only present in the tool-chip interaction but also in the tool-workpiece interaction and dynamically around the cutting edge radius, directly impacting chip formation, tool life, surface quality, and process energy consumption.

The coefficient of friction in the tool-workpiece interaction is directly related to machining. As the flank wear rate increases, the coefficient of friction also increases. Research focused on determining the friction in the presence of flank wear for titanium and nickel-based alloys, concluding that the coefficient of friction varies with the workpiece material and leading-edge geometry.

Furthermore, researchers proposed a quasi-stationary friction and an average friction coefficient value, while others demonstrated that the friction coefficient is not constant and recommended a variable friction coefficient empirically obtained from cutting tests. Factors such as rake angle, clearance angle, and uncut chip thickness were shown to affect friction.

Experiments were conducted using an uncoated sub-micro grain tungsten carbide tool under dry conditions, and results suggested that friction is influenced by parameters such as the rake angle, clearance angle, and uncut chip thickness. Moreover, experiments on inconel 718 indicated that as the planning time increased, the cutting edge radius also increased while the average roughness of the cutting edge decreased. However, it was noted that the brush bristle preparation technology has limitations in controlling microform variation and symmetry/asymmetry due to the nature of contact between the brush bristles and cutting edge.
