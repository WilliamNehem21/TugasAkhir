The paper argues that if statements concerning future events are already either true or false, then the future is predetermined in much the same way as the past, differing only in that it has not yet occurred. To avoid situations where further development becomes impossible, the author suggests rejecting the law of excluded middle, which assumes that every proposition must be either true or false. Instead, the author proposes a logic system that introduces a third truth value, representing the possibility of a proposition being true. This system, known as Lukasiewicz logic, provides an alternative approach to reasoning about future events.

The paper discusses the development of a 4-valued logic system, referred to as m4, which possesses the property that when restricted to a specific set of three values, it essentially represents the logic system g3. It also includes two negations, one of which is defined as Lukasiewicz negation (in l4) and functions as a strong negation. The paper proceeds to extend the definition of this logic in a conservative manner to a paraconsistent logic system, and then introduces Lukasiewicz 4-valued logic and its relation to the previously presented logics. Finally, the paper offers some conclusions based on these developments.
