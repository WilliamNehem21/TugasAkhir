Sobriety, a property exhibited by topological spaces between times t0 and t2, is a distinctive characteristic that cannot be compared with being t1 or being sober. Sobriety in spaces carries remarkable attributes and holds significant significance in domain theory, as demonstrated in prior studies (e.g., [1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11]). For example, a sober space is a directed complete poset (abbreviated as dcpo) in relation to its specialization order, and two sober spaces are homeomorphic if and only if their lattices of open subsets are order isomorphic. Furthermore, the well-known Hofmann-Mislove theorem establishes an order isomorphism between the poset of compact saturated subsets and the poset of Scott open filters of open subsets in a sober space. Various extensions of sober spaces have been introduced, including the concept of bounded sobriety, which is a weaker form of sobriety. It has been demonstrated that the subcategory of bounded sober spaces is reflective in the category of t0 spaces (Zhao and Ho, n.d.).

It is worth noting that countably irreducible closed sets are a subset of irreducible closed sets, and sober spaces are a specialized form of countably sober spaces. If a space x exclusively contains finite closed subsets, particularly if x is finite, then irreducible closed sets are inherently countably irreducible. To summarize, a space x is considered sober if it is countably sober.
