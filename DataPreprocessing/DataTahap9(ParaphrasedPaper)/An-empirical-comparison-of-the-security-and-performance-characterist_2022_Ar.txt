The objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of geographical displacement and latency between nodes in reducing information propagation delay in networks. The paper introduces and critically examines new network clustering methods, namely locality-based clustering (LBC), ping time-based approach (PTBC), super node-based clustering (SNBA), and master node-based clustering (MNBC). The proposed protocols are demonstrated to mitigate information propagation delay issues, thereby reducing the likelihood of successful double spending attacks. Additionally, a security evaluation of these protocols is conducted to address the tension between organized, low information propagation delay networks and robustness to partition-style attacks. The paper is organized as follows: strategies for speeding up information propagation are discussed in section 2, the problem and contributions are presented in section 3, the Bitcoin network and proposed clustering protocols are described in sections 4 and 5, the experimental setup and performance evaluation results are provided in section 6, a security evaluation of the proposed protocols is presented in section 7, and conclusions and future research directions are outlined in section 8.

Various efforts have aimed to reduce information propagation delay by minimizing the time required for verifying information (transactions or blocks) in the Bitcoin network. One such approach involves minimizing the verification time through the use of a protocol that divides the blockchain on multiple local computers at each node, resulting in a substantial reduction in verification time. Additionally, research has focused on enhancing information propagation speed while minimizing blockchain size to improve scalability and security. However, certain approaches that rely on miners for securing off-chain blocks have been found to compromise the decentralization concept of Bitcoin, thereby reducing security awareness. Furthermore, a study has highlighted the importance of network connectivity in reducing information propagation delays and proposed a star sub-graph topology to achieve this. However, this proposed network topology introduces security risks due to potential exploitation by malicious nodes.

A transport protocol layer called Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine (FIBRE) has been introduced to reduce information propagation delay by addressing packet losses and reducing network traffic. Additionally, an optimization protocol has been proposed to increase network connectivity by utilizing geographical proximity to cluster peers. However, the security implications of this clustering protocol were not evaluated, contrasting with the approach taken in the present paper, which conducts a security evaluation of new clustering protocols.

An analytical model of Bitcoin has also been developed to measure the impact of propagation delay on double spending attacks. The model suggests that reducing accidental forks can help mitigate double-spending attacks. Furthermore, a prototype system has been proposed to prevent double-spending attacks in vending machines, achieving fast payment with a low probability of attack occurrence.

The paper presents a performance evaluation of four clustering approaches - location-based clustering (LBC), Bitcoin clustering-based ping time protocol (PTBC), Bitcoin clustering-based super node (SNBA), and master node-based clustering (MNBC). Each approach aims to reduce average latency of information delivery between peers without compromising security. The results show that clustering based on link latencies yields smaller information propagation delays, and fully connected clusters improve both security and performance. Additionally, the paper evaluates the resistance of the proposed protocols to partition attacks, highlighting the importance of network size and information propagation time in mitigating such attacks and double-spending attacks.

In summary, the paper emphasizes the importance of considering geographical displacement and latency between nodes in reducing information propagation delay in networks, and provides a critical evaluation of new network clustering methods, along with their security and performance implications.
