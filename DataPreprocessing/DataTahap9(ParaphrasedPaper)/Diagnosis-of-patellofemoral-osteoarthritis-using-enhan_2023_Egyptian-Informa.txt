In the order of accuracy, loss, validation accuracy, validation loss, recall, precision, and f1 score, the study's results demonstrate the effective performance of the predictive model. Comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art models using the same datasets revealed the effectiveness of the predictive model. The findings suggest that RNN models, particularly GRU and LSTM, can be effective for detecting PF OA, and the specific RNN architecture used can significantly impact performance.

The internal structure of GRU reveals that it only incorporates two gates, lacking the output gate and internal memory present in LSTMs with three gates. In LSTMs, an update gate connects the input and target gates, while in GRU, reset gates are directly linked to the previous hidden state. The reset gate in LSTMs can be obtained through the input and target gates.

Researchers conducted experiments using a 1D sEMG signal of knee muscles and aimed to detect knee abnormality by straightening the knee and obtaining 2D projected images for input into a CNN model. They found that the scalogram image representation outperformed spectrogram and persistence spectrum in detecting knee abnormality, reaching a maximum accuracy of 84%.

Bansal et al. utilized various machine learning techniques to enhance classifier accuracy and predict distinct movements for normal and abnormal sets of sEMG data related to knee muscles. Their study achieved an accuracy rate of 85% without implementing anomaly detection techniques.

Zhu et al. investigated the effect of sEMG preprocessing and prediction on walking data collected from healthy adults. Their study resulted in an accuracy of nearly 99%, but it was only experimented on and trained with healthy individuals' data.

Li et al. researched the relationship between joint movement and surface electromyography (sEMG), concluding that the rfpca approach for estimating knee movement from sEMG is practical and might be employed for exoskeleton control and motion analysis.

Khowailed and Abotabl introduced the Neural Muscular Activation Detection (NMAD) framework, using deep learning to identify muscle activation. They found that a properly trained RNN can outperform state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy.

Liu et al. suggested predicting knee angle using a CNN model and achieved good results in predicting knee angles with greater accuracy.

In terms of interpretation of procedures, the study focuses on multiplying CT and FT as a method of erasing irrelevant data from the carried data flow, and on the role of TN, FP, TP, and FN in calculating knee abnormalities against normal ones.

The loss function and mean squared error (MSE) technique were utilized for minimizing the difference between determined and real-world values for data samples.

Lastly, the study found that RNN models, particularly GRU and LSTM, can be effective for the task at hand, with careful selection of the specific RNN architecture significantly impacting performance.
