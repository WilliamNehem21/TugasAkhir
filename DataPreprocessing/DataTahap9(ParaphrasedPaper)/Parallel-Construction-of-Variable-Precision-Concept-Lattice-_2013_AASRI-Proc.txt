The paper examines the fuzzy cut method and explores the concept of the fuzzy concept lattice. It proposes a new type of lattice called variable precision concept lattice, which can be constructed with various confidences by selecting different levels. The paper discusses two corresponding construction methods, context cut method, and concept cut method, and presents some results. Additionally, it includes a case study.

In real-world scenarios, the relationship between the extent and intent is often uncertain. Fuzzy relationships exist in concepts and are not accurately described by traditional concept lattices. The usual formal concept is a two-tuple consisting of extent and intent, where the extent is the set of elements and the intent is the set of attributes shared by all elements. Several scholars have introduced fuzzy concept lattices successively to express the fuzzy relationship between extent and intent, which aligns with human fuzzy concept ideas and is crucial for practical problem-solving.

The concept of a fuzzy set was proposed by L. A. Zadeh in 1965, aiming to quantitatively describe fuzzy concepts and the regularity of fuzzy objects. Fuzzy set theory expands the membership relation from the classic set theory, extending the membership degree from two numbers (0 and 1) to the interval [0,1].

The paper discusses the limitations of traditional concept lattices and introduces the concept of fuzzy concept lattice and weighted concept lattice. It points out that the time cost is significant, especially for large concept lattices, when searching for concepts with partial attributes. Additionally, in rough concept lattices, while it is possible to search for concepts with partial attributes, the support and confidence degree of constructing association rules may be greatly reduced.

The paper analyzes the relationships between fuzzy concept lattice and classic concept, introduces the idea of fuzzy cut set into the construction of concept lattice, and presents a new kind of concept lattice to describe different rule confidences. A case study is used to demonstrate the value of this concept. The next step is to apply this tool in engineering practices such as rule extraction, fuzzy decision making, and intelligent control.
