This academic paper discusses the requirements and characteristics of various types of actors in the context of a coordination model. It introduces the ARC programming model and its accompanying language, ARC-PL, and examines the syntax and informal semantics of language constructs that support modular coordination. The paper categorizes coordination models as data-driven or control-driven, discusses related work, and provides examples of programming in the ARC model to illustrate local coordination, intra-role coordination, and inter-role coordination. It also explores decentralization in coordination models and compares the ARC model to other approaches. Furthermore, the paper delves into the behavior and capabilities of role actors, including their handling of events and message dispatch. It also addresses role membership and the handling of conflicting role memberships in ARC-PL. Lastly, the paper touches on the coordination enacted by coordinator actors and the queries that role actors can use to communicate with coordinator actors.
