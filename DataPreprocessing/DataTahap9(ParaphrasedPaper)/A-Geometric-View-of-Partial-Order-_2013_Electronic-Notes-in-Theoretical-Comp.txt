This study examines a particular program in which the instruction x:=1 is considered as persistent, meaning that it commutes with all other instructions running in parallel with it. Without loss of generality, it is assumed that this instruction is executed first, and the task is to verify the validity of the program x:=1;(y:=2|y:=3;z:=4). Consequently, this program generates only three potential executions, as opposed to the six seen in another program. By iteratively applying a reduction procedure, paths through the state x12 can be eliminated. This reduction procedure, known as partial order reduction (POR), was introduced by Valmari and further developed by Godefroid. POR has led to numerous successful tools, such as Spin, which optimize deadlock detection, and have been extended in various ways. The focus of the study is on deadlock detection, but the intended application is broader, with full reachability to be detailed in future work. Acyclic systems are primarily considered, which is a common restriction in partial order reduction techniques.

The study seeks to establish a formal relationship between persistent sets and inessential paths, with the aim of combining their potential to address the state space explosion problem. Under reasonable assumptions, it is demonstrated that persistent transitions are the algebraic counterpart of inessential paths. The article aims to bridge the theoretical gap and demonstrates that while the analogy is intuitive, the theoretical comparison is sometimes complex. 

The study presents a review of the models of computation used to formalize persistent sets, focusing on labeled transition systems with independence (LTSI) and their generalization into asynchronous transition systems (ATS). The original definition of persistent sets from LTSI is conservatively extended to ATS, which are closer to geometric models, while retaining their fundamental reduction potential for deadlock detection. Furthermore, a conceptual link between partial order reduction and directed algebraic topology is developed.

The study concludes with the development of a conservative extension of persistent sets to asynchronous transition systems, which aligns with the original concept on LTSI and forms the basis for comparing the partial order reduction technique and the geometric approach to state space reduction. The extension also demonstrates that the definition retains the primary application of persistent sets by pruning the search for deadlocks.

The section primarily focuses on ATS induced by LTSI, assuming the presence of normal tiles, where switchings are unique, and pairs of co-final and co-initial transitions have different components in each tile.
