Since the 1970s, there has been significant interest in chaotic dynamics within the field of dynamical systems, prompting considerable effort to precisely define the concept of chaos in mathematical terms. Various ideas of chaos have been developed, and a substantial body of literature exists on the connections between these different approaches. For further details on this topic, readers are directed to references [9,14].

This paper delves into the exploration of the concept of strong chaos within the context of topological groups, which is slightly more specific but still broad in scope. Among other findings, it is demonstrated that a locally compact Hausdorff topological group exhibits a faithful and strongly chaotic continuous action on a Hausdorff space if and only if it is strongly syndetically separated and non-compact. When the acting group is discrete, this result can be specialized to characterize infinite residually finite groups in terms of topological dynamics. Notably, the concept of chaos established in this paper, which has also been discussed by various authors, particularly from a group-theoretic standpoint, is closely linked to the one introduced in previous work (refer to section 4 of this paper).

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 addresses some general matters concerning continuous group actions, while section 3 introduces terminology related to compactifications of topological groups and a closely associated type of separation property. Section 4 establishes the desired concepts of periodicity and chaos relative to a specific class of group compactifications, and demonstrates how these concepts extend the corresponding ideas discussed in earlier works. In section 5, a geometric characterization of certain classes of compactifications of a given locally compact Hausdorff topological group is provided, illustrating when such a group allows for a faithful or chaotic continuous action on a (compact) Hausdorff space (refer to theorem 5.5). As a special case of this parametrized result, a new description of non-compact, maximally almost periodic, locally compact Hausdorff topological groups is obtained through topological dynamics (refer to corollary 5.6).

As demonstrated by lemma 2.2 and proposition 4.6, if g is a topological group and d is a non-empty subset of c(g) such that g permits a faithful d-chaotic continuous action on a Hausdorff space, then g is non-compact and d separates compact subsets in g. In this section, we corroborate that the converse is true for locally compact Hausdorff topological groups.
