One possible solution, proposed by Tennent, involves the use of binary logical relations to represent data refinement. However, while binary logical relations are well-suited for higher order types, they do not compose. Therefore, there is a need for a more generalized approach that can easily handle higher order types and is closed under composition, leading to the development of the notion of lax logical relations and its variants. In this paper, we explore and expand the concept of lax logical relations within the context of call by value languages, building upon and clarifying previous work. This results in a more direct generalization of the basic lemma, as well as a condition for the composition of lax logical relations, which is satisfied by our leading examples. Overall, lax logical relations prove to be a suitable model for representing data refinement and higher order structures.
