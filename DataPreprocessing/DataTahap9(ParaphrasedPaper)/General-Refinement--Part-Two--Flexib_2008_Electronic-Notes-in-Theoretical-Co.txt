This paper presents the concept of vertical refinement within a general model, which can be interpreted as a form of action refinement or non-atomic refinement found in the literature. Alternatively, when treating a specific model as a logical theory, vertical refinement can be understood as a theory morphism formalized as a Galois connection. The paper introduces the idea that vertical refinement allows for the modification of the interpretations of entities during the system development process through formal refinement steps. This is illustrated through examples in several sections. Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of the ibp layer in the broadcast layer and observes challenges in extending this implementation to include handshake on broadcast. 

The concept of extension refinement and behavioral sub-typing is introduced to make certain events visible in concrete entities that are not visible in abstract entities. This kind of refinement is then formalized as a special case of theory morphisms. The paper establishes a definition based on two semantic mappings, (v) and (va), which interpret high-level abstract entities as low-level concrete entities and vice versa. It is shown that these semantic mappings form vertical refinements if any low-level refinement is interpreted as a high-level refinement, and vice versa.

Furthermore, the paper describes a process where a high-level specification is vertically refined into a more detailed low-level layer while preserving its original meaning. The paper also highlights that interpretations of behavior can be formally refined into other interpretations, allowing the choice of how to interpret the semantics to be postponed until needed.

Another refinement step discussed in the paper involves reducing nondeterminism by limiting a set to have no more than three elements. This refinement retains the original guarantee for sets with no more than three elements, and operations attempting to increase the size beyond three are allowed to return the new state.

The paper also explores the application of vertical refinement to processes with LTS operational semantics, refining processes based on one style of interaction to another. It introduces subset morphisms as a simpler alternative to vertical refinement and demonstrates their use in modeling restriction and hiding as found in process literature.

The concept of formal refinement steps is further demonstrated by discussing the introduction of new events to abstract processes, creating concrete processes. Additionally, the paper presents a particular vertical refinement between high-level ibp entities and low-level broadcast processes and discusses the limitations in extending the high-level refinement to all handshake processes.

In summary, the paper introduces the concept of vertical refinement as a means to modify interpretations of entities during system development, and provides examples and case studies to illustrate its practical application.
