The paper introduces a simulation method called Monte Carlo with Intermediate Estimations (CMIE), which aims to provide accurate estimations of dependability measures for highly reliable Markovian systems. It discusses the basis of CMIE, demonstrates the unbiasedness of the corresponding estimator, and shows that its variance is lower than that of the standard estimator. Additionally, it presents a variant of the basic scheme for large and highly reliable multicomponent systems, along with some experimental results.

The use of splitting in the context of highly reliable systems is also examined, particularly in the analysis of repairable systems using a variant called restart. Furthermore, the paper discusses applications of importance sampling methods such as zero-variance and cross-entropy in simulating systems affected by rare events.

Sections 4, 5, and 6 of the paper delve into the properties and features of the proposed method, while Section 7 demonstrates its application to the specific case of Markovian multicomponent systems. Experimental results are presented in Sections 6 and 7, with a comparison with splitting shown in Section 8. Finally, the paper concludes with an overview of future directions in Section 9.

The paper also addresses the complexities related to the choice of intermediate states in the CMIE method and discusses the implications of failure propagation. It concludes that CMIE is not affected by failure propagation and presents empirical comparisons of CMIE with other methods from the literature, demonstrating its efficiency in both variance and precision gain. Additionally, the paper suggests that CMIE can be extended to other types of rare event problems, such as network reliability estimation, under both static and dynamic approaches.
