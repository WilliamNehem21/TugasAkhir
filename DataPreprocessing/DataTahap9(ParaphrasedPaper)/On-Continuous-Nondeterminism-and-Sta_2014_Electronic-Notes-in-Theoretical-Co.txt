The concept of reachability for pointed non-deterministic finite automata (NCAs) was introduced by drawing a parallel with non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs), where a pointed NCA is considered reachable if there are no proper sub-NCAs. While for pointed deterministic finite automata (DFAs), which can be viewed as NCAs with identity closure, reachability is defined in the usual sense, as there is exactly one path from the initial state. However, the same cannot be said for pointed NFAs.

Every pointed NFA has a smallest sub-NFA, which is necessarily reachable. This means that one can discard all states not reachable from the initial states by transitions. From a categorical perspective, this implies that the intersection of all pointed sub-NFAs exists. Similarly, for any pointed NCA, the intersection of all pointed sub-NCAs also exists, enabling the construction of a unique reachable sub-NCA.

For example, if N(l) is an NFA with identity closure, then it is topological. This is the case whenever dl = 2nl, where dl (respectively, nl) is the number of states of a state-minimal DFA (respectively, NFA) accepting l.

If N(l) is topological, then so is N(rev(l)), as they are duals. It is worth noting that N(l) is topological if and only if the closed sets czl form a distributive lattice, and its order-dual is also distributive, isomorphic to czrev(l).
