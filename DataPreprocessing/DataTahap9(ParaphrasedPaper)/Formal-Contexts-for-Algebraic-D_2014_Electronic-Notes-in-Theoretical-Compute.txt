Another research area closely linked to information systems and domain theory is formal concept analysis (FCA), which stems from applied lattice and order theory and was initially developed by Wille. The fundamental principle of classic FCA is to extract the hierarchical structure of concepts present in relational data.

In this study, we examine the representation of algebraic domains using FCA. To achieve this, we introduce the concept of f-approximable concept, which can be considered as a selection of approximable concepts within the constraints of a consistent set applied to a formal context. Additionally, we investigate the relationship between f-approximable concepts and algebraic domains. Our findings reveal that all f-approximable concepts within a formal context constitute an algebraic domain, and conversely, every algebraic domain is isomorphic to the set of f-approximable concepts within a specific formal context.

An algebraic domain comprises all of its compact elements as its basis. Furthermore, a complete lattice is termed an algebraic lattice if it is also an algebraic domain. This paper primarily focuses on algebraic domains, and particularly discusses bounded complete algebraic domains known as Scott domains.
