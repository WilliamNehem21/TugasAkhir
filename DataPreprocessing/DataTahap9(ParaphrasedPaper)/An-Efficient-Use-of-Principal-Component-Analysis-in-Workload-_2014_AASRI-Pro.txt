Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a valuable statistical method widely utilized in various fields such as face recognition, image compression, dimensionality reduction, and computer system performance analysis. It is particularly effective for identifying patterns in high-dimensional data. In this paper, we present an overview of PCA as a versatile approach that can be applied to a range of data analysis techniques. We detail the mathematical foundations of PCA and focus on its application in monitoring system performance. Additionally, we elaborate on the dynamics of eigenvalue-eigenvector analysis, aimed at reducing the computational complexity of experiments, and validate the mathematical theory. To illustrate our points, we provide implementation details of the algorithm and furnish numerical examples using both real-time and synthetic datasets.

Performance evaluation is crucial for assessing the efficacy of a system relative to others. Workload selection is a pivotal aspect of the performance evaluation process, as an inappropriate choice can lead to erroneous conclusions. When evaluating computer architectures, workloads are executed on the system and the execution time is measured. Similarly, new computer designs undergo evaluation using the same method. In cases where a newly designed computer has not yet been manufactured, workload characterization becomes essential. The objective of workload characterization is to describe workload properties using abstract performance metrics known as workload characteristics, which can predict the final performance outcomes.

Principal Component Analysis finds application in numerous domains, including data compression, image processing, visualization, pattern recognition, and time series prediction. Notably, Sirvich and Kirby successfully utilized PCA for human face representation, leading to the decomposition of images into eigenpictures, allowing for image reconstruction using a subset of eigenpictures and their corresponding projections onto the eigenpicture subspace. Moreover, the PCA method has been employed in handprint recognition, human-made object recognition, industrial robotics, and mobile robotics. In workload composition, the selection of the benchmark is critical. Smith introduced a metric based on dynamic program characteristics for the Fortran language, using squared Euclidean distance to measure differences between benchmarks. However, this approach has limitations due to the use of Euclidean distance. To address this, Eeckhout et al. proposed PCA to alleviate the correlation and dependence between variables when measuring program characteristics for multiple benchmarks.
