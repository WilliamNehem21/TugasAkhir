The research focuses on the characterization of biopolymer blend compositions using various analytical techniques. FTIR spectra were used to assign different bands for the two biopolymers and their blends. XRD scans showed broad and sharp peaks, indicating the amorphous nature of PMMA and the semi-crystalline nature of PCL, respectively. UV-vis spectra demonstrated that increasing PCL concentration shifted the position of the sharp edge towards higher wavelength and decreased the energy gap from 5.047 to 4.265 eV, suggesting miscibility between the biopolymer blend. TGA studies revealed that the weight loss of PMMA was higher than that of PCL, implying that the addition of PCL biopolymer increases thermal stability. Overall, the results suggest that an 80/20 PCL/PMMA bioblend concentration may enhance the electrical, structural, and optical properties for potential biological applications.
