The focus of this paper is on freeform path fitting within the context of in-field path planning for agricultural fields. The objective is to minimize the number of transitions between headland paths and interior lanes by optimizing the fitting of interior lanes to non-convex field shapes, including obstacle areas. The motivation for this research stems from the observation that transitions between headland paths and interior lanes often lead to an increase in compacted area and may necessitate undesired hairpin turns in tight angles, particularly for in-field tractors with limited agility. By reducing the number of interior lanes, these detrimental effects can be mitigated. The paper evaluates the potential of freeform path fitting on real-world fields and compares it to the common practice of fitting straight interior lanes.

In the agricultural supply chain, logistics and routing are crucial for improving supply chain efficiency in the production, harvesting, storage, and distribution sectors. Within the production sector, in-field logistics pose challenges due to the diverse shapes of agricultural fields. The complexity of field shapes has been quantified using different indices, and research has shown that field shape characteristics can affect tractor performance measures such as fuel consumption and exhaust emissions.

The paper focuses on the first hierarchical planning layer of in-field logistics, specifically comparing freeform path fitting to the conventional method of fitting straight interior lanes. The research addresses the challenge of minimizing the number of transitions between headland paths and interior lanes by optimizing the fitting of interior lanes to field contours, considering obstacle areas. The paper outlines a method for generating the headland path and obstacle headland paths, selecting a reference path, and iteratively offsetting the reference to generate a grid of interior lanes with the goal of minimizing their total number. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm provides a data-dependent numerical optimization method for selecting optimal reference paths.

Although freeform path fitting requires increased steering along interior lanes, it is noted that this disadvantage may be less relevant in the future with fully automated robotic field coverage. The paper highlights the potential for future research to consider alternative objectives, such as minimizing the total accumulated path length along interior lanes.

In summary, the paper focuses on the optimization of freeform path fitting to minimize the number of transitions between headland paths and interior lanes within agricultural fields. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential to reduce the number of interior lanes as a proxy for achieving this optimization, and future research may explore additional objectives and evaluate the three hierarchical planning layers to determine the optimal grid of interior lanes fitted within field contours.
