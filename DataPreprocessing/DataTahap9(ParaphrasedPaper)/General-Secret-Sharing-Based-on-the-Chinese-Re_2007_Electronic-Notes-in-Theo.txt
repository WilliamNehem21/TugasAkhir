The authorized access structure, denoted as set A, will be referred to as the access structure, and the secret s will be referred to as the "secret." The shares, also known as "shadows," of s are denoted as i1,..., in while the authorized groups are the elements of the set a.

In a perfect secret sharing scheme, the shares of any unauthorized group do not reveal any information about the secret in the information-theoretic sense. Karnin, Greene, and Hellman used the concept of entropy to prove that in any perfect threshold secret sharing scheme, the shares must be at least as long as the secret. Later, Capocelli, De Santis, Gargano, and Vaccaro extended this result to the case of any perfect secret sharing scheme, indicating that in an ideal secret sharing scheme, the shares are as long as the secret.

Goldreich, Ron, and Sudan proposed choosing p0, p1,..., pn as prime numbers of the same size, and Quisquater, Preneel, and Vandewalle demonstrated that by selecting p0, p1,..., pn as consecutive primes, the resulting schemes are asymptotically perfect and asymptotically ideal.

An a-secret sharing scheme will be referred to as a (c, k) compartmented secret sharing scheme in this context. The sets c1, c2,..., cm will be the compartments of the scheme, while the values k1, k2,..., km will be the compartment thresholds and k0 will be the global threshold of the scheme. For technical details, please refer to the work of Quisquater, Preneel, and Vandewalle.
