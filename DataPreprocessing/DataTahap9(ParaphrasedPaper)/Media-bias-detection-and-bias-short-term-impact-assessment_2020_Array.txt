The rise of fake news has become a clear consequence of the current media landscape. The 2016 US presidential election campaign was notably affected by this issue. Fake news is now widely viewed as a significant threat to democracy, free debate, and the integrity of the Western order. To address this, there is a pressing need to restore news reporting to its original principles of neutrality and clarity.

The media holds significant power to shape public opinion and influence daily behaviors. In recent years, concerns about the credibility of news reporting have surfaced, highlighting the necessity of identifying bias in news and developing a platform for receiving balanced and reliable information.

This study makes use of Twitter, a prominent social media platform, to analyze the tweets of popular media outlets and journalists in India. The aim is to investigate how biased opinions are disseminated through social media to influence the network of people consuming this content. The research and proposed model can be expanded to encompass other social media platforms and analyze larger social networks.

The three-stage study begins with an investigation into subjectivity versus objectivity in news reporting, revealing that a substantial portion of media outlets deliver subjective news rather than impartial reporting. Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in all three stages of the study, serving as the basis for classifying and quantifying the polarity of tweets in the dataset.

The study compares different sentiment analysis approaches and suggests that the VADER tool outperforms others in capturing sentiment intensity within the social media domain. The research also explores the impact of media bias on political views and behavior, as well as the influence of media exposure on public opinions.

Furthermore, the study introduces a method to determine if news consumers have been conditioned by analyzing the difference between their current sentiment values and their previous average sentiment values. This approach aims to assess the extent and nature of conditioning in news consumption.

In conclusion, the study highlights the need for unbiased and neutral news reporting and proposes a method for detecting biased reporting using Twitter data. It emphasizes the influential role of journalists and the impact of their tweets on public opinion, emphasizing the importance of identifying influential journalists to preserve societal free will. The research also underscores the conditioning of opinions by media outlets and the need to develop a platform for safe and objective news reporting.
