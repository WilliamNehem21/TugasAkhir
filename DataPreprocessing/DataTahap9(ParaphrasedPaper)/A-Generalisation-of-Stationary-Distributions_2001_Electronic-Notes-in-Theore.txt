The primary focus of our contribution (outlined in section 3) is to provide a set of axioms that explain stationary behavior and its convergence. This approach expands and streamlines the traditional concept. Our generalized convergence concept is not limited to specific instances but is applicable to all Markov processes, offering a comprehensive framework that links stationary behavior to average long-term behavior. Further elaboration on this can be found in section 5.
