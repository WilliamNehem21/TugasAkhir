The study aimed to address the challenges in using optical sensors for predicting wheat yield at a field scale. The authors developed an approach that integrates various methods to fill in missing data caused by cloud coverage and to predict wheat yield using machine learning techniques. They hypothesized that by using a gapfill method to estimate cloudy pixels and machine learning methods to learn the relationship between NDVI and winter wheat yield, they could improve the prediction accuracy. The study used datasets from three years and employed various machine learning models and ensemble methods to predict wheat yield.

The study faced several challenges, including cloud coverage obstructing sensor images, the absence of long-term crop yield data, and the complex relationship between predictor and response variables. The authors used the gapfill algorithm to restore NDVI variables from high spatial and temporal resolution S2 sensor data. They also incorporated observations from cloud-restored images for wheat yield prediction.

The study utilized several machine learning techniques, including k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, and ensemble methods, in its analysis. The authors assessed the performance of the models using root mean squared error (RMSE) and scatter plot analysis.

The study found that the gapfill method and machine learning techniques showed promise in predicting wheat yield. However, they also observed overfitting in some models and underfitting in others, indicating the need for further refinement and tuning of the models.

The authors also discussed the potential impact of the restoration process on the regression analysis and identified the importance of the cloud percentage per subset in obtaining fully restored images. They emphasized the limitations of working with a small dataset and the challenges of implementing machine learning methods in such scenarios.

Overall, the study demonstrated the potential of using optical sensors and machine learning techniques for predicting wheat yield at a field scale. However, it also highlighted the need for further research to address challenges and improve the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
