The conventional entities involved in an authenticated key exchange, typically referred to as Alice and Bob, are joined by a trusted server. In this setup, Alice and Bob are assumed to have pre-existing long-term key shares with the server, denoted by symbols a, b, and s, and shared keys kas, kbs, and kab. 

To address the limitation of scalability in the one-time ID system, where a secret key is assumed to have been shared between Alice and Bob prior to any key exchange, we propose a new system that incorporates a trusted server. In this newly proposed system, a secret key is assumed to have been already shared between a user and a server beforehand, enabling secure communication between users without the need for pre-shared secrets with individual partners.

The proposed system relies on a set of assumptions, such as each principal sharing a long-term secret with the server, knowing their own Diffie-Hellman public key, the freshness of their own Diffie-Hellman public key, and possessing their own Diffie-Hellman private key. These assumptions are derived from the properties of a one-time ID, which can only be used once, as well as the belief of the server and the users regarding the freshness and authenticity of certain identifiers.

Furthermore, the paper introduces a scalable authenticated Diffie-Hellman-based key agreement protocol using a trusted third party, which incorporates one-time ID to achieve anonymity in the application layer. The protocol is analyzed using SVO logic, demonstrating its ability to meet authentication goals. Additionally, the paper addresses the one-time ID synchronization problem and proposes a solution for this issue.
