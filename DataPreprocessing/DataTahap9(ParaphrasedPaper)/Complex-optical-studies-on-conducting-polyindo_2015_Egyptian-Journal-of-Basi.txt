Currently, there is a growing research focus on the synthesis of conducting polymers such as polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), and polythiophene (PTH) due to their high electrical conductivity, interesting electrochemical properties, and ease of processing. These conducting polymers hold promise for various commercial applications, including battery materials, electrochromic devices, sensor technology, and nonlinear optics. Polyindole (PIN) has garnered significant research interest among various aromatic compound-based conducting polymers due to its structural similarities with the aforementioned polymers. This paper aims to provide a systematic report on the novel optical study of as-synthesized PIN through a chemical route using the oxidant FeCl3 at room temperature. Notably, there is no existing literature on the complex optical study of PIN synthesized using FeCl3 as an oxidant. The synthesized materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) analysis, and UV-Vis spectroscopy.

The optical band gap of PIN with varying concentrations of FeCl3 was determined in the energy range of 4.630-5.224 eV. The observed optical band gap values indicate the potential of this material. Furthermore, the refractive index of the as-synthesized material decreases with increasing photon energy, indicating normal dispersion behavior. The variation in refractive index values with photon energy suggests an interaction between photons and electrons, making the material suitable for fabricating optoelectronic devices. The decrease in extinction coefficient and refractive index with increasing photon energy may be linked to an increase in absorption coefficient and a decrease in transmittance. Notably, the real part of the dielectric constant decreases rapidly at higher photon energies but gradually at lower energies, while the imaginary part decreases gradually with increasing photon energy.

In summary, this work discusses the complex optical properties of as-synthesized PIN samples with varying FeCl3 concentrations as an oxidant through chemical polymerization at room temperature. Characterization confirmed the amorphous nature of the synthesized material through XRD and FE-SEM analysis. The absorption spectrum of the as-synthesized PIN samples was analyzed in the range of 200-500 nm to determine optical parameters. These samples exhibited absorption in the 220-300 nm range, with the lowest energy band gap of 4.6302 eV observed for PIN with 0.6 M FeCl3. UV-Vis studies allowed for the determination of optical constants, including extinction coefficient, refractive index, real dielectric constant, and imaginary dielectric constant. The optical conductivity increased with increasing wavelength, attributed to increased absorption in the material with 0.6 M FeCl3.
