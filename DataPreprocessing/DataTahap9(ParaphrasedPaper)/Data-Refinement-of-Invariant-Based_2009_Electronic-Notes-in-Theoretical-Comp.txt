Invariant-based programming entails beginning program construction by identifying all fundamental situations—such as pre-and post-conditions, as well as loop invariants—that may occur during algorithm execution. These situations are established prior to any code being written. From there, transitions between the situations are identified, dictating the program's flow of control. Data refinement is a technique used to develop correct programs that operate on concrete data structures as refinements of more abstract programs working on abstract data types. This paper investigates data refinement for invariant-based programs and applies it to the development of the classical Deutsch-Schorr-Waite graph marking algorithm. The results are formally articulated and mechanically proven using the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover.

Invariant-based programming focuses on determining and describing all basic situations that may emerge during program execution, before any code is written. This approach prioritizes transitions between situations in controlling the program's flow, while simultaneously verifying these transitions during their inception. The correctness of the program is thus established as an integral part of its construction process.

Control structures are subsidiary to the situation structure, and may not necessarily adhere to the classic single-entry, single-exit constructs. An invariant diagram explicitly exhibits all the necessary information to verify the program's correctness, including pre-and post-conditions, invariants, transitions, and termination functions.

Formal methods have been successfully taught using invariant-based programming as an introductory approach to computer science courses at the university level. Students have demonstrated an aptitude for constructing programs that are inherently correct using this approach, and have appreciated the enhanced understanding it provides regarding program operation. Challenges encountered are primarily associated with formally describing intuitively comprehended situations using predicate calculus.

Execution of an invariant-based program may commence in any situation (not exclusively in an initial situation), in a state that adheres to the situation's constraints. Subsequently, one of the enabled transitions in this situation is selected and executed, leading to a new state in another situation. This process continues, with execution progressing from situation to situation until termination is achieved.

An invariant-based program is considered consistent if each transition preserves the constraints of the relevant situation. Additionally, it is terminating if every execution of the program eventually concludes. The paper explores the semantics and proof theory for invariant-based programs in thorough detail.

Data refinement, a technique for constructing correct programs working on concrete data structures as refinements of more abstract programs, is delved into in this paper. The complexity of correctness proofs is typically lower when employing data refinement as opposed to directly developing the final program on the concrete data structure. The study illustrates the adaptation of data refinement to the construction of invariant-based programs and extends the concept of nested invariant diagrams to facilitate the description of data refinement. Theoretical advancements in the realm of invariant-based programs are presented, including methods for executing data refinement, with all associated theorems mechanically proven in Isabelle/HOL.

Proof obligations that emerged during the development process were formalized and mechanically proven in Isabelle/HOL. Notably, the refinement process in the case study was entirely executed using invariant diagrams, and the approach of initially proving a generalized version of the algorithm significantly reduced the overall proof effort.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the proof theory for invariant-based programs, while Section 3 outlines the process of carrying out data refinement of invariant diagrams. The construction of the Deutsch-Schorr-Waite algorithm as an invariant-based program is detailed in Section 4, and finally, Section 5 provides concluding remarks.

Data refinement has emerged as a robust tool for developing software systems. It is often valuable to commence the development of a complex program with an abstract program on an abstract data structure, and progressively refine it to a more concrete program functioning on a concrete data structure. This approach splits the overall proof work into smaller, more manageable tasks.

Data refinement is frequently utilized to implement a data module with information hiding. The module's specification defines the impact of access procedures using abstract variables, while the module's implementation is based on concrete variables to optimize efficiency. If data refinement can be proven for all access methods, then any user of the module will perceive no difference and may interact with the module while reasoning about its behavior as if it were implemented using the abstract variables.

In summary, the paper presents the application of data refinement techniques to construct the classical Deutsch-Schorr-Waite marking algorithm as an invariant-based program. The algorithm facilitates the marking of all reachable nodes in an arbitrary directed graph utilizing minimal additional memory and is achieved through multiple data refinement steps. The overall proof effort is simplified using the presented methodology, with all results formally proven using the Isabelle/HOL interactive theorem prover, underscoring the solidity of the findings. Ongoing work includes incorporating data refinement into the Socos environment, specifically designed to support the construction of invariant-based programs and the verification of their correctness.
