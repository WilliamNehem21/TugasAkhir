The paper discusses the limitations and trade-offs involved in nonclassical theories, particularly those related to instantaneous signaling and the presence of entangled states within composite systems. It also presents findings on bit commitment and teleportation tasks within the framework of ordered linear spaces. Additionally, the paper explores the idea of constructing categories of processes axiomatically, considering categories enriched over ordered linear spaces or abstract state spaces. This approach is seen as a step toward comparing the informational properties of theories obtained in the convex framework with properties used in categorical descriptions of information processing. The section of the paper discussing this idea is presented as work early in collaboration with other researchers.
