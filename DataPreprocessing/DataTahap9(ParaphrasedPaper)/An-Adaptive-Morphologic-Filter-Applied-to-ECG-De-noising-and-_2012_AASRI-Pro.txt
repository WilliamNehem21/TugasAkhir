The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an electrical signal that is detected using a specific device and method and is crucial for diagnosing various heart diseases. However, it is often affected by different types of noise. This paper presents an adaptive morphological filter designed to eliminate power line interference from ECG signals, thereby addressing the limitations of previous morphological methods. Additionally, this filter enables the extraction of R-peaks in the ECG for further analysis. The high speed of this method allows for real-time denoising of ECG signals and extraction of R-peaks, making it an effective approach for monitoring patients during surgeries.

Mathematical morphology (MM) is a mathematical branch based on set theory, topology, and random functions. Structuring elements, such as points, lines, and circles, are fundamental concepts of mathematical morphology. Erosion and dilation are two basic morphological operators, with opening and closing operations being defined through the transformation of these. The paper defines the morphological operations for interference in noisy ECG signals and discusses the results obtained from these operations with respect to signal quality and noise reduction.

To validate the suitability of the proposed algorithm for ECG signals, real ECG signals from a hospital in Taiwan are utilized. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology.

The paper introduces a new ECG denoising method that combines morphology with an adaptive filter using the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm. This method addresses the drawback of the morphology technique cutting down the R-peaks in ECG signals and effectively suppresses power line interference while minimizing the loss of useful information in the ECG signal. Additionally, the LMS algorithm is employed to reduce noise in the R-peaks obtained from the morphology. Finally, the morphology method is applied to extract the QRS wave from the denoised signal, facilitating real-time processing of R-R interval. However, the selection of appropriate structuring elements to accommodate individual differences remains a challenging aspect for future work.
