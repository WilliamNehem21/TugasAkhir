The 21st century industry is marked by intense global competition among companies, leading to a shorter product lifespan due to changing consumer demands. To stay competitive, companies must rapidly respond to these evolving demands, which presents the challenge of implementing new methodologies that enable adaptability and flexibility in mass production while maintaining high product variability and large production volumes. This has led to considerable interest in innovating production systems and integrating new technologies, known as industrial revolutions, with the current one being Industry 4.0 (I4.0).

However, the adoption of these technologies in the industry is still relatively low compared to academic research due to the complexity of implementing proper solutions and technologies in real environments, where unique and difficult challenges may arise. Despite the industry's interest in updating production systems based on I4.0 principles, technology acceptance remains slow, mainly due to the emergent nature and low technology readiness level (TRL) of these technologies, as well as their immaturity and lack of proper integration and validation in real industrial situations.

To address these issues, this paper conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) on artificial immune systems (AIS) applications in advanced manufacturing systems (AMS). The review aims to collect and analyze scientific contributions on AIS applications in multiple research areas to address various problems and assess the level of autonomy introduced to the system based on a taxonomy of system autonomy presented by Peres et al.

Germany's manufacturing industry is highly competitive, benefiting from its expertise in innovative manufacturing technologies, machinery and plant manufacturing, ICT competencies, and embedded systems and automation engineering. It has taken a structured and integrative approach for the implementation of advanced manufacturing technologies to leverage their individual and systemic benefits. This led to the introduction of the term "Industrie 4.0" at the Hannover Fair in 2011, with the Industrie 4.0 working group presenting a final report in 2013, stating that I4.0 is a strategic initiative to secure the future of the German manufacturing industry.

Similar initiatives to deploy advanced manufacturing systems into the industry have been recognized in other countries, such as the U.S. Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition (SMLC), Chinese Made in China 2025 (MIC25), French Usine du Futur, British Catapult, and Korean Industry Innovation 3.0. The convergence of the online world with industrial production has introduced a paradigm shift, with leaders in the digital domain poised to take the lead in industrial production. Consequently, there has been a dramatic increase in research support for I4.0, making it a top priority for research centers, universities, and companies.

The advent of advanced manufacturing technologies (AMTs) involves integrating computational and physical processes and connecting billions of objects over the Internet, often supported by modern cyber-physical systems (CPS), the Internet of Things (IoT), and other related technologies. However, defining AMS and AMT becomes challenging due to the overlapping terminologies and concepts, including embedded systems, IoT, multi-agent systems (MAS), CPS, industrial networks, wireless sensor and actuator networks, and digital twin (DT).

MAS is based on a society of intelligent, cooperative, proactive, and autonomous entities called agents, derived from the field of distributed artificial intelligence. AI manufacturing processes employ computationally processable models, such as data-based, physical-based, numerical-based, or discrete-based, to realize the full potential of decision support. Data-driven models involve the analysis of sensor data to discover hidden patterns, employing various AI algorithms such as machine learning methods or bio-inspired computation.

Cloud and edge computing have become essential in addressing the constraints of wireless devices and enabling real-time data processing and storage needs. Industrial robots, including collaborative robots, have emerged as key components in modern manufacturing, with the potential to be autonomous and adapt their behavior without human intervention. Furthermore, biologically inspired computation aims to solve engineering and computation problems by generating solutions inspired by biological processes from the natural world.

The literature review also reveals various AI applications in multiple research areas and application domains within AMS, including anomaly detection, optimization problems, and fault diagnosis. Most significantly, the research identifies a gap in the comprehensive exploration of AI models applied to different application contexts and research categories within AMS, highlighting the need for this systematic review.

The review identified the need for a comprehensive study of AI models applied to different application contexts and research categories within AMS, which provides readers with a complete understanding of the role of AI in industrial scenarios. The review also highlights the prevalence of research conducted as proof of concept, relying on datasets, simulation environments, or demonstrations in laboratory settings, with an average technology readiness level between 3 and 4.

In conclusion, the paper emphasizes the need for increased research on the application of AI models in advanced manufacturing systems and their potential impact on system autonomy, scalability, security, and standardization within AMS. By filling the identified research gaps, this study aims to provide a holistic understanding of the role of AI in industrial scenarios and pave the way for future developments in the field.
