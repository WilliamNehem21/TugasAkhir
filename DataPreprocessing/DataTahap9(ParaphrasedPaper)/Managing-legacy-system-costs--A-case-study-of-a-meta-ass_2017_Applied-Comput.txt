In summary, it is important to note several key observations about the meta-model discussed in this paper. Firstly, it is noteworthy that nearly all individual outcomes from the finco respondents align with the HBV-LTV quadrant in the decisional matrix, despite their diverse knowledge. This pattern also holds true for both the consolidated response and the consolidated response after excluding answers from the maintainability section. Therefore, it can be concluded that despite significant variations in the technical knowledge of assessment participants, the results demonstrate a high level of consistency in the output of the meta-model.
