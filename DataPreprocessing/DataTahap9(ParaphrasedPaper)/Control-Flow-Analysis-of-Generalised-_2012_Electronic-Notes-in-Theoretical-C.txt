In the realm of regulation, it is often observed that regulators behave differently when certain threshold values are exceeded. Despite its simplicity, logical abstraction captures the nonlinear nature of network behavior. The overall state evolves to the next state through a series of functions that determine the subsequent state of each gene based on the current state of the regulating genes.

Petri net theory, previously utilized in systems biology, has been employed to analyze the dynamics of regulatory networks in various studies, such as those mentioned in [7, 27, 28], where logical models are translated into Petri nets to take advantage of their useful characteristics. Process algebras offer an alternative framework for analyzing the dynamics of regulatory networks and have been effectively used to model different biological systems, as evident in the works cited in [23, 25, 24, 9, 10, 11, 5, 22, 8], among others. These works operate under the notion that a biological system can be abstractly modeled as a concurrent system. Our approach aims to utilize process algebras for the modeling and analysis of gene regulatory networks (GRNs).

Boolean networks (BNs) were introduced in biology to model GRNs, which represent the network of interactions between genes that govern protein synthesis. A Boolean network consists of entities that mutually regulate each other in a positive or negative manner. Each gene's state, viewed as a regulatory entity, is denoted by a Boolean value, representing its activity (1) or inactivity (0). The global state of a Boolean network, comprising n genes, is represented as an n-dimensional vector of Boolean variables, one for each gene. Transition to the next state is determined by a set of n Boolean functions, each acting on a single variable and defining the subsequent state based on the current state of the regulating genes.

While BNs and their generalized versions are typically used to infer genetic regulatory networks based on partial biological knowledge, generalized Boolean networks (GBNs) can also describe metabolic networks, where a broader range of concentration values is possible. It is valuable to investigate the conditions that facilitate the attainment of threshold values by the species of interest.

For instance, the differentiation process of two cell lineages, namely T-helper 1 and 2 (Th1 and Th2, respectively) from the common precursor Th0, illustrates the intricate regulation of T-helpers' roles in the mammalian immune system. This differentiation is finely regulated by various molecules, such as interleukins and interferons, produced by T-helpers themselves or by other cell types including monocytes and dendritic cells. For a detailed understanding of T-helper lymphocytes and their immune system role, the reader is referred to additional resources.

To illustrate our formalism and demonstrate the application of the CFA, we present a computation example and validate the consistency of our model by comparing our computational and analytical results with those presented elsewhere. Finally, we illustrate how our method can provide insights into the roles played by the network elements.
