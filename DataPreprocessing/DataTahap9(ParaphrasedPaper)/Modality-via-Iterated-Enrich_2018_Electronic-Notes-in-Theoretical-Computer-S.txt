This study explores modal type theories using a novel categorical semantics known as change-of-base semantics, which is based on iterated enrichment and interpretation of modality as hom objects. The relationship between meta and object levels in multi-staged computation in our semantics corresponds to the relationship between enriching and enriched categories, allowing for a categorical explanation of situations where meta and object logics may differ. We demonstrate how fitch-style modal type theory can be interpreted directly in iterated enrichment of categories, revealing its relationship with dual-context calculus. Additionally, we describe how linear temporal, S4, and linear exponential modalities can be articulated in terms of change-of-base semantics. Furthermore, we show that the change-of-base semantics can be extended to multi-staged effectful computation and generalized contextual modality. This paper addresses the question raised in a 2011 survey paper by de Paiva and Ritter regarding a categorical model for fitch-style type theory.

The dual-context system, originally introduced to study exponentials of linear logic, has been refined to accommodate more logics, including intuitionistic K and S4. Judgments in dual-context systems involve two contexts separated by "|", with the left side referred to as the modal context. Similar to fitch-style, only the right-hand side context is used when deriving non-modal constructs. The box of the dual-context system is characterized by two rules.

Formalizing the notion of infinitely iteratively enriched categories presents a mathematical challenge, particularly when modeling infinitely many universes of logic. While constructing concrete chains of iterated enrichment suffice for calculi with finitely many levels, generalizing finite iteration of enrichment to infinite is a more complex task.

We present two constructions of infinitely enriched categories, both of which are finite approximate constructions capable of generating finitely enriched categories of any length. However, they cannot produce one with infinitely many non-trivial enrichments. Notably, finite approximation is adequate for modeling the type theory, as any context stack cannot be infinitely high. Finding generic construction methods of truly infinitely enriched categories remains an important future endeavor.

We then proceed to construct (cartesian) infinitely enriched categories, leveraging the operation of kleisli lifting on a finite-product-preserving self-distributive comonad over a cartesian closed category. This operation can be repeated arbitrarily for finitely many times, allowing for the iteration of the operation to produce a (cartesian) infinitely enriched category. It is worth mentioning that cartesian doubly enriched categories arising from the Yoneda embedding have been utilized for the categorical semantics of higher-order abstract syntax and the study of natural languages.

The investigation also extends the semantics to effectful computation, addressing the challenge of formal semantics for modal type theories with effects due to the fact that a Kleisli category is not a monoidal category in general. The authors express gratitude to their colleague Hiroki Kobayashi for valuable discussions and comments on an early draft of the paper, as well as to the members of SLACS 2017 and CSCAT 2018 for their criticism and encouragement.

Defining higher-dimensional monoidal structures is a challenging task, and a definition of monoidal objects in terms of gray monoids is provided in a previous work. By the coherence theorem of tricategories, it is possible to define monoidal objects in any monoidal 2-category as well. For simplicity, the focus is restricted to monoidal (strict) 2-categories in the subsequent discussion.
