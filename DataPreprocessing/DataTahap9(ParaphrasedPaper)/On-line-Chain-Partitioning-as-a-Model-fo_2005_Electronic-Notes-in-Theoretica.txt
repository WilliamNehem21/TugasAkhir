The paper discusses the problem of scheduling tasks with specific relations between them, where each task must be computed by a single processor in real-time. The objective is to minimize the number of processors used, and the authors aim to leverage additional knowledge about task relations to achieve this goal. The paper introduces a rule for scheduling independent tasks to different processors, and presents the problem as a two-person game involving task assignment.

The authors prove that the nearest-fit algorithm provides an optimal solution for on-line chain partitioning of up-growing interval orders when given its representation. However, the algorithm does not work for interval orders without representation, which leads to the need for new algorithms. The paper also presents a lower bound for the up-growing version of the problem.

The paper establishes the concept of partially ordered sets and defines chain partitioning as the process of partitioning a set into non-intersecting chains such that the partition has the minimum number of chains. The paper also relates on-line chain partitioning of a poset to the scheduling of tasks and explains how scheduling can be considered as chain partitioning.

The authors discuss the game theoretic aspects of the problem and propose algorithms for solving the chain partitioning problem for interval orders with and without representation. They also suggest the need to design new algorithms for interval posets when presented without their interval representation, as well as address open problems related to this.

The paper concludes by highlighting the practical relevance of the proposed algorithms in scheduling tasks in a common environment with an additional time dimension and presents scenarios and strategies for on-line chain partitioning in various contexts.
