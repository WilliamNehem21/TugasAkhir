Model checking is a highly effective technique used for system verification, allowing for the verification of formal specifications of desired properties against a system's behavior model. While model checking has been extensively studied in the context of classical point-based temporal logics, its exploration in the interval logic setting remains largely uncharted. In recent work, interval temporal logic (ITL) has been proposed as a natural and expressive formalism for temporal representation and reasoning, exhibiting high expressiveness suitable for various computer science applications, such as computational linguistics and formal verification.

This study specifically focuses on the model checking problem for Halpern and Shoham logic (HS) and its related fragments, which has received relatively less attention compared to model checking for LTL or CTL. In the traditional formulation of model checking, systems are represented as labeled state-transition graphs (Kripke structures), and point-based temporal logics are employed to analyze how proposition letters labeling the states evolve along each path in the graph. However, in HS model checking, the interpretation of finite paths of a Kripke structure as intervals plays a crucial role in verifying interval properties of computations.

The third condition of Definition 2.10 stipulates that no two subtrees, with their roots as siblings, can be isomorphic. A descriptor for a track in the form of a b0-descriptor consists solely of its root and is denoted as root(d), while a descriptor element refers to the label of a node.

The algorithm is generally incomplete as its purpose is to identify counterexamples to relevant properties rather than exhaustively analyze all system behaviors. The approach involves considering only selected representative computations that satisfy a bounded number of cyclic subtracks, leading to a reduction in the spatial complexity of the algorithm at the expense of completeness. It is anticipated that this modified algorithm can be readily implemented and utilized for practical purposes.
