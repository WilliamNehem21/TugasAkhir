Car manufacturers are increasingly utilizing the Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) framework to integrate more comfort and security applications. To ensure efficient data transmission in VANET due to the high mobility of nodes, an appropriate communication protocol is crucial. VANET nodes move rapidly through fixed internet gateways to forward data before disconnection from the network as they move out of wireless coverage. A link reliability model is employed to predict the formation and disruption of wireless links among nodes.

Yi et al. studied the Security-Aware Ad Hoc Routing (SAR) protocol, which incorporates trust values and relationships. Their investigation revealed varying percentages of message packets transmitted by unauthorized and malicious nodes, exposing security flaws in ad-hoc network communication.

Sanzgiri et al. introduced the Authenticated Routing Protocol for Ad Hoc Networks (ARAN) as a solution to security issues utilizing cryptographic public-key certificates. While ARAN is as effective as AODV in maintaining and discovering routes, it uses larger packets resulting in higher overall routing overhead.

Shurman et al. proposed a novel mechanism to empower source nodes with computational capabilities to authenticate the origin of routing reply (RREP) messages. The method allowed the node to compute the safest route to the destination, yet it introduced routing delays of varying magnitudes. However, this approach only considered single-node attacks and not group attacks.

Dokurer et al. addressed the group attack problem by suggesting the disregard of the first route to counter the black hole attack, assuming the first RREP message might be from a malicious node. Despite widespread agreement, this method ignored the possibility of a malicious node sending a second RREP message, leaving the network susceptible to black hole attacks without a mechanism to identify and eliminate attacker nodes.

The Vehicular Ad Hoc Network is vulnerable to all-weather attacks from nodes within the radio range, including passive eavesdropping, information leakage, gray hole, black hole, worm hole, and denial of service. This paper's focus is on detecting and preventing black hole attacks.

To analyze vehicle movements on a highway, the freeway mobility model is employed, simulating a bidirectional multi-lane highway. The proposed algorithm is tested on NCTUns and compared with AODV, DSR, and BAODV (AODV with black hole attack) using various simulation parameters.
