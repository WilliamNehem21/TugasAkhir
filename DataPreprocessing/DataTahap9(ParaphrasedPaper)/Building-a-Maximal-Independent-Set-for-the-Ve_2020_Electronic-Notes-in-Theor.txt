The paper examines the vertex-coloring problem specifically within planar graphs and suggests that classic wheels and polyhedral wheels should be considered as fundamental patterns for planar graphs. The colorability of compositions involving wheels is analyzed, and a new algorithm based on three rules for the vertex-coloring problem is introduced. These rules involve selecting vertices in the frontier, processing subsumed wheels, and processing centers of the graph.

In this study, we present what we believe to be the fundamental graph patterns that constitute any planar graph, which we have termed polyhedral wheels. We explore compositions among polyhedral wheels and analyze their chromatic number. We propose a novel method for determining the colorability of classic and polyhedral wheels.

Let g=(v, e) denote an undirected simple graph with v as the vertex set and e as the set of edges. The paper assumes familiarity with standard terminology and notation in graph theory and planar graphs specifically. The class of wheels is expanded to include any polygon as an axle face of the wheel, leading to the concept of a polyhedral wheel. A polyhedral wheel of a planar graph g is represented as a cycle in its internal-face graph gf.

An acyclic graph is treated as a tree, with each vertex referred to as a node. It is known that an acyclic graph is 2-colorable. However, considering that any vertex of an acyclic graph has restricted any color from any of the 3 colors of three, the acyclic graph is 3-colorable. When the internal-face graph gf is a tree, then the corresponding planar graph g is referred to as a polygonal tree. The paper explains a theorem related to efficient procedures for the 3-coloring of a polygonal tree based on the order for visiting all faces from the planar graph.

Previous works have focused on recognizing 3-coloring patterns based on the length of cycles, while this paper presents a different analysis for recognizing the 3 or 4-colorable topologies in planar graphs. The focus is primarily on the recognition of the topologies formed by the union of polyhedral wheels in order to design a coloring algorithm.

The paper introduces theorem 5.4, which includes the forbidden existence of k4 and any other classic wheel in the resulting graph gj. If gj is a polygonal tree, then a 3-coloring is constructed. Otherwise, different algorithms can be proposed to build a 3-coloring for gj.

The algorithm presented involves two steps: processing wheels that subsume other wheels, and selecting vertices in the frontier. The process of building every cycle of the wheels employs a breadth first search procedure and has a time complexity of O(m). Subsequently, comparisons are made between the cycles of each wheel, with a worst-case scenario of at most n^2 comparisons.
