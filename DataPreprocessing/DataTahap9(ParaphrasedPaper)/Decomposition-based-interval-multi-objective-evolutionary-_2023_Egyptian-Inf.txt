The paper discusses Interval Multi-objective Optimization Problems (IMOPs) and the increasing attention they are receiving from researchers due to the ease of obtaining interval information for uncertain parameters. It focuses on the approach of designing IMOPs by defining the interval Pareto dominance relation for direct solving. The paper reviews various methods proposed by different researchers for defining the interval Pareto dominance relation, such as using interval upper and lower limits, interval confidence level, and interval probability dominance relationship. Additionally, it introduces algorithms and strategies, such as Interval Cooperative Multi-objective Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm, IMOMA-II, and an adaptive weight vector adjustment strategy.

The paper then presents the proposed adaptive weight vector adjustment strategy, which considers the sparsity and uncertainty of interval parameters to ensure the distribution and convergence of the population. It introduces the II-MOEA algorithm, which is based on Pareto dominance and interval confidence level, as well as the IMOEAD algorithm, an adaptive reference vector-based interval multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The experimental results and analysis are presented in one section, and the paper concludes with discussions on the challenges and future research directions.
