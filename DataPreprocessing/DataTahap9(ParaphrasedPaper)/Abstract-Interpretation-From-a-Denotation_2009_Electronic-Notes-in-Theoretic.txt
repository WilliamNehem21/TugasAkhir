Abstract interpretation and denotational semantics have common underpinnings and practical uses and there is a complex relationship between the two fields. The inverse-limit construction and its associated Scott-topology demonstrate how to create abstract domains as structural approximations of Scott-domains defined by inverse limits. The inductive nature of denotational semantics definitions guarantees the correctness of the resultant abstract interpretation, with the abstract domain taking the place of the Scott-domain. Thus, abstract interpretation can be elucidated from the standpoint of denotational semantics.
