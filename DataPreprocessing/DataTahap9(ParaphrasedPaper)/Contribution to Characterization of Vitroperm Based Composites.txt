The study investigated the characteristics of vitroperm (Fe73Cu1Nb3Si16B7) 800 flaky powder, focusing on granulometric composition, particle morphology, density, and resistivity. Composites based on this powder and phenol-formaldehyde thermosetting resin were prepared, and the physical properties of five different types of composites with varying resin content were analyzed. The microstructure, mechanical, and electrical properties of the composites were also examined. The findings indicated that the physical properties of the composites were influenced by the technology of preparation and the microstructure of the composite.

Two separate composite powders were prepared: a) VPM powder was dry mixed with 5%, 10%, and 30% of PFR-ATM, and the mixture was homogenized with acetone additive and then dried (referred to as VPM/ATM); b) Phenol-formaldehyde resin (PFRGT) was modified with glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GLYMO) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), and then dissolved in tetrahydrofuran. VPM powder was added to this solution, which was then mixed until the solvent evaporated, resulting in a composite powder with 3% PFRGT (referred to as VPM/PFRGT).

Optical examination, including both normal and polarized light images, was used to visually separate the pores, resin, and vitroperm matrix. The resin was found to electrically insulate conductive particles and create a mechanical bond after curing, with the shape of the pores closely resembling that of the vitroperm particles. The distribution of the resin was found to be influenced by the size and shape of the vitroperm particles, with a more homogeneous distribution observed in the case of VPM/10ATM compared to VPM/5ATM. Additionally, the VPM/3PFRGT composite showed the closest ordering of the VPM particles and the lowest porosity.

Overall, increasing the resin content led to an increase in the mechanical properties of the composites, with the VPM/3PFRGT sample exhibiting the highest mechanical strength. This outcome was attributed to the chemical stabilization of the resin with the addition of GLYMO and TEOS, as opposed to the dispersed solid filler used in the PFR-ATM composites. The volume resistivity of the composite material was found to increase with the resin content, resulting in lower porosity and better bonding of the powder particles.

The physical properties of the vitroperm 800 powder and vitroperm-based composites were thoroughly examined. It was observed that the physical properties of the composites, which are based on vitroperm with a bond-insulation resin phase, were influenced by the resin content, filler content, and in-situ modification of the resin structure. The findings suggested that a compromise between resin content and filler content, as well as chemical modification of resin composition and optimization of the curing cycle, could lead to improved physical properties of the composites.
