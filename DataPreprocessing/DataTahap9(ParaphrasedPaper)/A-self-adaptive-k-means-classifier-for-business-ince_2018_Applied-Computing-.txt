The study by Mok et al. introduces an interactive genetic algorithm (IGA) for personalized fashion design, allowing customers to create their own designs with ease. However, it is noted that busy customers may not have the time to create new designs themselves. Additionally, the paper mentions a trend of customers sending money to designers and expecting them to deliver suitable designs. Furthermore, the use of set-theoretic qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) was employed to identify consistent patterns across various cases.

The paper emphasizes the importance of considering not only the artistic aspect but also the commercial implications in fashion design, as suggested by Jacobs et al. It delves into analyzing the attributes that could lead to better business gains for designers, providing insights into the designs preferred by customers and those that attract the highest patronage. The findings highlight the significance of style, fabric, and color combinations in projecting creativity in fashion design and positioning designers as entrepreneurial and creative.

The rest of the paper is organized into various sections that include a literature overview of data mining in the fashion industry, market incentives for fashion designers, the implementation and results, and concluding remarks with suggestions for future work.

The study also introduces a new form of Linear Regression Coefficient (LRC) that is balanced for a low-dimensional excessive number of data. Additionally, it presents a Global Linear Regression Coefficient (GLRC) classifier that calculates the GLRC using test sample vectors and whole class subspaces for classification. The use of K-means with Dynamic Reduction through Homogeneous Clusters (DRHC) is also discussed, indicating the evolving nature of data mining techniques.

Industrial design is described as the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications to optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of users and manufacturers. The roles of industrial designers encompass various aspects such as problem-solving, creative design solutions, and brand development.

Customers are said to have the option to choose from original designs to create entirely new designs or combine different parts of existing designs to form a new product. This process involves selecting original designs for different components, such as tops and skirts, and making adjustments or additions to create combined designs.

The paper also touches upon the assignment of data to clusters based on mean vectors, as well as the need for further research to explore additional criteria that could contribute to fashion business development. It highlights the importance of conducting more comprehensive analyses with a larger volume of data to obtain more precise results. Moreover, it suggests that future research should focus on investigating other factors relevant to fashion business development.
