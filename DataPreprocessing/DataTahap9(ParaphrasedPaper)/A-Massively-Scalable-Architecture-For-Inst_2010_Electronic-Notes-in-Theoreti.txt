This paper examines the scalability of instant messaging and presence (IM&P) architectures by employing a queueing-based modeling and analysis approach to identify the bottlenecks in the current IM&P architecture at the Dutch social network Hyves. Three alternative architectures, namely evolutionary partitioning, aggregated batched presence updates, and presence subscriptions, are also analyzed to determine their scalability. The authors utilize the Hierarchical Evaluation Tool (HIT) to analytically create and assess models, and based on their findings, they propose a new architecture that offers improved scalability compared to the current one.

The study emphasizes the importance of timely message forwarding and exchange of presences in IM&P architectures, particularly in meeting user expectations for instantaneous response. The existing IM&P architecture at Hyves is noted to be adequate for the current workload, but concerns are raised regarding its ability to handle a tenfold increase in the future.

The paper outlines the modeling and analysis approach, presents details of the current IM&P architecture and its bottlenecks, describes three alternative architectures, and discusses the analysis results for both the current and alternative architectures. The MySQL protocol and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) are identified as the primary protocols used in the architecture, and the paper provides insights into the network layout, database structure, and performance measurements of the current architecture.

Furthermore, the alternative architectures, including the roles of channel nodes and application nodes, as well as the handling of message forwarding and presence information, are explained. The analysis results indicate the scalability and limitations of each architecture, ultimately leading to the recommendation of the subscription-based architecture as the most suitable option for IM&P services.

The paper concludes by suggesting specific enhancements for models of scalable architectures to streamline the analysis process. Finally, future recommendations for research and development in this area are provided.
