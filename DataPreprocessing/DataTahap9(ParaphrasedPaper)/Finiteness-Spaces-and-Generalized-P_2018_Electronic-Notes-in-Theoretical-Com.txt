Ribenboim introduced the concept of generalized power series to examine rings of arithmetic functions. This construction is quite broad and yields numerous examples, some of which are discussed in the paper. The construction is functorial and can be analyzed through category theory. Ribenboim starts with a special class of partially ordered monoids, known as strict pomonoids, and considers functions from the pomonoid to a ring in which the support is artinian and narrow. He shows that the Dirichlet convolution formula extends to this setting, resulting in a ring that can be construed as a ring of power series.

The paper also demonstrates that Theorem 4.1 is functorial. However, when considering it from the usual category of posets to any of the categories of finiteness spaces, this is not the case. The issue can be resolved by considering strict maps.

An example given in the paper is formal power series, where a set "a" is taken as the alphabet and "m" is the free monoid generated by "a." The finiteness space (m, p(m)) has a monoid structure in finpf (and also in finf) based on the classical monoid structure of m. The only non-trivial aspect here is verifying the multiplication.

The paper also explores the topic of differentiation as an important operator on power series rings and raises the question of whether one can differentiate the generalized power series discussed. In the commutative case, the category of linearized finiteness spaces serves as an example of a differential category, utilized in the study of models of differential linear logic. Exploring the differentiation of these generalized series and their compatibility with the differential category framework is an area of interest for future research.
