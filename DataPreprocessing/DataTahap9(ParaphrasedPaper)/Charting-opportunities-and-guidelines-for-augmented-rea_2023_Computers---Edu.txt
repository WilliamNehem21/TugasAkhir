Makerspace environments, which are utilized for project-based learning, have gained popularity as spaces where students are able to engage with physical objects, collaborate with peers, and develop 21st-century skills while also engaging with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) topics. Additionally, the integration of augmented reality (AR) technology has shown potential to address challenges faced by students in makerspaces. However, there is a lack of understanding on how to effectively utilize and integrate AR in real makerspace environments. This research utilized a co-design methodology to answer questions related to the usefulness of AR in education in makerspaces, the impact of co-designing AR technology on students, and practical considerations for integrating AR in makerspaces. The study involved engaging students in a semester-long makerspace course and generated six prototypes through a co-design process, which explored the use of AR in design, fabrication, programming, electronics, and training. The research findings suggested that AR technology can benefit makerspaces by enhancing STEM skills, facilitating construction activities, contextualizing learning, and aiding in debugging. The study also observed that students participating in co-design demonstrated improved understanding of technology design, enthusiasm for engaging with makerspaces and AR, and increased critical thinking about AR technology. The research further provided considerations and guidelines for integrating AR technology into makerspace environments.

In conclusion, this research aimed to fill the gap in understanding the opportunities and challenges of integrating AR in makerspaces and presented a co-design methodology as an effective approach for exploring future uses of AR technology. The study contributed to the development of a framework for integrating AR technology into makerspace environments and provided insights into the impacts of student involvement in the co-design process. The data collected for this study is confidential and adheres to the ethical guidelines of the institution, and was approved by the university's institutional review board.
