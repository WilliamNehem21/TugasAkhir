Initially, we propose an approach using spectral expansion to model the behavior of a fluid queue as a semi-Markov process (SMP) with a set of thresholds. We demonstrate that this approach outperforms techniques based on matrix-analytic methods and forward-backward decomposition in terms of speed. The performance measures obtained from the SMP model inform the development of an algorithm for selecting thresholds to minimize power consumption while meeting quality-of-service requirements. We then provide a numerical example to illustrate our results.

Section 3 outlines our model and method for analyzing buffer content given x1,..., xn. In Section 4, we discuss the steady-state performance measures, followed by a description of an algorithm for obtaining optimal thresholds in Section 5. Subsequently, in Section 6, we present our approach through a numerical example. Finally, in Section 7, we offer concluding remarks and identify potential avenues for future research.

We emphasize the importance of an efficient approach to compute metrics for optimization purposes. Although the computation time for a single run may be minimal, it can become significant when dealing with multiple cases. We also note that certain techniques, while not covered here, are not applicable to our specific scenario involving data center servers, which have an exogenous and independent arrival process and incur no cost for performing DVFS. Ultimately, the optimal policy tends to be of the threshold type, in the absence of a switching cost, and would involve a hysteretic policy if such a cost were present.
