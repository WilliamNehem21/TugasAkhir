In this research, a deep learning algorithm was utilized to perform two-dimensional magnetotelluric (MT) data inversion. In contrast to traditional linear iterative inversion methods, the MT inversion approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) does not depend on the selection of initial model parameters and is not susceptible to local optima. While the CNN inversion models can delineate clear electrical interfaces, their inversion results may still exhibit abrupt electrical interfaces unlike the actual underground electrical situation. To address this issue, a neural network with a residual network architecture (ResNet-50) was developed in this study. The modified ResNet-50 model was trained using apparent resistivity and phase pseudo-section data as inputs and the resistivity parameters of the geoelectric model as training labels, in order to generate samples based on the specific production strategy of the study area. Through experiments, it was demonstrated that training the ResNet-50 with the dice loss function effectively resolved the issue of over-segmentation of electrical interfaces, prevented abrupt inversion, and overcame the computational inefficiency of traditional iterative methods. The proposed algorithm was validated using MT data collected from a geothermal field prospect in Huanggang, Hubei province, indicating the promising potential of deep learning in the field of MT data inversion.

With advancements in computer performance and forward algorithms, an increasing number of nonlinear inversion methods, such as simulated annealing inversion, ant colony algorithm inversion, genetic algorithm inversion, particle swarm optimization algorithm inversion, and Bayesian inversion, have been proposed and implemented in electromagnetic fields. Additionally, there have been previous successful applications of artificial neural networks (ANN) in 2D MT inversion, demonstrating the feasibility of artificial intelligence approaches in MT inversion.

Several studies have explored various deep learning-based methods for geophysical prospecting. For instance, Liu et al. (2021) proposed a deep learning model for resistivity data inversion, incorporating a smoothing constraint and depth weighting into the loss function to enhance inversion accuracy. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2021) utilized a convolutional neural network to analyze electromagnetic induction (EMI) data and instantly estimate the number of subsurface conductivity layers. The use of deep learning techniques in seismic full-waveform inversion and other geophysical fields, such as gravity and magnetism, has shown to offer high computational efficiency and precise predictions.

In the context of deep learning, different activation functions exhibit various advantages and disadvantages, such as causing gradient disappearance or leading to high computational costs. For instance, sigmoid and tanh functions have their respective advantages and drawbacks, while the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function demonstrates low computational cost and quick convergence during training.

In deep learning, pooling operations among convolution layers are used to compress data, reduce dimensionality, and prevent overfitting. Common pooling operations include maximum pooling and average pooling, which serve to aggregate statistics between pixels and reduce the size of feature maps.

The loss function is utilized to measure the difference between predicted and observed values during model training. It allows for the updating of model parameters through backpropagation, aiming to minimize the difference between observed and predicted values and improve the model's fit to the data.

In the process of training neural network models for geoelectric inversion, a production strategy was developed to control the variation of variables and enhance sample representativeness while mitigating computational cost. Additionally, the addition of Gaussian noise to sample features was used to prevent underfitting and enhance the generalizability of the network.

In geophysical exploration, observation data often contains noise and errors, resulting in multiple geophysical inversion solutions. Seeking to develop simplified fitting models that reflect the fundamental features of underground real models can help reduce computational cost and accomplish training and experiments.ningbo bai derived part of the theory and revised the expression of the formula and draft, and checked the code. bo han supervised the method and provided the methodological support. xiangyun hu provided data and improved conceptualization.
