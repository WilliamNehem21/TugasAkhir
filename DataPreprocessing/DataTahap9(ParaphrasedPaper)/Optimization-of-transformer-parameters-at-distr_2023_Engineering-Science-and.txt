The use of oil-type transformers (OTT) is more prevalent than that of dry-type transformers due to cost considerations in the transmission and distribution of electrical energy. This increased usage density underscores the significance of cost in OTT, as weight plays a crucial role in transformer cost. The weight of transformers depends on the variable parameters of the core and windings, denoted as c (iron cross section conformity factor) and s (current density), respectively.

This study aims to attain an optimal weight for both distribution-type and power-type OTTs by utilizing the innovative gray wolf-whale optimization hybrid algorithm. The application of this hybrid algorithm resulted in a 44% weight reduction for distribution transformers and an approximately 14% weight reduction for power transformers. It was observed that these weight reductions correspondingly led to cost reductions for the OTTs. Comparative testing was conducted against other algorithms and statistically validated.

Furthermore, the study demonstrates the reduction in weight of a dry-type distribution transformer achieved through the optimal adjustment of variable parameters using a genetic algorithm. Similarly, the weight of oil-filled distribution transformers was optimized by employing a genetic algorithm to adjust variables c and s. Additionally, particle swarm optimization was utilized to optimize the weight of a dry-type transformer with the same variable parameters.

The application of whale optimization algorithm (WOA) in transformer fault diagnosis, in combination with other algorithms such as genetic algorithm and support vector machine, resulted in enhanced fault diagnosis efficiency. WOA was also shown to provide greater accuracy and reliability in stability analysis of power systems. Moreover, WOA was found to offer positive results in locating electric vehicle charging stations and optimizing their service capacity, thereby reducing social costs.

In the context of robotics, the hybrid gray wolf-whale algorithm was examined for determining the model parameters of different robots, showcasing improved parameter determination compared to other algorithms. Additionally, a holistic multi-objective optimization framework was proposed for electric vehicle participation in clearing the harmonic power market, and a new hybrid algorithm was developed to optimize this framework.

Another notable application of the hybrid gray wolf-whale optimization algorithm occurred in the early detection of breast cancer disease using support vector machine classifiers, achieving high classification accuracy compared to other algorithms.

The study concludes by highlighting the potential of hybrid heuristic algorithms in optimizing the weight of OTTs and achieving the objectives of cost reduction. It compares the performance of various algorithms and emphasizes the complementary structure of the gray wolf and whale optimization algorithms when hybridized.

The gray wolf optimization algorithm is noted for its quick convergence capability, reaching optimum parameters in a limited number of iterations. Conversely, the whale algorithm exhibits slower performance but attains optimum values and better verification results. When these algorithms are hybridized, they demonstrate a complementary structure.

The gray wolf algorithm, developed by Mirjalili et al. in 2014, is described as a population-based intuitive algorithm with superior convergence capabilities, efficient performance, and applicability. The social organization of wolves, including alpha, beta, and delta classes, is detailed to illustrate the optimization structure.

Overall, the study highlights the significance of transformer weight optimization in reducing operational costs and enhancing profitability, and it emphasizes the potential of hybrid gray wolf-whale optimization algorithms in achieving improved results.
