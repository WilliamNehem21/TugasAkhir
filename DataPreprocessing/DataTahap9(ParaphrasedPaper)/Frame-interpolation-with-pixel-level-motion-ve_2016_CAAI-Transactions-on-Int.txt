The up-conversion method known as motion-compensated frame rate up-conversion (MC-FRUC) typically involves two main steps: motion estimation (ME) and motion-compensated frame interpolation (MCFI). This method generates new frames by estimating the motion trajectories between consecutive frames and then interpolating new frames along these trajectories. The quality of the generated frames depends on the accuracy of the motion trajectories and the performance of the MCFI algorithm.

Conventional MC-FRUC algorithms typically use block matching algorithms to estimate motion vectors and interpolate new frames along these motion trajectories. However, these methods face two main issues. Firstly, they encounter problems with occlusions and errors in motion estimation, leading to holes and collisions in the generated frames. Secondly, they suffer from blocking artifacts in the interpolated frames due to block-level motion vectors.

Various approaches have been proposed to address these issues. To handle collisions, depth order of objects is determined and utilized, and techniques such as median filters, spatial interpolation, and image inpainting are employed. However, these methods struggle to effectively address holes, particularly when they occur in large areas. To reduce blocking artifacts, overlapped block motion compensation (OBMC) has been proposed, but it may still lead to artifacts, especially at object boundaries. Other methods such as pixel-level motion vector selection (MVS) have been suggested, as well as pixel-based bilateral motion vector filtering (MVF). While these methods partially alleviate blocking artifacts, they are still reliant on block motion estimation (BME), which may not provide robust motion vectors for individual pixels within the same block.

An alternative method is proposed, involving the upsampling of reference frames by a factor of two in both horizontal and vertical directions, and doubling the floating-point motion vectors. Motion post-processing based on image segmentation is then employed to enhance motion spatial consistency. The intermediate frame is interpolated based on the post-processed motion vector fields (MVF), and any remaining holes in the intermediate frame are addressed before downsampling it to the original size.

Occlusions, defined as areas that are covered or uncovered in only one of the reference frames, are also addressed in the proposed method. The detection and generation of occluded regions in the intermediate frame are considered important.

To improve the subjective quality of the interpolated frames generated by MCFI methods and address issues such as blocking artifacts and occlusions, the proposed method is compared with existing algorithms to demonstrate its effectiveness and advantages.
