Additionally, reasoning by induction and utilizing recursion over contexts prove challenging due to their representation as functional terms. Furthermore, the key advantage of higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) is compromised as it restricts the ability to verify properties related to the mechanisms delegated to the metalanguage.

In the fifth section, an intriguing outcome is presented: the derivation of higher-order induction from first-order induction combined with the axioms of the theory of contexts. This finding contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between the axioms and their expressive capabilities.

While the soundness of the theory of contexts has been established, the completeness with respect to a known logic system remains unproven. This section addresses this gap by demonstrating the derivability of higher-order systems. Furthermore, this paper seeks to challenge the perception that previous works have taken an ad-hoc approach to the axioms by presenting a systematic roadmap for instantiating the axiom schemata and working with a weak HOAS-based encoding.
