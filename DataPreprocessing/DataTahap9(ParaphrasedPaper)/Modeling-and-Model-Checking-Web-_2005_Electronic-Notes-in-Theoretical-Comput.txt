This academic paper provides an overview of web services and the web service technology stack, followed by a demonstration of how to construct Petri net models of web services using the specification language bpel4ws. The paper defines an abstract correctness criterion for these models and explores automated verification techniques in accordance with this criterion. Furthermore, it establishes a connection between the correctness of web service models and the model checking problem for alternating temporal logics.

Service-oriented architectures represent a new paradigm in the development of interconnected computational systems, particularly in business organizations. These systems are increasingly being utilized for administrative and organizational tasks such as procurement, document management, business transactions, and various management aspects. The integration of web service technologies is expected to bring about fundamental changes in the construction of these systems and in the interactions between internal and external systems.

The paper describes the construction of Petri net models of web services and the subsequent assessment of these models for correct behavior. It outlines state space reduction techniques used for automated verification and discusses the potential for applying these techniques to larger examples. Additionally, the paper proposes the study of simpler models, such as workflow modules, to explore questions related to the well-behavior of services, including usability, composability, and abstraction.

The concept of workflow modules is introduced to address questions about the successful control and usability of a service by a single partner. The paper characterizes successfully controlling partners and identifies the existence of a universal strategy that encompasses all successfully controlling partners. It distinguishes between scenarios where partners may or may not know the behaviors and states of other partners.

The paper outlines ongoing work on the automated translation of bpel4ws to Petri nets and the development of state space reduction techniques for assessing the central and distributed usability of web services. The goal is to establish an integrated environment for modeling, verification, and testing of web services.

Further research efforts include exploring generalizations of usability criteria to cyclic web services, developing methods for generating test cases from bpel specifications, and investigating the application of alternating logics for specifying relevant correctness criteria within the context of web service technology.

Finally, the paper provides references to related work in the field of discrete-event systems represented as Petri nets.
