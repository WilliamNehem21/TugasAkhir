An increasing number of C++ applications utilize template metaprograms, either directly or indirectly through libraries based on them. Given that C++ template metaprograms adhere to the functional paradigm, it is essential for developers to have access to functional programming tools. Specifically, the use of let expressions, as commonly seen in functional languages, can help simplify source code, minimize redundancy, and prevent namespace pollution. This paper introduces the integration of let expressions in C++ template metaprograms and demonstrates their application in implementing lambda expressions. We also discuss the limitations of nested lambda expressions with the boost metaprogramming library and how our approach addresses these issues.

C++ template metaprograms function as functional programs but have a complex syntax, leading to challenges in writing and understanding them. The presence of subexpressions that are used multiple times within metafunctions can lead to code duplication and namespace pollution. Introducing let expressions in metafunctions could alleviate these issues and streamline the development and maintenance of C++ template metaprograms.

The boost metaprogramming library offers lambda expressions for performing compile-time algorithms; however, creating nested lambda expressions poses challenges when using numbered arguments. Our proposed solution for let expressions can be leveraged to correctly implement nested lambda expressions in C++ template metaprograms. Additionally, a library based on the concepts presented in this paper is available.

The subsequent sections of the paper cover the concept of let expressions, our approach to integrating them into a functional language lacking built-in support, the implementation of nested lambda expressions using our approach, the extension to support recursive let expressions, future work, and a summary of our results.

While most functional languages with let expressions have built-in support for them, template metaprogramming in C++ lacks such support, necessitating the addition of let expressions using standard C++ features. We also present lambda functions as a solution for implementing utility functors in-place, without the need for named functions, thus facilitating the implementation of generic algorithms.

Let expressions are a fundamental feature of functional programming languages, and we have demonstrated how they can be incorporated into C++ template metaprogramming, a functional language lacking built-in support for them. Our approach also illustrates how let expressions can be used to enable lambda expressions. Moreover, we have developed a library supporting lambda and let expressions for C++ template metaprogramming, which can significantly enhance the boost metaprogramming library. Furthermore, our approach allows for the correct handling of nested lambda expressions.
