To explore the concepts of iteration and recursion within dialectica categories, our research aims to establish a natural numbers object within the context of dial2(sets). The first step is to determine which monoidal structure within dial2(sets) will be used to define the natural numbers object. It is important to note that there are multiple tensor structures within dial2(sets) that can be utilized, each with its own unique properties, as opposed to the more standardized cartesian structure.

These tensor products within dial2(sets) introduce additional complexity, as they are not universally equivalent and the category dial2(sets) includes at least two prominent tensor products, in addition to categorical products and coproducts. These tensor products, as defined in section 3, share a common unit, denoted as the object (1, 1, =), which could potentially be leveraged to construct a natural numbers object, as demonstrated in the monoidal extension of a natural numbers object in definition 1. However, rather than exhaustively examining all possible tensor products within dial2(sets), our approach will instead revisit the concept of a Peano-Lawvere category as initially proposed by Burroni.
