Lung diseases can lead to impaired respiratory function and encompass a wide range of conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, influenza, and lung cancer. Covid-19, in particular, is a serious respiratory illness that can result in fatalities and leave survivors susceptible to conditions like asthma, pneumonia, and leukemia. Various factors, including viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, as well as environmental factors such as asthma, lung cancer, and mesothelioma, contribute to the development of lung diseases. Early diagnosis of lung cancer can be challenging, and delays in diagnosis and treatment are often due to barriers such as communication gaps, financial constraints, and limited medical facilities in developing countries.

A sputum cytology test is a method for detecting lung cancer cells by examining sputum samples under a microscope. Previously, bronchoscopy was used for obtaining tissue samples, and its accuracy rate was 88%. Newer techniques such as radial probe endobronchial ultrasound and electromagnetic navigation systems have been developed to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. Symptoms of pneumonia and lung cancer can be similar, but there are distinct indications for each condition. Research indicates that individuals who frequently experience pneumonia may be at a higher risk of developing lung carcinoma later in life. Smoking, tobacco use, and exposure to environmental chemicals are known risk factors for lung cancer, as they can activate cancerous cells in the body.

Early detection of lung cancer is crucial, but it is often diagnosed in advanced stages, especially in developing countries. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms for early diagnosis, focusing on feature transformation and dimensionality reduction techniques to enhance the accuracy of diagnostic systems. The study aims to develop an ML algorithm that utilizes regression and feature transformation techniques for the early detection of lung cancer. The researchers also plan to evaluate different dimensionality reduction techniques and identify the optimal combination of regression models and feature transformation methods to improve accuracy.

Researchers have explored various methods for detecting diseases at early stages, particularly focusing on image recognition and classification techniques for cancer detection. The study emphasizes the collection of comprehensive datasets of lung cancer patients and proposes an ML-based diagnostic system that incorporates feature transformation and regression modeling for early detection. The challenges of managing large and constantly evolving datasets are acknowledged, and the study aims to contribute to the field by identifying an optimal combination of regression and feature transformation techniques for early lung cancer diagnosis.

The study introduces a framework for the early diagnosis of lung cancer using feature transformation and evaluates different dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize the diagnostic process. The researchers demonstrate the results of their experiments, showing the effectiveness of the selected model for feature transformation of complex datasets of lung cancer patients.

As machine learning-based models continue to evolve, the impact of dataset size and complexity on algorithm performance is recognized. Feature selection, extraction, and transformation techniques are crucial for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets and improving the efficiency of machine learning algorithms. The feature transformation technique involves replacing original features with functions derived from the existing features, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the dataset.

The researchers give particular emphasis to the feature transformation technique, which involves replacing original features with functions derived from existing features, to achieve dimensionality reduction. They highlight the importance of this technique in changing the bases of feature space, akin to changing bases in calculus, to improve computational efficiency.

The study also discusses dimensionality reduction techniques such as Isomap, which is effective for non-linear datasets, and emphasizes the importance of choosing appropriate methods for different types of data.
