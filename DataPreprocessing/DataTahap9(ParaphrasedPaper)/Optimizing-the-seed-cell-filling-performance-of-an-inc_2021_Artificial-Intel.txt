According to the aforementioned literature reviews, it is evident that combining the ANN modeling approach with the PSO algorithm can be utilized to model and optimize the seed-cell filling performance of an inclined plate seed metering device. Therefore, the current research aims to implement a novel integrated ANN-PSO-based intelligent optimization approach to identify the best operational parameters for an inclined plate seed metering device, ensuring 100% cell fill. To achieve this objective, an artificial neural network model was devised to predict the cell fill using experimental data. Subsequently, the developed ANN model was integrated with a particle swarm optimizer to obtain the optimal operating parameters for achieving 100% cell fill. Confirmation tests were conducted to substantiate the reliability of the proposed optimization approach.

Conversely, based on a 20 cm seed spacing and the specified overall gear ratio between the drive wheel and the seed metering plate, the seeds passing through the seed delivery tube were detected by an IR sensor connected to an Arduino microcontroller, and the counted seed numbers were recorded during the experiment. Initially, the test involved varying the forward speed of operation while maintaining other parameters constant. Similar observations were made by individually adjusting all independent parameters while keeping the remaining parameters constant. The test setup ran for ten revolutions of the seed metering plate for each set of independent parameters, and the system recorded the metered seeds and calculated the cell fill. Three replications were conducted for each set of conditions, and the average cell fill was computed from the collected data, which were then utilized to create the ANN model for cell fill prediction.

Additionally, the model was trained adaptively using the trial and error method, and the network connection weights were adjusted to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the target and model-predicted cell fill values, with a learning rate of 0.001 and a maximum of 6 validation checks before terminating the training process. The relative importance of input variables on the output, as well as the number of input and hidden neurons and connection weights, were also considered in the model.

The study proposed a new intelligent optimization technique based on the integrated ANN-PSO approach for optimizing the seed-cell filling performance of an inclined plate seed metering device. The experimental results indicated that the proposed optimization technique could also be effectively applied to determine the optimal operating parameters of other agricultural machines. Furthermore, the study offers a reference basis for future research on process parameters optimization and precision seeding technology. Nevertheless, it is important to verify these results under actual field conditions to ensure their applicability.
