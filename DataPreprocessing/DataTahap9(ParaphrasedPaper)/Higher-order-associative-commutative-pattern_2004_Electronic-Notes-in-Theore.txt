The techniques of syntactic matching [16,5] rely on either pattern matching or unification. These methods are advantageous due to their efficiency and the ability to be fully automated. Furthermore, unification and pattern matching are applicable to higher-order logics, aligning with the objective of accommodating the adaptation of components through the use of higher-order parameters. However, a main drawback of unification-based approaches is that they can be incomplete.

In Section 2, existing approaches to pattern matching and unification of higher-order logics are summarized, including those for associative commutative matching of first-order logics. Section 4 defines an expression language and provides a description of parameter instantiation, as well as outlines a purely syntactic pattern matching algorithm for the expression language. Section 5 presents a specification for associative commutative matching, and Section 6 introduces an (incomplete) associative commutative pattern matching algorithm for higher-order expressions. Section 7 discusses how this matching technique can be utilized to support component retrieval.

Moreover, higher-order unification has been employed in programming languages. For instance, Lambda-Prolog extends standard Prolog by permitting parameters to range over functions and relations. Consequently, reasoning in Lambda-Prolog relies on higher-order unification rather than standard unification.

One possible solution to the issue at hand involves conducting a case analysis on whether or not "e" is a member of the list "s." This can be achieved using a case analysis library component, the specification of which is detailed below, with "p" and "q" denoting parameters.

Function names are represented by the lowercase identifiers "f," "g," and "h" for functions of arity 1 and greater, and the identifiers "c," "d," and "e" for constants. Furthermore, function parameters are represented by the uppercase identifiers "f," "g," and "h."

Parameter instantiations are frequently defined using placeholders. For example, the instantiation "f~ ph(1)+ ph(2)" indicates that applications of "f" with at least two arguments are replaced by the application of "+" to the first and second arguments of "f." Specifically, "f(x, y)" would be replaced by "x+ y" using this instantiation.

Furthermore, an informal description of an algorithm for matching mathematical expressions that operates based on structural induction on the pattern is provided. The algorithm for matching terms adheres to the structure of the abstract syntax for terms given in Section 4.1. Although placeholders only occur in expressions utilized in instantiations, they are considered here for completeness.

An example of such matching involves matching the pattern "(g(x, y)+ z)+ h(c)" with the query "(x+ h(c))+(z+ y)." One potential match is achieved by instantiating "g~ ph(1)+ ph(2)." 

The paper also discusses an extension for handling queries and patterns involving associative commutative functions, providing detailed algorithms for matching such queries and patterns.

Furthermore, the paper mentions the absence of published decidability or complexity results for higher-order AC matching, but it notes that several results have been published for first-order AC matching [7,3]. Additionally, the paper describes the algorithm's implementation as part of the CARE library retrieval tool, emphasizing its similarity to the algorithm presented in the paper.

Finally, the paper suggests a potential enhancement to the retrieval tool, involving the combination of theorem prover-based matching with existing pattern-based matching, and details different approaches for achieving this enhancement.
