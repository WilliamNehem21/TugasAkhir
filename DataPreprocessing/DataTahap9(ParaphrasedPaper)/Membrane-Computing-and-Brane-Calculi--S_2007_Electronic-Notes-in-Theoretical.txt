This brief discussion highlights the similarities and differences between membrane computing and brane calculi, with a focus on recent efforts to bridge these two areas of research. The paper aims to establish that, despite initial appearances, there are no substantial dissimilarities between the two fields. The discussion primarily focuses on two specific brane calculi, which are based on Pino, Exo, Phago, and Mate, Drip, Bud operations. While other process algebra calculi have been considered by L. Cardelli and his collaborators, they are not within the scope of this discussion.

One notable point of difference frequently mentioned is the treatment of objects in regions versus objects on membranes. However, the paper argues that this contrast is not entirely accurate. Even in the standard setup of transition P systems with symbol-objects, it is possible to account for objects bound on the membrane by considering the membrane as a bilayer with an interspace between layers. This approach has been explored in previous research and involves creating a compartment from the membrane itself, albeit with certain limitations in handling the respective objects. This technique cannot be used for formalizing operations with membranes due to these restrictions.
