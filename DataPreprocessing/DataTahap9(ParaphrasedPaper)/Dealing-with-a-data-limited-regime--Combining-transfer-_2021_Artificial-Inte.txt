The solubility of substances in water is an important property that influences various chemical and biological processes. Predicting aqueous solubility computationally has been challenging and of significant interest for a long time. Recent studies have explored different approaches, such as fingerprint-based, feature-based, and graph-based representations, using various machine learning and deep learning methods. Traditional methods heavily rely on manually crafted features, while deep learning models face limitations due to the quality of available solubility data. This study introduces a new deep network architecture and employs transfer learning to develop a novel method for predicting aqueous solubility. The model was found to be competitive, achieving an RMSE of 0.587 during cross-validation and testing on an independent dataset. The method was evaluated using molecules from the online chemical database and modeling environment (ochem). The approach presented in this study may also be useful for modeling other chemical or biological properties with limited training data.

The presence of specific functional groups in the molecular structure, such as the carboxylic acid group and the nitro group, is strongly correlated with the representation learned by the model related to molecular aqueous solubility.

The model achieved an MSE of 0.48, indicating that scaffold splitting is a more challenging setting than the random split approach, as it yielded less impressive scores. Nevertheless, the outcomes demonstrate that even when the training and test sets have different characteristics in terms of molecular structures, the model is able to learn a general representation of the molecules and produce competitive predictions.
