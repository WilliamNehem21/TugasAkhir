The remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows: Section 2 contains initial definitions. Section 3 outlines the fundamental principles of rewriting using non-symmetric transitive relations and quasiorderings. Section 4 describes a Knuth-Bendix completion process for transitive relations and demonstrates its correctness. Section 5 further explores this procedure, while Section 6 extends it to quasiorderings. Section 7 discusses the extension of the procedure to the non-ground case, while Section 8 presents an application example. Finally, Section 9 offers a conclusion.

Although refining rewrite rules does not reduce the proof measure, it can hinder the termination of the completion process. Nonetheless, it preserves correctness because this property relies solely on the elimination of critical pairs. In a completion process that solely consists of critical pair computations, there are more critical pairs without refinements than with them.

In the case of a quasiordering, the non-symmetric ground completion procedure must be adjusted, as the presence of reflexivity means that the diagonal need not be explicitly considered. Furthermore, the theory of rewriting differs slightly, as highlighted in Section 3. Here, we only mention certain distinctions in comparison to completion with a non-symmetric transitive relation.

Section 3 demonstrates that the adaptation of ground completion procedures to the non-ground case encounters a significant obstacle. Second-order context variables have been introduced to represent the variable critical pairs that emerge for non-linear variables. This presents three cases of interest: the non-compatible case (when no function is monotonic), the linear case, and the general case.
