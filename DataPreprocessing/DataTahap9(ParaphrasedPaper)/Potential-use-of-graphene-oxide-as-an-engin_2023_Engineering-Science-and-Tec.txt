The utilization of go nanosheets resulted in an average reduction of 17% in wear scar diameter and a 44% reduction in total wear mass loss. Notably, go nanosheets led to a decrease in motored torque by up to 6% and improved mechanical efficiency by up to 2.8% at specific engine speeds. Furthermore, the addition of go nanosheets resulted in an average improvement of 2.6% in brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and 2.7% in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) across all engine speeds. These findings suggest that go nanosheets have the potential to enhance the mechanical efficiency of internal combustion engines, leading to energy and fuel savings and contributing to the reduction of CO2 emissions.

The demand for more advanced properties from engine lubricating oils, driven by factors such as supercharging, increased engine speeds, and exhaust after-treatment systems, presents challenges for base engine oils containing conventional additives. Nanoparticle additives, due to their unique properties such as smaller sizes and higher specific surface areas, have been the subject of extensive research. Previous studies have consistently shown that the addition of nanoparticles to base oils enhances the coefficient of friction (COF) and anti-wear properties, while also improving viscosity and thermal conductivity. However, there is a limited number of studies that investigate both tribological friction bench test and engine performance test results on a dynamometer under real operating conditions, highlighting the need for additional research in this area.

The study also examined the effects of different concentrations of go nanosheets as an additive in fully synthetic SAE 10W-40 base engine oil. The research demonstrated that go nanosheets at certain concentrations effectively reduced COF in all lubrication regimes and provided more efficient lubrication compared to the base engine oil. Furthermore, the addition of multi-layered 2D go nanosheets was found to reduce viscosity and improve mechanical engine efficiency and fuel saving, particularly in hydrodynamic lubrication regimes.

In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that the addition of go nanosheets to engine lubricating oils has the potential to enhance mechanical efficiency and contribute to energy and fuel savings, as well as the reduction of CO2 emissions. However, further research is required to investigate the long-term effects of this additive on the engine warm-up phase and sustainability of existing commercial engine oils.
