Temporal logics of knowledge are valuable for analyzing scenarios where an agent's or component's knowledge is significant, and where changes in this knowledge may occur over time. In this study, we explore the application of temporal logics of knowledge to specify and verify security protocols. We demonstrate how typical assumptions related to authentication protocols can be specified and examine verification methods for these logics, with a focus on proofs using clausal resolution. Finally, we share our experiences using a resolution-based theorem prover applied to security protocols specified in temporal logics of knowledge.

With the increasing transfer of information electronically and the growing sensitivity of this data, there is a rising demand for mechanisms to ensure the security of information transfer between computers. Additionally, as grid and ubiquitous computing become prevalent, security and trust are crucial factors for the success of these technologies. This heightened need for security has led to the development of cryptographic protocols, particularly for authenticating individuals and messages through encryption. Given the importance of this area, it is essential to employ techniques that enable automatic analysis of such protocols prior to their deployment.

The analysis of security protocols using logical tools was pioneered by Burrows, Abadi, and Needham (BAN logics), which are specifically designed belief logics for handling authentication issues. While these logics were influential, they had several limitations such as a lack of semantics, an inability to explicitly express time, and the necessity to capture additional features. Consequently, extensions or logics with similar styles aimed at a broader class of systems were developed. In this paper, we describe how to use a combination of standard, well-known modal and temporal logics instead of developing special-purpose logics to specify security protocols.

Modal logics have been used to capture concepts such as knowledge, belief, desire, and intention, with the modal logic S5 being particularly useful for reasoning about knowledge. Given our interest in knowledge, we utilize the modal logic S5 in our study.

The structure of this paper is as follows: in section 2, we describe the Needham-Schroeder protocol, a specific authentication protocol. In section 3, we provide a syntax and semantics for the temporal logic of knowledge (KL(n)) used in this paper, while in section 4, we discuss how protocols like the Needham-Schroeder protocol can be specified using this logic. Section 5 presents an overview of a resolution-based proof method for temporal logics of knowledge, followed by a discussion of the results obtained from manual and automatic theorem proving for a related logic in section 6. In section 7, we mention related work, and in section 8, we provide concluding remarks.

In this section, we outline how to use KL(n) to specify the Needham-Schroeder protocol. We introduce syntactic conventions and identify predicates to translate the specification of the protocol and the properties to be proven into FOTL, subsequently running TEMP on the output. By utilizing the axiomatic translation, we are able to prove the aforementioned properties, with the transitivity axiom being handled in a non-standard way to avoid termination issues. Complete details of this approach, including timings and the number of generated clauses, can be found in [reference].

While the BAN logic was influential, it suffered from several drawbacks. Firstly, it lacked a formal semantics, and the modal logic semantics provided for a BAN-like logic were complex. Additionally, using BAN logics to transform the informal description of a protocol to one using BAN primitives was far from straightforward. Moreover, the original BAN logic lacked explicit...

Although some of the verification tools mentioned above are general-purpose tools used for the formal verification of security protocols, there are also specific tools developed for the analysis of security protocols. Notably, the NRL Protocol Analyzer, developed at the Naval Research Laboratory, has been successful in identifying unpublished vulnerabilities.

For verifying other types of protocols, standard epistemic logics have been applied successfully to reason about communication protocols. For instance, epistemic language is useful in expressing that a receiver knows a message at a specific state of the protocol or that a sender knows that the receiver knows the message. In this context, unlike the security framework of BAN, the implicit assumption is always that the network is not hostile.
