The increasing demand for effective protective measures for safeguarding critical infrastructures against threats has prompted the development of quantitative methodologies for risk assessment. One of the key challenges in this area is evaluating the impact of attacks. Attack trees have emerged as widely used formalisms for modeling attack scenarios, and while various extensions have been proposed to enhance their expressiveness, efforts are needed to enhance their analyzability. This paper introduces a transformational approach that converts attack trees into Bayesian networks, offering the capability to handle different attack tree extensions and enabling the quantitative assessment of combined attacks modeled as a set of attack trees.

The expert-driven analysis required for this purpose demands a comprehensive understanding of the system details. Automatic support for experts during the design, evaluation, and runtime monitoring phases is an area of growing research, particularly in security-related event correlation. This expert-driven analysis has traditionally supported qualitative or semi-quantitative risk management processes, but there is potential for significant benefits from adopting quantitative approaches, as seen in safety analysis. Quantitative risk assessment not only enables the evaluation of proposed protection solutions but also facilitates cost-benefit analysis. Additionally, it allows for the determination of conditioned probabilities of complex events based on the probabilities of more elementary events and their relationships, providing quantitative measures of the risks posed by hostile behaviors.

The proposed method translates attack trees into a formalism with greater solving power than Bayesian networks, enabling the incorporation of significant extensions from the scientific literature. The method is applied using a tool that automatically translates separate attack trees into a Bayesian network model and solves it using freely available supporting resources.

The paper illustrates that attack trees are not limited to computer security and can be applied to other domains, such as homeland security and industrial systems. Attack trees are versatile and can be used to analyze risks associated with a variety of action chains or combinations, providing a general framework for understanding how risks are generated. The paper also discusses the semantic definition of attack trees and their qualitative and quantitative applications, presenting a proposal for quantitative semantics and discussing existing extensions in the literature.

Bayesian networks are identified as a suitable formalism for improving attack trees due to their ability to accommodate common ancestors and merge different attack trees, allowing for quantitative analyses. Model-to-model transformations are proposed as a means to enable analyses that may not be feasible in the original formalism, and the process is structured into four steps: system analysis, model synthesis, model evaluation, and results evaluation.

The paper further highlights the potential vulnerabilities in railway security, citing examples such as security breaches in port authorities leading to breaches in the railway system, unauthorized access to train schedule databases, and commercial implications for train transportation. It also categorizes potential attacks on railways into three main groups, outlining the destructive nature of these attacks.

In summary, this paper presents a translational method for automatically generating Bayesian networks from a set of attack trees, addressing the need for a process and formalism capable of providing quantitative evaluations of attack success likelihood, particularly in the case of combined attacks with mutual and non-trivial influences. The approach is applied in a railway case study to study influences between attacks aimed at trains and facilities, which are modeled using attack trees and then analyzed using existing analysis tools on the generated Bayesian network model.
