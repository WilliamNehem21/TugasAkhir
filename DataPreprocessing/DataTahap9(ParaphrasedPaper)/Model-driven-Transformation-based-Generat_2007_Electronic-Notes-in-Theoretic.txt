This academic paper discusses a model-driven approach for automating the generation of Java stress tests that are too large and complex to be created manually. The approach involves a framework for modeling Java entities at different levels of abstraction, with models possessing structural properties suitable for transformation-based manipulation. Analysis and generation transformations, implemented using the higher-order transformation language TL within the HATS system, are applied to abstract models to produce concrete models representing sets of Java classes. The resulting stress tests are used to validate that the SSP, a hardware implementation of a significant subset of the JVM, meets the Java virtual machine specification.

The <clinit> method in a class can only be invoked once during the execution of a Java program. The structure of the <clinit> method's body is important in the context of potential <clinit> method invocations for other classes. Execution of the <clinit> method's body for a class should be suspended if the <clinit> method for its superclass has not been invoked, or if a class's <clinit> method is not yet invoked within the method body. Resumption of suspended method execution occurs upon the completion of the triggering <clinit> method.

The dependencies between <clinit> methods of classes can be represented as a directed graph-like structure, which can be modeled by a class hierarchy model M. Given a <clinit> dependency description M, the goal is to create a concrete hierarchy of classes {b1, b2,..., bn} whose <clinit> dependencies correspond to M.

Patterns are used to describe the parse tree structures being manipulated. These patterns include typed variables quantified over specific tree structure domains. TL supports various standard generic traversals, as well as higher-order generic traversals that dynamically combine strategies to form new ones.

When generating stress tests, the consistent use of names poses a challenge known as the distributed data problem (DDP), where semantically related terms are syntactically unrelated. Parameterization of transformations is a common approach to address the DDP. In the described transformations, the DDP is largely mitigated through appropriate choice of identifier names and consistent use of a single model to derive various stress test components.

A generator such as "special new" is used to create method declarations in "observe" class and corresponding method invocations in "set" and "check" classes. This generator facilitates the creation of unique instances of these classes within a class hierarchy model.

Stress tests play a vital role in providing assurance for a system, particularly when their size and complexity make manual generation impractical. The challenges in automatically generating stress tests include systematically selecting test cases and constructing certificates for automatically checking the results. The paper presents an approach for <clinit> test generation, where test case selection and certificate generation occur at abstract model level and are transformed into concrete tests.
