This paper introduces a framework, based on strand spaces, for analyzing cryptographic protocols and describing their executions. The framework includes the concepts of skeletons, homomorphisms, and shapes, which capture partial information about legitimate behavior in the execution of a protocol. Homomorphisms between skeletons are information-preserving mappings and constitute a fundamental aspect of protocol analysis. The paper also discusses the construction of characterizations for protocol runs and identifies the smallest such set, known as the set of shapes, as a foundational element for the mechanization of protocol analysis.

The framework is motivated by the need to provide analysts with a systematic approach to reasoning about protocol runs, considering both authentication and secrecy properties. It presents a method for representing partial information about possible protocol runs in structures called skeletons, and defines homomorphisms as maps that preserve this information. The paper establishes the underlying framework for the algorithms used to construct characterizations, outlining how a set of initial assumptions (an initial skeleton) can be used to characterize all possible runs, with the smallest such characterization being the set of shapes. The paper includes an example of the iso reject protocol, demonstrating that the shapes of a preskeleton provide a succinct representation of all protocol runs consistent with that preskeleton. The paper also discusses the criteria for minimal characterizations and explores the notion of extension in the context of protocol runs.

The paper concludes with an overview of an algorithm that reasons about secrecy by attempting to construct a shape that discloses a value, highlighting potential directions for future research in this area.
