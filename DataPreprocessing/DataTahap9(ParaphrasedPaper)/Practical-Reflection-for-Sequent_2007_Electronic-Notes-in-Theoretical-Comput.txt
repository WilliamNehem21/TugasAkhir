The inclusion of reflective reasoning can significantly enhance the capabilities of a proof assistant. To make this theoretical advancement applicable in practice, substantial infrastructure is required within the proof assistant to support reflective reasoning. This paper delves into the challenge of implementing such a supportive framework.

Functions for substitution are implicitly universally quantified for each rule in which they are used. For instance, a second-order variable z[] stands for all closed terms (denoted simply as z in most cases). Similarly, the second-order variable z[x] encompasses all terms with zero or more occurrences of the variable x (i.e., any term where x is the only free variable).

Quoted terms and an inductively-defined type containing all quoted terms are of crucial importance. Although the specific encoding details have been previously published, it is essential to note the existence of a type for the expression of meta-properties.

At this stage, a representation function exists in which rules are reflected into statements of provability, along with a proof-checking predicate for validating proof correctness. The subsequent step involves establishing the validity of the reflected rules using the definition of provability. For instance, the substitution lemma example requires the proof of the reflected rule based on the proof-checking predicate (4.ii).

It is important to note that explicit universal quantifiers for the meta-variables are included purely for clarity, and they are assumed to not exist explicitly within the meta-logic. Additionally, it is crucial that the meta-logic's schema language alpha-renames the bound variables as necessary to avoid conflicts.

However, the aforementioned rule is not entirely accurate. The issue arises from the fact that the terms tij generally contain meta-variables, and these meta-variables must be separately universally quantified for each induction case. As detailed in section 5, explicit quantification of meta-variables is not expressible within our meta-logic.

In certain respects, the result appears deceptively simple. When a logic is reflected, its presentation changes only marginally, and the existing reasoning methods and proof procedures remain effective. The key distinction lies in the newfound ability to reason about meta-properties of the logic.

It was imperative for us to accompany the development of the theory of reflection with its practical implementation. This not only enhances its usefulness but also serves as a safeguard against potential fallacies, as the theory of reflection is fraught with paradoxes. While our paper seeks to simplify the account, the actual formalization was quite demanding, particularly in terms of the formalization of...

We are presently utilizing reflection to construct a framework for f<:type theory, which has presented both challenges and guidance. Looking ahead, we are contemplating alternative approaches to formulating the proof induction principle, recognizing that induction inherently lacks modularity. Nonetheless, we believe that substantial practical progress can be achieved through enhanced automation and hierarchical decomposition.
