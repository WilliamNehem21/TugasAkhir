Quantum computing is a field of study that explores the computational possibilities within the context of the quantum nature of the physical world. Unlike traditional computers, quantum computers possess unique features such as superposition and entanglement, allowing them to process and manipulate combinations of bits concurrently and leading to faster quantum information processing compared to classical computation. While general-purpose quantum computers are not yet available, various approaches have been proposed for quantum information processing.

In quantum computing, the fundamental unit of information is known as a quantum bit or qubit. Unlike classical bits, qubits are not limited to just the basic states of 0 and 1; they can effectively exist in both states simultaneously. Researchers have been investigating methods for manipulating particles to exhibit quantum characteristics, but there are still significant challenges in physically manipulating elements at the microscopic scale.

One important characteristic of quantum computing is quantum parallelism, where a qubit can simultaneously hold both the values of 0 and 1 due to state superposition. This property is leveraged in quantum algorithms, potentially leading to exponential speedup in handling multiple possibilities at the same time.

In the realm of quantum computing, there are two primary types of operations: measurement operations and unitary transformations. Measurement operations involve extracting information from the quantum state, while unitary transformations refer to operations that can transform the current quantum state into another state, similar to applying a function in classical computing.

Several works have explored the use of monads in quantum computing, often in the context of functional languages. In a distinct approach, Calegaro and Vizzotto applied concepts of monads in Java using closures, which enable the usage of anonymous functions (or lambda expressions) and were added as an extension to a proposed language, FJ, based on the work of Bellia and Occhiuto.

Modeling of quantum bits can be viewed as a form of side effect due to their non-deterministic nature, and qubits can be represented as a type of monad to build the space of quantum states. The monad enables the transformation of states through quantum gates, which are depicted as unitary matrices and can be applied using the bind monadic operator.

By equipping the language with the necessary tools to create quantum states and handle their probability amplitudes, it becomes possible to define the bind operator, represented as >>= in FJQuantum, which is responsible for applying transformations over the quantum state. Quantum transformations can be interpreted as applications of quantum gates on qubits, akin to information processing in classical computing.

This algorithm aims to determine whether a Boolean function is balanced or constant. In a classical algorithm, achieving this involves evaluating the function twice and comparing the results. However, a quantum approach allows for solving the problem with just one evaluation, leveraging superposition to simultaneously evaluate two inputs.

Quantum programming languages serve as vital tools for working with and formally reasoning about quantum algorithms. Despite the lack of quantum hardware, there is ongoing research into semantic models and quantum programming languages, typically proposed within the imperative or functional paradigm.

The approach used in this work is inspired by the work of Vizzotto et al. in the use of monads for simulating quantum computing. Additionally, the work of Calegaro and Vizzotto presents a starting point for the use of monads in object-oriented languages.
