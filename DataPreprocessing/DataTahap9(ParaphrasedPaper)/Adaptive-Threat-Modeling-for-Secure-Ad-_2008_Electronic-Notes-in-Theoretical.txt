In order for mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing protocols to operate effectively, it is essential to have confidence that intermediate nodes in the routing path adhere to the protocol rules. However, trust in the behavior of intermediate nodes is a significant concern in MANETs due to the highly dynamic nature of these networks, where nodes frequently join, leave, and change their positions, leading to variations in network topology.

One of the main challenges in addressing the security of MANET routing protocols is the development of a comprehensive threat model. Establishing a threat model involves making assumptions about the capabilities of potential attackers, which can range from assuming that attackers possess the same power and capabilities as non-malicious nodes to assuming that they have virtually unlimited capabilities, as defined in the classical Dolev-Yao attacker model.

The invisible node attack (INA) is a specific threat in MANETs, where a node clandestinely participates in a routing protocol without disclosing its identity. This node clandestinely forwards messages during route discovery, resulting in discovered routes that do not accurately reflect the current network topology, regardless of whether keying material is in use or not.

Effectively modeling attacker capabilities in the context of MANET protocol security poses a significant challenge. While the Dolev-Yao model is widely accepted for evaluating authentication protocols in the security protocol community, the secure routing community does not traditionally employ formalized attacker models.

The Dolev-Yao attacker in a MANET environment is capable of intercepting any message in the network and transmitting messages to any network node. By effectively creating a two-hop network channeled through the attacker, the Dolev-Yao attacker represents the strongest model for assessing the security of MANET routing protocols. Therefore, if a routing protocol can demonstrate security against a Dolev-Yao attacker, it can be considered secure against any attacker capability.

However, it is uncommon for the Dolev-Yao model to be utilized for evaluating MANET routing protocols. Instead, the prevalent approach in the MANET community is to assume that an attacker node possesses the same capabilities as any other node within the network. This approach, which limits the attacker to using nodes without additional capability, may not accurately reflect real-world attack scenarios.

In an effort to refine the active-n-m attacker model, a parametric attacker approach has been introduced. This approach specifies the number of attacker nodes and the initial pre-distributed attacker knowledge, such as keys. The Dolev-Yao attacker is included as a special boundary case in this refinement, but the interaction of this boundary case with the protocol remains unspecified. Additionally, the authors of this approach do not permit colluding attackers to share captured information during network operation, and the evaluated scenarios involve a single adversary with communication capabilities similar to non-malicious nodes.

In considering attacker capabilities, a category of attackers with unlimited reception capability and limited transmission capability is identified. This category, which includes classifications iii, iv, and viii, assumes asymmetrical communication for the attacker, enabling it to appear as a normal node during transmissions while having the ability to receive any message. This capability could be achieved by equipping the attacker with a more powerful transceiver or antenna than standard network nodes, while limiting its transmission range by adjusting its output power.
