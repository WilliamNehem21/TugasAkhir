The utilization of blockchain in agriculture has commenced, and it is acknowledged as an emerging technology in the agri-food industry that has the potential to enhance food traceability and offer a transparent and reliable means to authenticate the quality, safety, and sustainability of agri-foods. Given that the technology is still in its early stages, this article aims to stimulate dialogue and promote the application of blockchain technology, particularly in the agri-food industry. The review briefly outlines the working principle of blockchain for data recording and tracking, summarizes the collaboration models for current blockchain applications in agri-foods, and discusses specific ways in which blockchain can be used to improve the safety and quality of agri-foods in areas such as data transparency, traceability, monitoring, and cost reduction. A case study on a system tracing the origin of pork products at Walmart is presented to illustrate how blockchain can be employed to enhance food traceability. Additionally, the review examines the challenges and future trends of blockchain technology in agri-foods related to data and cost management, data security, and data integration. Overall, blockchain technology presents a promising prospect for fostering a future agri-food system that is safer, healthier, more sustainable, and reliable.

Ensuring the safety of agri-foods is crucial for global food distribution, particularly since safety issues can arise during pre- and post-harvest processing and production, resulting from factors such as the excessive use of pesticides, fertilizers with additive chemicals, and heavy metal residues, among others. Such safety concerns can be attributed to the lack of an efficient monitoring or tracking system, posing a significant threat to human health. It is important to note that blockchain technology is not a complete solution to all these safety issues.

Blockchain technology is recognized as an emerging technology in the field of agrifoods, with the potential to enhance the safety and quality of agri-foods while transforming various aspects of the agricultural industry. This review aims to define blockchain technology and provide a comprehensive analysis of its applications in the agriculture-foods domain. It summarizes the current model for implementing blockchain in the agri-foods industry, discusses case studies representing diverse applications of blockchain technology, and presents the opportunities and challenges of blockchain in the food industry. The insights provided in this study aim to enhance the understanding of how blockchain technology could be implemented in agri-foods to improve food safety, quality, and sustainability.

The term "blockchain" was initially introduced in 2008 to describe the distributed ledger technology underlying bitcoin. Bitcoin is a form of virtual currency for digital transactions that bypasses the need for intermediaries such as banks and payment gateways. The main issue addressed by blockchain technology is the bypassing of trusted third parties by building a trustless decentralized ledger, enabling secure peer-to-peer transactions based on cryptographically secure methods.

To further illustrate, IBM has developed specialized modules for specific use cases, such as the trace module, which provides the ability for supply chain participants to trace food products from upstream sources to downstream destinations, thereby enhancing brand trust, increasing supply chain efficiency, and improving food safety. Collaboration between food companies and IBM aims to enhance food safety by developing tracing systems for each step in the life of a food product, including its production and processing, using blockchain. This collaborative effort demonstrates how blockchain technology may be used to provide consumers with detailed information about the origin and processing of food products, thereby preventing unsafe foods from being consumed.

One specific example of the impact of blockchain technology on food quality is the mango pilot program in the United States, which monitors the quality and maturity of mango slices during international transportation from Mexico using blockchain. This demonstrates the potential application of blockchain technology in monitoring perishable fresh fruits during production and transportation.

Blockchain technology also has the potential to enable rapid and real-time payments for agricultural financial services, which can reduce transaction costs and risks, increase cash flow, and working capital. For instance, blockchain technology like Ripple can be used to address cross-border payment issues and reduce exchange fees and transaction time.

Walmart, a retail giant, has made significant investments in utilizing IBM's blockchain solution to establish food safety centers and conduct proof of concept and blockchain pilots for food products such as mango slices and fresh-cut pork products in both the United States and China. These efforts emphasize the importance of blockchain in addressing food safety and quality concerns, particularly in light of past scandals related to food products in China.

Challenges associated with blockchain technology in the agri-food industry include the compatibility of blockchain systems built by different companies or countries, verification of data accuracy, accessibility of consumer-friendly scan systems, and safety of non-crypto currency transactions. Additionally, integrating pre-existing data into the blockchain and addressing the diverse tracking needs of different products present further challenges.

In conclusion, while there is great enthusiasm for blockchain technology in the agri-food industry, there are technical and regulatory challenges that need to be overcome before widespread adoption of blockchain technology in various agri-food applications can be realized. Blockchain technology holds promise for revolutionizing the agri-food system by enhancing traceability and transparency and improving food safety and quality.
