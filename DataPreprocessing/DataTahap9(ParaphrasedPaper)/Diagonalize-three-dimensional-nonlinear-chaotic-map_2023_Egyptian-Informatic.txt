The trilinear system for providing image security is constructed using logistic and cubic maps, resulting in the generation of six completely random bijections, denoted as t1(x), t2(x), t2(y), t3(x), t3(y), and t3(z). The function t1(x) randomly shuffles the image pixels, while t2(x) and t2(y) scramble the pixel positions, and the remaining three maps alter the pixel values. This process effectively reduces the correlations among the RGB components of the image, enhancing its security. Image security is essential due to the susceptibility of sensitive images to attacks from various sources. Therefore, utilizing chaos theory in image encryption is critical, as it offers high security and totally random performance due to its sensitivity to initial parameters. The proposed chaotic system simultaneously encrypts RGB images and their components, providing a multi-layered framework with different secret parameters. The study demonstrates that the proposed method is highly sensitive to even minute changes in the input image, ensuring a high degree of security.
