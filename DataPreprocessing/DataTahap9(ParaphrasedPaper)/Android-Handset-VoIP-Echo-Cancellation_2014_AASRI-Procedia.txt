This research aimed to utilize a conventional 2G/3G circuit switch (CS) session without experiencing echo and maintaining excellent voice quality. To determine whether the echo canceller was integrated into the hardware or the chip, it was necessary to examine the Android source code and extract the relevant portion of code for the CS session. Subsequently, the identified code segment was utilized to replicate the echo function in the hardware.

The presence of a remote speaker implies that the individual speaking does not hear the listener's voice, reflecting a common scenario in human communication where one party speaks while the other listens. In such a scenario, the echo suppressor is activated to address this characteristic.
