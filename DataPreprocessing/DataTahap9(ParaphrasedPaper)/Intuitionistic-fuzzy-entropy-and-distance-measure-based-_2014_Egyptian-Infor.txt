In decision-making processes, dealing with ambiguous or imprecise preference information poses a significant challenge for decision makers. This challenge has driven researchers to expand multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques in fuzzy environments. The technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS), one of the well-known classical MCDM methods developed by Hwang and Yoon, is based on the concept that the selected alternative should be the closest to the positive ideal solution and the farthest from the negative ideal solution.

In this study, the TOPSIS method is extended to an intuitionistic fuzzy environment using a construction theorem and distance measure. Weights for each criterion are determined using intuitionistic fuzzy entropy measure to assess their relative importance. The proposed intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method is then applied to rank four organizations based on important criteria. Subsequently, the obtained ranking is utilized in a portfolio selection problem to analyze risk and return in different portfolios.

The relative closeness coefficient indicates the proximity of an alternative to the positive ideal solution and its distance from the negative ideal solution. The ranking order of all alternatives can be determined based on the descending order of relative coefficient values, with the most preferred alternative having the highest value.

Risk is defined as the level of uncertainty regarding the return on an asset and represents the potential for investment loss. It can either be zero (in the case of a risk-free asset) or positive (in the case of a risky asset). There are two types of risk associated with risky assets: systematic risk, which pertains to factors such as the market economy, and unsystematic risk, which is connected to specific events such as litigation outcomes or natural disasters.
