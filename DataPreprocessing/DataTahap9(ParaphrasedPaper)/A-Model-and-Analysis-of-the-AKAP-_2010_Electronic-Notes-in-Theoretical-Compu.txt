The focus of our research is to examine the biochemical processes involved in the scaffold-mediated communication between the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the raf-1/mek/erk pathways. In our study, we utilize a continuous time Markov chain with levels to model the system and analyze its properties using continuous stochastic logic and the symbolic probabilistic model checker prism. Our analysis considers two types of properties of the model: causal events and pulsating behavior. To articulate these properties, we enhance the model with trend formulas. It is important to note that this research is being conducted in collaboration with experimentalists, and the system is presently being investigated in wet-lab settings.

Intracellular signal transduction pathways play a crucial role in transmitting signals from a receptor to the nucleus, where they regulate cellular responses such as growth or apoptosis. Scaffold proteins are significant in these pathways as they facilitate the anchoring of specific proteins in precise locations for receiving or transmitting signals. Under certain conditions, a scaffold can amplify the output of a signaling cascade or reduce the response time for quicker output. While individual pathways have distinct signaling roles, they can also interact with each other, a phenomenon known as cross-talk. This paper specifically explores the modeling and reasoning of the scaffold-mediated cross-talk between cAMP and raf-1/mek/erk pathways, which is essential for the regulation of cell proliferation, transformation, and survival. The AKAP scaffold protein, often abbreviated as AKAP, plays a central role in this context.

Given the incomplete nature of some information, our approach to modeling AKAP is based on a stochastic, computational, and concurrent view, employing continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). Specifically, we utilize an abstraction of CTMCs based on discrete levels of concentrations, known as CTMC with levels. The formal language used for modeling is the state-based language underlying the probabilistic symbolic model checker prism. We express temporal properties of the model in continuous stochastic logic (CSL), focusing on causality properties and pulsations. In order to express these properties, we define trend formulas for variables in the prism model, which compute, for every state, the probability that the value of a specific variable increases or decreases during a transition.

The paper is structured as follows: we provide an overview of AKAP scaffold behavior in the next section, followed by an overview of the prism model in section 3. Section 4 contains a description of some properties of interest and the results of the analysis. Finally, we conclude with potential directions for future work.

For further details, the paper contains specific examples, such as the activation and inhibition of raf-1, downregulation by PDE8A1, scaffold notation, and pulsating behavior, all of which were analyzed in relation to the model. The paper also discusses the formalization of these properties and their verification using PRISM, as well as potential future work, including investigating the amplitude of the pulsation and examining the relationship between trends in the CTMC model and the sign of first-order derivatives in the corresponding ODE model. This involves considering derivatives in the context of model checking biochemical systems, as previously investigated in biocham, where oscillatory properties are analyzed using queries expressed as formulas in LTL with constraints over real numbers. These formulas are interpreted over traces of states, with each state including not only the concentration value of each molecule but also the value of its first-order derivative.
