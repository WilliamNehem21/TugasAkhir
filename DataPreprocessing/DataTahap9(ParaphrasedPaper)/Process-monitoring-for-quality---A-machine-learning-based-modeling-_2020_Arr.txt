This academic paper discusses the concept of process monitoring for quality, which is a quality philosophy driven by big data and focused on defect detection through binary classification and empirical knowledge discovery. The approach is based on big models, which are predictive models integrating machine learning, statistics, and optimization techniques to create a functional model for manufacturing processes. The functional model is parsimonious and has high detection ability, making it reliable for engineers to use in production control. The paper introduces a modeling scheme that aims to detect rare quality events by using feature selection and model selection to achieve parsimony. The scheme is tested in four case studies using support vector machine, logistic regression, naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors learning algorithms, and the results show that it outperforms typical learning approaches in terms of parsimony and prediction accuracy.

The paper also provides a review of related research efforts, such as a two-step fault detection procedure proposed by some researchers, a state-of-the-art report on the domain, and a project based on Bayesian nets. Additionally, it discusses various methods for handling unbalanced data structures and highlights the need for further research in developing algorithms that can learn from highly unbalanced data without relying on ad hoc manipulation.

The proposed scheme employs a hybrid correlation and ranking-based filtering algorithm to select relevant features and uses a nested candidate models approach to enhance parsimony. The penalized maximum probability of correct decision criterion is then applied to select the final model, and the scheme is shown to be applicable to various learning algorithms and effective in finding a good quality solution with a limited number of candidate models.

The paper is organized into sections covering theoretical background, the process monitoring for quality using big data-driven approach, empirical studies, comparative analysis, and conclusions. It also discusses the application of filter methods to eliminate irrelevant or redundant features before the learning process, as well as the use of hybrid approaches to combine different feature selection methods.

The proposed learning scheme has been validated on highly unbalanced data sets using several learning algorithms and has demonstrated its capacity to effectively select relevant features and achieve parsimonious modeling. Despite the limitations in guaranteeing the optimal solution, it shows promise in detecting rare quality events and handling diverse learning algorithms.
