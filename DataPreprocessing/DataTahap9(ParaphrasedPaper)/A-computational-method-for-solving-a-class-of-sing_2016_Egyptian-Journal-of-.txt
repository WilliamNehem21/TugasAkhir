The authors extensively discussed singular boundary value problems and their solution methods using reproducing kernel space, Galerkin and collocation methods. Mohsen and El-Gamel presented the application of Galerkin and collocation methods to solve two-point boundary value problems. Secer and Kurulay introduced the sinc-Galerkin method for singular Dirichlet-type boundary value problems. Rashidinia et al. proposed a reliable parametric spline method.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a review of the basic properties of Bernstein polynomials and the development of the Bernstein operational matrix for derivatives. Section 3 introduces the solution methods for singular boundary value problems. In Section 4, the efficiency and applicability of the suggested algorithm are demonstrated through numerical examples. Finally, the conclusion is presented in Section 5.
