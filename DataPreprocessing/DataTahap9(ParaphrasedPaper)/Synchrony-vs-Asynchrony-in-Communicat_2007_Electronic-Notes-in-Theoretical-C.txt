Certainly! Here is a paraphrased version of the academic paper:

It is possible for the auxiliary data resulting from the encoding of different processes to interfere with each other. However, this is not problematic as this data merely depends on the length of the translated actions. For instance, consider the situations where monadic and dataspace-based communications are not sufficiently robust to ensure effective encoding. The issue arises from the inability to associate a given piece of data with the process that generated it. Consequently, languages utilizing such primitives (e.g., ambient or CCS) are unable to freely switch between their synchronous and asynchronous versions, despite the latter ones maintaining Turing power. This observation prevents Theorem A.6 from being analogous in the case where a source language input/output of arity k is translated into an (k+ 2)-ary input/output. Consequently, proving full abstraction becomes slightly more complex, although proving divergence freedom remains the same.
