The latter two phases of a compiler correspond to the two phases mentioned here. Similar to how code generation uses information from semantics analysis, dynamic semantics can utilize information or properties provided by static semantics. In a strongly typed language, this information includes a well-typed result, allowing dynamic semantics to bypass typechecking.

It is possible to describe program properties other than types, such as security, resource usage, or effect. The aim of defining these properties is to facilitate compile-time analyses ensuring certain runtime behaviors of programs satisfying these properties. For instance, a security property might involve levels of priority and access to secure information. A successful static analysis should guarantee that no security violations can occur at runtime. However, demonstrating the correctness of the static analysis becomes increasingly challenging as properties and analyses become more complex.

Separating semantics and compilers into two phases offers two advantages: efficiency and predictability. Conducting tests and operations once during compile time can potentially eliminate the need to perform them at runtime. For example, static type checking in strongly typed languages exemplifies this advantage by establishing program properties at compile time, thereby predicting or guaranteeing the program's behavior at runtime. The benefits of these advantages outweigh the drawback of constructing and proving two distinct phases.

Nonetheless, defining languages with more complex features and providing more information through static analyses increases the difficulty of defining and proving the consistency of these analyses with dynamic semantics. An alternative approach is to define a single semantics containing both static and dynamic checks. This is generally easier than defining two separate semantics, as property checking can be done when properties are clearly evident. For example, dynamic type checking could be used instead of static type checking, altering the semantics. 

Constructing a type checker from a semantic specification is not a new concept, though there has been limited work in this area. Neil Jones, in 1991, focused specifically on type systems, but this approach could be extended to other static properties. However, this approach fails to distinguish between static and dynamic errors, and it does not guarantee that every source program processed in this way will result in a residual program without error checking, nor does it ensure that the language is strongly typed.

A fundamental limitation of using partial evaluation to specify static semantics is that it does not explicitly construct a type system or some other specification of static operations. An alternative staging transformation called pass separation could be used, which separates stages of computations based on the availability of data, offering a potential solution to this limitation.

Creating a type system requires starting with terms already attached with types and using those types in semantics to perform checks. This approach may be biased and might be seen as a part of the proof of type soundness, raised questions about the origin of these types.

If the goal is to enhance a language like Scheme with static checking to prevent certain types of runtime errors, a technique similar to the one proposed in the previous section may be applicable. This involves starting with Scheme's simple notion of type, identifying a notion of safe state, and working backwards using rewrite rules to argue that safe states come from safe states. Exploring this approach could yield interesting results and is worth studying.
