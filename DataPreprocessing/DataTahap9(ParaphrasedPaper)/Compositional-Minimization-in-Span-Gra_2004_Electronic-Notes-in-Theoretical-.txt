The conventional concept of minimizing an automaton has been expanded to the compositional domain of span graphs, particularly in relation to branching bisimulation. This form of minimization serves as the foundation for compositional model checking, which aims to address the issue of exponential state-space growth in exhaustive automated searches. Despite its successful application in a variety of problems within practical model checking programs, this approach has been found to have certain limitations.

In the context of model checking, we are specifically interested in problems that can be bounded by polynomial functions. Every problem x1, x2, ... is constrained by the exponential function b(n) = cn, where c represents the maximum number of states and transitions that an xi may possess.

In Remark 4.6, we provide explicit descriptions of the four minimal spans f1, f2, f3, and f4. As demonstrated in the proof of Lemma 4.4, it is evident that f1 comprises 4 states (corresponding to cases 4, 5, 7, and 8 being empty), f2 consists of 6 states (with cases 3 and 6 empty), and both f3 (cases 3, 7, and 8 empty) and f4 (cases 4, 5, and 6 empty) encompass 5 states. We describe these minimal spans as sub-spans of the span q, which consists of 8 states (each state corresponding to one of the cases of the partition described in the proof of Lemma 4.4), along with the associated transitions.

Specifically, f1 is the sub-span of q with states 1, 2, 3, and 6, f2 comprises the sub-span with states 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, f3 encompasses the sub-span with states 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, and f4 includes the sub-span with states 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8.
