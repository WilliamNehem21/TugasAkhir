Weeds, as defined by the Weed Science Society of America, are plants that are objectionable or interfere with human activities and welfare. Different weed species may respond to phytotoxicity in varying ways, and reducing reliance on synthetic herbicides remains a priority in weed management research. Allelopathy has emerged as a potential natural solution to this issue, offering an effective and affordable alternative to synthetic herbicides.

Seeds of B. pilosa were collected from orchards in El-Sharkia Governorate, Egypt, and subjected to sterilization with 0.3% sodium hypochlorite, followed by drying and storage. The germinated seeds were then exposed to different concentrations of plant extracts, and the growth inhibition was measured in terms of radicle and plumule lengths.

Variation in the response of B. pilosa seedling growth to the extracts of three Plantago species was observed, with methanolic extracts showing higher phytotoxic effects than aqueous extracts. This suggests that methanol extracts a wider range of active components compared to water, making them potentially more effective in managing this troublesome weed through eco-friendly bio-control methods.

The study also found evidence of reduced cell division, alterations in cellular ultrastructure, and disruptions in various physiological processes in B. pilosa seedlings exposed to the plant extracts. Further research is needed to identify and characterize the specific allelochemicals responsible for these effects and understand their modes of action.
