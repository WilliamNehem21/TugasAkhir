The current momentum is pushing for increased integration of information and communication technology (ICT) in the agricultural sector, with digitization offering significant potential benefits for both producers and consumers. However, the introduction of technological solutions in rural areas is met with several challenges. This paper provides a survey of recent research activities, including research projects and scientific literature, with the aim of demonstrating achieved results, ongoing investigations, and remaining challenges, both technical and non-technical. The focus is primarily on the European Union (EU) territory, identifying threats, concerns, existing solutions, and upcoming solutions to overcome barriers.

Smart farming (SF) refers to the application of ICT in agriculture, utilizing data collected and analyzed through ICT techniques to support efficient production processes. This motivates scientists, practitioners, and private and public companies to work towards developing and promoting the use of innovative technologies to support farmers. The European Union highlights the relevance of technologies such as satellite imagery, agricultural robots, sensor nodes for data collection, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery and actuation, and aims to fully exploit these technologies for the benefit of European agriculture and rural areas.

The lack of connectivity, or digital divide, is identified as the primary obstacle to implementing SF in rural areas. Despite promising developments, such as the advent of 5G technology, scattered coverage remains a concern, particularly in rural and low-income areas. Despite these challenges, numerous initiatives are working towards the digitization of agriculture, including Smart AKIS, a thematic network funded by the EU Agricultural European Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI). This network aims to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and practitioners to promote implementable solutions. However, there is ongoing debate about the socio-economic implications of SF, particularly concerning work safety and environmental impact.

Farmers often perceive SF as beneficial only for large holdings due to the perceived high costs and complexity of the technologies involved. However, innovative technologies may not only be large-scale and costly but also slow, precise, small, and affordable. This underscores the need to promote awareness of the potential for innovative technologies to benefit a wide range of agricultural operations.

This paper aims to survey research initiatives and scientific literature on SF, highlighting recent technologies and techniques as well as remaining challenges. It further discusses ongoing research projects in the EU related to SF activities, emphasizing advancements in satellite optical data processing, real-time stream processing, analysis, and reasoning, and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles as part of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Additionally, it addresses the application of semantic analyses and big data techniques in agriculture, as well as the potential for machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in autonomous agricultural systems.

In conclusion, this paper emphasizes the importance of ongoing efforts to promote ICT use in agriculture, particularly in the EU, and highlights the need for advancing technology, open standards, and programs to address digital divide in rural areas. Additionally, it underscores the significance of consolidating existing scenarios in an interoperable and cost-effective manner, and the importance of addressing concerns related to data access and use in agricultural contexts.
