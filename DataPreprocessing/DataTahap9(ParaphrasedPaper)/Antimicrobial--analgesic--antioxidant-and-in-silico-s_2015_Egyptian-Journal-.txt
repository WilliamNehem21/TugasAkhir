A series of new azosalicylic acid analogs were synthesized by combining different aryl and heteroarylamine functionalities with a salicylic acid core. Various modern analytical methods were used to confirm the structure of the synthesized compounds. These compounds were then tested for their antimicrobial, analgesic, and antioxidant activities. Two compounds, 4e and 4h, demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against most bacterial strains, while compound 4e exhibited the highest analgesic activity. In vitro antibacterial and analgesic activity results were supported by in-silico investigations, and compounds substituted with antipyrinylazo and 4-carboxy phenylazo moieties exhibited potential antioxidant activity.

The paper also highlights the biological activities of azo-salicylic acids, citing the effectiveness of sulfasalazine against ulcerative colitis, as well as the potential of azo-salicylic acids as precursors for various pharmacological agents. The authors emphasize the importance of synthesizing new azo-salicylic acid congeners with different aryl and heteroaryl functionalities to investigate their antibacterial, analgesic, and antioxidant activities.

Furthermore, the study details the testing of the newly synthesized azosalicylic acid analogs on various microbial strains, along with an acute oral toxicity study in female Wistar rats to determine their safety dose. The antioxidant activity of the synthesized compounds was also evaluated using the DPPH assay, with promising results compared to a standard antioxidant.

In summary, this research focused on the synthesis and characterization of new azosalicylic acid analogs, as well as their biological activities, microbial testing, safety assessment, and antioxidant potential.
