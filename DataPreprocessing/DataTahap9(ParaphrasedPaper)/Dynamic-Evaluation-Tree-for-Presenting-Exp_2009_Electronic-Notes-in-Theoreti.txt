Inexperienced programmers encounter challenges with their visual attention strategies when interacting with program visualizations. This paper discusses ongoing efforts to enhance the user interfaces of visualization tools in order to assist students in addressing visual attention issues. An interface solution called the dynamic evaluation tree is introduced, aiming to consolidate the user interface windows and enable users to focus their visual attention more effectively on a specific area of the screen.

Many visualization tools have similar user interface structures and components, which may be due to the absence of specific design principles being applied to the UI design, as these tools offer various perspectives without clear guidelines. Depending on the focus of the visualization, certain windows may not be necessary, such as the evaluation window in algorithm visualization tools that operate at a higher abstraction level. Experts are better equipped to manage information presented in different windows of visualization tools compared to novices, who tend to concentrate their attention in a limited manner, either switching continuously between windows or fixating on a single window.

To address the challenges faced by novice programmers, a dynamic evaluation tree is proposed as a potential solution, with the aim of improving their visual attention strategies. The dynamic evaluation tree's effectiveness should be assessed through eye-tracking studies once implemented, to determine its impact on visual attention strategies. Additionally, further research could explore the potential of guiding students to develop better visual attention strategies using the dynamic evaluation tree and similar UI solutions.
