In an informal manner, the academic paper discusses the representation of pairings and encryption using mathematical notation. It states that a probabilistic pattern associated with a ciphertext can be obtained by replacing each encrypted block with the corresponding clear expression, along with the probability of obtaining information about it. Furthermore, it introduces the concept of the probabilistic pattern associated with an encrypted message and formally defines it in terms of the probability of obtaining information about the message. The paper assumes that the initial knowledge of the adversary, represented by expression g, is empty, and notes that as the adversary gains additional information, the estimation of the probability of obtaining information may increase.
