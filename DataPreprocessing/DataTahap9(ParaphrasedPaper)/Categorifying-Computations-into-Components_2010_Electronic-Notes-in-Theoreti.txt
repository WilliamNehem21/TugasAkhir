A less robust version of this situation has been previously presented. However, the final part of the argument was not thoroughly explained with direct calculations. What is unique in this paper is the exploration of work within the bicategory of profunctors. One of the main themes of this paper is to illustrate the application of calculations within this specific context.

In actuality, this 2-cell is a form of strength in an internal sense. Consequently, an arrow, with its complete set of operators (arr, >>>, and first), constitutes a strong monad within the realm of profunctors. This observation interestingly aligns with the informal perspective of arrows as an extension of strong monads.

The assertion of f's arguments is contradicted in (4). By considering this functor (4) as f in definition 2.1, we establish an end x[f(x, x), g(x, x)]. Such an end does exist when c is a small category, as sets possess small limits (thus small ends).

However, a challenge arises in that the (horizontal) composition of 1-cells (i.e., profunctors) is not strictly associative. As a result of definition 2.7 of composition by coends and products, associativity can only be guaranteed up to coherent isomorphisms. The same limitation applies to unity. Therefore, profunctors constitute a bicategory (as opposed to a 2-category), as indicated in (see).

Proposition 3.3 provides a new mathematical interpretation of the concept of an arrow. Its systematization appears to be more robust than that of the original definition (3.1). Moreover, it seems simpler than the treatment of first in Freyd categories, which involves complexities such as premonoidal categories and central morphisms. It is this simplicity that is leveraged throughout the remainder of the paper.
