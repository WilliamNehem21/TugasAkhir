The concept of epidemic intelligence (EI) has revolutionized disease surveillance and control by integrating indicator-based and event-based surveillance into a single system, as stipulated by the International Health Regulations (IHR) of 2005. Informal sources, which provide unstructured textual data, pose challenges to the surveillance systems due to linguistic ambiguities, redundant information, and data overload. In this paper, we propose statistical measures to effectively extract epidemiological events from textual data, without the need for counterexamples, and to determine the parameters that need to be integrated. We focus on two main parameters: the textual context for extracting pairs of elements to define an epidemiological event for animal disease surveillance, and the pairs of entities and generalization to apply for event extraction, with potential relevance in embedding approach architectures.

The paper presents related work on event-based surveillance systems, entity extraction and normalization, linking, and event extraction in the context of animal disease surveillance. We outline a global process for extracting relevant events, and discuss the results obtained with different strategies. The paper also reviews various existing event-based surveillance systems, such as ProMED, BioCaster, and others, which utilize a combination of automated text-mining and expert curation.

To address challenges in extracting epidemiological events from textual data, we propose the use of association mining methods to detect entity co-occurrences in news articles. We conducted experiments to evaluate the proposed approach, using a corpus of news articles annotated with events and compared against a gold-standard database. The experiments yielded promising results, showing that using a window of words outperformed document-based and sentence-based methods while reducing the probability of detecting false pairs.

In this work, we also highlight the limitations of pre-trained language models, such as BERT, in specific domains, and suggest potential future work in utilizing BERT for event extraction. Further, we discuss challenges related to detecting disease-location pairs and the implications of implicit host information in news articles. Finally, we propose the expansion of text content using word embedding architectures as a potential solution for addressing these challenges.
