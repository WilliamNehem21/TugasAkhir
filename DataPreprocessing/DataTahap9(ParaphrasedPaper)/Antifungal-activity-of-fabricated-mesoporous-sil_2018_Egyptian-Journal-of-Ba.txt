This study discusses the creation and assessment of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) with sizable, adjustable, and open cylindrical pores as a potential antifungal solution against a. solani in both laboratory and greenhouse settings. The effectiveness of MSN was compared to the recommended fungicide, metalaxyl, with regard to combatting tomato early blight.

The ethylene oxide (EO)(pluronic P123; EO20PO70EO20) utilized were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Company, Ltd., and were used without further purification. Metalaxyl, a recommended fungicide for controlling the tomato early blight pathogen, was sourced from Nanjing Essence Fine-Chemical Co., Ltd. and Agricultural Development Co., Ltd.

Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were captured with a Hitachi S-4300 microscope, using carbon tape as a substrate for fixing the MSN powder. Additionally, 29Si MAS NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer.

Under laboratory conditions, the efficacy of MSN and metalaxyl against a. solani was assessed based on the percentage of growth inhibition relative to the control treatment. Potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium was poured into petri dishes, with 15 ml per dish, and inoculated with a 5 mm diameter disk bearing the mycelium growth from a 5-day-old a. solani culture.

The distinctive traits of MSN, such as a high surface area (SBET) of 489 m2/g and a small pore size (DP) of 10.7, are expected to enhance its surface morphology's significance in cellular interaction, resulting in a cytotoxic effect against early blight fungus. It is known that smaller particles have a larger surface area available for interaction and consequently exert a stronger antimicrobial effect than larger particles.

When managing plant pathogens, attention should be given not only to effectively controlling the pathogens attacking agricultural crops but also to their impact on the growth and yield characteristics of the crops. A noteworthy increase in growth parameters was observed in tomato plants treated with MSN, consistent with findings suggesting that control agents can suppress disease incidence and positively affect plant growth and yield.

The specific dosage of MSN needed for spraying one acre remains undetermined. However, based on the results, it is estimated that around 40 g of MSN mixed with 100 L of water per acre could be applicable and cost-effective, comparable to the tested fungicide amount (30 g/4046.85 m2).

Safety is a crucial consideration for any agents used to control agricultural pests. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of silica nanoparticles in killing bacterial cells without harming human cells, confirming the safety of MSN to human health and its potential to mitigate the hazardous effects caused by chemical fungicides.

MSN effectively reduced the severity of early blight disease in tomatoes and improved tomato growth characteristics. The application of MSN nanoparticles at low concentrations is expected to be environmentally friendly and reduce farm management costs. Furthermore, the easy synthesis of MSN presents a promising approach for designing and synthesizing other metal oxides with potent antifungal activity, offering a safe alternative to chemical fungicides for controlling tomato early blight.
