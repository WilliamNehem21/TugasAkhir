Definition 2.3 states that given a set of functions called basic functions (denoted as b) and a set of operations (denoted as o), the function algebra, denoted as fa[b; o], refers to the smallest set of functions that includes b and is also closed under the operations in o. To enhance readability, the elements of b or o are often listed as a simple comma-separated list.
