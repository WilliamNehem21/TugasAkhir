The data set comprises a graph representing the structure of a double helix DNA, which consists of a large number of interconnected four elements (a, t, c, g) spanning from one side of the DNA strand to the other. The connections between these elements are not random; they adhere to specific rules, with (a) being paired with (t) and (c) being paired with (g). These elements are connected in the DNA strand through three components: phosphate, sugar, and the base itself. 

The initial algorithm involves isolating one strand of the DNA from the double helix and subsequently transforming these DNA structures into messenger RNA (mRNA). This conversion process entails replacing each thymine (t) element with uracil (u) and leaving cytosine (c) and guanine (g) unchanged across all mRNA structures. Following this step, the entire graph (mRNA strand) is divided into multiple sub-graph datasets, which are then fed into the RDFSM algorithm to identify various possible sub-graphs based on a specified minimum support threshold. An illustration demonstrating the execution of this process is provided below.
