The paper introduces new amplitudes for test signals and validates a model using a test object. The received model demonstrates high accuracy, both within linear and nonlinear models. The newly defined values significantly improve identification accuracy compared to previously used amplitudes and coefficients. The accuracy of identifying the nonlinear part of the test object increases by nearly 10-fold, with a standard deviation of no more than 5% in the best cases.
