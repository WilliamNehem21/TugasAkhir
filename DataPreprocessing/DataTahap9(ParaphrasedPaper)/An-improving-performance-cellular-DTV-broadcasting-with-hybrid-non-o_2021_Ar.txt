When it comes to selecting technology for service layers, the evolution of the physical layer in cellular broadband infrastructure has shown a pattern of changing roughly every decade, such as the transition from 4G to 5G. Similar shifts have occurred in television broadcasting, for instance, the transition from analog television (ATV) to digital television (DTV), as seen in the conversion from the National Television System Committee (NTSC-3.58) to the Advanced Television System Committee (ATSC) standard in the USA, and from the Phase Alternation Line (PAL) to Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DVB-T) in Europe, as well as the conversion from NTSC-J to Integrated Service Digital Broadcast (ISDB) in Japan [5, 6]. In response to the gap in physical layer structures between broadcast owners and service providers, a hybrid technology approach using a multi-layer delivery system has been proposed by researchers in recent years. Efforts to develop technologies that can meet these demands have led to extensive research and development in the areas of convergence between broadcast and broadband, and the integration of hybrid broadcast and broadband (HBB) methods on a global scale [12, 16, 17].

The concept of cellular digital television (CDTV) broadcasting over mobile networks was introduced by Shi et al., while Lykourgiotis et al. explored combinations of broadcast and broadband for real-time services. Shokair et al. proposed a hybrid broadcast/broadband network as a potential solution to address the growing demand for CDTV. Additionally, researchers including those cited in references [29, 30] have investigated the performance analysis for users at varying distances in a non-orthogonal-based system. L. Zhang et al. examined non-orthogonal multiplexing in 5G-multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS) as part of broadband-broadcast convergence. Further research has focused on the planning of hybrid CDTB services using digital video broadcasting-next generation handheld (DVB-NGH) and LTE models, as presented in the referenced work.

This section involves mathematical analyses in three sub-sections: 1) investigation and analysis of bit error rate (BER) performance, 2) consideration and analysis of fractional transmit power allocation (FTPA) algorithm for locally decodable codes (LDM) multiservices, and 3) consideration and analysis of outage probability performance.

In comparing the use of fractional transmit power allocation (FTPA) with cases without FTPA, it is apparent that the performance worsens in the FTPA case. Furthermore, the use of FTPA has an impact on uplink BER performance and LDM, though it does not yield a gain in downlink BER performance, and the effect on LDM is not as clearly visible.

Conclusively, the research suggests that non-orthogonal and orthogonal hybrid framework technologies have outperformed in terms of BER and outage rate performance compared to singular technologies. Therefore, it is proposed that these technologies be considered for the next generation of CDTV as an intermediate infrastructure for broadcast network owners. In specific instances, it is recommended for the next-generation CDTB broadcast.
