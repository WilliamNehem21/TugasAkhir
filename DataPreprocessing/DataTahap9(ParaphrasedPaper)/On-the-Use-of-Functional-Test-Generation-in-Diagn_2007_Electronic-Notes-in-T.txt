Bi-national test generation for fault diagnosis focuses on producing combinational tests to isolate and identify faults within a circuit. These tests target the combinational logic by assigning values to primary inputs and present state variables, and then observing the effects of faults on primary outputs and next state variables. Each test for a fault defines a single state transition in the circuit.

To facilitate diagnostic test generation, we introduce the concept of state transition faults as part of the diagnostic test set. These faults, denoted as STT arg, consist of individual or multiple state transition faults. The process of diagnostic test generation involves creating tests specifically tailored to the faults outlined by STT arg. One approach is to employ a functional test generation method, as described elsewhere. Alternatively, test generation for state transition faults can be carried out at the gate level.
