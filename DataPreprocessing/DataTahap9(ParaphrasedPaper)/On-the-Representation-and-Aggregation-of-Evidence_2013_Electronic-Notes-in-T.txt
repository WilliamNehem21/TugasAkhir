As expected, most informal representations lack rigor, but they are typically relevant as they directly pertain to practical applications. While professionals use various channels and formats to communicate experiences effectively, organizing this information into a coherent body of knowledge is challenging due to its dispersed nature and constantly evolving content.

An intriguing approach to capturing and presenting evidence involves leveraging theories as a framework for aggregating evidence. The use of theories provides a solid foundation for formulating and accumulating scientific knowledge across various disciplines. Theories aid in providing a structured representation of complex real-world phenomena, thus facilitating the communication of ideas and knowledge in a precise manner.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the conceptualization of theories and the use of the Dempster-Shafer theory as an aggregation mechanism. Section 3 presents the approach, while Section 4 discusses its benefits and limitations. Section 6 addresses the industry perspective, and Section 7 identifies future avenues for research.

Decision-making based on belief functions often involves choosing the hypothesis with the highest associated belief. However, the next section presents an alternative criterion to support decision-making and refine the problem framing.

It is important to note that while we have assigned the same belief value to all theory propositions, it is not mandatory to do so. In fact, both qualitative (grounded theory) and quantitative (categorical regression) data analyses were used. Differentiating data types and considering analysis results could be used to determine belief values for each proposition individually, but a systematic procedure for this determination is currently lacking. As a result, a belief of 0.65 was uniformly assigned to all propositions, intended as an illustrative estimate within the context of evidence originating from a real-world environment through action research.

Before describing the evidence used in the example, it is necessary to outline the steps and procedures involved in aggregating evidence using our approach, albeit at a high level of abstraction. While additional research efforts are being applied to detail these processes, the steps described should be sufficient for a proof of concept.

To begin, all relevant information from the first paper comparing UBR against ad hoc was reviewed and noted, and a theory was created to represent this evidence. While the process of theory building is systematic and involves clear steps, it is not exact and depends on individual interpretation and reasoning. The resulting theory represents an understanding of the evidence, supported by the wealth of empirical studies related to software inspection. Furthermore, most of the data and its analysis reported in the paper are quantitative, simplifying the construction of the theory based on variable constructs and proposition values derived from the study results.

The final results showed high belief values for most propositions, indicating a high level of agreement and certainty among the evidence sources. This represents the current body of knowledge, although aspects such as p-values were not considered, which could have affected belief values. The reliability of agreement can be leveraged to address subjective aspects of the approach, including selecting relevant constructs and defining proposition values. Additionally, the use of evidence strength grading in conjunction with quality assessment can improve belief estimation and represent the weight of each evidence contribution accurately, crucial as the concept of evidence expands to include weak and incomplete forms.

Regarding the application of the proposed approach to real-world evidence, post-mortems represent a valuable source of weak and informal evidence, aligning with the approach's focus on knowledge representation and aggregation. Translating such knowledge to theory representation enables its aggregation and subsequent use by practitioners and researchers for decision-making and hypothesis generation, although potential biases in industrial practice must be acknowledged.

In summary, the paper introduces an approach to aggregating evidence using theories as a framework and illustrates its application to real-world evidence, highlighting the potential benefits and challenges associated with this approach.
