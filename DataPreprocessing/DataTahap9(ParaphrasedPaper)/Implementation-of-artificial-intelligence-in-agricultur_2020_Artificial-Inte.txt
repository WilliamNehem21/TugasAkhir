In 2050, the global population is projected to reach nearly 10 billion, leading to a significant increase in agricultural demand and a potential 50% growth in agricultural orders compared to 2013 (FAO, 2017). Currently, approximately 37.7% of the Earth's land surface is utilized for crop production, highlighting the essential role of agriculture in various aspects such as employment generation, contribution to national income, and economic prosperity in both developed and developing nations. Furthermore, the agricultural sector plays a crucial role in bolstering rural development and structural transformation, with countries like India relying heavily on this sector, which contributes to 18% of the country's GDP and employs 50% of the workforce. Strengthening the agricultural sector is considered to be a rational and pertinent approach, with potential positive impacts on rural development and overall economic transformation.

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computational models inspired by the human brain's structure and operation. They have exhibited exceptional self-organizing and adaptive learning capabilities, making them a prominent technology in various fields such as computer science, mathematics, engineering, economics, and linguistics. Learning mechanisms in neural networks, including supervised and unsupervised learning, have been explored in the context of AI applications in agriculture, paving the way for precision farming and enhanced decision-making processes in the sector.

AI-based technologies have been instrumental in improving efficiency and addressing challenges across different industries, including agriculture. These technologies have contributed significantly to various agricultural processes such as crop yield management, irrigation, soil sensing, crop monitoring, and weeding. Furthermore, the integration of agricultural robots and AI solutions has enabled farmers to achieve higher productivity with reduced input, improved output quality, and faster time-to-market for their produce. The potential impact of AI in the agriculture sector is forecasted to be substantial, with projections indicating a significant increase in the adoption of connected devices by farmers and a surge in the volume of data generated daily from farms by 2050.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have garnered considerable interest for their applications in agriculture, including surveillance, crop monitoring, and search and rescue operations. The versatility and imaging capabilities of drones have made them increasingly popular for a wide range of agricultural activities, with potential advancements in autonomous UAV technology expected to further enhance their utility in the sector.

Artificial intelligence has facilitated the collection and analysis of large volumes of data, providing farmers with valuable insights and smarter irrigation methods, ultimately leading to higher crop yields. As the world's population becomes increasingly urbanized, there is a growing need to alleviate the burden on farmers and enhance the efficiency of agricultural processes through the automation of tasks, risk reduction, and improved farming practices using AI-based solutions.

Advancements in agricultural technology, including AI-driven selection and seed quality assessments, have significantly improved the efficiency and productivity of farming practices. These technological developments have enabled better crop selection, improved seed choices, and enhanced disease management, leading to higher returns for farmers. Additionally, the implementation of autonomous irrigation machines, based on real-time environmental and soil data, has revolutionized irrigation practices, ensuring the optimal use of water resources and improved crop yields.

In the context of weed control, AI-based techniques have been employed for distinguishing between crop seedlings and weeds, utilizing methods such as morphological characteristic measurements and digital imaging. These advancements aim to enhance the precision and efficiency of weed management, ultimately leading to improved crop outcomes.

Furthermore, AI technology has been leveraged to develop automated spraying systems for UAVs, enabling precise and efficient pesticide application, contributing to better crop health and yield. Additionally, advancements in geographic information systems (GIS) have enabled spatial crop mapping and accuracy assessment using remote sensing data, further enhancing decision-making processes on farms.

From a technological standpoint, the integration of AI and advanced sensing technologies has revolutionized agricultural practices, allowing for more precise and efficient resource allocation, improved decision-making processes, and better overall management of agricultural operations. These developments in AI technology are expected to play a crucial role in addressing the challenges faced by the agriculture sector and ensuring sustainable productivity and resource management in the coming years.
