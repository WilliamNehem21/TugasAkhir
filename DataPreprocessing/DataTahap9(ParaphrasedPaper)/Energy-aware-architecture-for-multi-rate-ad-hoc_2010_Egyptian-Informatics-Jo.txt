The foundation of ad hoc network design revolves around managing energy performance and bandwidth resources within their limitations. To address this, various multi-rate adaptation architectures have been proposed to reduce control overhead and enhance bandwidth utilization efficiency. This paper presents a multi-rate protocol aimed at optimizing network performance with minimal control overhead. The effectiveness of the proposed auto multi-rate protocol is validated through extensive simulations using the QualNet network simulator, demonstrating a significant improvement in overall network performance.

In order to enhance network throughput and bandwidth efficiency under clear channel conditions, we introduce a novel solution for efficient network operations in ad hoc networks. This is achieved by implementing a multi-rate algorithm alongside a multi-level power save protocol to achieve high network throughput with minimal overhead. The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows: Section 2 discusses multi-rate in ad hoc networks, followed by Section 3 which explains the multi-level power save protocol for MANETs. Section 4 introduces related work, while Section 5 details the performance of the proposed auto multi-rate protocol. Simulation parameters and results relevant to our proposed protocol are presented in Section 5, followed by concluding remarks in Section 6.

The main concept involves enabling a wireless station to dynamically select the most energy-efficient transmission strategy based on the link quality with the receiver. This includes factors such as transmission rate, transmit power, and/or data payload length. As different wireless stations may experience varying channel conditions due to their distances from neighbors, they may adopt different transmission strategies. To further elaborate, the distance between the sender and receiver is a primary factor influencing channel quality in wireless networks.

Building upon these guidelines, we propose three power-saving protocols. For each powered save (PS) host, the time axis is divided into fixed-length intervals known as beacon intervals. During each beacon interval, there is a subinterval called the ATIM interval. Within the ATIM interval, the PS host should activate its receiver to listen for any packet and take appropriate actions as needed. If the station has packets to send, it will contend to send its ATIM frame to its neighbor. If the station is in the ATIM window without any activity, it will periodically send beacon frames to its neighbors to synchronize the network stations. After the ATIM interval, a PS host with no packets to send or receive may enter sleep mode.

In the network setup, constant bit rate sources generate 512-byte data packets at a rate of 10 packets per second, targeting randomly chosen destinations for 100 seconds. Ad hoc ondemand distance vector routing is used for each constant bit rate source to discover a route to the destination. Additionally, the 802.11 MAC and physical wireless parameters were modified to match the specifications of the Cisco Aironet 802.11a/b/g wireless cardbus adaptor.
