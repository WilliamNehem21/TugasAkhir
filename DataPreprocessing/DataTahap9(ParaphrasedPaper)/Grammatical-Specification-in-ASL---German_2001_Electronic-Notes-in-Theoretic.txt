We could consider extending the strategy further by proposing that "zag" subcategorizes for a set of elements that could potentially form a sentence in different orders. However, it is simpler to state that "zag" subcategorizes for a verb, such as "kussen," which in turn takes "harold" as a subject and "maria" as an object. We might then explain the Dutch word order by stating that a verb "v," which is an argument to some "r," must come after "r," while other arguments to "r" precede it. This approach eliminates entities at the S and VP levels and may simplify the representation by stating that "zwem," for example, subcategorizes for a noun, and a proper noun like "harold" takes no arguments, but a singular common noun like "man" subcategorizes for a determiner, such as "een," which must immediately precede it.

If we want to avoid having objects precede verbs, we would need to take the opposite approach. One possible solution to address this issue might involve adopting a more localized treatment of word order. However, this approach may be challenging and arguably unintuitive, especially when dealing with the broader specifications and the cross-dependencies in Dutch. Alternatively, a different entry for each word could be insisted upon.

It is somewhat unsatisfactory to independently specify for each distinct root constructor that dependents map the result of its application to the multiset formed by the further application of any defined grammatical functions. A more satisfactory solution may involve utilizing a specialized institution in which the concept of grammatical function and the definition of dependents are integrated into the underlying logic. An institution is a formalization of first-order logic defined in terms of category theory. In the paper, the author defines some example institutions specialized for linguistic settings. It may also be preferable to incorporate the subject operation into the specialized institution, always corresponding to the first argument of the verb.

The use of the same dependency system, adependencymodel, for German and later Dutch as for English partly reflects the proximity of the languages, although it is also influenced by the triviality of the example. However, a different precedence relation is required, and the actual words used are different. The first disjunct of the axiom of germanordermodel is the same as for englishordermodel, while the second states that a verb succeeds all its dependents. ParametricGermanic (germanlexicon+germanordermodel) is a specific grammar that covers dependent clauses, such as "michael harold schwimmen sah."

This article has attempted to demonstrate the utility of the algebraic specification language (ASL) in grammar engineering. The class-of-model semantics offered by ASL proves useful in both defining the broad concept of a solution and in producing specific grammars that implement this concept. The author has illustrated how parameterized specifications can be used to capture the same construction in different contexts, including across languages. This, along with the notion of stepwise refinement, aligns well with the principles-and-parameters approach of contemporary linguistics.
