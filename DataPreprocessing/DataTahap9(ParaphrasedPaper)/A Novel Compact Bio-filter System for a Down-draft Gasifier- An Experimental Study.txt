Biomass energy plays a significant role in the global energy supply from renewable sources, accounting for 67.86% of current energy levels (Rogner et al., 2000). However, the presence of tar in producer gas poses challenges for its use in internal combustion engine applications (Parikh et al., 1995), leading to efforts to reduce wear on the engine (Kuapp et al., 1984). Previous research has suggested limits of less than 100 mg/nm3 for tar and less than 50 mg/nm3 for particulate content in producer gas for IC engine applications (Bhattacharya et al., 1999).

Despite extensive previous work, the design and development of a compact bio-filter system without preheating has not been thoroughly addressed. Additionally, achieving efficiency beyond 90% is a challenging task. This study aims to address these gaps by developing a new compact bio-filter system with improved efficiency.

The compact bio-filter system utilizes wet scrubber, wet charcoal, and dry coconut coir in three different layers. In the first section, raw producer gas is collected and cooled using counter water flow to remove most dust particles and a limited quantity of tar. The gas is then expanded and its velocity reduced to remove settled tar in the filter bed of the second section. The final section is utilized for condensing the moisture content of the gas and eliminating remaining tar.
