Studying the structure-activity relationship (SAR) is a critical aspect of medicinal chemistry. SAR analysis helps identify key structural features that determine molecular activity and is essential for screening potential candidate molecules with clinical applications. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) is a method for predicting molecular properties by establishing a relationship between descriptors calculated from molecular structures and the biological activity values of these molecules. Various machine learning methods, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and artificial neural networks (ANNs), have been utilized to construct SAR and QSAR models. Molecular descriptors are used to characterize physical and chemical properties or structural characteristics of compounds, and different descriptors are explored during modeling to optimize the model's effectiveness. 

For a specific dataset of JAK1 inhibitors, compounds with IC50 values between 50 nm and 100 nm were removed, while those with IC50 less than 50 nm were classified as highly active, and those with IC50 greater than 100 nm were classified as weakly active. This resulted in a dataset comprising 2982 JAK1 inhibitors, including 1712 highly active and 1270 weakly active inhibitors. 

In this study, extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs), a type of Morgan fingerprints based on the ECFP algorithm, were used to characterize the molecular structures. The radius and bits of the Morgan fingerprints were selected to ensure effective information without redundancy. Specifically, 4096-bit Morgan fingerprints with a radius of four were calculated and subsequently pruned to include 958 bits. Additionally, 80-bit MACCS molecular fingerprints were used for modeling.

The random forest (RF) algorithm, an ensemble method based on bagging, was employed for classification. The algorithm's parameters, including criterion, max_features, max_depth, max_leaf_nodes, and n_estimators, were optimized using grid optimization in a five-dimensional parameter space.

The study also identified specific structural characteristics of weakly active JAK1 inhibitors, such as the presence of six-membered aliphatic rings with no heteroatoms and a lack of aliphatic chain structures. Furthermore, these inhibitors contained three consecutive nitrogen atom structures, resulting in the presence of pyrrolotriazolopyrimidine. Thirty-three weakly active JAK1 inhibitors met these characteristics.
