Over the past ten years, there has been a proliferation of new formal languages and frameworks utilized for modeling in the field of biology. Among these are the rule-based languages, which succinctly describe one or more biological reactions. Notably, the rule-based languages Kappa and the closely related Bionetgen are capable of describing protein complex transformations at the level of binding sites. The complexity of the binding site and bond label specifications can obscure the underlying essence of a rule. In response to this, in this paper, a syntactic abstraction of Kappa, termed AL, is introduced to enable the representation of rules in a simpler form, without referencing specific binding sites.

While previous work has focused on enhancing the structure of Kappa models as a whole, specific attention has not been given to the representation of binding itself. The graphical nature of complexes in Kappa lends itself well to visual rule specification and visualization, supported by tools like RuleBase 3. However, it is emphasized that textual representations remain crucial, as they are favored by some for efficient model development and are central to efforts to introduce additional structure, such as modularity, into models.

The proposed rule specifies the degradation of an EGFR receptor when not already bound to another receptor, although it may or may not be bound to a ligand. Furthermore, the rule clarifies the binding of protein A to one of two B proteins, addressing the issue of non-commutative operator arising from the order of occurrence in rules.

Additionally, an abstract syntax of Kappa, adapted for the purposes of this paper, is presented, and an alternative approach is adopted for pairing based on protein instance numbers to resolve potential ambiguities.

Moreover, it is acknowledged that some Kappa rules can be significantly simplified using AL. While the representation in AL may complicate certain rules, it has been observed that more advanced language constructs may not be necessary for the majority of rules based on limited experience with the EGFR case study. In fact, rules in the AL EGFR model are approximately 20% shorter on average compared to the original Kappa model.

In the future, it may be meaningful to translate Kappa models to AL models for improved readability, particularly in cases where models are based directly on experimental data. This translation could serve as the foundation for a model development tool supporting two views, in Kappa and in AL, for editing the same model. Additionally, it is suggested that the binding-level semantic representation employed by Kappa might be the most natural approach when addressing the combinatorial explosion in the number of protein complexes.
