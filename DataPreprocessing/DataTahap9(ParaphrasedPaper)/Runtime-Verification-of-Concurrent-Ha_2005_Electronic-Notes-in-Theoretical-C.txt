This academic paper employs model checking techniques to troubleshoot concurrent Haskell programs. It verifies LTL formulas specifying assertions or other properties at runtime, emitting a warning and recording the path leading to any violations detected. The paper introduces a method to dynamically add formulas at runtime, providing flexibility not available in static source code verification. It presents a comprehensive example of using these techniques to detect lock-reversal in concurrent Haskell programs and introduces a template mechanism to define LTL formulas across an arbitrary set of threads or communication abstractions.

The paper suggests strategies for debugging errors and recommends using unique markers to record the position and state of the current run. While resembling traditional hello-debugging, the paper demonstrates that these traces offer added value by enabling runtime verification for running programs through an embedded runtime verifier system.

The paper explains that LTL, a temporal logic, is well-suited for describing properties that depend on a program's changing states over time, emphasizing that formulas should never evaluate to false during program execution. It allows the dynamic addition of new formulas that must hold as the system evolves.

It is structured in sections: a brief introduction to Haskell and the technique of recording traces for debugging, background on LTL and the LTL runtime verifier, a sample verification of the lock-reversal problem, a discussion on templates, and a conclusion with future work.

The paper describes the use of mvars in the IO monad for communication and synchronization in Haskell programs. It outlines the process of recording traces of concurrent actions to aid in debugging, and discusses the limitations of traditional model checking in practice, emphasizing the advantages of runtime verification for concurrent systems.

The paper introduces an algebraic data type for debugging concurrent Haskell programs, allowing for per-thread expressions and the recording of the mvar being held. It also discusses the challenge of optimizing the instantiation of templates to avoid redundant formulas.

The paper concludes by highlighting the usefulness of explicit annotations and a powerful template mechanism for dynamic instantiation of formulas. It emphasizes the value of including tail trace printing and the potential for extending the template mechanism to handle parameterized propositions.
