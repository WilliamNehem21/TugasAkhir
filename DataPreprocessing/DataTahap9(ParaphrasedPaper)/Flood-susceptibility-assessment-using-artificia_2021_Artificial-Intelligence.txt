Compared to other natural disasters driven by meteorological factors, flooding stands out as one of the most catastrophic phenomena, causing extensive damage to properties and loss of life on a global scale. Indonesia, particularly the islands of Java, Bali, and Sumatera, is at significant risk of flooding, with Jakarta, the capital city, being the most densely populated province. The city has a long history of flooding and remains vulnerable due to its location on a deltaic plain crisscrossed by natural and man-made waterways. Various factors, including climate change, sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and land subsidence, are exacerbating the flood risk in Jakarta.

On January 1, 2020, Jakarta experienced its most intense rainfall event on record, leading to widespread flooding, 16 fatalities, and displacement of over 30,000 people. This flood event caught city officials off-guard and paralyzed the nation's main economic and political hub. To mitigate such incidents and facilitate timely preparation, it is essential to develop the capability to predict and assess the areas in Jakarta most susceptible to flooding.

In recent years, machine learning models, particularly artificial neural networks (ANN), have been increasingly utilized for flood susceptibility modeling. Previous research has demonstrated that factors beyond heavy rainfall, such as elevation, curvature, stream power index, topographic wetness index, soil type, and distance from rivers, have contributed to disastrous flooding in the area. This study aims to develop a suite of machine learning models that use these environmental factors to predict flood susceptibility in Jakarta in a novel manner with a temporal aspect. The research intends to create a tool for prioritizing allocation of flood defense resources and informing civilians of flood risk when extreme rainfall is forecasted.

The study compares three machine learning models—ANNs, k-nearest neighbors (K-NN), and support vector machines (SVM)—against a random baseline to find an optimal model for flood susceptibility prediction. The research incorporates environmental input factors as well as a temporal component to improve the accuracy of flood susceptibility modeling.

The study also considers the use of satellite imagery from the Sentinel-1 C-band radar imaging satellite to provide flood extent information. Machine learning models and the concept of rebalancing the dataset using the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) are explored to predict floods. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the limitations of machine learning models when extrapolating outside of their known range and the need for periodic retraining.

The results indicate that the ANN outperformed the random baseline in predicting floods, while the SVM and K-NN models showed limited performance. The success of the ANN model is attributed to the non-linear nature of the problem and its suitability for a mixed-effects model, as well as the relationship between input variables and output varying across space and time. The analysis underscores the significance of rebalancing the dataset for accurate prediction and highlights the potential of machine learning models in addressing flood susceptibility on a spatial and temporal basis.
