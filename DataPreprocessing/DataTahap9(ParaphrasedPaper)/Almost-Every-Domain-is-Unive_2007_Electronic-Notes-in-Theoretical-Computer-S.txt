The finite set "an" does not have a bifinite partial order, so "x\pbif" can be seen as a combination of basic open sets, making it open and demonstrating that "pbif" is a closed subset of "x". As a result, the space (pbif, d) is a complete metric space. It is a well-known result that (pbif, d) is topologically equivalent to the Cantor set.
