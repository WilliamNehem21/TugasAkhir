We summarize the technical development of the paper here in a simplified manner to better communicate the fundamental concepts. The broader enriched universes of discourse discussed in the paper (defined as definition 2.2) are essential for accommodating multi-sorted theories.

For the sake of clarity and as a notation convention, we will underline the v-enriched structures. Structures that are not underlined will represent ordinary categorical notions. For example, for a v-category c, its underlying ordinary category is denoted as c.

It is not feasible to achieve an external completeness result at the level of generality of the previous section. However, in the presence of free constructions, an internal completeness result is attainable. The significance of this result in relation to external completeness is demonstrated in the subsequent section's application.
