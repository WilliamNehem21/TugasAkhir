The reduction of dephasing presents a significant obstacle in enhancing the performance of error-prone superconducting quantum computing systems. In this study, we investigate the dephasing of a transmon qubit in a dispersive readout regime using a josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier as the preamplifier. Our findings indicate that the leakage of pump from the preamplifier may lead to substantial dephasing, which can be attributed to a combination of measurement-induced dephasing, ac Stark effect, and heating. We demonstrate that pulse-mode readout is a promising measurement method for mitigating qubit dephasing while minimizing the requirement for bulky circulators. Our research provides valuable insights into addressing decoherence from microwave-pumped preamplifiers, which is crucial for advancing large-scale quantum computers.

Preamplifiers for qubit measurement, such as traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPA), may induce dephasing when the pump is active. These preamplifiers typically operate based on nonlinear wave mixing, converting pump photons into amplified signal photons. Compared to a reflective josephson parametric amplifier (JPA), a TWPA is considered a promising preamplifier for scaling up due to its higher bandwidth and larger dynamical range. However, the leakage of microwave pump can pose a severe dephasing challenge for both types of amplifiers, potentially hindering the development of dynamic quantum circuits and quantum error correction. A comprehensive understanding of the origins of such dephasing is needed to find a resolution.

To systematically address this dephasing challenge, we investigate the effects of TWPA on qubit dephasing. Using high-coherence tantalum-based superconducting transmon qubits and homemade TWPAs, we quantitatively explore the dephasing from pump leakage. We discuss various aspects of TWPA that can cause qubit dephasing, including backward amplification, pump leakage, and backward noise, and introduce a metric to compare different readout modes. Additionally, we experimentally explore several of these dephasing factors in section 3 and assess a corresponding solution known as pulse-mode readout, measuring the effectiveness of our approach.

A TWPA is a two-port device that amplifies signals by utilizing the nonlinearity of an array of Josephson junctions, a long wire with kinetic inductance, or other types of nonlinear transmission lines. It operates based on three- or four-wave mixing, where one or two pump photons are downconverted into a signal photon and an idler photon, providing exponential gain to the signal wave through energy transfer from a strong pump wave. TWPAs are beneficial for qubit readout due to their ability to achieve near quantum-limited noise, wide bandwidth, and high gain. However, they also suffer from noise originating from non-superconducting materials and intrinsic quantum fluctuations of the signal and idler waves.

Finally, we analyze the impact of leaked pump photons on the qubit chip, emphasizing the significance of understanding the effects to advance quantum computing.
