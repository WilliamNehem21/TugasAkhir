This study focuses on determining an optimal placement for the sink node within a wireless sensor network, with the aim of minimizing the total distance from all sensor nodes to the sink. To achieve this, the algorithm used in the paper calculates the geometric median of all sensor node locations, which is defined as the point that minimizes the sum of distances to all the sensor nodes. The paper outlines the related work and proposed solutions, as well as the strategy and algorithm used to find the optimal sink node location. Additionally, the network model and simulation parameters are presented, along with the performance evaluation and results, and the conclusion of the study.

The study concludes that placing the sink node at the center of the network, or at the center of the quarter with the highest node density, are favorable options for optimizing the network lifetime. Previous work using the p-median problem and other algorithms to determine optimal sink node locations are discussed, along with the results showing improvements in data rate and power efficiency through different base station layout algorithms. Furthermore, the use of the geometric median as a method to estimate location is highlighted, along with its application in facility location problems to minimize transportation costs.

The paper details the procedure for finding the optimal sink node location, including the calculation of distances to neighboring points and the iterative process used to update the sink location based on these distances.
