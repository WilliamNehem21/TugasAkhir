This research introduces a protocol named a-smac that adjusts the listening and sleep time of sensor nodes based on dynamic data traffic. The protocol sends error decisions generated by sensor nodes. The paper also presents an adaptive fault-tolerant algorithm (AFTA) for nodes. The AFTA algorithm utilizes fault-tolerant judgment results and dynamically adjusts the node listen and sleep time using the a-smac protocol, thereby integrating data judgment and node dynamic listening.

The a-smac protocol measures network traffic based on node throughput and sets parameters for the statistical number of packets sent and received by nodes in each cycle. It employs a two-threshold method (designated as s and m) to categorize the nodes into three different scenarios.

Increasing the duration of data packet transmission allows for more efficient data transmission. AFTA suggests sending three consecutive decisions when environmental changes occur to increase data traffic transmission by the node. Subsequently, the a-smac protocol is used to increase the duty ratio and listening time, ensuring timely transmission of decision information and reducing decision delay.

The study involves the random deployment of 90 nodes within a defined area, which form pairs of CBR stream transmission links. An adaptive incident detection algorithm utilizing the sliding window restart method is employed to determine the length of the sliding window (l), binary decision threshold (th), and threshold area parameters.

Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach significantly reduces unnecessary data transmission and results in lower energy consumption compared to the a-smac protocol. Furthermore, the AFTA enhances the efficiency of data transmission and improves system real-time performance and reliability. The AFTA approach could be extended in the future to address larger networks.
