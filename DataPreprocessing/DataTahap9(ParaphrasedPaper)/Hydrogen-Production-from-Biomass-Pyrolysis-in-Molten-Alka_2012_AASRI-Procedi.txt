The study involved conducting pyrolysis of various biomass feedstocks in a stainless steel tank reactor using molten alkali as a thermal pyrolysis medium, with the aim of producing hydrogen-rich gas. Six types of biomass were utilized, and the experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure and temperatures ranging from 350 to 550 degrees Celsius. Gas chromatography was used to analyze the resulting pyrolysis gas. The investigation focused on evaluating the impact of biomass type, addition of additives, and reaction conditions (including temperature and N2 flow rate) on the hydrogen content and yield in the pyrolysis gas. The findings of the study suggest that producing hydrogen-rich gas through the pyrolysis of biomass in molten salt media is feasible.

In recent times, addressing the interconnected challenges of energy and the environment, particularly in terms of energy sustainability and carbon emissions from fossil fuel usage, has emerged as a critical global concern. Many experts advocate transitioning from the current fossil fuel-based system to a hydrogen energy system as a potential solution to these issues. Research and development of technologies to produce hydrogen from alternative sources, particularly biomass rather than fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas, is seen as crucial for achieving environmentally friendly hydrogen production.

Biomass-based hydrogen production can be achieved through two major approaches: thermochemical and biochemical processes. Thermochemical routes enable rapid hydrogen production from continuous feed biomass and include methods such as gasification, pyrolysis of bio-oils, steam reforming of biomass-derived higher alkanes and alcohols, and aqueous phase reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons.

In previous work by the researchers, molten salts (ZnCl2-KCl) were used as a medium to produce bio-oil from biomass. Building on this, the current study focused on the pyrolysis of biomass in molten alkali media to generate hydrogen-rich gas, using molten NaOH as the medium and considering six different biomass samples. The investigation delved into the effects of biomass type, reaction conditions, and additives on the product gas yield and hydrogen content.

The study specifically utilized agricultural and forestry waste, including fir, birch, and redwood sawdust, as well as rice stalk, cole stalk, and rice husk, as the biomass feedstocks. The elemental content (C, H, O, N, and S) in the biomass materials was analyzed, with the biomass samples being sieved and dried prior to the pyrolysis experiments.

From the experimental results, it was observed that biomass sample type, reaction temperature, and the addition of additives significantly influenced the yield of hydrogen gas. Higher temperatures were found to contribute to a higher hydrogen yield, and the introduction of additives, particularly NiCl, led to an increase in the hydrogen yield.
