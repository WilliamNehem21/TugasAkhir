Even though the virus is expected to be eradicated in the future, many people are still hesitant to return to work, particularly in sectors that require face-to-face interaction. A study found that 65% of workers report feeling anxious about going back to the workplace. Researchers have been focusing on finding strategies to halt the spread of the virus, which primarily travels through the respiratory system to the lung cells, causing direct harm. The most effective strategy identified to stop virus transmission is maintaining physical distance from others and always wearing a mask in crowded or public places.

The paper introduces a model for categorizing facial photos based on MobileNet, using the depth-wise separable convolution (DWSC) technique to address the challenges of image processing. The study is structured with sections on image processing and deep learning techniques, the state of the art in face mask identification, discussions on challenges in face mask detection approaches, research methods, dataset presentation, experimental setup, trial findings, and conclusions. 

Scientists initially believed that COVID-19 was transmitted through the respiratory system, but later research pointed to airborne transmission as the primary mode of infection. Controlling airborne infections effectively requires employing a range of strategies, as different organizations have varying opinions about the efficacy of certain methods. While some studies have suggested that face masks have limited efficacy, recent research has shown the benefits of using face masks in preventing the flu, particularly among healthcare workers.

Early research on face mask detection primarily focused on grayscale facial picture algorithms and pattern detection techniques, leading to the development of real-time face detection with the Viola-Jones detector. However, there were limitations in low-light conditions. Recent advancements in object recognition have shifted towards deep learning models over shallow models, improving the ability to perform complex tasks such as real-time face mask detection using techniques like MobileNet and YOLOv3 algorithm.

The paper also discusses the use of gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm for face mask recognition, as well as the utilization of deep learning models such as stacked autoencoders in conjunction with principal component analysis (PCA) for face mask detection. The paper aims to investigate various facets of face mask identification, including the development of a framework for identifying masks on individuals' faces and the application of techniques like PCA and DWSC for detecting masks in the face.

The proposed system was experimented using Windows 10 and an Intel Core i5 processor with an NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPU for testing. The study also evaluates the performance of the proposed algorithm using a confusion matrix and assesses it against original convolutional filters. The findings indicate that the proposed system outperforms existing conventional convolutions, achieving an accuracy score of 94.1%, a precision score of 97.6%, a recall score of 94.4%, and an F-score of 96.01%. However, the model still requires further processing to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate mask application.
