This academic paper discusses the concept of executions in the context of dynamical systems and proposes a semantic framework for modeling system behavior based on executions. The paper argues that in order to fully capture the behavior of a system, executions should be considered as first-class citizens in the semantic framework, alongside states.

The paper also explores the use of open maps in a presheaf category to capture functional bisimulations, but notes that open maps may not fully capture the refinement perspective between an implementation and its specification. To address this limitation, the paper introduces the concept of bisimulation maps and discusses their role in capturing complete refinement between an implementation and its specification.

Additionally, the paper discusses the use of prefix orders as a way to study executions of dynamical systems in an order-theoretic manner, and raises questions about how to enrich prefix orders with observations for modeling labeled executions uniformly.

In summary, the paper presents a semantic framework for modeling system behavior based on executions and explores the use of bisimulation maps to capture complete refinement between an implementation and its specification. It also discusses the potential enrichment of prefix orders with observations for modeling labeled executions in a uniform manner.
