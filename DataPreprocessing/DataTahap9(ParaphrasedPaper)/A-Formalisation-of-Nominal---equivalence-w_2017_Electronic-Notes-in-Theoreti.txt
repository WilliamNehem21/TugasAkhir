In the specification, the grammar is presented as detailed above. The operators ut, at, ab, pr, fc, and su denote the unit, atoms as term objects, abstractions, pairs, function applications, and suspended variables, respectively. Within the fc constructor, the first and second natural number arguments signify the super and subscripts of the applied function symbol. Within the specification, the function symbols f a and f ac are represented.

An atom, denoted as an object term a, is expressed in Coq as (at a). This syntax is employed in the pseudo-code that describes the specification when necessary; otherwise, standard nominal syntax is used. It is important to note that while, according to nominal syntax, two atoms a and d are distinct by definition, (at a) and (at d) could refer to the same atom. This discrepancy arises since in the Coq specification, a and d serve as meta-variables representing atoms.
