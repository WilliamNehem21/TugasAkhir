This paper introduces the tccpinterpreter system, which has been implemented in the Maude language to interpret the behavior of programs written in the tccp language. The tccp language inherits characteristics from ccp, including being parametric with respect to a constraint system, non-deterministic, and the storage of information growing monotonically. The system specifies constraints and relations, and the non-deterministic behavior allows for more precise specifications of large systems. The tccp language includes features for capturing behaviors of reactive systems and integrates temporal capabilities through a global clock, enabling the use of linear temporal logic for specifying and model checking properties of tccp programs.

The tccpinterpreter system has been implemented in approximately 1080 lines of code divided into six Maude modules, and the system simulates the behavior of tccp programs based on the language's operational semantics and a specified constraint solver. Maude enables the implementation of a constraint solver or the utilization of an existing one to handle constraints.

The paper presents examples of tccp program behavior being interpreted by the tccpinterpreter system and demonstrates the synchronization of processes and recursion in the execution model. Additionally, it discusses using the Maude system as a semantic framework and metalanguage for the execution of the tccp language. It highlights Maude's ability to provide a clear formulation for specifying transition systems and supporting the formal specification and implementation of concurrent systems.
