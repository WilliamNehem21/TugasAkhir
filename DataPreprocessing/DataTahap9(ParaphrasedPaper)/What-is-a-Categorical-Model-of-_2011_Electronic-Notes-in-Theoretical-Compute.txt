In this section, we explore the connection between arrows and freyd categories. Initially, we revisit the definition of a (closed) freyd category and its association with strong monads. Following this, we examine the perspective of the definition of an arrow in a CCC (defined in 2.1) as a freyd category, leading to a natural definition of an enriched freyd category. We then demonstrate that enriched freyd categories and freyd categories are distinct entities in the subsequent section.

We proceed by considering an arrow within a category with finite products (defined in 2.3) and investigate its resemblance to the structure of a freyd category. The resulting structure, termed indexed freyd categories, is more general than that of arrows. Next, we explore the correlation between indexed freyd categories and freyd categories and introduce an additional condition on indexed freyd categories that renders them isomorphic to freyd categories.

The preceding proposition delineates two well-defined translations: one from arrows to closed indexed freyd categories and another in the opposite direction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these two translations are mutually inverse, up to isomorphism. To precisely define what we mean by isomorphisms in this context, we establish morphisms between arrows on a base category and morphisms between indexed freyd categories on a base category.

By considering the provided counterexample regarding the counit of the adjunction as not being isomorphic, we discern the fundamental disparity between freyd categories and indexed freyd categories. In a freyd category, computations denoted by members of k(x, y) entail a single input, which may or may not be structured: in the instance of a freyd category derived from a comonad (k(x, y) = c(wx, y)), the input is structured, whereas in the case of a freyd category constructed from a monad (k(x, y) = c(x, ty)), it remains unstructured. Conversely, indexed freyd categories feature two inputs: computations in hw(x, y) encompass an input of type w and an input of type x, both of which may be structured. In the scenario of closed indexed freyd categories, the w input must be unstructured.
