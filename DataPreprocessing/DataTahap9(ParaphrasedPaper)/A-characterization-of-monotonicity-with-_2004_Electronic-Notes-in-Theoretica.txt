This research paper examines the behavior of plural determiners that quantify over collections from the perspective of monotonicity and collectivity in natural language semantics. It builds on previous studies by proposing a unified determiner fitting operator that captures both existential quantification with plural determiners and respects their monotonicity properties. The paper also introduces a novel collectivity operator on determiners that combines insights from generalized quantifier theory. The study showcases two asymmetries in the monotonicity properties of collective determiners, revealing that natural language determiners change their monotonicity behavior when they quantify over collections only if their conservativity is altered. The denotation of determiner expressions is discussed in the context of distributive predicates, with specific attention given to the monotonicity properties of determiners and their collectivized counterparts.

The paper presents various observations and analyses related to the behavior of determiners when quantifying over collections, highlighting instances where monotonicity entailments are not preserved and contrasting cases where certain determiners, such as "some", maintain their monotonicity properties when quantifying over collections. The discussion also involves the concept of global determiners and their monotonicity in different arguments, as well as the process of counting members of collections and its impact on the monotonicity properties of determiners.

One of the key findings of the paper is that determiners like "all" and "not all" lose their left monotonicity under count, while determiners like "some" and "no" do not lose their left monotonicity under count due to their similar monotonicities in both arguments. The study concludes that it is the counting process itself that collective quantification involves, rather than the existential requirement within the determiner fitting operator, which is responsible for the exceptional monotonicity properties of collective determiners.

Overall, the research paper makes important contributions to the formal investigation of monotonicity and collectivity phenomena in natural language semantics, shedding light on the intricate relationships between determiners, quantification, and collectivity.
