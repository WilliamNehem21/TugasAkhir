The paper demonstrates that top-down non-deterministic finite tree automata (NFTA) and bottom-up NFTA have equivalent expressive power. Specifically, the languages accepted by top-down NFTAs are exactly the same as those accepted by bottom-up NFTAs. This paper focuses exclusively on the set of top-down NFTAs.
