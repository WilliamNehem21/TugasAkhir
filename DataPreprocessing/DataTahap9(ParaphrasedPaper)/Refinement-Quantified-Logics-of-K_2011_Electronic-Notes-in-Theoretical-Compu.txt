Balbiani and colleagues subsequently investigated arbitrary public announcement logic, a variant of public announcement logic that includes an operator for quantifying over arbitrary public announcements. Van Ditmarsch and French later demonstrated that arbitrary public announcement logic was undecidable within the multi-agent context, suggesting that related logics for action models might also be undecidable.
