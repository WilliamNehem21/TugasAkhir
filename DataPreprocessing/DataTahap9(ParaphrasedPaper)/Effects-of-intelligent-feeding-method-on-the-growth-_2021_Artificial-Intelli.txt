Novel intelligent feeding methods have been developed to determine the feeding endpoint in aquaculture by characterizing the variations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and water temperature during feeding. While such methods have shown improved performance compared to traditional feeding, they are not widely applicable to increasingly industrialized aquaculture systems, such as recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), due to the stable maintenance of DO and temperature in these environments.

In contrast to these methods, recent research has focused on quantifying fish appetite in real production by utilizing fish feeding behavior characteristics. With the advancement of artificial intelligence and technology, feeding based on fish feeding behavior has become a trending area of research in aquaculture. Feedback control systems have been developed to achieve this goal.

While intelligent feeding methods have shown potential to improve production and reduce costs, their impact on fish welfare remains largely unknown. Therefore, an adaptive feeder based on a practical and typical intelligent feeding method was designed to comprehensively evaluate the effects of the intelligent feeding method on fish growth, as well as biochemical and immune indexes, throughout a 47-day production experiment.

The adaptive feeder implemented a feeding quantity adjustment mechanism based on fish appetite assessment. Comparison with a traditional feeding method showed that the intelligent feeding method resulted in improved fish growth parameters, especially in reducing the feed conversion ratio (FCR), thereby indicating cost-effectiveness and improved feed efficiency.

The experiment also assessed the impact of the feeding methods on fish welfare by measuring cortisol levels, lysozyme levels, and antioxidant capacity. The intelligent feeding method led to higher cortisol levels and lower lysozyme levels, indicating potential negative effects on fish health and welfare. Additionally, the antioxidant capacity showed differences between the two feeding groups.

The study concluded that while intelligent feeding can improve fish growth and reduce feed costs, it may also lead to stress and suppress innate immunity. Future research should focus on developing targeted and adaptive feeding strategies that consider specific fish breeds and environmental factors to ensure improved breeding efficiency and fish welfare.
