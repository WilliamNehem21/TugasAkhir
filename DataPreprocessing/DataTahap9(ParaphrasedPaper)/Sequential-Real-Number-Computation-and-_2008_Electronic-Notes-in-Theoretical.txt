The concept is to enable the reduction of a let term when a partial value is known with a precision of p. This reduction strategy is referred to as call-by-partial-value. The denotational semantics associated with it incorporates concepts commonly used by domain theorists, such as measurement as articulated by Martin and a monadic approach to the differentiation between value and computation as proposed by Moggi. Additionally, in consideration of relations on product types, the language is expanded to include explicit products of ground types.
