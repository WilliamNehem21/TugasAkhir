The paper discusses the relevance of the constructive approach of Coglio and Green in the context of generating Java source code from specifications. The authors demonstrate that generating code from specifications can be a valuable alternative to the traditional method of verifying legacy code. The paper also presents an extension of the synchronous product of automata, which includes the structure of the composite, allowing for a better understanding of complex systems.

The authors also discuss the use of abstraction techniques, such as those found in existing literature, while highlighting the need for manual transformation steps in the current context. They present a design case study using LOTOS and the CADP toolbox for describing processes, with the objective of eventually providing a Java compiler capable of translating state machines and architectures into Java code.

In the context of data modeling, the paper discusses the use of received data types and actions in the specification process, and presents an experimental generator designed to produce full imperative Java code from data type descriptions. The authors note certain technical restrictions and future tasks, such as defining and implementing abstraction techniques and elaborating a concrete syntax for hierarchical components.

Finally, the paper outlines future perspectives, including the need to prove the correctness of the translation process into Java code and the correctness of the rendezvous mechanism.
