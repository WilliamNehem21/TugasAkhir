A botnet is a coordinated network of infected computers, known as zombies, that carry out malicious actions under the remote control of a human operator, referred to as the botnetmaster. As the internet has continued to develop, it has become a platform for an array of compromised and distributed computers, bringing with it certain risks, with botnets emerging as a prominent concern in the realm of internet security.

The rise of botnets is linked to the growing efforts of malevolent users to capitalize on cybercrime activities. To this end, a distributed architecture of remotely controlled networks of infected hosts, called botnets, has been designed and implemented for malicious operations. With a single command from a command and control (C&C) server, botnetmasters can manage networks of susceptible hosts. These botnetmasters usually carry out maintenance and updates of their C&C setup on fast-flux service networks (FFSN) to make the detection of bots more challenging.

Botnet detection is a classic machine learning task that requires researchers to either learn new features or adopt existing reliable subsets based on the existing literature. Although several botnet detection systems (BDS) have been developed, the identification, adoption, and consolidation of reliable features for detection continues to pose challenges. This is primarily due to the lack of accuracy in existing features and the evasion mechanisms adopted by botnetmasters to disguise the operations of legitimate internet devices.

Honeynets, which are comprised of simulated servers known as honeypots, serve as deliberate vulnerabilities intended to provoke attackers to target the system. The main aim is to collect bot signatures and the mechanisms of the C&C server. Honeynet-based detection generates reports on detected bot signatures to gain insights into the penetration methods of the botnet. However, these approaches do not always detect the damages caused by the botnet. Honeypots can be further categorized as low-interaction and high-interaction based on their simulation capability.

Researchers have also proposed several methods for botnet detection, such as using normal traffic for training, employing a DNS rule-based approach, and utilizing mining-based detection, each with its own advantages and limitations.

Furthermore, the paper explores the use of the k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) classifier as a traditional nonparametric technique in pattern recognition for data categorization, as well as the design and testing of a bot-ffx model for botnet attack classification.

Overall, this study introduces various methods and models for botnet detection and highlights the significance of addressing the evolving challenges associated with botnet activities in the context of internet security.
