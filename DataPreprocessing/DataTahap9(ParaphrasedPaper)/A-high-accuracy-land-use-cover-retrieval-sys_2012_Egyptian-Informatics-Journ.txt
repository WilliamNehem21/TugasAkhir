At a more detailed level, the residential area primarily consists of individual houses, roads, and vegetation. Advances in remote sensing technology now enable the capture of very detailed images of the Earth's surface, ranging from local to regional scales. Satellites are now capable of achieving spatial resolutions as fine as 0.5 to 25,000 meters, while airborne data acquisition technology has also seen rapid development in recent years. As a greater number of high-resolution datasets become available, there is an increasing demand for more efficient methods to store, process, and analyze this wealth of data. To tackle this, it is important to develop effective analytical techniques for utilizing multiscale data to enhance land analysis.

A certain transformation has been identified that allows each feature vector to be expressed in terms of the centroid and variance of all image groups. The radial basis function (RBF) is a nonlinear transformation that provides a series of functions, serving as a basis for input feature vectors. This transformation can be adjusted so that each component represents the membership function of a subimage to a group.

The system correlation matrix is designed to store updates and correlate subimage groups, enabling the system to progressively learn from each new session and become less reliant on initial settings. Through a process of cluster splitting and merging, the feature space is eventually divided into semantically related clusters. For non-neighboring clusters containing semantically related subimages, the correlation weights between these clusters are assigned high values. Consequently, the correlation matrix plays a crucial role in this.

The multi-resolution framework proposed in this paper acknowledges the importance of incorporating the spatial structure of images into the classification process to minimize errors, enhance efficiency, and extract information more effectively. The selection of training schemes and classification decision rules should be guided by the specification of the scene model (high and low resolution) and the level of spatial variance represented by the image being classified. A super resolution approach has been employed to generate a high-resolution image dataset. Various spatial analysis methods can provide the aforementioned information to account for resolution effects on individual classes being examined. Different strategies can be employed to integrate information from multiple resolutions.
