The accessibility of affordable head-mounted displays and the proliferation of virtual reality applications and games have led to a substantial rise in the utilization of this technology among the general population. As a result, there is growing interest in investigating the potential risks and aftereffects associated with its use. While manufacturers of head-mounted displays offer general usage guidelines, there is a lack of recent evidence comparing early virtual environment studies with experiences from modern head-mounted displays. The primary aim of this study was to examine response activation and inhibition following exposure to a typical virtual environment in a head-mounted display, using reaction time as a metric. However, the study found evidence of participant fatigue during the reaction time tests, which raises concerns about the reliability of reaction time measurements. This study affirms the safe use of virtual reality experiences in modern head-mounted displays for brief exposures, while also highlighting the need for further investigation into the issues with reaction time testing.

Traditionally, research on cybersickness has relied on measures such as questionnaires, postural instability, and more recently biometric and physiological states. This study sought to explore the real-world use of virtual reality head-mounted displays using off-the-shelf hardware and software, representative of common scenarios such as trade shows, gaming conventions, shop demonstrations, or casual home use. The study focused on short-term use of head-mounted displays and aimed to assess any impact on response inhibition or delayed response activation in this context by pairing a real-world virtual reality experience with a robust reaction time test.

The sessions, conducted individually and lasting approximately 90 minutes each, involved obtaining consent from participants, providing a tutorial on using the Xbox gamepad, and performing a cued go/no-go task. After playing Minecraft in virtual reality, participants completed a post-experience reaction time test and a demographic survey, along with a questionnaire to assess their susceptibility to motion sickness. The study also examined failure of response inhibition and identified the need to consider the impact of cognitive fatigue, as well as potential biases due to self-exclusion.

The findings indicated no significant differences in response activation or inhibition in participants after brief exposure to the virtual reality environment. The study acknowledged that certain participants experienced discomfort and chose to discontinue the virtual reality task, highlighting the importance of considering potential negative impacts of head-mounted display usage. Additionally, the study suggested the need for future research to explore the impact of cognitive fatigue and other contributing factors on reaction time data.
