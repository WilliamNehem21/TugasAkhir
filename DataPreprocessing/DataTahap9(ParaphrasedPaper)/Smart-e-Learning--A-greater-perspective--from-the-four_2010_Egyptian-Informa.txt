The academic paper discusses the evolution of distance learning through four generations and highlights the need for customizing course delivery to suit individual student profiles in order to enhance effective teaching. The focus of the research is on improving the quality of web-based e-learning by adapting course authoring and delivery to match each student's skills and preferences. The article provides an overview of the vision and status of an eight-year smart e-learning environment project that aims to advance e-learning through the use of AI techniques. The authors emphasize the importance of tailoring course materials and teaching methods to meet the diverse needs and preferences of individual students. The paper also discusses the challenges facing educators in shaping presentations to meet the diverse needs of learners, and presents an experimental strategy for verifying and assessing the effectiveness of the proposed model. Additionally, it outlines the components developed under various research projects to support the global vision of the smart e-learning paradigm, including the smart tutor, smart e-notebook, and smart office-hours assistant. The paper concludes by highlighting some future research directions and presents the results of an experiment conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed model.
