Plants are frequently exposed to environmental stressors that can significantly impact their growth and productivity. These stresses can be characterized as biotic (caused by pathogens and pests) or abiotic (caused by factors such as heat, drought, cold, and salinity).

Assessing and categorizing biotic stresses in plants and determining their severity is a challenging endeavor due to multiple factors, including the lack of precise delimitation of lesion areas, variations in lesion characteristics, the presence of multiple lesions on the same leaf, and similar symptoms arising from different stresses. Recently, deep learning techniques have shown promise in addressing these challenges by facilitating the classification of plant diseases. However, traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches have limitations, such as the requirement for extensive datasets for effective generalization. Consequently, new methods, including meta-learning and few-shot learning techniques, have been proposed to develop models that can generalize well with limited data.

Several studies in the literature have utilized deep neural networks for plant disease recognition, achieving high accuracy rates across different crops. This paper explores the application of few-shot learning and feature extraction for the recognition and severity estimation of plant stresses, specifically using a dataset of biotic stresses in coffee leaves. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents fundamental concepts of deep learning and few-shot learning, including the triplet network and prototypical network methods used in this work. Section 3 outlines the experimental setup and results, and finally, Section 4 presents the conclusions drawn from the study.

In the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), feature maps from the convolution layer are spatially reduced through a pooling operation, which summarizes regions from activation maps, effectively reducing their size while retaining essential features. The pooling operation can be performed using maximum pooling or average pooling, summarizing values by their highest or average value, respectively.

The fully connected layer, constituting a typical feedforward network or multilayer perceptron, acts as the classifier in CNNs, utilizing features extracted from previous layers as input. Alternatively, a CNN architecture can be used without a fully connected layer, producing a flattened vector or embedding as output. This type of architecture is commonly used in few-shot learning applications.

To address the challenges posed by limited data in traditional machine and deep learning approaches, the paper focuses on distance metric learning-based methods known as embedding learning. In particular, the triplet network and prototypical network methods are used in the study. The triplet network uses three images as input (anchor, positive, and negative) to produce representations such that the anchor is similar to the positive and dissimilar to the negative, while the prototypical network computes a prototype for each class and compares embedded query samples to these prototypes using a distance function.

The experimental results obtained from applying the few-shot learning methods, including the triplet network and prototypical network, in the classification and severity estimation of plant stresses are presented and discussed. The study includes an evaluation of various backbones (feature extractors) to compare their performance. Additionally, the experimental setup, including the datasets used, metrics computed, and tools employed, is detailed. Finally, the obtained results are compared with prior studies, demonstrating competitive or superior performance in the biotic stress classification and severity estimation tasks.
