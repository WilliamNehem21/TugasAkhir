The development of integrated circuit (IC) fabrication technology has led to significant improvements, allowing for the production of ICs at a 7nm scale. This advancement has enabled ICs to accommodate more transistors, thereby facilitating the implementation of system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs. SoC typically comprises numerous digital circuits with specific functionalities, and these circuits communicate both internally and externally. Routing these interlaced and complex signals within the increasingly compact channels poses a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a complexity effect routing algorithm based on the Lee algorithm, aimed at facilitating rapid verification for SoC designs. The algorithm offers several advantages, including the ability to swiftly evaluate various routing architectures, trace paths from origin to destination, and simulate diverse complexities inherent in different SoC architectures. Our experimental results demonstrate the successful application of the algorithm to five complexity sets of routing benchmarks.

The progression of fabrication technology has brought about the integration of system-on-a-chip (SoC), consolidating processors and essential components within a single unit. With the latest advancements in semiconductor technology, the length of transistors within SoC has been tailored to enhance capacity, performance, and reliability. Simultaneously, the integration of an increasing number of circuit modules into SoC has made the process of routing through these modules considerably more challenging.

Advanced nano-process integrated circuit technology has yielded significantly smaller transistors, leading to lighter and faster products. These minimized transistors have expanded the capacity to accommodate an increasing number of digital circuits, while simultaneously reducing the available routing paths. Furthermore, despite the fact that the chip area remains the same or even smaller than previous products, the denser circuit placement has resulted in a drastic reduction in the available communication paths. Thus, the modernization of chip design, driven by nano-process technology, has significantly exacerbated the routing problem.

Once the modules are placed within the SoC, the routing process is conducted by the Computer-Aided Engineering Routing Algorithm (CERA) from the origin to the destination. The outcome of this process may be a successfully completed route or a disconnected path. The former provides valuable insights for designers to further consider delays and driver issues, while the latter informs designers that adjustments to the module placement may be necessary.
