To the best of our knowledge, recent research has revealed certain characteristics of the ieee 802.11 standard [18,12]. However, this research has several limitations. Firstly, the verification of the standard has been informally and non-mechanically approached, despite its formal specification. Secondly, the lack of time modeling in this verification means that it only considers safety and liveness properties, without accounting for timeliness as required by quality of service (QoS) and real-time applications. Thirdly, given the complexity of the coordination functions in the protocol standard, verifying them in isolation does not account for potential interference and temporal behavior issues that may arise from their integrated use.

The ieee 802.11 standard defines two coordination approaches, known as the Point Coordination Function (PCF) and the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) [5]. PCF involves an arbiter station that coordinates medium access to prevent access conflicts among stations, whereas DCF uses a distributed approach and offers best-effort message delivery. As the protocol can alternate between PCF and DCF during operation, analyzing their integrated behavior is crucial; however, previous verification work has only examined these functions in isolation.

In addition, a version of the standard, ieee 802.11e, introduces mechanisms for managing message priorities and includes coordination functions, HCF and EDCF. These functions have similar meanings to PCF and DCF but operate with traffic categories.

Subsequent sections of this paper comprise an overview of the ieee 802.11 MAC layer, an introduction to UPPAAL, the presentation of specification and verification, and, finally, concluding remarks with potential areas for future research.

The ieee 802.11 standard's MAC layer defines two medium access control schemes: the Point Coordination Function (PCF) and the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). When PCF is used, the network operates in the contention-free period (CFP), while DCF operates in the contention period, allowing stations to contend for medium access. PCF is optional, and if supported, both coordination functions occur alternately in time.

DCF, as the primary coordination function, employs a carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) access method. This method requires stations to sense the medium before sending frames, implementing a mechanism to avoid collisions. The medium activity is verified using a variable called the Network Allocation Vector (NAV) and various interframe spaces (IFS) to prioritize medium access. PCF, which is built on top of DCF, functions based on arbitration, with the coordination achieved by a designated bus arbiter known as the Point Coordinator (PC).

To verify the properties of the ieee 802.11 MAC protocol, several automata networks were employed, encompassing the validation of DCF and PCF in isolation, as well as scenarios with workstations operating in either mode. The results were obtained for a specific scenario with three workstations operating in DCF mode, two in PCF mode, and a Point Coordinator workstation. The verification was performed using UPPAAL, and the longest verifying time was approximately two hours, verifying Property 1. Some properties verified in scenarios with more components caused state explosion.

The publication acknowledges the need to address mobility in future work involving the ieee 802.11 standard, particularly in the context of mobile systems where station movements may lead to temporary failures affecting network performance. This important aspect, along with other potential research directions, should be considered in future investigations.
