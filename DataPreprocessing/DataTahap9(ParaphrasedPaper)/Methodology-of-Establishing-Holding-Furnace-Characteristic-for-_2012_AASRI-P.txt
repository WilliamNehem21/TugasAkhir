This academic paper discusses the influence of various parameters on the properties of castings generated through the pressure die-casting process, as well as the function of holding furnaces in this technology. The paper highlights the four categories of holding furnaces based on their power source and introduces a proposed method for assessing the behavior pattern of liquid alloy in the melting holding furnace, monitoring variations in chemical composition, and analyzing the elements that impact the quality of final casting properties, such as silicon, manganese, aluminum, and ferrite.

The proposed method is designed to identify variations in the elements, such as declining values of monitoring elements which can reduce strength and cause leakage, and the potential concentration of elements like ferrite at the bottom of the furnace. The paper also emphasizes the need for the visual control of samples and the exclusion of contaminated samples, as well as the calculation of the weight loss percentage for silicon, manganese, aluminum, and ferrite.

Overall, the study describes the proposed method for monitoring and analyzing the behavior of liquid alloy in the melting holding furnace and its potential impact on the final properties of castings produced in the pressure die-casting process.
