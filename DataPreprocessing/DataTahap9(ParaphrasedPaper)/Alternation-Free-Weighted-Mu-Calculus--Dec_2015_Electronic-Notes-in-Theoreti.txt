This paper presents the introduction of WMC, a weighted version of the alternation-free modal mu-calculus for weighted transition systems. WMC encompasses previously studied weighted extensions of CTL and bears similarities to previously proposed time-extended versions of the modal mu-calculus. The paper also develops a symbolic semantics for WMC and demonstrates that the concept of satisfiability aligns with that of symbolic satisfiability. This crucial finding enables the proof of two major meta-properties of WMC.

The first major contribution is establishing the decidability of satisfiability for WMC. Unlike the classical modal mu-calculus, WMC does not possess the finite model property. However, the finite model property holds for the symbolic semantics, leading to readily established decidability. This is in contrast to logics for timed transition systems, for which satisfiability has been shown to be undecidable.

The second primary contribution of the paper is the provision of a complete axiomatization that applies to both semantics. The completeness proof is non-standard due to the non-compact nature of the logic and involves the notion of symbolic models.

The paper then introduces a complete axiomatization for WMC, enabling the derivation of all valid properties as theorems. This is noted to be the first complete axiomatization for a fixed-point weighted modal logic in the literature. The axiomatization is characterized by its simplicity, combining modal axioms of non-recursive weighted logic with classic axioms of fixed points. The finite model property serves as evidence that the axiomatization is complete for the symbolic semantics, and the completeness result is extended to the WTS-semantics.

The subsequent section focuses on the development of a sound and complete axiomatization for the validities of WMC with respect to the two semantics. Noting that the two sets of validities coincide, it is shown, in light of Theorem 5.1, that finding such an axiomatization for the SWS-semantics is sufficient. This axiomatization is then demonstrated to also be sound and complete for the WTS-semantics.

The paper outlines several axioms stating simple arithmetic facts, as well as an axiom regarding the positive cost of an action transition. Furthermore, it introduces an axiom guaranteeing that all resource variables measure the same resource, and depicts the nature of the reset operation through additional axioms and a rule.
