The symmetric circulant traveling salesman problem entails finding the lowest cost of a Hamiltonian cycle in a weighted undirected graph with circulant structure. The computational complexity of this problem is currently unknown, with only an upper bound and a strong lower bound established.

When the graph is restricted to a circulant structure, Codenotti, Gerace, and Vigna demonstrated that both the maximum clique and minimum graph coloring problems remain NP-hard and cannot be approximated within a constant factor. Muzychuk, on the other hand, proved that graph isomorphism in circulant undirected graphs is in P, indicating that the problem may be less challenging in this restricted context.

In the undirected case, Burkard and Sandholzer showed that the Hamiltonian circuit and bottleneck TSP are solvable in polynomial time on circulant weighted undirected graphs. Unfortunately, a similar result is not known for TSP.

Lower bounds for SCTSP and certain sufficient conditions for reaching these bounds have been independently proposed. This includes the presentation of a lower bound (Theorem 4.5) and two sufficient conditions in the case of two stripes (Proposition 4.6).

Several specific instances of the problem have been resolved, including the not connected case (Proposition 4.1), the case where c1 = c2 (Proposition 4.4), the case where gcd(n, a1) = 1 (Theorem 4.3), and the case where gcd(n, a1) = 2 (Theorem 4.6).

Considering the weighted undirected graph G = G(45; 20, 9; 1, 2), it is evident that G1 = 5, AG = {7}, and therefore, m = 2. According to Theorem 5.3, a Hamiltonian cycle of cost 54 does exist, but this cycle is not minimal, as UB(G) = 53, as proven by Theorem 4.3.

Although a definitive solution for SCTSP has not been attained, it is speculated that SCTSP may be solvable in polynomial time, particularly in cases where the costs of any two stripes are distinct. Understanding how a Hamiltonian cycle, or a more general Hamiltonian path, for a circulant W.U. graph with s stripes can be transferred to circulant W.U. graphs with more stripes may bring us closer to solving SCTSP.
