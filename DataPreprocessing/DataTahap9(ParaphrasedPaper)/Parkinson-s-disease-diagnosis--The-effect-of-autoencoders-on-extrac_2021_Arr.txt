This academic paper discusses Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative condition that affects millions of people worldwide, particularly the elderly. The early diagnosis of PD is crucial as there is currently no cure for the disease, and existing treatments mainly focus on slowing down its progression. Neuroimaging techniques such as MRI, as well as machine learning (ML) approaches, have garnered interest from researchers in aiding the early diagnosis of PD.

The paper explores the use of ML techniques, including support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), and artificial neural networks, for the accurate prediction and diagnosis of PD using neuroimaging and vocal characteristics. It also investigates the application of an autoencoder to extract useful features and improve the performance of classifiers. The study presents the use of logistic regression for stacking the outputs of different classifiers to enhance the accuracy of PD patient classification.

Furthermore, the paper examines the use of machine learning techniques for the classification of PD based on vocal characteristics, which have been the subject of numerous research studies. It discusses previous works focused on PD classification using vocal data and highlights the significance of vocal impairments in determining the occurrence of PD.

The effectiveness of machine learning techniques, such as SVM and XGBoost, in classifying PD based on various data sets is discussed. The study also identifies the challenges associated with using deep learning methods for PD classification and emphasizes the significance of features extracted from vocal data in predicting the disease.

The paper provides insights into the application of machine learning techniques, including ensemble learning, in improving the accuracy of PD classification. Additionally, it highlights the utility of autoencoders for feature extraction and emphasizes the potential of classic classifiers for achieving comparable or better results than deep neural networks in PD classification.

Overall, the paper presents findings that advocate the application of machine learning techniques, particularly classic classifiers, and ensemble learning, for the accurate diagnosis of PD using various data sources including neuroimaging and vocal characteristics. It also underscores the potential of autoencoders in extracting useful features, especially in cases with an imbalanced data set and a high number of features compared to the number of samples.
