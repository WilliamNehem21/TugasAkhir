Process calculi, originally developed for modeling distributed and mobile systems, have become widely used for formally specifying biological systems. In this new context, significant efforts have been made to adapt traditional models to capture the molecular and biochemical features of biological systems. On one hand, approaches such as bioambients, beta-binders, and brane calculi have aimed to represent hierarchical structures, compartments, and membranes, which are crucial for organizing biomolecular systems. On the other hand, there is growing interest in the development of practical tools for analyzing and simulating these systems, addressing their unique characteristics and complexities.

However, applying automatic tools to biological systems has revealed challenges, particularly due to the large number of processes with similar behavior, such as thousands of molecules of the same type. This leads to very large state spaces in the transition system, requiring the analysis of various scenarios to extract meaningful biological insights. To overcome these limitations, approximation techniques have been established to preserve the validation of temporal properties, particularly through static analysis techniques for computing safe approximations of system behavior.

In the pursuit of addressing these challenges, we have introduced an LTS semantics that supports a natural abstraction, approximating the multiplicities of reagents with intervals of integers. This abstraction allows for the definition of an abstract LTS semantics, where multiplicities are replaced by intervals in both states and transitions, recording information about the labels of actions, their rates, and their potential number of occurrences.

To derive a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) from the LTS, we calculate the probability of transitioning from one multiset to another, based on the rate of the corresponding continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). This involves extracting the rate from the transition labels and calculating the related probability accordingly.

Our framework, based on abstract interpretation, presents the advantage of enabling the design of new analyses by introducing different abstract LTS semantics. For example, future developments could replace the domain of intervals with more precise numerical domains capable of modeling relational information, or explore parametric versions of the framework to study the trade-offs between precision and complexity. Additionally, we aim to extend the proposed methodology for the Chemical Ground Form (CGF) to the full calculus with communication.
