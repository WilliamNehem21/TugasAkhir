This academic paper demonstrates a method for encrypting images using dual encryptions with logistic and Lorenz chaotic systems to alter the locations and sizes of pixel values. These dual encryptions conceal the encrypted information within the carriers, making it less noticeable and thereby enhancing the security of transferred information. The decryption process reverses the encryption, extracting the information and subjecting it to anti-scrambling using secret keys to restore the original images. The peak signal-to-noise ratio between the restored and original images is 21.78. Experimental results confirm that this approach maintains the desirable randomness of chaotic order and significantly complicates deciphering, thus improving the security of the encrypted images.

The encryption of images differs from the encryption of textual data due to the large volume of data, high redundancy, and interrelationships of pixel values. Chaos, as governed by nonlinear dynamic systems, exhibits regularity, ergodicity, intrinsic stochastic properties, and unpredictability, making it popular for image encryption. Encryption conceals and protects information before transmission to enhance security. Recipients can utilize an encryption key to restore encrypted information. Information hiding technology exploits human insensitivity and the redundancy in multimedia digital signals to securely transfer confidential information.

Despite slight color differences, no mosaic effects are observed, and the visual effect is significantly enhanced. Because the size of segments is identical in the encrypted and carrier images, the computational complexity is much simpler compared to previous methods during the implementation process. Additionally, simulation time is reduced, with the former approach taking 15.307 seconds and the latter only 4.1099 seconds.

A quantitative pixel-based arithmetic effect measurement enables fair comparisons between different arithmetic methods. Various distortion or quality measures for visual information fall under distortion measures. Current measure indices for picture visual coding compression use the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) as units. The SNR of the image reflects changes before and after the picture data are processed, representing the statistical average of the picture data changes. Higher SNR values indicate better visual effects. The definition of PSNR is as follows:

For the carrier image, the SNR is 56.36 before and after hiding the picture information, indicating a good effect. The SNR of the original and restored images is 21.78, with differences mainly noticeable in areas with obvious color changes and complex textures.
