The polarity of first P-wave arrivals is crucial for accurately determining focal mechanisms, particularly for smaller earthquakes. Manual estimation of polarities is both time-consuming and susceptible to human errors, emphasizing the need for an automated algorithm to determine first motion polarity. This paper introduces "PolarCap," a deep learning model that employs an autoencoder architecture to identify first-motion polarities of earthquake waveforms. The model is trained using a supervised approach with over 130,000 labeled traces from the Italian seismic dataset and cross-validated on 22,000 traces to select the most optimal set of hyperparameters. The model achieves an accuracy of 0.98 on a previously unseen test dataset consisting of almost 33,000 traces. Additionally, the model is tested on datasets from previous works, demonstrating higher recall on both positive and negative polarities.

Traditionally, the first-motion polarity of earthquake waveforms has been manually assigned, but studies have shown that manual polarities are inconsistent with true polarities about 10% to 20% of the time. With the increasing volume of seismological data, there is a growing need for a faster, more precise, and efficient method for determining polarities.

The use of autoencoder models for determining first-motion polarities, as opposed to using simple convolutional neural networks, is explored in this study. Unlike previous studies that used autoencoders for unsupervised polarity classification, this study leverages supervised learning and utilizes polarity information provided in the metadata of the instance dataset. The focus is on the classification of polarities rather than the picking of P-arrival times.

To address issues related to the incorrect determination of polarity, the study includes the use of data augmentation to add a time shift to some of the traces in the training data. It is observed that the model, "PolarCap," is capable of predicting polarities with a high degree of accuracy, surpassing human analysts in over 98% of cases. The main reasons for incorrect polarity assignment by the model were identified as incorrect P-arrival picks and emergent arrivals, while the model's predictions were more often correct when compared with the metadata. Despite challenges, the study demonstrates the model's capability to overcome human errors.
