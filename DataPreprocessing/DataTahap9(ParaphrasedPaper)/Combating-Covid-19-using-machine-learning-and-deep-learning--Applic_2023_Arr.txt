The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant loss of life over the past two years and has prompted extensive research into the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in various aspects of medical science. This study aims to evaluate the performance of different machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and combinations of AI approaches used in recent studies to address challenges associated with the pandemic. The comparison between stand-alone ML and DL-based research and the combination of ML, DL, and AI-based research is presented. The study also identifies potential future research directions in this area, providing guidance for the development of practical applications and strategies to tackle COVID-19.

Due to its ability to monitor the spread of the virus, assess its severity, and measure its rate of progression, AI has emerged as a valuable technology in managing the pandemic. The review assessed a variety of studies related to the use of AI and ML mechanisms in the context of COVID-19. It also identified research opportunities and challenges for future investigations in this field.

Initial searches identified a total of 600 studies, from which 104 studies were included in the final analysis. The methodology, data types, sample sizes, techniques, and best-performing models used in these studies were evaluated. Furthermore, the study reviewed and summarized the application of various AI and ML models for COVID-19 management, while also identifying potential research opportunities.

The study also addressed the significance of using AI to remotely diagnose COVID-19, particularly in light of the limitations of traditional methods such as RT-PCR testing. It highlighted the importance of developing end-to-end solutions that mitigate the risks associated with physical hospital visits, emphasizing the need for standard and reliable diagnostic tools.

Various challenges and limitations associated with using ML, DL, and AI-based techniques for COVID-19 research were outlined, including the selection of effective models and the scarcity of standard datasets. The study also emphasized the importance of evaluating research studies using standard metrics and criteria to ensure their trustworthiness.

In conclusion, the study provided a comprehensive analysis of the current state of AI, ML, and DL research in the context of COVID-19. It identified several areas for future research and emphasized the need to address existing challenges, ultimately aiming to contribute to the development of effective solutions for managing the pandemic.
