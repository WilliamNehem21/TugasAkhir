This academic paper introduces a category of one-step semantics to bring together different approaches to coalgebraic logic parametric in a contravariant functor that maps the state space to its set of predicates with propositional connectives. It identifies modular constructions of coalgebraic logic as colimits, limits, and tensor products, expanding on existing results for predicate liftings. It also introduces generalized predicate liftings as modalities. Under common assumptions, the paper shows that the logic of all predicate liftings, along with a complete axiomatization, exists for any type of coalgebras, and that it is one-step expressive for finitary functors. Furthermore, it demonstrates that colimits and compositions of one-step expressive coalgebraic logics remain one-step expressive.

In categories such as set and the category veck of vector spaces over a field k, it is noted that every finitely generated algebra is free, indicating that finitary functors are finitely based. Additionally, it states that every finitary endofunctor of ba is naturally isomorphic to a finitely based functor on non-trivial boolean algebras. However, it is mentioned that this coincidence does not hold in general, and a counterexample is provided in [29, example 3.12].

The paper further justifies the point-free formulation in [6, section 4.1.5], based on the assumption of the existence of a proper factorization system. Following this, it assumes that x is concrete, although this does not necessarily imply the existence of kernel pairs.
