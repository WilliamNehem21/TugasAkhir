In the past two decades, progress in the agricultural sector has been achieved by leveraging data analytics tools and decision support systems (DSS), which have had a discernible impact on irrigation management, precision agriculture, and optimal farming. While these systems offer structured analysis and information to farmers in a systematic manner, their sophisticated nature presents a challenge for farmers with low literacy, particularly in developing countries. Several systems, including informal forums, social networks, and interactive voice response systems, facilitate peer and expert interaction to exchange suggestions and opinions on farmers' concerns.

Recently, there has been a significant growth in data analytics enabled by big data technologies and digital sensors, offering benefits for decision support in agriculture. Nonetheless, data analytics encounters challenges in handling extensive and diverse data sets, such as semi-structured, unstructured, and streaming data. As a result, there is a need to effectively utilize datasets to facilitate efficient and effective user decision-making.

One solution involves the real-time monitoring and collection of sensor data in a seaport infrastructure using a web-based GIS application built on open-source big data architecture. This system is deployed at the Puerto de la Luz seaport and applied to data from two system sensors.

The Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) is an extension of the DSS application that supports improved decision-making through spatial data. SDSS has a positive impact on decision-making in agriculture, benefiting from greater public availability of spatial data and more flexible software for integration into geographic information systems. An open-source SDSS project known as MicroLEIS DSS supports agricultural soil protection and land sustainability, incorporating valuable tools and techniques for decision-making in various agro-ecological schemes, such as statistics, databases, neural networks, expert systems, web technology, and GIS applications.

The SDSS for agricultural land management aids in decision-making for food crop land management by testing, validating, and conducting sensitivity checks on decision models. It is developed with compromise programming modules to produce spatial information integrated with fuzzy set and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and utilizes field expert input information during operation.

The proposed architecture consists of three tiers: the Application Layer, the Data Integration and Storage Layer, and the Information and Analysis Services Layer. The Application Layer provides presentation services to end users through a graphical user interface, while the Data Integration and Storage Layer is responsible for storing, maintaining, and retrieving application data in a database and file server. The Information and Analysis Services Layer contains backend software components that provide authentication, persistency, and information services.

Authentication services operate on the user data info dataset and authenticate users based on their credentials and access privileges, while the supervisor has overall system control and the ability to create, edit, and delete agro-experts. Upon registration, the system sends an automated email to the agro-expert.

Overall, advancements in agricultural decision support systems have brought significant improvements through the application of data analytics and big data technologies, although challenges remain in effectively utilizing datasets and making these systems accessible to users, particularly in developing countries.
