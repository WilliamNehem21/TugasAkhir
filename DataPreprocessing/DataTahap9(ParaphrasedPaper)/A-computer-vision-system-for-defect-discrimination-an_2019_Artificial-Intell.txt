The predominant method for sorting and grading tomatoes is manual sorting, which, as noted by Karlsson (2016), has several drawbacks including low precision, labor intensiveness, and subjectivity. Gould (1975) introduced a mechanical tomato sorting machine to address these deficiencies, but it was limited to size and weight classification. The emergence and advancements in machine vision technology now enable a more accurate and non-destructive approach to overcoming these limitations.

Color features, also known as statistical features or 1st order spatial statistics measure, were utilized in this study, with the lab color space chosen due to its limited variance caused by sensor sensitivity. Additionally, texture features, known as 2nd order measures, were employed to capture the spatial dependence of gray values using Haralick textural features computed from gray-level cooccurrence matrices (GLCM).

Fifteen features were extracted from each image, and four models were developed based on the quality grading, employing linear-SVM, quadratic-SVM, cubic-SVM, radial basis function (RBF-SVM), ANN, decision tree, and random forest recognition models. The developed ANN models consisted of three layers: input layer, hidden layer (with ten neurons using a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function), and output layer (employing a linear transfer function). These models underwent evaluation using a 10-fold cross-validation-based parameter search on the training dataset and further assessment on a testing dataset.

The study also proposed a threshold method for discriminating unripe, ripe, and spoiled tomatoes, drawing attention to the high costs associated with advanced imaging systems despite their high accuracy. The system demonstrated high accuracy in grading date fruits, even with sensitive ambient light conditions, suggesting its potential for detecting defects in cherry and heirloom tomatoes.

Finally, the classification results achieved a specificity of 0.9613, precision of 0.9742, and sensitivity of 0.9775 on the testing dataset. This study proposes a tomato defect detection system based on image color, texture, and shape features, noting its potential for use with other tomato varieties. Despite its limitations, the proposed machine vision system shows promise and merits further validation and exploration.
