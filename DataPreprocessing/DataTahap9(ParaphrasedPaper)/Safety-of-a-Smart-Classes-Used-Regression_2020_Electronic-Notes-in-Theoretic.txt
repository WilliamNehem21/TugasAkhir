The process of running tests is a critical aspect of code writing. It is essential to execute tests to verify that programs behave as expected and documented. When a program is modified, its tests are rerun to ensure that changes have not introduced new bugs, a process known as regression testing.

In practical scenarios, codebases and their associated test suites can be extensive, making it impractical to rerun every single test after every small change, as it can take hours or even days. Consequently, algorithms and methods have been developed to select which specific tests to rerun after code changes, a process referred to as regression test selection (RTS). An RTS algorithm is considered safe if it only deselects tests whose previous results could be reproduced under the modified program.

Ekstazi is a Java library for regression testing that utilizes an RTS algorithm at the JVM bytecode level based on the classes referenced or used by each test. The algorithm collects the classes touched by a test during its execution, and when changes are made to the code base, a test is only rerun if one or more of the classes it touched have been modified. This approach significantly reduces the number of tests that need to be rerun, particularly in scenarios where only a small number of modifications are made to non-core classes in a large codebase.

The paper presents a formal definition of RTS algorithms in the Isabelle language and introduces a collection-based RTS algorithm. It discusses the safety of using defined class collection functions as the basis for RTS algorithms, and expands on the implications of modifications made to the code base.

Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the importance of selecting tests to rerun in large codebases to reduce retesting time. It also introduces a modified collection algorithm that optimizes the process by not collecting classes that have previously been collected, thereby reducing the overall overhead.

The paper discusses various aspects of formalizing and proving the safety and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, providing insights into the underlying concepts and methodologies involved.

Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of regression testing, RTS algorithms, and their practical implementations in the context of large codebases. It also presents formal definitions and proofs to support the proposed methodologies and algorithms.
