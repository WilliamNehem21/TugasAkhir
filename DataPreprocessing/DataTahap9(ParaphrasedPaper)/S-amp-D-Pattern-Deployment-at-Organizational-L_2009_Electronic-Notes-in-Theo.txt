The current methods for implementing security solutions at the organizational level are primarily theoretical, as discussed in the proposal by Kim et al. Their approach aims to address system threats through the application of security engineering, but lacks specific details on how to integrate security countermeasures into the systems being enhanced.

In this study, we focus on systems encompassing software, hardware, human resources, and policy infrastructure, and propose deployment guidelines tailored to these types of infrastructure. These guidelines outline how security patterns should be implemented, with the goal of promoting best practices for defining security policies and procedures, as well as selecting supporting infrastructure. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present a case study in which security and deployment patterns are implemented in a prototype remote healthcare system.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces a healthcare system used as an ongoing example. Section 3 provides background information on our methodology and illustrates it with examples from our case study. Section 4 details the proposed methodology, using the remote healthcare system as an example. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and suggests directions for future research.

We specifically examine the application of our approach in an emergency scenario within a remote healthcare system. In this context, patient health status and activities are continually monitored by body sensor networks and smart home technology. All alerts and critical situations are sent to a monitoring and response center, where appropriate actions are taken after a thorough analysis.

The paper also discusses the role of organizations as being mediated by technology, with humans using various technical media to conduct business activities. The participation of system users is crucial for the success of these activities.

Our methodology uses the Zachman Framework to identify contextual specifications, enabling the determination of the cell that provides semantic information about the organizational security and deployment pattern implementation context. This context is independent of the infrastructure type.

As part of the methodology, we identify a detailed deployment context. The specific software or hardware implementation infrastructure used influences the accuracy of security and deployment solutions. Guidelines serve as a follow-up for managing the expertise captured in organizational patterns for policy and human resource implementation infrastructures. Deploying organizational security and deployment patterns involves providing system designers with a list of necessary modifications before implementing the patterns.

Another critical step is to translate the general terms of the pattern into those of the system. Analysts must understand the relationship between the pattern and the concrete instance of the system. If there is disagreement or difficulty in defining these relationships, the pattern instantiation process is halted.
