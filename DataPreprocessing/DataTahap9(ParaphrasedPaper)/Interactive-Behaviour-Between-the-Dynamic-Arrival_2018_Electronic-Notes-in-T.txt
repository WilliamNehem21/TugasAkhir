This academic paper discusses the behavior of TCP traffic in practical network systems, particularly in scenarios involving commercial internet connections. It emphasizes that the potential arrival rate of network traffic is likely to exceed the mean service rate of the bottleneck gateway at various times. To ensure efficient utilization of bandwidth resources, the bandwidth of long-distance connections is intentionally set to be smaller than the sum of the bandwidths of all connected edge links. This is because TCP sources adjust their transmission speed in response to congestion, resulting in a lower overall mean traffic arrival rate compared to peak transmission rate.

The paper presents a method for representing TCP traffic and its transmission rate in response to network congestion feedback. TCP utilizes flow control and congestion avoidance mechanisms, adjusting window sizes to achieve high bandwidth utilization while preventing congestion. The relationship between transmission rate, flow control window size, congestion window size, and queue and gateway throughput performance is explored.

The paper also discusses the probabilistic representation of congestion and flow control window sizes, while the transmission rate is determined deterministically based on network specifications. It highlights that the arrival rate during active transmission is associated with the link bandwidth, while departure rate is associated with the link bandwidth between the bottleneck gateway and the destination.

The study emphasizes the need for a time slot associated with a physical time unit in discrete-time queueing models to properly compare theoretical results with practical systems. It also discusses the impact of variations in buffer size, overall arrival rate, and departure rate on queue length, throughput, and dropping rate, and the validation of proposed modifications to conventional queueing methods and dynamic traffic source models through numerical simulations.

Overall, the paper provides insights into the behavior of TCP traffic in network systems and its implications for congestion control and throughput performance.
