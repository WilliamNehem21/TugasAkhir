Because a quantum Turing machine (QTM) undergoes unitary evolution, it cannot be measured until it halts. However, there is a need to observe the machine during its evolution, such as to determine whether the machine has halted. This issue has been resolved by demonstrating that a halt qubit can be added, which can be measured after each transition and changes from 0 to 1 when the machine halts. We propose a formal and more comprehensive framework for describing the partial observation of the machine before and after each transition.

In general, for any QTM m and any partition k of its internal states, the machine[m]k is well-observed. However, the machine's evolution depends on the partition k, leading to variations in the language recognized by the machine and its execution time. Proposition 5.1 asserts that if k consists of a single block, then the evolution of a QTM m and the observed QTM [m]k are the same. Another example, where k is a bipartition, is provided in Lemma 5.2. In this case, for a given QTM m, m and [m]k do not have the same evolution. However, in this specific example, the computational power of m and [m]k is equivalent.
