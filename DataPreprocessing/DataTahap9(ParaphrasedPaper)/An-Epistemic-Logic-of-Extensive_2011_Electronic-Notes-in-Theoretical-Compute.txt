Although there has been substantial research on epistemic games in economics, particularly in the field of interactive epistemology, very few modal logic analyses of epistemic games in both strategic form and extensive form have been conducted. As a result, there is currently a lack of a logic with a corresponding formal semantics for extensive form games that is sufficiently general. In response to this gap, a new logic is presented that allows reasoning about the epistemic aspects of extensive games, addressing concepts such as knowledge, rationality, and backward induction. However, the logic's treatment of these concepts is based on ad hoc axiomatization, and it is purely syntactic, lacking a model-theoretic analysis of extensive form games.

The definition of rationality presented in the paper states that an agent is considered rational at an end vertex of the game if and only if they choose an action that maximizes their individual payoff. Notably, this conception of rationality does not involve any epistemic considerations.

The paper introduces two constraints, labeled as c6 and c7, which outline the continuous awareness and recall of uncertainty by agents throughout the game. According to c6, agents will never forget their current uncertainty over strategies in any reachable vertex, ensuring perfect recall of their past uncertainty. On the other hand, c7 dictates that agents are always aware of their future uncertainty over strategies in every reachable vertex, preventing them from discarding strategies and learning as they progress through time.

While the paper acknowledges prior logical analyses of extensive games, it aims to provide a comprehensive axiomatization of its own logic and expresses plans to explore potential extensions of the logic. Future work may involve investigating the expansion of the current semantics to reason about the past and hypothetical scenarios, in addition to the future. This represents a promising research direction for further study.
