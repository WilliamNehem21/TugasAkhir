Various studies have demonstrated the significance of genre in music appreciation, with some indicating that the style of a piece can have a greater impact on listener preference than the piece itself. The role of categorization in music appreciation and cognition has also been emphasized. In light of this, the following sections provide an overview of literature on music genre classification techniques, describe a proposed approach, present test results, and offer conclusions. The challenges in this area include the subjective and ambiguous nature of genre classifications, the evolving nature of music styles, and the difficulty in manually categorizing recordings. These challenges have led researchers to develop new approaches to music genre classification, such as a framework based on auditory human perception and sparse representation, which has demonstrated high levels of accuracy. Additionally, it has been noted that most existing approaches focus on timbre texture, rhythmic content, or pitch content, whereas the proposed approach in this work is based on entropies and fractal dimensions, bypassing the traditional musical information such as harmony, melody, beat, and tempo. Furthermore, the study found that while using a substantial portion of the database for training can lead to full accuracy, even a modest training dataset can produce strong classification rates, suggesting the potential effectiveness of the proposed approach.
