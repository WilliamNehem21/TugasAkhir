When conducting a risk assessment of a system in which trust considerations are critical, it is necessary to incorporate information about how individuals make decisions based on trust into the system model. For instance, the choice of which rule to adopt, or whether alternative rules or measures would be more effective, hinges on a comprehensive understanding of the system. This understanding can be achieved through the involvement of various stakeholders, such as end-users, decision makers, and engineers, each of whom brings different backgrounds and expertise to the table. Therefore, the language used to express the system models should be intuitive and easily comprehensible to all parties involved.

Trust plays a pivotal role in influencing the behavior of individuals, as exemplified by the decision-making process of a party such as "Billy." However, the explicit representation of how trust informs decision-making is currently lacking. Therefore, the objective is to explicitly capture this aspect within the system specification. To do so, it is essential to establish a clear definition of trust as it pertains to the context being analyzed.

In this context, trust is defined as the belief held by a trustor regarding the conduct of a trustee. As a belief, trust is inherently subjective. An actor, which may take the form of an organization, a person, or an automated entity, possesses goals, intentions, and capabilities. Typically, a trustor anticipates that a trustee will only act in a certain manner under specific conditions—a scenario referred to as the antecedent scenario of trust in relation to a transaction.

In the specific example provided, "Billy" can be considered the trustor, while the seller assumes the role of the trustee. The antecedent scenario involves Billy making an advance payment after a phone conversation, with the ensuing transaction entailing the seller dispatching the item upon receipt of payment. If Billy's belief in the seller's likelihood of sending the item stands at, for instance, 0.9, then his trust in the seller with regard to this transaction is also 0.9. Furthermore, the asset in question comprises both the items received by the purchaser agent and the available funds for additional purchases. Failure to receive an item for which payment has been made diminishes the value of this asset.

Thus, in this example, it is crucial to ascertain the degree to which the purchaser agent trusts the seller to dispatch the item after receiving an advance payment—namely, the subjective probability assigned to this outcome by the purchaser agent. Additionally, understanding how this trust impacts the decision-making process concerning whether to make an advance payment is essential.
