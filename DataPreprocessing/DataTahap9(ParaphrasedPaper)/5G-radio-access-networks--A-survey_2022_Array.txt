The fifth generation (5G) technology enhances user experience and opens up new possibilities for a range of applications such as transportation, device-to-device communication, agriculture, and manufacturing. These new use cases result in a significant increase in the number of users, volume of traffic, throughput, and latency, necessitating modifications to the Radio Access Network (RAN) for the 5G system. This study explores various RAN architectures, including Cloud-RAN (C-RAN), Heterogeneous Cloud-RAN (H-CRAN), and Fog-RAN (F-RAN), and examines their efficiency in different contexts such as system efficiency, spectrum and energy efficiency, fronthaul capacity, latency, resource sharing and allocation, among others. The study also highlights current issues with these architectures and potential solutions.

The remainder of this article is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an introduction to the basics of the 5G system, key milestones, and standard development organizations (SDOs). Section 3 discusses the 5G Radio Access Network (5G RAN) architectures and their limitations. Finally, Section 4 concludes with the key contributions and areas for future work.

The RAN is a crucial component of a mobile network, playing a vital role during deployment and in operational complexity and cost. Traditionally, mobile networks rely on a distributed RAN architecture where a single Remote Radio Head (RRH) is linked to a point of deployment. This article explores cost modeling for BBU hotelling strategies, network planning and provisioning frameworks, fronthaul compression techniques, and optimization methods for different RAN architectures such as C-RAN, H-CRAN, and F-RAN.

Efforts have been made to reduce latency and optimize resource utilization in RAN architectures, including the use of open-loop radio access, information-based resource optimization, and dynamic stochastic resource optimization models. Additionally, interference control in H-CRANs is discussed, highlighting challenges related to network size, heterogeneity of base station sites (BSS), and fronthaul/backhaul limitations, with proposed strategies to address the interference problem.

In conclusion, this study delves into various aspects of RAN architectures for 5G systems, addressing their limitations and potential solutions while providing insights for future research directions.
