This paper introduces a platform designed to facilitate communication between various automata tools. The platform, called Calife, supports several different automata models, such as transition systems, timed automata, and counter automata, and it enables the creation of new models and the integration of new tools. Currently, Calife interfaces with a number of tools, including Uppaal, HyTech, Kronos, CMC, and Coq. Notably, the platform allows for the export of a single timed-automata system model created in the Calife system editor to all of these tools.
