Whether greenhouse gas emissions are primarily responsible for global warming or not, the fact remains that they must be reduced to improve air quality and address a range of issues, from environmental to economic and political. Nuclear hydrogen production (NHP), which involves deriving energy from nuclear reactors to power chemical plants for hydrogen production, has been under study since the 1970s as an effective method for producing clean fuels for the automotive and electricity industries. While this concept was once distant from industrial application, recent advances in nuclear and chemical technology are bringing NHP plants closer to reality. Two promising NHP technologies have a common critical step, sulfuric acid decomposition, which is the most energy-intensive part of the process and operates at high temperatures. Improvements in energy usage in this section could significantly enhance overall process efficiency. This study introduces a simple yet realistic methodology for simulating and analyzing this crucial section, with validation achieved through direct comparison with experimental data and subsequent thermal optimization leading to a 4% reduction in energy consumption by adjusting the reactor's outlet temperature.

Inside the reactor, a progressive acid vaporization is followed by chemical decomposition (reaction 1), gas heating, and another chemical reaction (reaction 2). This process constitutes the cold stream. Subsequently, the hot gas undergoes a cooling process upon exiting the catalytic section, during which its residual heat is transferred to the cold stream, constituting the hot stream.

The research group conducted a study that involved analyzing data from the Chemical Engineer's Handbook, along with numerical analysis. This effort, combined with dynamic interpolation and extrapolation based on the data and computational programming, served as the foundation for SEAS v 0.1, a sulfuric acid modeler developed by the group.
