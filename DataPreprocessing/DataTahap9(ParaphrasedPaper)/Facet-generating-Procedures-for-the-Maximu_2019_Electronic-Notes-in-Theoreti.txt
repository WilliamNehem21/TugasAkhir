A common issue in course scheduling involves determining which classrooms should be allocated to each lecture of each course in a way that ensures that overlapping lectures are assigned different classrooms, taking into account the starting and ending times of each lecture. This problem can be represented by an undirected graph (denoted as g=(v, eg)), where the vertices represent the lectures and the edges connect pairs of lectures that cannot share the same classroom due to overlapping time intervals. Additionally, a set of classrooms, denoted as c, is involved in this modeling. The graph g is commonly referred to as the conflict graph associated with the lectures. This problem is equivalent to the classical graph vertex coloring problem, where the goal is to color the vertices of the graph with a minimum number of colors such that no adjacent vertices have the same color.

The methods for generating facets and the separation algorithm introduced in this study can be applied to the standard formulation of the classical vertex coloring problem. In this scenario, the y-variables in the procedures must be disregarded. It would be beneficial to investigate whether these concepts can be further developed and refined for the classical vertex coloring problem in order to create more precise procedures and a more efficient unified separation heuristic. Furthermore, it would be worthwhile to explore the application of similar facet-preserving procedures to other related problems, as these ideas may simplify the description of existing facets and streamline the implementation of cutting-plane-based procedures.
