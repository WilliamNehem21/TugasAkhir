Wireless communication systems are increasingly utilized across various domains, including consumer electronics, automated highways, remote tele-medicine, and wireless sensor networks, due to their critical applications in terms of safety and financial significance. Consequently, a substantial amount of time is devoted to analyzing designs and ensuring the reliability and performance of wireless systems prior to production. While computer-based simulations are commonly used for probabilistic analysis of wireless systems, the inherent nature of simulation, coupled with the usage of computer arithmetic, leads to potential inaccuracies. Therefore, relying solely on simulation for the analysis of wireless systems, particularly in safety critical areas, may pose risks.

This paper presents a methodology for the probabilistic analysis of wireless systems using the HOL theorem prover, which is based on higher-order logic. While the methodology discussed is based on HOL, it can be adapted to other higher-order-logic theorem provers, such as Isabelle, Coq, or PVS. The paper is structured as follows: It provides a review of related work in Section 2, presents the methodology based on existing HOL formalizations of probability theory in Section 3, offers an analysis of the ARQ mechanism at the LLC layer of the GPRS in Section 4, and concludes in Section 5.

Probabilistic model checking is a commonly used formal method for the analysis of wireless systems, but it comes with limitations, such as state space explosion and difficulties in reasoning about statistical quantities. In addition to probabilistic model checking, rewriting logic-based formal tools have been explored for the probabilistic analysis of wireless systems. The paper also details the formalization of an expression for expectation in higher-order logic, which is crucial for reasoning about statistical properties in a theorem prover.

The authors advocate for the usage of higher-order-logic theorem proving for the precise analysis of wireless systems, particularly in safety critical applications such as medicine and transportation. They present a generic methodology for the probabilistic analysis of wireless systems and illustrate its application through an analysis of the ARQ mechanism at the LLC layer of the GPRS. This marks the first instance of a theorem prover being used for the probabilistic analysis of a wireless system.
