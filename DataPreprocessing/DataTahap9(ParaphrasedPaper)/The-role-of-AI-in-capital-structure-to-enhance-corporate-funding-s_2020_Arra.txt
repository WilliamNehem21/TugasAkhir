The aim of this research was to investigate the potential use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and its impact on the accuracy of expected return estimations. The cost of capital represents the minimum return expected from any investment made by a firm, and accurate estimation of the cost of capital is crucial for maximizing the value of a corporation.

To assess the use of AI in the CAPM, the study analyzed the adjusted closing stock prices of 10 high-tech public companies from January 2013 to January 2019. The research involved predicting returns for the upcoming year using both traditional CAPM and a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to forecast stock prices. A deep learning network architecture featuring Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and dropout layers was developed for this purpose.

The study also considered the influence of market volatility on the cost of capital and the importance of using average values to lessen the impact of sudden fluctuations in default-free securities, especially during financial crises such as that of 2008.

Artificial intelligence was defined as an algorithm capable of learning and making decisions. The study discussed various AI models, including deep learning, neural networks, and image recognition. It emphasized the potential of AI in financial applications, such as pattern recognition and prediction of future events.

Furthermore, the research explored optimization algorithms for identifying the best parameters for a neural network model and highlighted the advantages of neural networks in capturing non-linear effects that are concealed in regression algorithms. The study employed Python for data analysis and neural network development, as well as Microsoft Excel for data management.

In addressing the performance of RNN, the study identified the vanishing gradient problem and proposed the use of LSTM to increase prediction accuracy. The study also compared the traditional method of calculating CAPM with the newly proposed AI-based approaches.

Overall, the findings suggested that AI-based methods, particularly those utilizing LSTM, showed promise in predicting stock prices and estimating returns more accurately than traditional CAPM. The study highlighted the potential impact of AI on the finance industry, specifically in the context of portfolio planning, and emphasized the need for further research to validate the findings in other markets and industries.
