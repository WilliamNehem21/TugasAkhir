The conventional method for retrieving information can be formally described as follows: the user provides the properties of the entities to be retrieved as a query, and the answer is the set of all entities that satisfy the query. Another method is to request the overall information about a specific entity, with the answer being the corresponding information. An example of the first kind of query is "What are the drugs that contain a given molecule?" while an example of the second kind is "What are the properties of a given drug?"

The latter method has received scant attention in research despite its potential practical applications. However, it raises several non-trivial issues. The first is to establish a precise definition of what it means for a piece of information to be "about" a given entity. This paper explores the formal definitions proposed in formal classical logic and the main properties that follow from this definition. The second issue is to adapt existing automated deduction methods to compute this new kind of answer, using either deduction or abduction techniques.

Currently, information accessible via the internet is not formally structured in this manner. Instead, it is mostly represented in natural languages, and queries are expressed using keywords rather than a formal language. These keywords, from a logical standpoint, may be constant symbols or predicate symbols. Therefore, it is important to extend automated deduction methods to retrieve overall information about one or several given entities.

The work presented in this paper aims to propose theoretical foundations and practical methods to design tools that allow for the retrieval of overall information about a given entity. It builds upon previous works by philosophers, logicians, and researchers in automated deduction. The objective is to define a bridge between the theoretical definitions of relevant information and an automated resolution strategy that is as efficient as linear resolution. While the methods proposed here are designed to be practical, the paper acknowledges that more efficient strategies could potentially be developed in the future.

The paper is organized as follows: in section 2, different approaches to storing and retrieving information are classified using examples. Section 3 presents the theoretical foundations that allow the characterization of information that is "about" a given entity. The subsequent section is devoted to the presentation of automated deduction methods for retrieving this information. Finally, the last section presents a set of open questions that merit further research.

The paper also addresses specific technical issues, such as proof schema and syntactical characterization, and proposes potential areas for further investigation, such as language extension to function symbols and dealing with the large volume of information about a given entity.

Overall, this paper emphasizes the importance of defining practical methods for retrieving overall information about a given entity and lays the groundwork for future research in this area.
