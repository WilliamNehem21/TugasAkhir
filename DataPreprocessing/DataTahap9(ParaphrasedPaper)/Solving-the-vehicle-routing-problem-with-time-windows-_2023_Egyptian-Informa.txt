The vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) is a well-known logistics and transportation problem with various practical applications. The main objective of the problem is to minimize the total distance traveled by a fleet of vehicles that start from a central warehouse, visit predetermined customers within specified time constraints, and return to the warehouse. This paper introduces a modified football game algorithm (MFGA) as an efficient optimization approach to address the NP-hard VRPTW. The MFGA, inspired by the behavior of football players during a game, aims to find the best positions to achieve the goal under the guidance of a team coach.

The algorithm introduces a novel method for generating an initial solution for the VRPTW, as well as an improved approach for updating the location of players, enhancing the efficiency of the algorithm. The growing significance of an efficient transportation network is recognized as a crucial requirement for development and economic progress. Transportation is now viewed as a key service sector, playing a direct role in reducing production costs, facilitating market access, and enhancing competitiveness in international trade.

The study discusses the importance of transportation management, planning, and investment in the context of global economic growth and increasing competition. Due to the computational complexity associated with large problem instances, approximate methods such as the harmony search algorithm, memetic algorithm, tabu search, and variable neighborhood search are preferred by researchers for swiftly obtaining near-optimal solutions. Various hybrid algorithms and techniques such as adaptive harmony methods, simulated annealing, and dynamic programming have been proposed to tackle the VRPTW, addressing objectives like minimizing traveled distance, route balance, and customer satisfaction.

A detailed exploration of the modified football game algorithm is presented in this paper, along with an analysis of the experimental results and a comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods. The algorithm, based on the principles of football, allows for the replacement of underperforming solutions with better ones, akin to substituting players during a match. Additionally, the algorithm's search behavior is influenced by an adjustable parameter called alpha, balancing between local and global exploration with respect to the optimization problem.

The paper also describes the use of the hill climbing method as a local search strategy to further improve the effectiveness of the MFGA. Detailed insight into the parameter settings and computational performance of the algorithm on specific hardware is provided. The study emphasizes the importance of choosing appropriate parameter values for achieving optimal performance, considering factors such as population size, number of customers, and control parameters for search diversification and intensification.

Finally, the paper is structured to provide an introduction to the football game algorithm in section 2, followed by an explanation of the proposed MFGA approach in section 3. Section 4 delves into the experimental design and results, comparing the performance of the MFGA with state-of-the-art methods. The discussions and conclusions are presented in section 5, summarizing the key findings and implications of the study.
