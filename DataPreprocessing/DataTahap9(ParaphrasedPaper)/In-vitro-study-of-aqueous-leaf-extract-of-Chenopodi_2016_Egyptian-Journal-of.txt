The growth of brushite crystals was analyzed using a growth assay in a single diffusion gel, following the methods previously outlined by Joshi et al. [2005b] with minor adjustments. The single diffusion gel growth approach was employed to facilitate the growth of calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (CHPD) crystals. Once the crystals reached their maximum growth, the inhibitive effects of citric acid solutions with varying concentrations were investigated by introducing them into the supernatant solution.

The experiment utilized glass test tubes with dimensions of 2.5 cm in diameter and 15 cm in length for crystal growth. A 5 mL sodium metasilicate solution with a specific gravity of 1.06 was acidified by adding 2.7 mL of orthophosphoric acid, and 10 mL of 1 M aqueous calcium chloride solution was carefully added to the set gels. Crystals were observed to exhibit rapid growth within two days of pouring the supernatant solutions, resulting in the formation of elongated platelet and star-shaped crystals in the gel. The apparent length of the growing crystals was measured at various time intervals under a microscope. Analysis of the growth kinetics revealed that the crystals reached their maximum length on the 5th day after pouring the supernatant solution onto the set gel. An aqueous solution of citric acid, as well as a control, was added in the same volume as the calcium chloride solution on the 5th day after the crystals achieved their maximum length, and their influence on the growth of CHPD crystals was examined up to the 8th day. Observation under pH 5.0 revealed the presence of numerous crystals exhibiting star and platelet morphologies. Photographs were taken to document the growth of the crystals in the test tubes.
