This research paper introduces a new annotation methodology called Biochemical Space, along with a set of software tools, to address the challenge of uniquely annotating organism-specific computational models in a public model database. The central idea is to create a transparent and well-annotated reaction network of chemical entities and elemental reactions on which mathematical models can be projected. The Biochemical Space aims to provide a unifying platform for understanding the biological processes related to a specific organism. The methodology's three main contributions are: (i) systematic projection of models to well-structured biological knowledge, (ii) simplification of the annotation procedure, and (iii) addressing various problems such as lumped model variables, combinatorial explosion in chemical modifications of entities, and hierarchical organization of entity locations. The Biochemical Space methodology extends beyond current standards like SBML by offering a process-focused hierarchical description. The paper outlines the annotation workflow, the formal structure of annotation data, and the toolset developed for maintaining Biochemical Space. The paper also demonstrates the application of the Biochemical Space framework to annotate complex cyanobacteria processes.

The paper discusses the challenges of rigorously presenting complex biological models without overwhelming users with the underlying mathematical complexities. To address these challenges, the paper presents the E-cyanobacterium 1 activity, focusing on handling domain-specific problems and leveraging repository and database synthesis to create complex relationships between models, ontological knowledge bases, simulations, and integration of models in the domain-specific context.

The Biochemical Space is described as a representation of reaction networks linked to existing ontologies, using process-based hierarchy to navigate through the biological space. The paper discusses the hierarchical representation of relevant biochemical mechanisms for understanding the non-trivial biological context of models accompanying the Biochemical Space data. It explains that Biochemical Space avoids issues related to dynamical models by focusing on a process-level description, going beyond the features of SBML Level 2 by addressing issues such as generalization of compartments in a hierarchy of locations, introduction of entity states, and dealing with combinatorial explosion.

The paper also discusses the practical aspects of creating and maintaining the Biochemical Space, including the use of a textual file with specific syntax for the creation and modification of the Biochemical Space, as well as the mapping of entities, elemental reactions, and models into a high-level process hierarchy. It also discusses the process of mapping entities and reactions from the Biochemical Space to model species and ODEs, highlighting the challenges and the final step in establishing connections between biology and mathematical modeling.

The paper outlines the features of the graphical user interface (GUI) designed to facilitate user understanding and interaction with the Biochemical Space, including the visualization of entities and reactions in a network structure. Additionally, the paper describes an online tool that provides functionality as an extension to the annotation editor, enabling visualization and interconnection of entities and reactions to a tree structure for a better understanding of real-world distribution.

Furthermore, the paper provides a case study of the development of Biochemical Space for several biological processes of cyanobacteria, particularly focusing on environmental processes, respiration and photosynthesis, and metabolism. It explains the specific details and challenges related to each of these processes and how the Biochemical Space is used to address them.

In conclusion, the paper emphasizes that Biochemical Space serves as an interface connecting mathematical models with existing annotation databases, distinct from existing formalisms, and providing a comprehensive platform for annotating complex cellular processes.
