The article presents a method for creating bi2s3/(p)cuscn heterojunctions on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates, and demonstrates the successful use of this heterojunction as a room-temperature sensor for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). In a related study, Rath et al. described the first solution-processed heterojunction solar cells using p-type PbS quantum dots and n-type Bi2S3 nanocrystals, with the nanostructured n-type Bi2S3 serving as the electron acceptor. The formation rate of Bi2S3 is controlled by the concentration of Bi3+ ions, which forms a complex with Bi[(TEA)n]3+ where TEA is triethanolamine. Ni-doped Bi2S3 films were created by adding 1.5 wt% of nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2) to the fabrication process. The films exhibit agglomeration of small crystallites, making evaluation of grain size from scanning electron microscope (SEM) images difficult, and depict a common spherical shape. The number of free charge carriers in the (p)Si/(n)Bi2S3 junction increases with temperature, leading to a decrease in series resistance. The authors investigated the temperature-dependent electrical and photovoltaic properties of the (p)Si/(n)Bi2S3 heterojunction fabricated using the chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique. They found that the junction exhibits a rectifying nature, indicating the formation of a barrier at the semiconductor interface. The ideality factor and series resistance decrease, while the potential barrier height increases with temperature. The photovoltaic conversion efficiency is low due to the presence of interfacial and barrier height inhomogeneity.
