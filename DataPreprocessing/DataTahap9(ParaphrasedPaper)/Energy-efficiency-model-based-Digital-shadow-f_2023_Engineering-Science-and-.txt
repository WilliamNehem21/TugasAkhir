In order to address the challenges described, a digital twin (DT) is utilized to transform the system and monitor energy data from physical assets through a dynamic model. The development of the energy efficiency model-based DT within the context of Industry 4.0 involves data collection to be used in the model, with the goal of improving the simulation of energy consumption for all loads in the ecosystem. However, the heterogeneity of energy data types and lack of communication between entities are hindering the implementation of energy-based DT and data collection systems in actual industries. Hence, the energy efficiency of each entity is used to standardize data collection, starting with a single machine.

Another method, the Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)-based IM controller, is also presented. Additionally, the development of an ANFIS torque controller method is discussed, aimed at improving both dynamic and steady-state performance. Efforts have been made to apply the ANFIS algorithm for estimating the equivalent circuit parameters (ECPs) of induction motors. The paper is organized as follows: the significance and novelty of the research are highlighted in section 2, while a literature review of induction motor DT implementation in Industry 4.0 is provided in section 3. Section 4 discusses the development of the energy efficiency model for the DS application of induction motors, and section 5 presents simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. A brief conclusion and prospects for future work are provided in sections 6 and 7.

The resistance of the windings is calculated when the motor is cold (ambient temperature), and then the motor is run at 100% of its operating load for 1 hour. The difference between the temperatures of each resistance during this time represents the leading coefficient of the linear affine model of the temperature.

The paper also compares efficiency results obtained from the proposed model with those obtained from measurements of a motor. The performance results of the optimal ANFIS algorithms are described, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The Neuro-Fuzzy Designer from the MATLAB toolbox is used to estimate the ECPs in real-time by considering dynamic input of voltage, current, and power factor, and static input from the motor manufacturer datasheet. The simulation is run for 1 second, and the speed control is utilized as the mechanical input.

The proposed model's simulation shows promising results for the losses and energy efficiency estimation for linear speed input, making it suitable for better machine design and energy efficiency-based predictive maintenance. However, the model may require further development to enable implementation in certain industries due to speed measurement challenges. To address this, additional speed estimation techniques may be employed, such as the sliding mode observer.

Overall, the proposed model shows good agreement with the measured energy efficiency and can have potential applications for energy efficiency-based predictive maintenance and improved machine design.
