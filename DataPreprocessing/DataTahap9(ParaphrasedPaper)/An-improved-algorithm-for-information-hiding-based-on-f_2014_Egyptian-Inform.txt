The concept of steganography involves concealing confidential information within a host media to prevent detection by unauthorized individuals. Text steganography, in particular, poses a challenging problem due to the limited data redundancy in text files compared to other carrier files. In this study, we present a novel steganographic algorithm designed specifically for Arabic text, focusing on enhancing security and maximizing carrier capacity. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly increases the embedding capacity rate of the carrier media, making minimal changes to the carrier text and effectively resisting traditional attack methods.

Steganography aims to clandestinely transmit hidden information, which can take the form of plain text, ciphertext, or images encoded into a bit stream and embedded within a cover carrier to create a stego-carrier. The process of text steganography is influenced by the unique characteristics of each language, and exploiting these characteristics is essential for developing effective steganographic schemes. Text steganography in Arabic, for instance, utilizes the distinct features of Arabic letters, such as the significance of dots in 14 of the 28 letters, and the specific rules governing the positioning and isolation of certain letters within words.

Arabic text presents challenges for steganography due to its limited redundancy and the need to take into account the language's specific grammatical and orthographic characteristics. Our proposed steganographic algorithm leverages the properties of Arabic text to effectively hide data within the text without noticeably altering its appearance, using a specialized font created for this purpose. The method utilizes isolated letters at the beginning and end of words as hidden keys in Unicode-format Arabic text, ensuring a seamless integration of hidden data within the carrier text.

Experimental results validate the high capacity and security of our method when applied to a diverse range of Arabic text files sourced from various domains. Additionally, we anticipate future enhancements to further increase the capacity ratio of the method by considering all isolated letters in every word according to our initial estimations. Furthermore, our approach is versatile, extending beyond electronic text steganography to also encompass hard copy documents. Utilizing a special font for isolated letters in printed documents enables the extraction of hidden information using our proposed algorithm.

In summary, our study introduces an innovative steganographic algorithm tailored for Arabic text, offering heightened security, increased carrier capacity, and versatility for both electronic and hard copy applications. Our findings pave the way for further advancements in text steganography, particularly in the context of Arabic and related languages.
