Model checking and temporal logics, as currently understood, are binary in nature. The core question in model checking, which is whether a system satisfies a certain property, can only be answered as true or false. Furthermore, properties expressed in temporal logics are rooted in boolean propositions. Although this traditional approach suffices for specifying and validating boolean temporal properties, it is inadequate for addressing quantitative aspects of systems. Various extensions of temporal logics have been proposed to address this limitation, particularly within the realm of probabilistic systems. These extensions enable the exploration of questions pertaining to the probability with which a system satisfies a given property.

A similar circumstance arises in the domain of constraint satisfaction problems, where classical problems are limited to considering boolean constraints exclusivelyâ€”where a constraint is either present or absent. However, certain CSP problems cannot be adequately formulated using such a rigid interpretation of constraints. To address this, several approaches have emerged, which essentially assign non-boolean values to constraints, such as probabilities, costs, and sets. These types of constraints are referred to as "soft constraints," giving rise to related problems known as "soft CSP," including fuzzy CSP, probabilistic CSP, and weighted CSP, among others.

This paper presents a framework based on additive and multiplicative operations, which captures the majority of common soft CSP problems. The framework enables the application of results to specific instances, which can be utilized effectively in solving a given problem or as indications of specialized solution methods suitable for a particular problem. Remarkably, the c-semiring constraint methods offer a unique advantage in addressing problems involving multiple criteria or metrics.

Network quality of service (QoS) properties such as bandwidth, delay, and jitter exemplify typical examples of QoS properties, while application-level QoS encompasses attributes like pricing and access rights. In most cases, the implicit algebraic structure is a c-semiring. In fact, c-semirings have been utilized in KAOS, a calculus for programmable QoS, as a formalism for representing QoS properties of wide area network (WAN) applications.

The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 provides the essential background on c-semirings and transition systems. The subsequent section delineates the syntax and semantics of the extended logics, along with presenting some theoretical results. Section 4 discusses the computation of these logics, while Section 5 highlights various applications of the proposed framework. The final section offers a conclusion and outlines current and future work. An appendix following the bibliography contains proofs of certain lemmas and theorems.

The set "f" denotes additional functions over the domain of the specific c-semiring under consideration, aside from the additive and multiplicative operations. For example, if the c-semiring in question is the boolean one, the set "f" can include boolean negation as a function, enabling the definition of all possible boolean functions. In the context of an optimization c-semiring, additional arithmetic functions like multiplication or division may be included in "f." Ultimately, the choice of "f" determines the set of all functions that can be represented within the framework.
