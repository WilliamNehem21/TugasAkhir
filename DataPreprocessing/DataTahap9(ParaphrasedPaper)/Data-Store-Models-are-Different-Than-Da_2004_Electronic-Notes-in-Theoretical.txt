A data store serves as the central repository for managing persistent data in an application, encompassing critical concepts, data storage, and behavioral facilitation. It requires careful management to ensure accuracy and support application memory.

On the other hand, a data interchange facilitates the movement of data between applications and is transient in nature. It does not store data but instead acts as a conduit for transferring data from a source to targets, necessitating data translation from the source application and data population in the target application.

A case study about the Process Data Exchange Institute (PDXI) from the early 1990s is used to illustrate these concepts. Initially, there were concerns about awarding the project to a university-led team, but the team ultimately proved to be effective and business-like, dispelling initial worries.

Looking back, it becomes evident that the deliverables produced, comprising 150 pages of models, were too extensive for an interchange standard. This reflects a confusion between an application model and an interchange model.

The distinction between application and interchange models, which was not initially recognized during the project, becomes evident in retrospect. The excessive size of the delivered models for the interchange standard highlights this distinction. Additionally, the development of a metamodel for physical properties within the PDXI models was met with resistance from corporate sponsors who lacked a clear understanding of the desired data interchange model for their business purposes.

In summary, the case study exemplifies the importance of understanding the differences and requirements of application and interchange models, as well as the significance of clear communication with stakeholders regarding their needs for data interchange models.
