The signaling techniques used in optical burst switching (OBS) networks can be classified as either immediate reservation or delayed reservation, depending on the duration for which the wavelength channel is reserved. In immediate reservation, the channel for the expected data burst is reserved right after processing the burst header packet (BHP), whereas in delayed reservation, the channel is reserved only for the duration of the burst. For example, the JIT signaling protocol employs immediate reservation, while the JET signaling protocol utilizes delayed reservation. However, the JET protocol outperforms the JIT protocol in terms of bandwidth utilization and burst loss probability (BLP) at the expense of increased computational complexity at the core nodes due to bandwidth reservation even when there is no burst.

In OBS networks with multiple wavelength channels per link, a scheduling algorithm is necessary to determine the appropriate channel for forwarding a burst. The scheduling algorithms can be broadly categorized into non-void filling and void filling algorithms. Non-void filling algorithms, such as FFUC (First Fit Unscheduled Channel) and LAUC (Latest Available Unscheduled Channel), minimize the void size by scheduling bursts on wavelengths with the latest available unscheduled time.

Contention loss, resulting from multiple bursts contending for the same output port on the same wavelength simultaneously, is a significant issue in OBS networks and can greatly affect their performance. OBS networks lack efficient optical buffers, necessitating the design of quality of service (QoS) differentiation mechanisms to address burst loss due to contention. These mechanisms aim to allocate more resources to higher priority traffic classes compared to lower priority ones.

This paper presents an analytical model for a wavelength reservation-based QoS differentiation mechanism in OBS networks. The model is initially studied for a single class system and then extended to a k-class service system. Simulation results demonstrate the impact of higher priority traffic classes on the performance of lower priority ones in terms of blocking probability. The study also examines a shared traffic system to illustrate QoS differentiation among multiple traffic classes, concluding that service classes with more allocated wavelengths experience lower burst loss probability compared to classless systems, while those with fewer wavelengths suffer heavy burst losses.
