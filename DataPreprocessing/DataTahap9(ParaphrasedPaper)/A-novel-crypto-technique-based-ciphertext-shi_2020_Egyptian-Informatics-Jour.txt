Cryptography involves the use of mathematical algorithms to secure information by encrypting and decrypting messages, transforming intelligible data into unintelligible data. This ensures that sensitive data can be stored or transmitted across insecure networks without being deciphered by unauthorized parties. In contrast, steganography involves hiding a message within another message, allowing only the intended recipient to decode it.

This study focuses on enhancing the security of secret key steganography by strengthening the cryptosystem. Building on previous research that combined text steganography with AES-HMAC cryptography, a new method was devised to increase cryptographic strength by modifying ciphertext using a shifting algorithm based on a key value. The resulting ciphertext is highly resistant to decryption without the appropriate decoding tool.

In terms of hybrid cryptography and steganography, the approach relies on a previously established strategy based on AES-HMAC. The HMAC method involves combining a keyed-hash message authentication code with the hash function SHA256 using a secret cryptographic key, while the AES-256 encryption standard is employed. This technique offers enhanced security compared to standard encryption methods. In this study, HMAC is used for encryption, and a shifting algorithm is subsequently applied to the ciphertext produced by the HMAC method.

The shifting algorithm rearranges the ciphertext to create a shifting cipher, which is then subjected to a steganographic process. Several important conclusions can be drawn from this work.
