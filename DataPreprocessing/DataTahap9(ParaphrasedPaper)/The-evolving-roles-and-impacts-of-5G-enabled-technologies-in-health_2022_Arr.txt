The usage of 5G-enabled technologies is rapidly expanding and has the potential to have significant impacts across various fields, providing real-time services beyond our current expectations. This study aims to explore the capabilities of 5G technology and its potential to address current healthcare challenges, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It emphasizes the evolving roles of 5G-enabled technologies, including AI and machine learning, IoT devices, big data analytics, cloud computing, and other digital platforms, in addressing the current epidemiological challenges. Additionally, the paper discusses the technological and healthcare challenges as well as the potential for developing 5G-powered healthcare solutions.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on education, with the closure of educational institutions in 153 countries affecting approximately 1.2 billion students. The shift to online platforms and communication networks has become essential as people work from home, leading to a significant increase in internet traffic.

The existing healthcare system faces numerous challenges, such as limited access to healthcare services and facilities, as well as the lack of digital resources and quality treatment. Intelligent healthcare solutions are needed to provide optimal care for patients and ensure the delivery of safe and high-quality services.

The integration of 5G-enabled technologies and digital platforms has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by enabling remote diagnosis and treatment, continuous contagion monitoring, and the development of smart hospitals. These advancements can significantly improve healthcare services, including remote consultations, tele-surgery, and remote healthcare monitoring.

Additionally, 5G technology has the potential to enhance public-health strategies by enabling the development of innovative healthcare solutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes the use of 5G-powered robots and drones for epidemic prevention, unmanned cars for contact-free tasks in infected areas, and 5G-powered disinfection robots for sterilization purposes.

The integration of 5G technology with other digital innovations, such as AI, IoT, big data analytics, and cloud computing, is driving advancements in personalized and preventive healthcare. Furthermore, there is no substantial evidence to suggest that 5G signals cause the spread of the coronavirus, and the successful use of 5G technology in addressing healthcare challenges could pave the way for its acceptance in other sectors in the future.
