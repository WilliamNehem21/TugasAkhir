The study investigated the impact of punicalagin on various aspects of diabetes-induced complications, including metabolic risks, oxidative stress, inflammation, cardiac apoptosis, and histopathological changes. Diabetes was induced in male rats through streptozotocin injection, followed by punicalagin administration every other day for 15 days. The results showed that punicalagin treatment improved cardiac function, reduced apoptosis and inflammation, and protected against DNA damage in the heart. These findings suggest that punicalagin has therapeutic potential for managing diabetes and its associated complications in the heart by improving the redox state, suppressing apoptosis-related proteins, and increasing anti-apoptotic factors. Furthermore, punicalagin treatment was found to mitigate elevated levels of troponin T, LDH, and CK-MB, indicating its cardioprotective effects in diabetic conditions. Importantly, punicalagin also demonstrated anti-apoptotic effects and protected against DNA damage in the diabetic heart, possibly through its antioxidant properties. Overall, the study suggests that punicalagin may have therapeutic benefits in alleviating diabetes-related complications and protecting the heart from damage.
