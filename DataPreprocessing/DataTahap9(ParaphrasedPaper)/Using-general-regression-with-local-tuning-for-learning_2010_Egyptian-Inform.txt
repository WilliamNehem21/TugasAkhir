The abstract discusses the use of finite mixture models (FMM) as a pattern recognition technique for fitting complex data distributions, with parameters typically determined through the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. However, a modified version of the EM algorithm previously proposed to handle data sets with missing values is found to be influenced by outliers, class overlap, and bias in data generation, and is effective only with low missing value rates. To address these issues, a new algorithm is introduced in this study. A comparison study demonstrates the superior performance of the new algorithm over the modified EM algorithm and other commonly used algorithms in the literature. The study emphasizes the importance of handling missing values in data sets for accurate pattern recognition and model fitting. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is less sensitive to modeling assumptions and is more robust to learning challenges, making it particularly effective in scenarios involving outlier presence, class overlap, and imbalanced data sizes.
