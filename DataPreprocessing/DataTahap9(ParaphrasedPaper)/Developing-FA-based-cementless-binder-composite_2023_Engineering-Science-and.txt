A unique natural precursor, dune sand (DS), found abundantly in arid regions, has been classified as poorly graded sand according to the ASTM and AASHTO soil classification system. Its low fineness modulus makes it suitable as a fine aggregate for structural concrete; however, its high fineness and silica content play a crucial role in geopolymerization and strength development for alkali-activated binders (AABs). The use of DS as a component for one-part geopolymer mixture requires further extensive study for the development of carbon-neutral geopolymer cement.

In addition to the reactivity of the precursors, various factors such as type of precursor, alkaline to precursor ratio, ratio between alkaline activators (sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide), molarity of NaOH solution, and curing temperature influence the mechanical strength of two-part geopolymers.

Furthermore, DS has been found to be advantageous for pavement materials, as it can reduce plasticity. It has also been used to enhance the performance of grout and in the production of construction materials such as bricks. When combined with industrial waste, DS has been shown to improve the compressive strength of construction materials.

In a study on the development of AAB, fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), and DS were used as precursors. Different sources were obtained for FAs, and they were activated with GGBS to achieve the desired performance under ambient curing conditions. The addition of DS helped improve the packing and activation of FA. The study found that early compressive strength of FA-based geopolymers was enhanced by hot curing, and strength improvement over time could be achieved by addressing particle size variation.

The study also demonstrated that AAB mixtures incorporating DS resulted in high-strength and lightweight materials, particularly suitable for arid regions. The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) was employed to simplify the selection of sustainable construction materials for different scenarios and criteria.

Additionally, it was observed that reducing bulk density without compromising mechanical strength is an ideal application for lightweight AAB products. Water absorption was found to be strongly related to mechanical strength, with higher water absorption resulting in lower strength. However, high water absorption contributes to good insulation properties in arid regions.

The compressive strength of DS-incorporated AAB mixtures was the highest among all specimens, demonstrating the potential for high-strength materials based on DS for use in arid regions.
