The paper introduces and defines the terms true positive, fake positive, true negative, and fake negative, represented as TP, FP, TN, and FN, respectively. The specific values of these indices for the study are provided as TP=25, TN=179, FP=40, and FN=39, resulting in accuracy of 72.08%, sensitivity of 39.06%, and specificity of 81.73%.

Additionally, the study was supported by the earthquake monitoring center of the Shaanxi Earthquake Bureau, and earthquake precursor wave recording devices based on the liquid-suspension principle were deployed at Ziwu, Qianling, and Louguan for over a year. However, the proximity of these data collection stations had an impact on the accurate locating of the epicenter in relation to the propagation speed of the precursor waves. To address this issue, recording devices were redeployed in Gansu, Henan, Sichuan, and Shaanxi, locations that are relatively farther apart. The new data recording process began on July 21, 2011.
