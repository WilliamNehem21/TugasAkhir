For a comprehensive understanding of the general theory of lambda calculus, readers are directed to works by Barendregt and Krivine. Similarly, for an in-depth study of the general theory of universal algebras, readers may refer to resources by Burris and Sankappanavar, Gratzer and McKenzie, and McNulty and Taylor. For references on topological algebras, readers are recommended to consult works by Taylor, Gumm, Bentz, and Coleman.

A lambda theory, denoted as "t," is characterized as a set where t+ equals t (refer to [3, def. 4.1.1] for details). It should be noted that the notation t` m= n entails t+ t` m= n, and can also be represented as such.

In the context of a T0-space a, a partial order is termed as the specialization order of a. It is noteworthy that any continuous mapping between T0-spaces is inherently monotonic, and the order is discrete, i.e., it satisfies the condition a b if and only if a = b, if a is a T1-space.

The previous axioms of separation can be adapted to pairs
