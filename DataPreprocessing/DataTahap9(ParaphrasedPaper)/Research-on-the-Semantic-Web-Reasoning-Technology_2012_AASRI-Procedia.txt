The semantic web enriches web content with semantic features, representing an extension of the world-wide-web with the goal of imbuing all web resources with meaning. This enhancement enables computers to gain some level of understanding of semantics, leading to more efficient resource sharing and cooperative intelligence. In this context, the research prioritizes the development of the description logic, a decidable subset of first-order predication logic, to serve as the logical foundation of the semantic web. This flavor of logic is powerful in its ability to express knowledge and is constructed based on concepts and roles, where concepts denote collections of objects and roles denote binary relationships between objects.

An application of this theoretical framework is illustrated in an automatic course-arranging system, where an ontology of teaching materials is initially established to provide reasoning services for relevant resources and facilitate the reuse of domain knowledge. Rule-based course and test arrangement procedures are then implemented to carry out reasoning services. Following the completion of reasoning, newly inferred facts can be incorporated into the ontology as needed, managed by the jesstab function which can add, modify, or delete contents. This integration of reasoning and management functions enables efficient operation based on predefined conditions, and facilitates the importation of new facts into the ontology for further use in knowledge base systems or other applications through the JESS API.

The development of the semantic web presents several challenges, including semantic interconnection, reasoning, and intelligent data integration. The study of semantic reasoning focuses on two main aspects: refining rules when constructing ontologies to reveal implied relations and balancing the expression of semantic relations with the complexity of ontology construction, as well as increasing efficiency and accuracy during the design and implementation of systems. This paper concentrates on enhancing the efficiency of semantic reasoning by building a prototype system that utilizes description logic reasoning as a subsystem to conduct semantic reasoning. Future work aims to explore the construction mechanism of semantic reasoning rules within ontology construction, integrating these rules with system design and implementation to serve as a reference for various knowledge service systems in the future.
