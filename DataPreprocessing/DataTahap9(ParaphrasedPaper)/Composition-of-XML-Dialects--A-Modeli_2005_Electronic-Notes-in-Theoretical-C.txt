This research paper explores the application of software composition and transformation to domain-specific languages used in the modeling and simulation of physical systems. Specifically, the paper focuses on the composition and transformation of the modelica language, targeting the modelicaxml dialect, which is the XML representation of the modelica language. By extending the compost concrete composition layer with a component model for modelica, the paper provides composition and transformation of modelica. The design of the compost extension is presented along with examples of composition programs for modelica.

Modelica is an object-oriented modeling language used for modeling complex physical systems across multiple domains such as mechanical, electrical, electronic, and hydraulic systems. It follows a component-oriented approach where components can be interconnected to form complex systems. In order to access the structure of a model, modelicaxml has been developed as an XML representation of the modelica language.

The paper is structured as follows: the next section provides an introduction to modelica, modelicaxml, and compost. Section 3 presents the compost extension and its usage through various examples of composition and transformation programs for modelica. The conclusion and future work can be found in the final section.

The translation of modelica into modelicaxml involves serializing the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the modelica code as XML using the modelicaxml format. The validation of modelicaxml is done using the modelica.dtd document type definition (DTD). This XML representation simplifies the generation of documentation and translation to/from other modeling languages.

The paper also discusses the use of XML technology in software engineering, citing examples such as the smarttools system, which uses XML technologies to automatically generate programming environments tailored to specific XML dialects representing the abstract syntax of desired languages. Additionally, it mentions the use of abstract syntax trees represented as XML for aspect-oriented programming and component weaving, as well as the exploration of transformations on modelica code like meta-programming by the OpenModelica project. The paper underscores the potential to further extend and test the framework by supporting composition for advanced domain-specific languages like modelica.

The paper also delves into the layers of the compost framework, discussing the transformation engine layer, the concrete composition layer, and the uniform composition layer. It highlights how compost can be utilized to prepare components to fit into component models of stage 2 and 3 and discusses the mapping of boxes (templates) to their specific element types in the modelicaxml representation.

Concrete examples of the framework's usage are provided in the paper, demonstrating its application in composing modelica models, designing libraries, and addressing constraints based on domain knowledge.

Overall, the paper provides insights into how software composition and transformation can be leveraged for domain-specific languages, particularly in the context of modeling and simulating physical systems, and lays the groundwork for future research and development in this area.
