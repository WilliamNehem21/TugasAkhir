The presence of software bugs necessitates a significant investment of software developer resources, leading to financial losses. As a result, substantial research efforts have emerged to address software bugs, yielding innovative tools and methodologies. In the realm of real-world software development, there has been particular progress in the implementation of preventive approaches aimed at averting the introduction of bugs, such as bug prediction, static checking, and automated testing.

This paper introduces a machine learning-based classifier designed to predict the type of fault associated with a bug based on its textual bug report. This ML-based approach seeks to encapsulate a small aspect of the knowledge and experience typically associated with debugging tasks. Anticipatory information about the underlying fault type can assist less experienced developers in selecting appropriate debugging strategies and tools.

The paper conducts a user survey to establish a baseline for human performance in classifying the fault type of bugs based on textual reports. It then presents preprocessing steps tailored specifically for bug reports and applies ensemble learning techniques to the classification problem. The paper evaluates the performance of various classical ML algorithms, preprocessing steps, and ensemble approaches, including an assessment of their effectiveness in an inter-project context.

The paper goes on to discuss the challenges associated with using NLP approaches for bug reports and compares its approach to related work, such as ML-based bug analysis focused on fixed bugs and root cause prediction from code changes. It also provides an overview of existing bug classification schemes and discusses the performance metrics used in the evaluation.

The paper concludes with an acknowledgment of the limitations of its current approach, emphasizing the need for further research in this direction. It also highlights the potential of its approach to support researchers in creating bug benchmarks for experiments on specialized debugging tools, and makes its datasets and implementations publicly available for use by other researchers.
