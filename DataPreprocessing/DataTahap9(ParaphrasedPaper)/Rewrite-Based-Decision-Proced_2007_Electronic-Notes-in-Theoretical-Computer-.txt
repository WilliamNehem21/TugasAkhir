The study demonstrates that the inference system exhibits modularity in terms of termination. This modularity was shown by introducing the concept of variable-inactivity: if the combined theories are variable-inactive, a strategy based on sp will terminate on their combination, provided that it terminates on each individual theory. Contrary to the common expectation that a generic theorem prover would be outperformed by more specialized systems such as cvc([6,15]) or cvc lite(), experimental results show that such procedures are highly efficient on several problems.

The next phase of the research aims to explore the generalization of the rewrite-based approach to t-decision problems, or the determination of t-satisfiability of quantifier-free formulae. One potential method being investigated is the integration of rewrite-based t-satisfiability procedures with a SAT solver, as previously done in [7,10,2,12,5]. Additionally, the research will explore whether rewrite-based theorem-proving strategies can serve as t-decision procedures themselves.

Definition 2.3 states that a literal is strictly flat if its depth is 0, and for a clause c, maxd(c) is the maximum depth of terms appearing in c. A clause c is considered flat, or strictly flat, if all its literals meet this criterion.

Definition 3.2 introduces the concept of ordered flatness, defining a clause as ordered flat if it only contains strictly flat literals except for one, denoted as l da r. In addition, it stipulates that r < l, and r must contain only function symbols appearing in l.

Finally, definition 3.6 describes weak flatness, asserting that a clause is weakly flat if it only contains literals with terms of depth at most 1, along with at least one non-ground literal l da r that is not strictly flat. Furthermore, if the clause contains a literal x da t, then t is of depth 0.
