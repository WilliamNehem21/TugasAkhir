Systems biology utilizes various languages and formalisms derived from mathematics and computer science to construct models and investigate intricate biological systems in terms of their components and interactions. A formal representation and comprehension of the fundamental laws of life serve as the foundation for all biological research. The potential impact of systems biology on the development of new therapies and drugs is briefly mentioned here.

The complexity of biological systems necessitates the establishment of multiple modeling languages operating at different levels of description, such as different space and time scales. It is crucial to compare and integrate these languages within a comprehensive framework that facilitates the sharing and analysis of information from diverse perspectives.

One approach could involve implementing a control process within the system, where the reactants would only communicate with the control process, which would acquire information from the reactants and issue commands in return. However, this introduces significant complexity due to the multitude of communications and stochastic rates involved, making both the reactants and reactions active participants.

To simplify the approach, the focus shifts to modeling the passive reactants as arguments of messages exchanged via a memory channel. The messages contain information about the quantities of the reactants within the system.

A declaration is made for a polyadic channel called "mem," which facilitates instantaneous exchanges without any rate, aligning with the goal of inducing stochastic behavior during the execution phase.

In summary, the structural aspect of the approach is compact and modular. Moreover, the models' complexity should not be contingent on the quantities of the reactants, as the approach emphasizes chemical reactions over reactants. Additionally, the kinetic behavior is explicitly specified in the delay rates, which depend on the reactant concentrations.

Several case studies are presented, and their simulation results are compared using the approach described. Notably, the classical molecule-centric approach is unable to model the brusselator, as it involves ternary reactions, which the described approach easily accommodates.

The repressilator, a biological system comprising three genes, is introduced, with a focus on the use of passive reactants and active reactions, injecting an external perspective into an internal framework without altering the language's structure. This was achieved by translating chemical reactions into delay transactions based on their chemical significance. The presented approach aims to address the limitations of pure chemical-based models, such as ODEs, in formal analysis contexts.

Ultimately, the primary objective is to achieve a deeper understanding and integration of various formalisms, particularly in translating ODEs and hybrid automata into process algebra. The need for an external point of view becomes evident for translating global constraints, and work has been conducted to provide continuous semantics for biocham and to translate SCCP programs into hybrid automata.
