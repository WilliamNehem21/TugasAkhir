On the other hand, the ccmf technology has been introduced in ref. to enhance signal quality and improve internet experience within high-speed railway environments. Results have indicated significant improvement following the implementation of ccmf technology compared to other technologies. This technology is deployed on trains and other large vehicles, where the ccmfs are connected to. 

To address the above issue, there are several potential solutions that can be discussed. One approach involves adjusting the transmission power when the train enters the overlapping area between the serving enb and the target enb. This strategy aims to delay the handover process by increasing the transmission power of the serving enb, thereby preventing premature handovers until the train gets closer to the target enb. Subsequently, the target enb starts increasing its transmission power, while the serving enb decreases its transmission power to facilitate a smooth handover process. 

It should be noted that dropped calls/packets may occur due to inadequate resources to accommodate the incoming mf and its ues. Passengers on the train may be individually connected to the t denb via direct links, and the connection quality depends on various factors such as vpl, path loss, and the train's speed. 

The probability of dropped calls is a critical performance indicator used by service providers to measure system quality of service (QoS). Factors contributing to an increased number of dropped calls include vpl within train carriages, path loss, and shadowing, where obstacles absorb power and cause penetration loss. Moreover, the path loss is a result of power dissipation from the transmitter and the effects of the propagation channel. 

High-speed trains (HSTs) are considered a cost-effective and efficient means of transportation, and providing internet connection within train carriages is integral to the future of public transportation and networks. Despite the challenges associated with this solution, the implementation of ccmf technology is seen as a promising approach to providing internet connections within train carriages.
