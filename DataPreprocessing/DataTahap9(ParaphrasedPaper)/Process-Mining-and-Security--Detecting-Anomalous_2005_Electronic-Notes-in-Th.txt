Driven by the widespread presence of event logs within transactional information systems (such as wfm, erp, crm, scm, and b2b systems), process mining has emerged as a vibrant area of research [5,6]. Historically, the data within these event logs was seldom leveraged to analyze the underlying processes. The objective of process mining is to address this gap by offering methodologies and tools for uncovering process, control, data, organizational, and social structures from event logs. Essentially, process mining seeks to diagnose processes by extracting knowledge from event logs. To date, process mining research has primarily focused on process discovery and enhancement. However, this paper is centered on the utilization of process mining in addressing security concerns.

Although the concept of process mining is not novel [2,5,7,8,13,23,24,26,29,33,36], the majority of existing techniques primarily concentrate on the control-flow perspective. Nonetheless, process mining is not confined to examining control-flow alone. For instance, in our work, we employ process mining techniques to construct a social network. For a more in-depth understanding of process mining, further details can be found in a special issue of Computers in Industry on process mining and in a survey paper. Regrettably, this paper may not fully encompass the breadth of work carried out in this domain.
