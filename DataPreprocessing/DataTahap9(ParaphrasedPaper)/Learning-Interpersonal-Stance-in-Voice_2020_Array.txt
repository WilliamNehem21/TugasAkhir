Understanding how people respond to various attitudes and the associated interpersonal dynamics is an area that lacks clarity. Timothy Leary's influential theory outlines eight fundamental stances and their interpersonal implications, making it valuable to comprehend our reactions to these stances for enhancing social and professional relationships.

In the context of a police interrogation training game, nonverbal cues like body posture, gestures, and facial expressions serve as measures for interpersonal stances. Findings from the study reveal that professional actors exhibit better proficiency in portraying these stances compared to non-actors. However, there is substantial difficulty in accurately depicting a stance, and observers often disagree on the interpretation of enacted stances. In linguistics, researchers have also examined interpersonal stances in written and spoken interactions.

Ranganath et al. have developed a system that identifies interpersonal stances through prosody, categorizing them into flirtatious, friendly, awkward, and assertive classes. The system uses prosodic, lexical, and dialogue features of non-acted prosody fragments and involves various analyses, including gender differences, comparative analysis of lexical and prosodic features, and more.

Other studies have concentrated on creating systems to train individuals in improving their interpersonal stance skills. For instance, a simulator-training game was developed to teach interpersonal stances using text inputs; however, the system's accuracy is limited, diminishing its training effectiveness.

The simulation-based training game consists of a software interface where users record voice samples, leading to the generation of unique voice models for each user. Data from 20 English speakers were collected, and the experiment included both experienced and non-experienced participants.

In conclusion, achieving the goal of positioning the computer status into the big green circle within two tries is crucial. Following the pressing of the "step 2 training" button, the software records the user's voice and sends the fragment to the server, which classifies the voice stance using a personal model and a svm algorithm.

It is challenging to build accurate models for classifying the eight basic stances, and teaching people to use these models is even more difficult. Future research should delve into understanding how individuals comprehend each category, investigating the relationship between stances in greater detail, and confirming the tendencies observed in the study. Furthermore, it is essential to determine whether people recognize interpersonal stances as distinct categories or group them into clusters during interactions and to ascertain the potential for improving interpersonal stances through simulation-based training games.
