The paper discusses the challenges of implementing parallel state-space exploration algorithms and the techniques to address the overheads associated with parallelization. Section 3 outlines the authors' approach to evaluating parallel state-space exploration algorithms, including methods for measuring and assessing overheads, as well as presenting results from real models. The paper concludes with a discussion of related work (Section 4) and the authors' conclusions (Section 5).

One of the major challenges in parallelizing state-space exploration algorithms is determining how to effectively implement a parallel algorithm. The choice of languages and libraries for parallelization can significantly impact the performance of the parallel algorithm by influencing overheads. For example, the use of Java resulted in high synchronization overheads for memory allocation and garbage collection, prompting the switch to C for implementation. Therefore, language selection can have significant time and effort costs if it impedes parallelization.

Selecting a suitable architecture is also crucial when parallelizing a state-space exploration algorithm. The availability of hardware, such as multi-processor, multi-core PCs, larger shared-memory machines, and PC clusters, presents both opportunities and challenges for performance evaluation. Additionally, operating system choice and tool support further influence the parallelization process.

In addressing parallel overheads, techniques such as dynamic load balancing, specifically work-stealing techniques, have been employed to mitigate load imbalance caused by irregularity. However, implementing these techniques introduces overhead from extra code and synchronization, requiring sufficient parallel work for optimal spread across available processors.

The measurement of parallel overheads and its reflection on the algorithm's performance is a key issue that has not been adequately addressed in the literature. The authors note that the estimation of overheads may not provide an accurate measurement of their true impact on a parallel algorithm, calling into question their contribution to an objective evaluation.

The paper addresses the measurement of parallel overheads for different types of overheads, and underscores the impact of the model on the severity of the overheads. The authors stress the importance of considering the underlying model and its influence on parallelization efficiency and the techniques used to address overheads for future optimizations.

Furthermore, the paper introduces three model profiles for analyzing the performance of parallel overhead techniques, allowing for a quantitative comparison of different techniques and an understanding of how model characteristics can challenge the effectiveness of these techniques.

The authors highlight that previous work on parallel state-space exploration has mainly focused on networks of workstations, with limited exploration of run-time overheads. Their unique approach includes a thorough evaluation of the parallel algorithm's overheads and a carefully selected benchmark of its runtime performance.

Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive examination of the challenges and techniques associated with parallelizing state-space exploration algorithms, offering valuable insights for future research in this area.
