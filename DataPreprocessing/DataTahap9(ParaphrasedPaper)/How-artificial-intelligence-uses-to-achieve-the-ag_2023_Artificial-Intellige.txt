Addressing the growing demand for food production and ecosystem security poses a significant challenge. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) models in sustainable agriculture has garnered increasing interest due to their potential to meet this challenge. Researchers have proposed various AI models for agriculture functions, including prediction, weed control, resource management, and advanced crop care. This systematic review article evaluates the use of AI models in agriculture functions, as well as their application in achieving sustainable objectives. The review also discusses considerations and limitations for implementing the next generation of sustainable agriculture using AI technology.

AI has emerged as a key area of research, offering solutions to reduce labor, optimize resource utilization, and promote sustainable business practices. The rapid technological advancement has led to the development of different AI approaches aimed at addressing existing agricultural challenges and improving productivity.

Current labor-intensive crop care practices rely heavily on chemical inputs, resulting in high production costs and environmental pollution. AI-based robotic disease detection systems have been designed to identify infections and optimize fertilizer application, thus addressing disease management and ensuring safe and nutritious food production. Additionally, machine learning (ML) techniques have been utilized for plant measurement, growth estimation, and classification, while artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep learning (DL) have been employed for various applications, including plant recognition and disease detection.

Weed infestation significantly impacts agricultural productivity by competing with crops for resources. The review suggests the extension of robust weed recognition approaches by incorporating additional data capturing conditions and sampling techniques, such as synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN).

The use of AI technologies for natural resource management has contributed to increased global crop yields, addressing the challenge of conserving natural resources. These technologies have focused on soil health, water quality, and biodiversity conservation while enhancing agri-food productivity with minimal environmental impact. To further improve crop water productivity, advancements in AI technology are necessary, particularly in irrigation technologies and decision support tools integrating weather, soil, and crop information.

In conclusion, AI has shown significant promise in addressing the complex challenges of sustainable agriculture, with applications ranging from disease management and weed control to natural resource conservation. Continued research and development in AI technologies are vital for achieving sustainable agriculture objectives and ensuring food security for a growing global population.
