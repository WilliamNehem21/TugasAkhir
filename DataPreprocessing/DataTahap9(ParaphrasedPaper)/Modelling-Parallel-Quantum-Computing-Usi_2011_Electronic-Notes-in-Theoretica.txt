This academic paper delves into utilizing ensemble methods to achieve additional acceleration, in addition to the quantum parallelism that arises from employing superposed quantum states. It discusses how a form of classical single-instruction-multiple-data parallelism is achieved in the Parallel Quantum Computing (PQC) framework by operating quantum systems (molecules) in parallel, akin to classical computation. The paper highlights that the PQC's state preparation method sets up the entire state so that a subset of qubits represents the communicating quantum computers in a mixed state, while the remaining qubits in a pure state serve as the proper argument registers for each quantum computer. The authors demonstrate that the PQC leads to increased acceleration for significant quantum algorithms such as Grover and Shor, particularly facilitating significant speedup for unsorted database searches.

The paper also observes that the organization of the PQC state aligns with the concept of multithreading programming. It draws a parallel with multithreading, where a process entails multiple execution threads operating independently and potentially sharing a common memory area. Notably, from a computational standpoint, the quantum state within the PQC, existing in a Hilbert space, is interpreted as global, allowing all quantum computers in the PQC to share a common global memory area.

The central concept of the PQC involves running numerous parallel copies of quantum systems within the ensemble. The objective, akin to classical computation, is to achieve enhanced acceleration by executing tasks in parallel. By concurrently running identical quantum computers, tasks such as unsorted database search can be substantially accelerated.

This approach is referred to as parallel quantum computing, wherein multiple quantum computers operate in parallel. While the computation itself can be consistent across all molecules, the databases, represented by different molecules, may vary.

The paper also touches upon the concept of atomic execution and memory transactions, emphasizing the need to ensure that an atomic block guarantees certain conditions when accessing shared variables. Additionally, it briefly reviews state vectors as monads, the density matrix approach, and how superoperators can be incorporated into the concept of arrows, within the context of the functional programming language Haskell.

The paper proposes a global quantum state that can be accessed and manipulated by all parallel or distributed processes, aligning with the requirements for coding the multithreading PQC presented in a previous section. The utilization of superoperators is noted to significantly aid the processes in accessing small portions of the state.

Finally, the paper discusses a procedure using the Quantum State Teleportation (QST), outlining a method to organize the state within the QST for sharing a quantum state between different processes. It particularly highlights that the first qubit inside the QST serves as an identifier, indicating if the state pertains to Alice or Bob.
