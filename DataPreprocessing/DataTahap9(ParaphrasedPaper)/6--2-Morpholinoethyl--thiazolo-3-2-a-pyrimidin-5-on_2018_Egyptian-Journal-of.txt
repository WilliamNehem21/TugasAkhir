After observing the effectiveness of biologically active compounds against cancer [6,7], our interest was piqued in assessing a range of thiazolo[3,2-a] pyrimidin-5-one derivatives with different substituents at the 3-, 6- and 7-positions to identify potent anticancer agents. Our focus centered on evaluating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, an intracellular signaling pathway pivotal in regulating cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis [8,9]. We were motivated by numerous studies targeting the therapeutic potential of the PI3K pathway in cancer and the development of inhibitors targeting PI3K and its isoforms, protein kinase B/Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).

Drawing from a US patent on thiazolopyrimidine compounds with anticancer activity, particularly PI3 kinase inhibitory activity, our research sought to combine a morpholinoalkyl moiety with the thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-5-one series, aiming to potentially inhibit PI3K and consequently elicit noteworthy antitumor activity. We introduced the morpholine ring to enhance water solubility, and the attached group was designed to protrude from the binding site and be exposed to the surrounding aqueous environment.

To synthesize the compounds, dimethylformamide (DMF) was stirred at room temperature until the reaction was deemed complete, as monitored by thin-layer chromatography. Upon completion, the reaction mixture was poured onto crushed ice and treated with an excess of aqueous sodium carbonate solution. The resulting precipitate was isolated by filtration and washed with water, yielding a pure product for practical use.

Subsequently, the compounds underwent testing in 10-dose IC50 mode with a 3-fold serial dilution starting at 100 μM using PI-103 as a positive control (with a starting concentration of 20 μM) and employing a 10 μM ATP concentration. Nonlinear regression analysis was utilized to assess the efficacy of the compounds. Additionally, kinase activation assays were conducted using radioactivity and Echo550 technology in order to evaluate the compounds' impacts on kinase activity.
