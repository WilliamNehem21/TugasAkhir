The usage of web services is a well-established form of service-oriented computing, with the ability to combine existing services to create custom, complex applications. Orchestration, which involves bringing together separate web services in a consistent manner to create higher-value services, is a key aspect of this approach. The Business Process Execution Language for web services (BPEL) is widely recognized as the standard for defining the business logic that governs the interaction of processes in an orchestration.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an introduction to the syntax and semantics of the BP-calculus, and Section 3 presents the behavioral properties of the BP language. Section 4 details the verification framework, which is then used in Section 5 to verify an example and present the results. Finally, in Section 6, the paper concludes and suggests future research directions.

The paper offers an extensive analysis of the behavior of web services, employing terms, messages, and various rules to define and model their behavior. It also outlines a verification process that iteratively checks and corrects processes and formulas until the system is validated. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the practical feasibility of the proposed approach with an illustrative example involving the placement of a share sale order by a customer via a broker service and other composite services.

The paper includes descriptions of an event handler and a fault handler, detailing the activities and channels associated with each in order to demonstrate how they are utilized within the web service architecture. The process of validating desired properties is also discussed, with a focus on how to modify the specification if certain properties are invalidated to ensure that all favorable properties are accepted.

Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive examination and validation of the proposed approach for web service orchestration, offering insights into how to automatically generate BPEL code once the desired properties have been validated.
