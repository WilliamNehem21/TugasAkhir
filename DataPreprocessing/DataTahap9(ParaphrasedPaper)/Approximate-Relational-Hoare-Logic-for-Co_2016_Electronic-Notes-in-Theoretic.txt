The approximate relational Hoare logic (APRHL) is a formal verification logic designed for determining the differential privacy of databases programmed in pWhile. Nevertheless, it directly addresses discrete random samplings. This paper introduces the graded relational lifting of the subprobabilistic variant of the Giry monad, which characterizes differential privacy, and integrates it into APRHL to handle continuous random samplings. It provides a generic method for establishing proof rules of APRHL specifically for continuous random samplings.

In the context of continuous APRHL, the paper primarily expands the proof rules for relation compositions and the frame rule, and devises a generic method for formulating proof rules for random samplings. By incorporating these new rules into APRHL+, the paper offers a formal proof of the differential privacy of the above-threshold algorithm for real-valued queries.

A key modification from the original definition involves altering the domain and codomain of "c" from n to r and from a discrete probability space to g(rn), respectively. This modified definition is applied to interpret pWhile programs, where the input and output spaces can be other types. The essentiality of this modification in describing and confirming the differential privacy of the above-threshold algorithm is underscored, as it involves sampling from the Laplace distribution over the real line.

The paper also revisits and reformulates the categorical semantics of the pWhile language, with the language being constructed in the standard manner. Throughout the paper, the categorical semantics of a probabilistic language as outlined in prior research is primarily referenced.

Additionally, the paper presents a general approach for formulating rules for random samplings and demonstrates the soundness of the proof rules in previous studies—specifically those pertaining to the Laplacian mechanism, exponential mechanism, Gaussian mechanism, and Cauchy distributions—by instantiating this method.
