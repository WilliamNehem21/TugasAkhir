Research on the effectiveness of pedagogical animated visualizations (PAVs) has yielded varied findings, with some notable results emphasizing the importance of student engagement with visualization tasks over the visual content presented in PAVs. Hundhausen et al. reported that student effort dedicated to visualization-related tasks was more influential than the specific visual materials displayed. They also identified gaps in research in certain areas.

In a move to move beyond passive viewing of PAVs, Naps et al. developed a taxonomy that classified different modes of interacting with PAVs, known as the engagement levels taxonomy. They proposed a hierarchical structure in which increased engagement was expected to lead to educational improvements.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 details the study conducted, the types of papers included, and their surveyed characteristics. Section 3 outlines successful experiences categorized by the engagement levels where improvements were observed. Section 4 analyzes these experiences from two different perspectives. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions and future work.

Upon reviewing published experiments, it becomes evident that mere visualizations may not suffice to achieve educational enhancements. Indeed, significant studies suggest that the manner in which students utilize visualizations is more crucial than the content presented. Additionally, successful experiences have been noted in the provision of high-quality content alongside visualizations, advanced manipulation interfaces, or the inclusion of visualization sessions in regular classes.

Kann et al. conducted a comparative study among no viewing, viewing, constructing, and viewing and constructing experiences. However, they only observed notable improvements between viewing and no viewing groups, making it the sole experience without textual or narrative content.

Three studies at this level compared responding with the no viewing level. The first two experiences detected improvements in knowledge acquisition and were supported by supplementary narrative content. While Byrne et al. utilized a basic algorithm animation, the instructor provided the students with questions.

Lawrence investigated the impact of changing input data to animations compared to no viewing and viewing levels. In the comparative study with the no viewing level, she found improvements in knowledge acquisition, where the animations included narrative content and students engaged in an additional lab session. She also compared this level with the viewing one and once again observed improvements in knowledge acquisition without additional features.

Finally, Urquiza-Fuentes studied the impact of the same construction approach in a long-term evaluation, comparing the constructing level with viewing and no viewing levels. Improvements in attitude were observed in both comparisons, along with enhanced knowledge acquisition when compared with the no viewing level.

Clearly, learning can be enhanced with PAVs. 75% (18/24) of the experiences identified improvements in terms of knowledge acquisition, with more than 20% (5/24) detecting enhancements in attitude towards the materials used or the subjects affected by the study. Additionally, programming skills were shown to improve in over 8% (2/24) of the experiences.

Upon examining successful engagement levels investigated, there are two extremes. Changing is the most studied level, comprising 37.5% (9/24) of the experiences, while presenting is the least with 12.5% (3/24). Responding is evident in 20.8% (5/24) of experiences, and both viewing and constructing are present.

The construction interface is crucial when students create their own animations. Therefore, providing carefully designed interfaces or allowing students to select their own construction kits has been shown to be effective. Encouraging students to produce their own textual or narrative content has also shown positive results, with most improvements noted in attitude towards materials and subjects.

The no viewing level implies the absence of PAVs. Transitioning to the viewing level can lead to improved knowledge acquisition, especially considering the availability of numerous PAV collections. However, if one desires to create their own PAVs, the inclusion of narrative and textual content should be taken into account.

Advancing to the constructing level could enhance attitude and, as a secondary benefit, knowledge acquisition. Once again, the construction process should be straightforward, and narrative content should be integrated into the animations. It can be paired with the presenting level to improve knowledge acquisition, though students should have the freedom to select their own construction kits.
