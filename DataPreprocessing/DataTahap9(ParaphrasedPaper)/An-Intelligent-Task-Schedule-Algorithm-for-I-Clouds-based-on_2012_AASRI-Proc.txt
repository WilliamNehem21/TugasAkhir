Clouds form an environment that facilitates the sharing, selection, query, and aggregation of geographically dispersed resources for addressing large-scale issues. Consequently, devising a resource scheduling mechanism becomes a complex challenge. In this study, we examined various well-known scheduling methods introduced by Nimrod-G, a renowned computational economy framework for managing resource supply and demand. We present a novel scheduling algorithm centered on deadline and cost optimization, which extends the traditional cost and time optimization approaches while maintaining an optimal level of performance.

We developed a simulated experimental platform using GridSim on the Linux operating system. In the experiments, we generated 100 jobs, each requiring 90 seconds for processing, and each experiment entailed 10 processing queues with access costs ranging from 10 to 28g$/CPU time. The optimal deadline was determined to be 10 jobs per queue. During the simulations, we considered three deadline variations: 990 seconds (the optimal deadline plus 10%), 1980 seconds (twice the optimal deadline), and 2970 seconds (three times the optimal deadline).

From the results, we observed that, in contrast to cost-optimal and time-optimal strategies, the deadline and cost optimization algorithm (STPP) strikes a balance between time and cost. If a zero value is selected, then STPP functions as a cost-optimal strategy. Additionally, STPP encompasses more quality of service factors compared to the cost-optimal and time-optimal strategies.

We also varied the budget from 5000g$ to 22000g$ in increments of 1000, and found that, similar to the earlier comparison, the deadline and cost optimization algorithm (DCOA) compromises between time and cost. When a zero value is chosen, DCOA functions as a cost-optimal strategy and incorporates more quality of service factors compared to the cost-optimal and time-optimal strategies.

In the future, we plan to integrate resource reservation and various economic models into resource allocation, allowing us to compare the efficiencies of different economic models. Additionally, we are considering credit evaluation, job preemption, and job migration policies aimed at achieving the integrity of market transactions.
