The paper introduces team automata as a formalism for specifying reactive, distributed systems in a component-based manner. These automata allow for flexible coordination patterns among systems, extending the capabilities of i/o automata. The authors also present a process calculus tailored for team automata, where each automaton is described by a process that is bisimilar to the original automaton. This mapping is denotational and preserves the correspondence between coordination patterns and operators defined on processes.

The paper extends classical results on i/o automata to team automata and discusses the compositionality of team automata. It is shown that while certain team automata are compositional, not all coordination patterns exhibit this property. The paper also presents a way to obtain the language of a team automaton from its components, thereby enhancing modularity in component-based system design.

Future work in this area includes extending the calculus with parallel composition operators to accommodate various synchronization patterns for team automata. The distinction of actions into input, output, and internal actions in team automata also needs to be taken into account to address compositionality for different types of team automata. Additionally, further research is needed to study the complexity of the algorithms introduced in the paper, such as the cost of checking bisimilarity between automata and obtaining the language of a team automaton through its translation into a process.
