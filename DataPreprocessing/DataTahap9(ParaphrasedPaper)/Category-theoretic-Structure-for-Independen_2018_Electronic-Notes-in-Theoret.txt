The concept of independence and conditional independence appears in various fields, including probability theory, statistics, database theory, and modeling of concepts such as region disjointness for heap memory. This paper aims to establish a unified category-theoretic structure that encompasses these different forms of independence and conditional independence. The proposed structure is intended to support the expected reasoning principles for these notions and to identify associated notions of independent and local independent product. The paper also provides a foundation for future research on logics of dependence and independence and discusses specific conditions and constructions related to independence structure in various categories. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of the proposed category-theoretic structure in various examples and highlights its relevance to computer science.
