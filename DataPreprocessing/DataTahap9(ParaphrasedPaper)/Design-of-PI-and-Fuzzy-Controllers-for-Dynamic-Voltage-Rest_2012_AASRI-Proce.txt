The issue of power quality has become increasingly important in today's society, particularly with the proliferation of advanced electronic devices that are highly dependent on stable power supply. To address this issue, custom power devices such as the dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) are utilized. The DVR is recognized as a cost-effective and efficient solution for improving power distribution networks due to its compact size, affordability, and rapid response to disturbances. This study focuses on the modeling, analysis, and simulation of a DVR using MATLAB, with a specific emphasis on both PI and fuzzy controllers.
