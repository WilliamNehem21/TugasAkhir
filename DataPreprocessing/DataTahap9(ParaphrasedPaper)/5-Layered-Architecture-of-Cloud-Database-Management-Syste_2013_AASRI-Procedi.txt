The emergence of cloud database management systems represents a recent development in the field. However, there is currently no standardized architecture for these systems within the cloud. This paper proposes a five-layered architecture framework for cloud database management systems, addressing key considerations at each layer. The first layer, referred to as the external layer, focuses on user-centric concerns such as manageability, transparency, and security. The second layer, the conceptual middleware layer, deals with the interoperability challenges arising from the presence of heterogeneous databases and clouds. The third layer, the conceptual layer, addresses programming techniques, transaction management, query processing, and optimization. The fourth layer, the physical middleware layer, tackles interoperability issues related to diverse platforms. Finally, the physical layer handles data storage and accessibility, addressing concerns such as data security, storage, backup, load balancing, partitioning, scaling, elasticity, fault tolerance, and replication.

To harness the fault tolerance, heterogeneous cluster support, and user-friendly capabilities of MapReduce, while also leveraging the efficiency, performance, and tool flexibility of shared-nothing parallel database systems, a hybrid solution is required. This integrated approach is expected to significantly impact the cloud database market. The architecture of cloud database systems is organized into a three-level hierarchy comprising the cloud data centre, cloud service provider level, and client level.

Within this framework, manageability involves the administration of various users, monitoring their usage of the cloud database management system, and determining user payments based on their usage. Additionally, it is responsible for maintaining payment records and generating reports. Transparency, on the other hand, aims to provide users with visibility into the system, including the physical placement of data, fostering the development of real-time applications and facilitating flexibility and mobility.

Security is a primary concern at the conceptual layer, focusing on preventing unauthorized access, data disclosure, and data manipulation. The application of multilevel security policies is a key aspect of this layer. Partitioning, another important consideration, aims to balance and share the load across cloud environments, thereby enhancing performance, scalability, and availability in a multitenant setting. The decisions on horizontal and vertical partitioning for cloud data are addressed at this layer.

In summary, this paper introduces a comprehensive five-layered architecture for cloud database management systems, elucidating the functions and challenges associated with each layer.
