The local algorithm described in this paper, as outlined in a previous section, has a broad range of applicability beyond just total domination. An essential outcome by Hoppen and Wormald found in this paper serves as a critical tool that enables the transfer of a result derived in the context of random graphs (Theorem 1.2) to the context of large-girth (Theorem 1.1).

During each round, pairings are made involving at most 2d vertices. In order to confirm (ii), we initially calculate e[x(t+ 1) x(t) ht] for each variable x. Notably, the conditional expectations within our process can be computed based on gt, rather than the entire history ht. We are able to demonstrate that...
