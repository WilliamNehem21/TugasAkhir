The following definition introduces the set of valid expressions for given sets of algorithms f and r. This set is denoted by exp(f, r) and represents the construction of a message through the application of deterministic algorithms to bitstrings, which may be randomly generated or chosen by the principals.

The first message always returns an encryption of the second message; the attacker's goal is to determine which. The intuition behind ind-cpa security lies in the idea that, for a polynomial-time observer, the encryption function reveals nothing about the underlying plaintext. A precise definition follows.

The subsequent theorem formally captures this intuition by expressing ind-cpa security in terms of probabilistic statements. It utilizes the well-known fact that an asymmetric encryption scheme is not ind-cpa secure if an attacker can compromise its ind-cpa security with only one query to the oracle. The result is stated using the same notational conventions as mentioned above.

Example 3.7 demonstrates the representation of an attack on a 6-round version of DES using the well-known differential cryptanalysis technique within our model. The set of algorithms and associated probabilistic statements are used to estimate that, through encrypting 200 pairs of plaintexts, an attacker can guess 30 of the 56 key bits with a probability of 0.65, based on the distribution of maximum entropy. A simplified description of this technique using our framework is presented in the appendix, while a detailed description of the attack can be found in [reference].

In section SA, we provide an intuitive description of the result: assuming A has knowledge of the messages exchanged in the network and the cryptographic primitives used, A can correctly uncover the bitstring corresponding to the expression e with a non-negligible probability.

As mentioned in the introduction, this work aims to bridge the gap between symbolic and computational approaches to the analysis of security protocols. This line of work has been widely explored, with different proposals addressing this problem from various perspectives. Some proposals include the inclusion of algebraic properties of cryptographic functions in the model, formal models for analyzing guessing attacks, and computational validation of cryptographic assumptions. The comparison of our approach with other proposals in the literature, including extensions of the dolev-yao model and information-theoretic approaches to security, will be an important area for future research. 

The sum on the right-hand side is telescopic, and the left-hand side is non-negligible by hypothesis, thus the right-hand side is also non-negligible. The assumption that q and bf return an answer in polynomial time for every possible input is necessary here, since we are running these algorithms with inputs that would be impossible in the original setting.

Example 3.7 (Cryptanalysis of DES): In this example, we demonstrate the representation of an attack on a 6-round version of DES using the well-known differential cryptanalysis technique within our model. A detailed description of the DES encryption scheme and this cryptanalysis technique can be found in [reference]. For simplicity, the security parameter is ignored in this description.
