Key tools for the professional development of nurses extend beyond traditional seminars and symposiums, encompassing training and workshops that include simulations. Such experiences are essential in enhancing nurses' competencies and expertise in delivering safe, high-quality healthcare. During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses globally played a critical role as frontline healthcare workers. In a specific study, 120 nurses from a hospital in Saudi Arabia were randomly assigned to two groups for exposure to high-fidelity simulation (HFS) and virtual simulation (VS) sessions. These sessions were divided into different phases involving simulation and debriefing. The nurses' skills were evaluated before and after the simulation sessions using an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) with a reliable assessment mechanism. The results indicated that simulation-based training significantly improved nurses' knowledge, critical thinking, and expertise in clinical practice. The study highlighted the importance of simulation programs in nursing education and emphasized the positive impact of HFS and VS on learning outcomes and skill enhancement. The researchers extended their appreciation to the healthcare professionals and educators who supported the study.
