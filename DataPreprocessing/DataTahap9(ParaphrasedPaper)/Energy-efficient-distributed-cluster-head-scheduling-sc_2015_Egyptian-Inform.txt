The system described in the paper consists of a large number of small wireless sensor nodes and a base station (BS). Each wireless sensor node contains a sensor, processor, memory, RF transceiver, peripherals, and a battery for power supply. These nodes are deployed ad hoc across a geographical area to detect events and gather data on various environmental conditions. The data collected in real time by the wireless sensor network (WSN) is utilized to design the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), a popular hierarchical routing protocol for aggregating and disseminating data to the base station. LEACH achieves energy efficiency by clustering nodes and operating in rounds, with each round consisting of a setup phase and a steady state phase. During the setup phase, sensor nodes are selected as cluster heads based on a random number comparison with a threshold value, and the responsibilities of the cluster heads include collecting sensed data, creating a time division multiple access (TDMA) schedule, and transmitting aggregated data to nearby cluster heads or the base station. Since the lifetime of a cluster head is short if it performs all these tasks, a new cluster head selection mechanism is proposed based on residual energy and communication distance between sensor nodes, as opposed to the standard mathematical coordinate system used in existing papers.

The paper also highlights the use of real-time experimental setup to estimate the distance between sensor nodes based on received signal strength indication (RSSI) values, which can be measured by radio modules such as IEEE 802.11 and 802.15.4. The proposed LEACH-centralized (LEACH-C) algorithm employs a centralized approach for selecting cluster heads based on energy level, whereas the Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed Clustering (HEED) protocol periodically selects cluster heads based on residual energy. However, the experiments are generally based on simulation results rather than real-time behavior. Additionally, the paper introduces a two-tiered WSN architecture where the base station designates primary and secondary tier nodes, and describes a Dynamic Cluster Head Selection (DCHS) mechanism for minimizing transmission distance between tiers.

The report is structured as follows: related work is discussed in Section 2, the network model and the proposed DCHS mechanism are detailed in Section 3, the experimental setup and results are presented in Section 4, and the conclusions and future enhancements are outlined in Section 5. Finally, the paper discusses cluster-based energy-efficient forwarding, RRD-based energy-aware intracluster routing, and the need for real-time experimental validation of clustering algorithms.
