The presence of resistance does not impact the signal, while the gravity differential pressure is directly related to the phase holdup. As a result, the method for pattern transition is universally applicable. By utilizing wavelet analysis to examine the characteristic parameters of the gravity differential pressure signal, it becomes possible to depict information relevant to the shift from stratified flow to annular flow. This, in combination with interphases force, can be used to scrutinize the driving force behind flow pattern transition. This research introduces a novel approach for understanding the management of gas-liquid two-phase flow motivation.

The fluctuating signal of gravity differential pressure perpendicular to the horizontal flow not only correlates with phase holdup but also serves as a reflection of interphases force. Through the extraction of characteristic quantities, it is confirmed that wavelet energy is responsive to the transition from laminar flow to annular flow. Furthermore, by analyzing the way in which characteristic parameters change with flow parameters and then coupling this with interphases force to investigate flow pattern transition motivation, it becomes possible to acquire the gravity differential pressure fluctuation signal easily and accurately. This represents a new method for identifying gas-liquid two-phase flow patterns that changes significantly along with flow pattern alterations.
