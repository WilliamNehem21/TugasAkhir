Bouzary et al. conducted an in-depth examination of service selection and composition in cloud manufacturing, categorizing their findings into six areas including objective functions, selection criteria, algorithm types, correlation awareness, mapping approaches, and dynamic composition. However, they overlooked the service selection problem within the IoT environment and failed to address quality of service (QoS) within the IoT architecture. Their study primarily focused on traditional QoS parameters and did not cover evaluation metrics for the proposed state-of-the-art approaches.

Hamzei et al. conducted a systematic survey of QoS-aware methods in the IoT environment, categorizing them into framework-based, model-based, service-oriented architecture (SOA), representational state transfer (REST)ful-based, and heuristic-based approaches. They identified six QoS factors for service composition approaches, but did not consider QoS factors specific to the IoT architecture. While providing discussions on the benefits and drawbacks of state-of-the-art approaches, they did not detail the methods for designing and evaluating service selection algorithms (SSAs).

Asghari et al. performed a systematic review of service composition approaches in the IoT, categorizing their findings across seven main categories. While they explored most QoS factors in IoT systems, they did not specifically address QoS factors based on the IoT architecture. Their study offered a detailed discussion on both the functional and non-functional aspects of QoS in IoT service composition, but it did not cover methods for designing SSAs or provide a comprehensive review of all QoS factors.

Aoudia et al. reviewed existing service composition approaches for IoT, assessing them based on dynamic composition and adaptation, protection and security protocols, and performance of service representations. They did not thoroughly detail all segments of the selection problem, such as dynamic composition, and did not provide a comparative discussion of the employed techniques. Furthermore, they overlooked discussing factors that affect traditional QoS or QoS in the IoT environment.

Dongre et al. explored QoS parameters for service composition and selection, focusing on nine QoS parameters at the application layer. However, they did not elaborate on the techniques or methods used to solve the selection problem.

To further discuss the research findings, our review paper is organized as follows. We present background information and necessary definitions in Section 2, followed by the proposed state-of-the-art classification method in Section 3. Additionally, we discuss the solutions for designing and implementing SSAs in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. Section 6 delves into the performance evaluations of SSA solutions, while the results and future research directions are examined in Section 7. We present our conclusions in Section 8, outline research limitations, and provide recommendations in Section 9.

Dynamic service selection involves selecting services during runtime, allowing for consideration of changes in service components. The proposed classification for the QoS architecture by Li et al. caters to the needs of the IoT environment, optimizing QoS across different IoT layers. Additionally, simulation and prototype methods are commonly employed to evaluate the performance of proposed algorithms.

In conclusion, these academic papers collectively contribute to the understanding of service selection and composition in cloud manufacturing and the IoT environment, shedding light on various methods and algorithms utilized. However, this area of research is dynamic and there is still potential to explore other optimization techniques and develop a comprehensive QoS dataset tailored to the IoT environment.
