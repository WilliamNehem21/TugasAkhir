As software systems continue to grow in size, the benefits of automated transformation tools become increasingly apparent. These tools empower machines to analyze and manipulate high-level source code, thus allowing for the delegation of repetitive programming tasks from human developers to machines, thereby reducing costs and development time.

Although many transformation tools can preserve comments, they often struggle to accurately replace comments in their original positions, potentially posing hazards for later maintenance activities, especially in scenarios such as protocol field identification.

One of the critical challenges in creating the LL-AST (Low-Level Abstract Syntax Tree) is ensuring that the representation is semantically correct. The use of conditional directives, such as #ifdef, #if, #elif, #else, and #endif, is particularly relevant to this issue. For instance, maintaining parallel branches in the LL-AST significantly increases the complexity of the transformation logic, making a case against integrating conditionals directly into the AST grammar.

Furthermore, the flexibility of symbol placement in code, where any input symbol can be replaced by any other symbol, results in a language that cannot be captured as a context-free grammar, as exemplified by the discrepancies between preprocessor-valid code and conforming C++ grammar.

Proteus, a tool for performing program transformations on LL-ASTs, expands macros while allowing transformations on their uses. It uses annotations on the LL-AST to indicate the result of an expansion and retains metadata for macros defined as null. However, there are challenges in dealing with include directives, which are treated as a symbolic replacement and may complicate the transformation process.

Proteus employs its own implementations of C and C++ grammars based on the language standards, written in Syntax Definition Formalism (SDF) and utilized as input to the SGLR parser. Additionally, Proteus incorporates comment-based metadata tags to record macro expansions, susceptible to disruption during the transformation process when layout is intelligently manipulated.

To construct the LL-AST, Proteus uses a transformation language called YATL (Yet Another Transformation Language), which provides abstractions known as super-types and includes parsing free-text for statement and expression construction.

The reconstructions of LL-AST fragments include the retention of existing layout whenever possible, maintaining consistency with the surrounding context to enhance accuracy in the reconstructed program text.

A separate tool, Recond, is developed to perform macro replacement and unmask conditional directives in the reconstructed program text. The merge tool combines transformed slices to produce a unified version while highlighting differences and introducing new changes only where necessary.

This paper has discussed the capabilities of the Proteus C/C++ transformation system and highlighted its successful application to a large volume of commercial source code. It is suggested that addressing practical problems is crucial for the advancement of automated transformation technology, paving the way for exciting opportunities in software engineering.
