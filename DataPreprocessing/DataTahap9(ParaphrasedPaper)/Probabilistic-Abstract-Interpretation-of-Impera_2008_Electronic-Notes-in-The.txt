In 1981, Kozen presented a method for defining the meaning of probabilistic programming languages using linear operators on Banach spaces. The approach involves representing a program as a linear map from an input probability measure (the joint distribution of its initial variable values) to an output sub-probability measure. Monniaux, Di Pierro, and Wiklicky extended the concept of abstract interpretation to handle probabilistic programming by employing different ideas, leading to probabilistic abstract interpretation.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes a simple imperative language with message passing, and Section 3 provides a concrete probabilistic semantics. Section 4 discusses the abstract interpretation framework, while Section 5 presents the abstraction and abstract semantics. The paper concludes with Section 6.

Expressions in the described context are always linear, and the paper argues that this does not limit expressiveness, as non-linear operations can be encoded using loops. By defining the language in this manner, it is suggested that only the abstraction of loops is necessary to capture non-linear behavior, thus eliminating the need for separate abstractions.

The paper suggests that allowing a variable to be compared with a constant simplifies abstraction, as more complex comparisons can be constructed by defining new variables. Furthermore, it states that conjunctions and disjunctions of conditions can be expressed through nesting if-statements, albeit inefficiently, and are not necessary as primitives.

The semantics of the program are described in terms of probabilistic automata, and the paper emphasizes the consideration of the data environment of a program, where variables are viewed as random variables with distributions that are transformed by the program's operation.

The paper discusses the application of classical abstract interpretation to the probabilistic setting, comparing measures using a strict ordering and exploring alternative approaches such as the probabilistic analogue of the Galois connection. It also touches upon the challenges of constructing an abstraction function and the limitations of domains in the probabilistic setting.

The paper concludes with a discussion of the abstract collecting semantics, and it addresses the challenges of computing measures for intervals and the need to improve the overall approach through larger case studies. It also highlights the aim of providing a formal framework for deriving stochastic models of communication protocols from source code using abstract interpretation.
