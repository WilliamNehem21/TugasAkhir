This paper introduces an abstract machine designed for the stochastic bioambient calculus, demonstrating its soundness and completeness with respect to a new stochastic semantics, and showing that it preserves the reduction probabilities of the calculus. The machine is integrated into an existing simulator for the stochastic pi-calculus. Recent research has focused on expanding the stochastic pi-calculus with components that capture the intricate spatial hierarchy of biological systems. The bioambient calculus and brane calculus were developed to model mobile compartments and mobile membranes, respectively. Just as with the stochastic pi-calculus, it is crucial for these abstractions to be accurately simulated in accordance with the principles of the Gillespie algorithm for practical usefulness. While a simulator for the bioambient calculus exists, there remains a substantial gap between the definition of the calculus and the implementation of the underlying simulation algorithm. The precision of the simulation algorithm is argued to be of equal importance to the calculus itself and should therefore be approached with the same rigor. The tree T comprises a list of all child ambients in the term, each associated with a global set of names Z and a global constant environment E containing process definitions. The syntax of processes P is constrained so that each choice C is associated with a corresponding species definition in the environment, enabling the grouping of populations of identical species. Theorems 3.14 and 3.15 ensure that the reaction probabilities of the bioambient machine align with those of the bioambient calculus, and vice versa, with the proofs relying on the correspondence of reactions in the stochastic bioambient calculus to those in the stochastic bioambient machine, and vice versa.
