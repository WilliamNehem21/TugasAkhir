Abstract:
This paper examines the adaptation of Arabic speech recognition systems for speakers with foreign accents, utilizing adaptation techniques such as maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR), maximum a posteriori (MAP), and a combination of MLLR and MAP. The LDC-Westpoint Modern Standard Arabic Corpus and HTK toolkit were employed for all experiments, with evaluation conducted at both word and phoneme levels. Results indicate that certain Arabic phonemes, notably pharyngeal and emphatic consonants, which are difficult for non-native speakers to pronounce, benefit from the adaptation process using the MLLR and MAP combination, resulting in an overall improvement of 7.37%.

Abstract:
The prospect of e-commerce and e-government hinges not only on individual acceptance of internet technologies for transactions, but also on the perception of the web as a reliable environment. In light of this, a comprehensive model elucidating the factors influencing individuals' acceptance of online transactions over the web was formulated and tested. This study seeks to integrate the established Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with three key constructs – trust, credibility, and risk – essential for predicting individual acceptance of online transactions.
