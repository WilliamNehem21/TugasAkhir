This study utilized a quasi-experimental research approach to examine the relationship between ICT maturity and value in the Nigerian service industry. After obtaining permission from 72 service firms listed on the Nigeria Stock Exchange, 28 firms consented to participate, with 23 ultimately taking part in the data collection process between April 14th and May 15th, 2015. The participating firms were predominantly from the banking sector, and respondents were spread across different managerial levels.

The findings suggest a negative-weak correlation between ICT maturity and value in the Nigerian service industry. In other words, an increase in ICT maturity within a service firm does not necessarily lead to higher ICT value, and conversely, lower ICT maturity does not necessarily lead to lower ICT value.

The study's main contribution to knowledge lies in clarifying the relationship between ICT value and maturity. It highlights that the benefits from ICT adoption and diffusion (ICT value) are not inherently linked to the level of ICT adoption and diffusion within a service firm. This insight may be valuable for policymakers, managers, and IT experts in understanding the implications of ICT adoption and diffusion in the service industry.
