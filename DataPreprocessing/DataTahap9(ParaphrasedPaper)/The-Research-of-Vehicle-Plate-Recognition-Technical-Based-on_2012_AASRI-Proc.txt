Regarding character recognition, following an examination of license plate recognition technology both domestically and internationally, we apply weighted statistics to emphasize the position of the plate in the image. Simultaneously, we employ a combination of thick grid feature extraction and the momentum backpropagation algorithm to differentiate license plates. This approach enhances the accuracy and speed of character recognition.

As societal and economic development, as well as the prominence of the automotive and transportation industries increase, road transport has become more significant than railway transport. However, the rise in motor vehicle usage has led to a surge in traffic congestion, prompting the need for automated traffic management. The intelligent transport system (ITS) emerged as an efficacious solution to this issue, originating from the Intelligent Transportation Society of the United States in 1990.

License plate recognition (LPR) forms a crucial element of ITS, particularly in the area of electronic billing. As a specialized computer vision system in real-time scenarios, the LPR system consists primarily of the subsystems for license plate detection and character recognition. This system traverses numerous domains including pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and digital image processing. Its capability to distinguish between license plate numbers, letters, and Chinese characters enables the computerized monitoring and management of vehicles.

Utilizing image processing technology, the ultimate aim of the LPR system is to ascertain the license plate number and color from the image. Directly extracting license plate characters from collected images is challenging. To address this, the general LPR software is typically divided into three modules: license plate location, character segmentation, and character recognition. License plate location involves determining the plate's position in the image, while character segmentation entails cutting out each character after positioning. Character recognition involves identifying the characters through segmentation.

Enhancing image contrast and stretching the contrast between the license plate and the background are imperative for image processing. To accomplish this, image enhancement is applied to grayscale images, primarily to enhance the definition of license plate contour lines. In this paper, we employ the gray histogram balanced method for image enhancement. With a grayscale image consisting of n levels, where the probability of each grayscale level appearing is represented by pi, it contains information content equivalent to.

License plate localization involves extracting the license plate from the plate image. In this paper, a weighted statistical method is utilized to emphasize the plate's position in the image.

Based on China's motor vehicle licensing standards, the country currently has three types of standard license plates to identify different entities: Chinese characters, English characters, and digits. This comprises 51 Chinese characters, 25 capital letters (excluding 'I'), and 10 digits, totaling more than 80 license plate characters of uniform size.

The backpropagation (BP) algorithm not only features input and output nodes but also one or more hidden nodes. When disseminating the hidden layer's output signal to the output node, the BP algorithm first propagates the concealed stratification spot forward, followed by the action function. After this, the network yields the output result. The excitation function usually selects the function: where n represents the input number, m denotes the output number, s signifies the concealed number, and c is an integer between 1 and 10. As such, there are 18 Chinese characters, 16 English characters, and 15 digits at the concealed level. The initial weight of the BP network is defined within [0,1], and the initial values of the learning factor and the momentum factor are respectively.
