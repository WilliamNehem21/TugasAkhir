The primary aim of this project is to develop algorithms for 3D path planning, navigation, localization, and mapping for micro air vehicles (MAVs) to enable autonomous navigation. Local planners based on waypoint and bezier curves have been created to facilitate successful navigation of MAVs across various environments. The proposed method introduces a navigation approach that can seamlessly switch between local planners by assessing the complexity of the environment.

One of the major challenges faced by MAVs is their limited computing and storage capacity. Therefore, it is crucial that the methods designed for MAVs have low processing complexity. Various methods in the literature are employed for path planning operations in MAVs, such as effective waypoint selection and assessing the planned path's effectiveness using a Bayesian approach. Path planning algorithms based on the A* algorithm are commonly used to plan a path to a destination while avoiding obstacles. These research efforts are generally based on the assumption of knowledge of the environment map, whether it is feature-based, grid-based, or graph-based.

Several studies in the literature have shown that navigation is often addressed in conjunction with localization and mapping, referred to as active SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). Various active SLAM studies exploring different types used on robot platforms have been compiled. Additionally, 3D mapping is essential for robot navigation, and mapping techniques using a single camera and an IMU sensor have been implemented. 

In this study, curves are generated based on selected control points, facilitating path planning for the path tracking module integrated into the control systems of MAVs. This method acts as a global planner within the navigation algorithm, effectively avoiding enlarging the search space. The study also involved the implementation of 3D mapping techniques, costmap extraction, and global and local route planning methods integrated into the navigation algorithm.

The designed navigation algorithm extracts a global cost map using octomap data, and local cost maps are calculated using MAV depth sensor information for navigation in dynamic environments.

The system produces a global path to a given goal using an A* algorithm based on local and global cost maps. The navigation module calculates two different cost maps: local cost maps using sensor data and global cost maps using octomap data.

The study demonstrates the use of multi-hop paths for reaching a target when a continuous path cannot be established with a single curve. Waypoints are pre-defined to reach the destination using a specific number of hops, and navigation routes are established using 2-hop or 3-hop methods.

The study presents scenarios where routes were found with 2-hop and 3-hop methods, highlighting the efficiency of the multi-hop approaches compared to traditional methods such as Dijkstra and A*. 

In conclusion, the study introduces new navigation approaches for MAVs and identifies future research areas for improving the efficiency of navigation methods.
