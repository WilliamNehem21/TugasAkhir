In this academic paper, the authors outline the approach for representing the odt (observability, diagnosability, and testability) problem as a single d-dnnf graph denoted as 'g'. They emphasize the importance of minimizing the size of the graph for efficient odt computation and propose a method for reducing the size of 'g' by focusing solely on the model counts for the test vectors rather than the actual observations. They demonstrate that 'g' can be projected onto its input variables, provided that the number of models is computed before they are lost through the projection.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the composition of a subgraph 'gs', which is made up of a set of 's'-subgraphs. The authors highlight the consideration of which children of an 'or' node should be included in 'gs' and introduce the concept of distinguishing ratio for such a node with children 'n1' through 'nj'.

The authors also present an evaluation of their dnnf-based testing method using a model of an automotive engine test-bed, which comprises three main components: engine, pipe, and throttle. Their aim is to identify leaks in the pipe by manipulating three to four controllable variables and observing three to four measurable variables. They describe the conversion of the problem into discrete instances of varying sizes through different abstractions applied to the original mixed discrete-continuous model, and the use of a direct encoding from constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) to satisfiability (SAT).
