Approximately 210 wells in Iraq were studied, with data including gas-liquid ratio, upstream/downstream pressures, chock size, production rates, and API oil gravity. The author conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the most suitable correlation for rate estimation. The findings indicated that the Gilbert's correlation provided a relatively accurate prediction of wellhead rates, while Achong's correlation underestimated production rates. Economides et al. (2011) noted the lack of clear description regarding the theory of multi-phase fluid flow through chokes, and Ghareeb and Shedid (2007) suggested a study to address this issue.

Zhong-Bao et al. (2011) proposed a neural network model based on the backpropagation learning algorithm for predicting surface oil rates. The neural network consists of one hidden layer and 10 neurons, with input neurons including well numbers, well coordinates, cumulative production, derivative of cumulative production, shut-in time, average distance to surrounding wells, and average cumulative production.

Elmabrouk et al. (2010) developed a neural network model to forecast reservoir average pressure without shutting down the wells. Elshafiei et al. (2011) introduced a neural network model for predicting crude oil production rates from multi-stage oil separators, with inputs based on initial and final temperatures for each stage and oil composition.
