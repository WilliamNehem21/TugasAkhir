The described approach involved designing a power farm to maximize energy extraction from the waters of western Sicily. The farm's size was selected based on experimental data on seawater energy density collected from a specific location in the northwest part of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea. The paper details the numerical analysis and optimization of this process.

The converters were simulated using a standard numerical inverter model. The parameters considered included the ripple in the DC link, the duration of each inverter's use, and the continuity of power generation. The simulation was conducted multiple times, with each generator being subjected to a specific set of waveforms. Each generator exhibited similar characteristics to those described above.
