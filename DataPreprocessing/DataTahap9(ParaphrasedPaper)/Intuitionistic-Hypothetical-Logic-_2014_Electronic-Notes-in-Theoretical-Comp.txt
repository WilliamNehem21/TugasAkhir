In section 2.2, one might question whether the plus operator in the implicative fragment can be eliminated while still maintaining realization of all S4 theorems. It is observed that this is feasible if non-injective specification sets and nonnormal realizations, as described in the terminology of LP and also in [5, sec.11.2], are permitted.

Furthermore, a basic intuitionistic logic of proofs is developed, introducing a modality of the form [u]]a for a proof variable u, along with a set of axioms over this modality. These, together with the axioms of IPC and MP, are proven to capture HATAutologies. The addition of operations on proof terms to this system, as described towards the end of the aforementioned work, results in a system that is proven to be arithmetically complete. It is suggested that developing a proof theory for this system could be a promising area for further research.

Other potential research directions involve the use of natural deduction presentations for fragments of first-order LP. While first-order LP is not finitely axiomatizable (although there are exceptions, see [23,8]), a type theory system resulting from this approach, albeit losing the connection with Peano arithmetic, could serve as the foundation for a logical framework with forms of reflection that are decidable. Additionally, efforts are currently underway to extend these findings to full LP, based on classical logic.
