Using borehole electrical-logging techniques to determine true-formation resistivity and estimate original hydrocarbon saturation is a crucial method in petroleum exploration. The use of joint inversion algorithms has been found to enhance log interpretation and reservoir evaluation. However, the nonlinearity of the limited measurement data poses challenges in finding a unique solution for the electrical-logging inversion problem, leading to approximate or estimated results rather than true values.

In logging inversion problems, the true reservoir parameters are typically unknown. Therefore, besides relying on prior information constraints, it is essential to evaluate the inversion solution, including the inversion algorithm. One common approach to assessing the reliability and efficiency of an inversion method is to evaluate it using artificial formations. Furthermore, the electric logging inversion problem is inherently nonlinear, but it can be transformed into a linear inverse problem using appropriate techniques, allowing for the application of evaluation criteria from linear inversion theory. This study assessed the stability and convergence of a joint inversion algorithm for the dual-induction log and dual laterolog devices using data-resolution matrix, model-resolution matrix, and condition number based on linear inversion theory.

The formation consists of the borehole, invasion zone, and undisturbed formation, which can be characterized by three parameters: true-formation resistivity (rt), resistivity of the invaded zone (rxo), and invasion depth (ri). A dual induction logging instrument, such as conventional dual-induction devices or high-resolution dual induction arrays, provides deep and medium-induction log values, while a dual laterolog tool, such as conventional dual laterolog tools or high-resolution dual laterolog arrays, yields deep and shallow lateral logging values. By simultaneously obtaining four logging data through the use of both the dual laterolog device and dual-induction tool during well logging, it becomes possible to inversely determine the three unknown formation parameters: rt, rxo, and ri.

Upon solving the increment x, new model parameter values are obtained, which are then used as input in the forward model to calculate logging responses and errors. The iterative process continues until the convergence condition is met. In the notation used, superscripts m and s denote the measurement and simulation results, respectively, while r1 represents deep-induction logging data rid; r2 denotes medium-induction logging data rim; and r3 and r4 indicate deep and shallow laterolog responses rld and rls, respectively.
