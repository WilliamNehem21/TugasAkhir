The level of expressiveness in a multiscale model is not determined solely by its multiscale nature, as it can vary based on the specific models incorporated for each scale and how they are integrated. Homogenization is a complex task when dealing with heterogeneous single-scale models or when different homogenization techniques are applied, potentially leading to information loss across scales. This issue is illustrated through the application of the micro-macro scheme to bone remodelling, a multiscale biological process where macroscopic behavior and microstructure mutually influence each other.

The Bioshape simulator, designed as a uniform, particle-based, space-and-geometry-oriented multiscale modeling and simulation environment, treats biological entities of any size as geometric 3D shapes, which can be basic (e.g., polyhedra, spheres, cones, or cylinders) or composite shapes. Each simulated entity possesses a specific 3D shape and behavior, and their interactions are defined using a combination of the shape calculus and Java programming. The shape calculus, a formal language that specifies the structure of 3D processes and their interactions, enables the creation of new 3D processes through the composition of shapes and behaviors. Additionally, Bioshape incorporates features such as communication services within 3D processes, information repositories, and representation of diffused species as concentrations.

Drawing inspiration from the cxa approach, the meta-model of Bioshape is expanded to encompass various coupling mechanisms. Specifically, the components necessary to execute a model and the main simulation loop are formally described, demonstrating how models at different scales can be interconnected and run together using a specific coupling scheme. Furthermore, a general graph of interconnected models is introduced to enable multiscale simulations.

A specific use case example is presented using the bone remodelling process, wherein a multiscale model is formulated in terms of the cxa and Bioshape approaches, leveraging the respective micromacro coupling schemes in both instances.

In the context of implementing the Bioshape meta-model, the simulator is designed to natively run a given model on various computational platforms, thus enabling the concurrent execution of multiple models on multiple nodes. A global coordinator software agent is responsible for ensuring balanced distribution of computations on the assigned platforms and regulating the pacing of the main simulation loop.
