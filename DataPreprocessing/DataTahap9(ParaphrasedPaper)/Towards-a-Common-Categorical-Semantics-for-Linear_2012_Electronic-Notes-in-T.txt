In section 3, we establish that fan categories serve as models for functional reactive programming (FRP). We demonstrate a connection between the time-dependent concept of truth in temporal logic and the time-dependent type inhabitance in FRP. Using categorical semantics, we elucidate the relationship between temporal modalities and the type constructors for behaviors and events, crucial concepts in FRP.

Moving on to section 5, we introduce variations of temporal modalities that pertain exclusively to the future. To reflect this in the semantics, we define ideal intuitionistic S4 categories. We establish a relationship between fan categories and ideal intuitionistic S4 categories, analogous to the result presented in section 4.

Behaviors and events are fundamental constructs in FRP for describing temporal phenomena. A behavior represents a time-varying value, while an event signifies an occurrence time with an associated value. The modalities 2 and 3 correspond to type constructors 2 and 3 for behaviors and events, respectively. This correspondence can be observed through the endofunctors 2 and 3, which model the temporal modalities and, consequently, the corresponding type constructors. For any object a, we defined 2a and 3a as...

The classical modal logic S4 corresponds to a class of Kripke frames with a preorder as their accessibility relation. Kripke models for temporal logics with a linear notion of time utilize totally ordered sets of times as Kripke frames. Thus, a Kripke model for such logic is also a model for S4. Similarly, we demonstrate the analogous connection in the case of intuitionistic logics and categorical models.

Lemma 5.4 and Definition 5.5 establish that every ideal intuitionistic S4 category gives rise to an intuitionistic S4 category. Notably, fan categories yield ideal intuitionistic S4 categories. We define ideal temporal functors of a fan category in a manner analogous to Definition 2.2 and obtain a result akin to Theorem 4.4.

While fan categories are quite concrete, we seek a more abstract categorical model for temporal logic and FRP in this section. Ideal intuitionistic S4 categories provide a promising starting point, but they fail to capture the concept of linear time. We enrich ideal intuitionistic S4 categories with additional structure to reflect the linearity of time, resulting in constructs called temporal categories.

Jeffrey presents an FRP implementation in the dependently typed programming language Agda and develops a category, Rset, which expresses the notion of time-dependent type inhabitance, closely related to our fan categories. Jeffrey also employs FRP analogs of advanced temporal operators to create variants of Rset that enforce causality of FRP operations.

In section 4, we discuss the relationships between our intuitionistic S4 categories and the categorical models by Kobayashi and by Bierman and De Paiva. Alechina et al. illustrate the connections of the latter with algebraic models and Kripke models.

Krishnaswami and Benton present an FRP semantics based on the category of 1-bounded ultrametric spaces, and Birkedal et al. study the related category of presheaves over the natural numbers. Both approaches employ a discrete notion of time, whereas our work is compatible with any totally ordered set of times. Exploring the connections between our developments and those of Krishnaswami and Benton, as well as those of Birkedal et al., remains a task for the future.

We have defined fan categories as categorical models of a subset of an intuitionistic LTL variant and a corresponding flavor of FRP. Fan categories directly capture the notion of time-dependent truth in LTL and the related concept of time-dependent type inhabitance in our FRP dialect. Additionally, we have introduced the more abstract notion of temporal category based on categorical models of intuitionistic S4 and demonstrated that fan categories are a specialization of temporal categories.

In a future publication, we aim to expand temporal categories to encompass other modalities of LTL and their FRP counterparts. Furthermore, we intend to investigate how recursion can be integrated into categorical models of FRP. We also plan to utilize concepts from temporal categories in the interface design and potentially the implementation of FRP systems. Moreover, we are interested in integrating temporal logic with other logical frameworks and exploring the corresponding programming paradigms. Another task is to explore the relationships with other categorical FRP semantics, as discussed in section 7.
