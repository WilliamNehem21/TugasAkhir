The primary aim of direct torque control for a squirrel-cage induction generator is to effectively regulate both the speed and torque produced by the wind turbine with high precision and no time delay. To achieve this, a feed-forward neural network is developed to estimate the actual speed of the machine using input variables such as rotor flux and stator current. The performance of the direct torque control system for the squirrel-cage induction generator in a wind energy conversion system is compared with conventional proportional-integral (PI) controllers and neural controllers. The control strategy and system modeling are elucidated using MATLAB/Simulink.

The implementation of direct torque control for the squirrel-cage induction generator in a wind energy conversion system, incorporating both PI and neural controllers, is carried out using MATLAB/Simulink. The wind energy conversion system comprises five key components, namely a constant-pitch and variable-speed wind turbine, an induction generator, a three-phase inverter, a direct torque control (DTC) controller, and a PI controller or a neural controller for speed regulation. The wind turbine functions as the primary mover for the induction generator, with a constant pitch angle of 45 degrees and wind velocity varying randomly between 0 and 20 m/sec.
