This research paper examines the energy efficiency of DC distribution systems. It establishes calculation models for the efficiency of feeders and loads, and analyzes the efficiencies of AC/DC, DC/DC, and DC/AC systems. Additionally, it calculates and compares the energy efficiencies of an AC system and two DC systems (monopole and bipolar), and demonstrates the efficiency improvement of an office building supplied by a DC power system compared to an AC system. The analysis reveals that the energy efficiency is higher in DC distribution systems than in AC distribution systems.

The energy efficiency index of power feeders primarily encompasses active power loss, transmission efficiency, energy loss, and the loss rate of feeders. The paper compares the calculation models of AC feeders, monopole DC feeders, and bipolar DC feeders, and states that the operating mode of a DC feeder is the metal loop operating mode.

It is assumed during the calculations that the losses of feeders in the building are neglected. Based on the calculation models of loads and daily load curves, the paper calculates the energy loss of the building and its main loads for one day, presenting the results in Table 3.

Through the calculation models, it is found that the bipolar DC feeder has the highest efficiency compared to the AC feeder and monopole DC feeder. The efficiency of the office building is also higher when supplied by DC power, with an increase of approximately 14.90%. The paper suggests a theoretical basis for implementing a DC supply system in office buildings in place of an AC supply system.
