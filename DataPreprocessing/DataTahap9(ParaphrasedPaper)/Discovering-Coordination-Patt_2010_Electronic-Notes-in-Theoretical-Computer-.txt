Many software systems rely on complex coordination logic to utilize third-party services or components. It is crucial to thoroughly capture and understand this layer of coordination in order to facilitate system verification, maintenance, development, testing, deployment, and integration. This paper introduces a method based on program analysis techniques, such as dependence graphs, program slicing, and graph pattern analysis, to extract coordination logic from the source code of legacy systems. The process involves predefined coordination patterns and special-purpose graph structures, which can be used to generate coordination specifications in various formalisms.

The concept of a system dependence graph has been extended to accommodate object-oriented features, with new representations introduced for program constructs such as partial classes and methods, delegates, events, and lambda expressions. This paper provides a brief overview of the structure of a system dependence graph, as it relates to the pattern discovery algorithm discussed in section 4.

The system dependence graph contains different types of nodes, and relationships established between these nodes represent various dependencies, such as control flow and method invocations. The graph also maintains visibility modifiers and connections between formal and actual parameters. The algorithm for pattern discovery involves traversing the graph pattern and constructing a list of candidate graphs, which are evaluated based on their ability to conform to the pattern.

The discovery algorithm facilitates the identification of coordination patterns within the source code, as illustrated by the asynchronous query pattern examples highlighted in the paper. The code details related to server operations and web service proxy setup are omitted for brevity, but are clearly identified in the paper.

By using the graph pattern discovery algorithm presented in section 4.2, instances of coordination patterns can be identified within the code, allowing for a better understanding of the statements involved in these patterns.
