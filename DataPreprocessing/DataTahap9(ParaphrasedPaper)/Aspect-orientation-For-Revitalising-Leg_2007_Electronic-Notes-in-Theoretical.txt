Business applications are specific instantiations of business processes and are highly vulnerable to changes in these processes. The increasing globalization and demand for connectivity between companies require the scaling up and integration of business applications. However, integrating different business models and their associated processes, as well as getting business applications to cooperate, presents significant challenges due to insufficient documentation and support for these applications. 

Using declarative methods, such as the use of language modeling and architectural descriptions, can enable the expression of business concepts and the architectural structure of business applications at a higher level of abstraction. By making these descriptions available for practical use, it is possible to encourage their development and understanding.

To enable the evolution of legacy systems, a thorough understanding of the systems is necessary, often requiring the use of reverse engineering techniques due to a lack of up-to-date documentation. Dynamic analyses, such as analyzing the dynamic run-time behavior of systems, offer one approach to this. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) can facilitate these techniques by applying tracing aspects to existing applications.

Despite the potential benefits, there are challenges in implementing AOP in legacy systems, such as difficulties in integrating with the build system and limitations in handling context-specific information and type specifications. Additionally, the use of AOP for revitalizing legacy software requires preparing the build system for these applications, which may rely on custom-defined and complex makefile hierarchies.

The use of dynamic aspects in investigating problematic statements and behaviors within applications can provide insights into the behavior of applications, verification of assumptions, and mining of business logic. Furthermore, aspect-oriented programming combined with language modeling allows for a flexible and powerful tool for investigation and recording of recovered knowledge.

In some cases, limitations in legacy systems, such as those in COBOL, can pose challenges to implementing AOP effectively, particularly when dealing with crosscutting concerns, such as the Y2K problem, due to limitations in the language's functionality and lack of typing support. Despite these challenges, leveraging AOP and language modeling can still offer benefits in addressing complex issues within legacy systems.

It is important to note that while AOP and language modeling present notable capabilities for addressing crosscutting concerns and investigating legacy systems, challenges related to weaving and language limitations need to be carefully considered in implementing these techniques effectively.
