In this paper, the authors propose the concept of a pseudo-commutative monad and a pseudoclosed 2-category, with the primary example being a 2-monad on the category of small symmetric monoidal categories. They establish that any pseudo-commutative 2-monad on this category has a pseudoclosed 2-category of algebras. In addition to presenting supplementary definitions and results, the paper provides further illustrations, including examples involving small categories with finite products, as well as examples related to wiring, interaction, contexts, and the logic of bunched implication.

The authors also discuss the interactions between various structures, particularly evident in work on linear logic and bunched implication. They delve into constructions utilizing symmetric monoidal structure, such as the consideration of free symmetric monoidal categories and the study of free symmetric monoidal closed categories. Furthermore, the authors seek to develop a calculus of symmetric monoidal categories with additional structure, subject to certain axioms. Such a calculus would explore the structure of the 2-category of small symmetric monoidal categories and strong symmetric monoidal functors, with the aim of determining whether this 2-category itself forms a symmetric monoidal category. This exploration is motivated by the desire to expand the range of available constructions, as demonstrated by examples widely used in computer science for modeling contexts, parallelism, and interaction.

The paper also compares its proposed definition with that of a closed category in the context of enriched categories, highlighting the primacy of the closed structure. It further discusses the limitations of its definition in capturing all the axioms applicable to the examples presented in the paper, and the challenges associated with incorporating additional axioms to address these limitations.

The authors' analysis of various examples and their investigation of the interplay between different structures, as well as the implications of their proposed definitions, offer valuable insights into the mathematical and computational principles underlying the study of symmetric monoidal categories and their applications.
