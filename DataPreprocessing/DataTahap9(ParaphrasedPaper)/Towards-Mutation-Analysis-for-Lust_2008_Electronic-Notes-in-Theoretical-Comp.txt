The paper introduced twenty-two operators, which were then grouped into eight classes and three levels (SAL, PDA, and CCA). Statement Analysis (SAL) involves replacing each statement with a trap 4, continue, or return (for subprograms), as well as replacing the target label in each goto and do statement. Predicate and Domain Analysis (PDA) includes taking the absolute or absolute negative value of an expression, replacing one arithmetic/relational/logical operator with another, inserting a unary operator before an expression, and modifying selective mutation by omitting the most productive mutation operators (n-selective) such as SVR (scalar variable replacement) and ASR (array reference for scalar variable replacement) for 2-selective mutation, and also omitting CSR (scalar for constant replacement) and SCR (scalar for constant replacement) for 4-selective mutation.

The work of Arditi et al. involved using Esterel and formal methods to enhance confidence in the functional validation of a commercial DSP as presented at the ERCIM Workshop on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems in Trento, Italy in 1999.
