Building service-oriented applications with services running on distributed platforms is notoriously challenging. Such applications require collaborative behavior among their services, leading to complex coordination. Therefore, constructing these applications relies on deriving an accurate coordination model that specifies the precise order and causality of their constituent services' actions. For instance, in an online banking scenario, a user can log into the system only after their account information, such as the account number and password, has been verified.

The proposed channel-based coordination model, Reo, utilizes complex coordinators known as connectors, which are compositionally constructed from simpler ones. The main concepts of Reo are summarized here, with detailed information available in [3,7,9].

Drain channels have two source ends and no sink end, meaning that no data value can be obtained from them. Synchronous drains can accept a data item through one end only if a data item is simultaneously available for it to accept through the other end, resulting in the loss of all accepted data. Asynchronous drains accept and lose data items through their source ends independently. Synchronous spouts are the duals to drain channels, featuring two sink ends.

Our next steps include automating the synthesis approach outlined in this paper. We already possess a suite of integrated visual tools, including graphical editors, animation and simulation tools, and model checkers, to support the coordination of components and services. We anticipate that our tool will be beneficial for the model-based development of service-oriented applications, aimed at assisting designers interested in complex coordination scenarios by enabling the use of UML SDS.
