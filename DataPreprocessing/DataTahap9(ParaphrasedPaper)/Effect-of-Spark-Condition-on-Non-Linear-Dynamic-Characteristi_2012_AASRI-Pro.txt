The increasing significance of environmental pollution and fuel reservoir concerns has brought attention to the advantages of compressed natural gas (CNG) as an alternative fuel. With its abundant resources and clean burning properties, CNG has garnered substantial interest due to its benefits such as knock tolerance, reduced CO2 emissions, improved homogenization capabilities, and decreased non-methane hydrocarbon emissions.

In the realm of SI natural gas engines, cyclic combustion variability is a prominent characteristic. The elimination of cyclic combustion variability is projected to result in a 10% increase in engine power output. Despite its importance, the challenge of minimizing cyclic variability remains unresolved. Consequently, the generation mechanism, source identification, and elimination of cyclic combustion variability have emerged as crucial issues in SI engine technology engineering. J.B. Heywood has identified three key factors that influence cyclic combustion variability, namely aerodynamics during combustion in the cylinder, mixture composition near the spark plug, and the quantities of fuel, air, and recycled exhaust gases supplied to the cylinder.
