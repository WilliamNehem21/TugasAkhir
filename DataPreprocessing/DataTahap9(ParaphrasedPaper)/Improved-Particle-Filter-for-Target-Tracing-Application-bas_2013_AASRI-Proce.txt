Most practical target tracking systems involve maneuvering targets, yet many existing tracking algorithms are linear filters, which introduce more estimation errors. As a result, there is a growing interest among researchers in maneuvering target tracking algorithms. One such approach is the particle filter, which has been developed for estimating the states of nonlinear systems. This paper presents an enhanced particle filter designed to address maneuvering target tracking problems. However, practical application of the particle filter requires significant computational resources. To mitigate this, the Chinagrid system employs agile and distributed federations to reduce computation time, enabling fast resolution for particle filter computation in target tracking applications. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of this approach.

The main challenges in target tracking involve refining estimation procedures to accurately determine the target's position from noisy measurement data, as well as predicting the target's position in the future to form forecasting windows. The key issue in target tracking is to estimate the states of the moving target, such as position, velocity, and acceleration. Most target tracking algorithms are based on Bayesian theory, with the Kalman filter and particle filter being popular Bayesian filters for target tracking due to their probabilistic nature.

The particle filter uses a large number of particles to approximate the posterior distribution for the target, drawing inspiration from Monte Carlo simulation theory. While this approach can improve tracking performance, its computational demands are high. Only by using a large number of particles can the particle filter achieve better estimation results for complex target tracking, necessitating a large and highly efficient architecture.

Grid technology facilitates the extensive sharing of computing and storage resources by virtually allocating computational tasks to distributed machines. Therefore, the issue of computational limitations in particle filter for maneuvering target tracking can be addressed by leveraging a grid framework. This paper proposes a framework for particle filter in maneuvering target tracking, based on the Chinagrid system, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex target tracking through simulation.

The paper presents an improved particle filter based on the Chinagrid framework for maneuvering target tracking systems, and simulation results confirm that the algorithm effectively addresses maneuvering target tracking problems. Additionally, the Chinagrid system provides the necessary computational resources for handling large particle computations, making this technology valuable for practical target tracking systems.
