The tms320vc5509a offers three high-speed, full-duplex, multi-channel buffer serial ports (MCBSPs), each supporting up to 128 channels at speeds of up to 100 mb/s. The MCBSP provides a direct serial port within the tms320vc5509a digital signal processor (DSP) or between the DSP and other devices in the system, enabling direct connections with other c55xx DSPs, industrial standard codec ports, and other serial devices such as ADCs and DACs. Each MCBSP has a different number of DSP channels and pin connections.

This study describes the development of an underwater acoustic speech communication system using half-duplex and low-power consumption based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) technology. The paper analyzes the theory and key aspects of OFDM and utilizes low-power operational amplifiers and A/D and D/A converters in the hardware design. Additionally, the system employs AMBE-2000 for speech coding compression and the tms320vc5509a DSP for speech signal modulation and demodulation. The feasibility of the underwater acoustic speech communication system based on OFDM technology is demonstrated through testing in a pool.
