This research paper introduces a new metric called "workflow critical path" (WCP) for comprehensive high-performance computing (HPC) workflows and presents a prototype tool named "Crux" for calculating WCP. The paper describes how the Crux tool is used to efficiently calculate WCP and evaluates its performance using simulators to simulate HPC workflows and workflow patterns in a cloud-based test environment on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The results suggest that Crux can be effectively used to calculate WCP, making it a promising diagnostic metric for assessing an entire workflow.

The Crux tool provides an API for building workflow process activity graphs (PAGs) and computing WCP, as well as a user interface (UI) for visualizing WCP data. The prototype of Crux can be deployed in the cloud using Amazon Web Services or locally using Docker.

The paper addresses the challenge of exposing traces at a level of granularity that end-users, such as Facebook engineering teams, can understand. To overcome this, the paper presents a solution called "Canopy," which constructs a modeled trace of events as higher-level representations of lower-level performance data. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a graph database, Neo4j, which offers algorithm support optimized for the database and provides tools and support in its ecosystem.

The paper also describes the Crux UI, which visualizes critical path data in the Crux database, allowing for the visualization of program activity graphs, critical paths, and metadata like workflow runtime. It also provides user authentication and profile features.
