The academic paper discusses the simulation of ubiquitous nets and mobile synchronizing nets without identifiers using ordinary Petri nets. The paper focuses on the expressiveness of mspn systems with identifiers and introduces abstract mspn systems with fresh identifiers. It also presents several decidability and undecidability results for reachability and coverability problems in these models. In particular, it establishes that reachability and coverability are decidable for mspn systems, but submarking reachability is not. For abstract mspn systems, coverability is decidable, but reachability is not. The paper is organized into sections, which give an overview of mspn systems, present reachability and coverability issues, and conclude with future research directions.

An mspn is a colored Petri net with three different color types for localities, identifiers, and black tokens. The paper imposes conditions on transitions and places in the nets to ensure their functionality and to avoid the simulation of ordinary counters. The paper also presents a mechanism to obtain authentication using labeled natural numbers to abstract from specific cryptographic techniques.

The paper concludes with discussions on the scalability of the proposed approach, modifications required for open environments, and the development of an alternative version of the operational semantics to accommodate potential environments. Additionally, the paper outlines plans to study the model in the presence of alternative primitives for interaction between components, such as broadcasting, and to extend the model with recursive primitives. The authors also intend to define an abstract version of the open semantics and continue their investigation in this area.
