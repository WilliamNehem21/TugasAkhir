The use of diverse sensor nodes has been proposed as a means to improve the lifetime and reliability of networks. Furthermore, it has been suggested that deploying heterogeneous nodes is more cost-effective than deploying homogeneous nodes, especially for large-scale applications. However, the optimal deployment of such nodes remains a key objective of this study.

In previous work, the authors utilized Voronoi diagrams and introduced solutions that make use of heterogeneous mobile and static sensors to reduce network costs. However, these solutions were limited by the constraints of Voronoi diagrams, as they only work with the same sensing and communication ranges, thus restricting their applicability to heterogeneous nodes.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of related works, while Section 3 presents the assumptions and proposed geometrical foundation. Section 4 discusses the proposed relocation strategy, and Section 5 provides detailed descriptions of the basic operations of the strategy. In Section 6, performance comparisons and simulation results are presented to evaluate the designed parameters of the proposed strategy. Finally, Section 7 concludes and emphasizes future work.

The paper also suggests deploying a combination of static and mobile sensors to reduce network costs, with mobile sensors moving to cover any gaps in coverage using Voronoi diagrams. However, such an approach may consume additional energy due to the sensors moving to multiple positions before reaching their final destination. This issue was addressed in another study, where dynamic clustering was used to reduce the number of movement rounds and efficiently move sensors to their final destinations. Nevertheless, this solution is not applicable to heterogeneous sensors, especially those with different sensing ranges, as Voronoi diagrams are designed for identical sites.

The paper proposes an adaptive relocation strategy (ARS) to efficiently deploy heterogeneous sensors for large-scale applications. The ARS strategy involves designing a geometric model to identify coverage gaps and uses four types of announcements to plan communication among sensing nodes.

The operations carried out by the deployed sensors differ depending on their characteristics. For instance, mobile sensors perform the sweep radius and boolean polygon operations, whereas static sensors perform the sweep radius operation and additional operations when chosen as leaders. The time complexity of these operations varies, with the triangulation operation having a higher complexity.

The proposed strategy's performance is compared with existing distributed strategies for mobile sensors, demonstrating that the ARS strategy achieves high coverage performance with less average moving distance and appropriate communication cost for heterogeneous sensors.

The study also evaluates the proposed strategy's performance under various network metrics, including the percentage of coverage improvement, average moving distance, and designed announcements cost. Additionally, different fitting methods are introduced, such as fitdis, fitcov, and fitsdr, for fitting mobile sensors to midpoints based on proximity, coverage, and score-to-distance ratio, respectively.
