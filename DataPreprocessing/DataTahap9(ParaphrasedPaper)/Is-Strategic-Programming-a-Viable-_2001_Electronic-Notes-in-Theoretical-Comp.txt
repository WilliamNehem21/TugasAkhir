In Algol 60, call-by-name parameters of procedures deviated from the standard innermost evaluation order. In the case of a call-by-value parameter of a procedure p, the value of the actual parameter is computed once and used throughout the execution of the body of p. However, in call-by-name, the value of the formal parameter is determined by evaluating the value of the actual parameter expression at each occurrence in p, similar to outermost evaluation. This technique, known as Jensen's device, has been used successfully in numeric applications for the successive computation of an expression for different parameter values.

It is noteworthy that the backtracking-based execution models described have been superseded by more limited, declarative mechanisms in certain domains. For example, in string matching, declarative syntax definitions and implementations based on parser generation are now more common. Similarly, in logical programming, more controlled paradigms are being explored.

In the context of theorem proving, axioms and proof rules are provided, and the problem is to prove or refute a potential theorem. The order in which proof rules are applied is an integral part of the problem solution, and expressing this order in the form of a strategy (also known as a "tactic") is very natural. This is relevant for both automatic theorem proving (the strategies guide the prover) and interactive theorem proving (the strategy records decisions taken as a result of user interaction). Additionally, it is true that an individual proof step may involve a complex computation.
