The authors of this academic paper discuss the challenges that arise when creating control software for embedded systems used in consumer electronics. They focus on control tasks in television systems, where devices in the same signal path need to be coordinated. This coordination creates a strong dependence on the hardware topology, which can change in new products and even during the development of the same product. To address these issues, the authors propose allowing components to communicate using horizontal communication interfaces in addition to vertical control interfaces. This means that components controlling individual hardware devices have input and output ports that mimic the hardware and communicate through them.

The paper also discusses concurrent activities within the system, such as a loop occurring concurrently with the blanking operation between two components. The authors explain that explicit notation for concurrency is unnecessary on the live sequence chart (LSC) when the concurrent activities involve different components. However, if a component were participating in both activities, the authors suggest using coregion notation (dotted vertical lines around concurrent messages) with the true-concurrent interpretation. The paper indicates that a more in-depth discussion on coregions is provided in section 3.

The concepts described in the paper are demonstrated using an example from embedded software for consumer electronics products. The interactions between components were initially modeled using Live Sequence Charts (LSCs) and then formalized using snapshots generated from the LSCs. Additionally, the authors aim to use the mandatory behavior described in an LSC as the basis for their component model, which is discussed in other publications. [7,8].
