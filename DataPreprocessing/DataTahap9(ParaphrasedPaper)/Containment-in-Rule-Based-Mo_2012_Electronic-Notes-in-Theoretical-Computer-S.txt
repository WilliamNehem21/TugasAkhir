Lately, there has been significant interest in utilizing rule-based modeling approaches, such as the kappa modeling language, as a means to tackle the combinatorial complexities inherent in numerous biochemical systems. These approaches have facilitated the development of various novel static analyses, thereby prompting a need to broaden their expressivity. In this article, we build upon previous work that assigned a rewriting semantics to kappa, by incorporating containment structure to model the different ways in which biological mixtures are partitioned and enclosed by membranes.

Two prominent examples of the rule-based approach are kappa and the bng modeling systems. Considerable recent efforts have been devoted to applying techniques based on kappa to handle the combinatorial complexity of biological systems, thus advocating for an expansion in the expressivity and applicability of the rule-based approach to encompass more complexly-structured systems.

The partition of biological mixtures is of critical importance due to the significant divergence in concentrations and chemical behaviors exhibited by different compartments. Additionally, the cell frequently utilizes concentration gradients across membranes. Furthermore, the location of a reaction significantly impacts the system's evolution. Notably, these structural arrangements are not static, as new compartments can form, be destroyed, or merge with existing compartments.

Given the complexity of actual eukaryotic cells, any simple formalization necessarily involves approximation. In kappa modeling, the existing approximation describes biochemical networks as operating within a single well-mixed solution, where no statistically significant structural properties affect the probabilities of specific particles interacting. We also outline how our containment structure dynamics can be integrated with kappa, allowing for the application of stochastic elements to create a model with both stochastic chemical and structural expressiveness. Finally, we provide an overview of current and future work based on this new model.

Kappa has been the subject of numerous papers, and it offers a means to model the state of a well-mixed solution through complexes of agents. Each agent represents individual proteins or molecules and possesses functional sites that can form binary links with other sites. The dynamics are defined through rules, which locally describe the solution's behavior by detailing the effect on any collection of agents that match a specified test pattern.

The overall development pattern for our semantics involves establishing a category of structures to represent kappa states and rule patterns, along with introducing partial mappings and distinguishing classes of matchings and action morphisms. Rules are then modeled using action morphisms, and the application of rules is defined as matchings from the left-hand side of the action morphism into an object representing the mixture. We also demonstrate that the pushout of the action morphism against this matching always exists. A similar pattern will be followed in defining our compartment modeling structures.

Biological systems exhibit remarkable complexity in structure and arrangement, and a common simplifying pattern is desired to form the basis of our model. From this perspective, the cell (or subsystem of interest) is viewed as a set of regions, each of which may contain other regions recursively, assuming the contents of each region are well-mixed and obey standard mass action dynamics. We model one compartment being contained within another through a notion of containment on regions.

We employ a constrained form of partiality for our actions, where maps must be total on all regions while not necessarily preserving the containments between regions. This choice, combined with the rest of the defined dynamics, ensures that the effect of a rule is confined to the region of the containment structure where it applies.

In conclusion, we have presented a natural, conservative extension to the semantics of kappa to include a simple dynamics of regions, as an initial step to enriching kappa as a biological modeling language to represent compartments. This extension opens up several potential avenues for future research.
