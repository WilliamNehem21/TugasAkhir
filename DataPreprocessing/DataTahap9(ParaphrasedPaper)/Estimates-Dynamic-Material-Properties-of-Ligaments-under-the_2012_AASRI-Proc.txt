Kastelic identified the collagen fascicle as the primary structural unit of tendons. Ligaments, which are passive tensile tissues, are mainly composed of water (60-80%), collagen, and elastin, with minimal ground substance that contributes to their unique mechanical properties. The collagen fibrils in ligaments are organized in long strands parallel to the loading axis to fulfill their functional role. When ligaments are subjected to load, the bending angle of the crimp structure of collagen fibers reversibly decreases, indicating that deformation of this structure contributes to its elasticity. Both the inherent elasticity of individual collagen fibrils and the crimp structure are believed to determine the overall mechanical properties of passive tensile tissues.
