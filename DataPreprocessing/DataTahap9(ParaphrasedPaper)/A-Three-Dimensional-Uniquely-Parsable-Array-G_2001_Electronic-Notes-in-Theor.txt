Yamamoto and Morita introduced a type of array grammar called uniquely parsable array grammar (UPAG), which is a subclass of isometric array grammar (IAG) and allows parsing without backtracking. UPAG can be used as an efficient mechanism for two-dimensional pattern recognition, and it also supports parallel parsing, making it suitable for formal parallel pattern recognition. This paper demonstrates the utility of UPAG in generating and recognizing three-dimensional patterns by constructing a UPAG capable of generating cubes of any size. This UPAG enables recognition of cubes in linear time relative to the length of their sides through maximum parallel reduction. Additionally, the paper presents a tool for designing three-dimensional IAGs to support this work.

Rosenfeld introduced isometric array grammar (IAG) as a formal model for two-dimensional pattern generation, and various subclasses of IAGs have been proposed and explored, such as context-sensitive array grammar (CSAG), context-free array grammar (CFAG), and regular array grammar (RAG). Despite extensive research on two-dimensional array grammar, parsing two-dimensional languages using IAG frameworks remains challenging. The paper presents a simple tool for designing IAGs and demonstrates its usefulness by designing a context-free IAG that generates rectangular parallelepipeds. Furthermore, a UPAG capable of generating and parsing three-dimensional patterns, specifically cubes, is constructed, allowing for linear time recognition based on the side length of the cubes.

Wang also presents a UPAG that generates and parses cubes, utilizing a special parsing algorithm, GCUBE, while adhering to the same framework as two-dimensional IAG. GCUBE satisfies the UPAG condition, enabling parallel parsing without backtracking.

This paper applies IAG to the generation and recognition of three-dimensional patterns, introducing a context-free IAG (GRP) for generating rectangular parallelepipeds and a UPAG (GCUBE) for generating cubes. GCUBE allows for linear time recognition of cubes based on the length of their sides.
