mor-trust is a decentralized trust management system designed for networks and applications involved in quantitative transactions or collaborations. It is unique in that it expresses trust in terms of monetary units, directly linking trust estimates to transaction values and outcomes. The system has been validated through simulation, demonstrating convergence towards small errors in trust estimates distributed throughout the network.

In contrast to centralized trust systems such as those used by popular platforms like eBay, mor-trust is purely decentralized and does not rely on a central organization or entity for maintaining and distributing trust information. Instead, trust information is securely distributed throughout the network and hosted on multiple nodes to achieve decentralization.

One of the key features of mor-trust is its focus on modeling trust in terms of quantitative monetary units, allowing for the development of algorithms to estimate, use, and propagate trust throughout the network. The system also implements the concept of ratcheting trust estimates, which allows trust to accumulate as a result of repeated successful transactions, potentially exceeding the actual transaction value.

Other distributed trust management systems, such as eigentrust and a Bayesian-based reputation system, employ different approaches for computing and aggregating trust values. These systems utilize a network-wide reputation value for each peer and maintain first-hand reputation information, respectively. Additionally, the trustme system emphasizes anonymity and uses a random assignment of trust-holding agent peers, with a focus on data management and trust reporting.

Furthermore, in mor-trust, transaction outcomes are represented as a numerical value reflecting the degree of success, allowing for a range of values beyond just complete success or failure. The system also employs a hybrid approach to network scanning and path creation, with the use of biased random walks and independent, non-intersecting paths.

Overall, mor-trust presents a decentralized approach to trust management that is designed to support quantitative transactions and collaborations within peer-to-peer networks.
