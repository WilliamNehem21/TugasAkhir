Deep learning methods offer several advantages for classifying mass spectra, including the ability to conduct parallelized signal correction and feature extraction. Deep metric learning models combine metric learning with the generalization power of deep learning to enhance feature extraction. Two popular models in this category, the siamese neural network (SNN) and triplet neural network (TNN), were utilized in this study to taxonomically categorize validated mass spectra corresponding to 30 species of neotropical arthropods in the Culicidae and Ixodidae families, some of which serve as disease vectors. Both SNNs and TNNs demonstrated high effectiveness in accurately classifying 826 spectra from 12 mosquito species and 310 spectra from 18 species of hard ticks, with minimal average loss observed during cross-validation. The SNNs achieved accuracy rates of 91.22% for ticks and 94.46% for mosquitoes, while the TNNs exhibited accuracy rates of 93% and 99%, respectively. These results indicate the practical utility of deep metric learning in rapidly and precisely classifying MALDI-TOF-generated mass spectra of neotropical arthropod species with public health significance.

Vector-borne pathogens in Panama, including mosquito-transmitted Plasmodium (e.g., malaria) and tick-transmitted pathogenic Rickettsia (e.g., Rocky Mountain spotted fever), necessitate the monitoring and elimination of vector populations. However, previous studies on Panamanian arthropod species have predominantly focused on a small subset of species, highlighting the need for broader research in this area.

Mass spectral features derived from MALDI-TOF experiments enable the identification of unique biomarkers characterizing different biological species. Previous studies in Panama have utilized MALDI-TOF for species identification within the Culicidae and Ixodidae families, which are known to harbor disease vectors. Deep learning represents an alternative approach to analyzing mass spectra, encompassing various techniques and algorithms associated with artificial neural networks (ANNs). These models leverage adaptive learning through nonlinear transformations inspired by the functioning of neurons in the human brain.

Comparing deep metric learning with traditional deep learning methods, deep metric learning emphasizes the determination of similarities between objects, irrespective of their preassigned labels, contrary to the approach of carefully studying defining characteristics of each class of objects. Notably, deep metric learning has not been extensively explored for the rapid identification of arthropods in the biodiverse neotropical region.

In this study, advanced feature extraction techniques based on deep learning and CNN were specifically tailored to work with mass spectra without preprocessing, aiming to enhance the classification of neotropical mosquito and tick species, some of which serve as important disease vectors. CNN architectures have emerged as prominent tools for image recognition, classification, and detection, comprising layers for convolution, pooling, and classification through ANNs. The use of the binary cross-entropy loss function in this context enables flexible comparisons, particularly advantageous in multiclass problems with numerous comparisons between classes, as seen in the case of arthropod species.
