The reptilian species exhibit a wide range of anatomical and functional diversity in their tongue structures, which are adapted to their feeding habits and environmental habitats. Additionally, the squamata tongue also serves other functions such as olfaction in combination with the vomeronasal organs. Some researchers have speculated that the tongue is adapted for both fluid and food transport.

Chameleonidae species are known for their high peristaltic movement used to capture prey, and their tongue length can exceed the entire length of their body. The lingual system of chameleonidae species consists of the hyoid body, lingual muscles, and other collagenous structures. The accelerator muscle generates significant power for contracting and projecting the lingual body.

Research has shown that the ballistic tongue apparatus in juvenile chameleons requires more feeding apparatus compared to adult chameleons. Juvenile chameleo calyptratus has been observed to have an increased tongue retraction time relative to their body size due to immature mouth closing until the tongue is fully retracted.

In terms of structural analysis, the chameleon tongue is composed of a fore tongue for capturing prey and a mid & hind tongue for exerting muscular force for elongation and grasping of prey. The mid-tongue region contains a central cartilaginous element, providing solidity during tongue protrusion. The surrounding connective tissue allows for greater contraction and sliding along the interior connective tissue, facilitating more protrusion of the tongue. The hyoid plays an integral role in tongue projection and is moved by a system of strap-like muscles attached anteriorly to the mandible and posteriorly to the sternum and shoulder.

The glandular structures in the dorsal lingual mucosa exhibit characteristic variations in alcian and periodic acid Schiff reaction, reflecting the diversity of acid mucins and glycogen derivatives. The increased number of mucous glands and their secretions all over the tongue surface facilitate prey capture and swallowing, while the moisture secreted by the lingual glands helps maintain the structural integrity of the lingual papillae and promote lingual muscle contraction.

Various forms of filiform papillae were identified, such as club-shaped, cubical, biforked, multibranched papillae, and finger-like structures, which aid in capturing and swallowing prey.

Although there is no obvious keratinization of the lingual epithelium, cytokeratin expression was observed in the epithelial cells of the dorsal lingual mucosa, particularly in the alveolar glands of juvenile chameleons. This overexpression of the antibody of stem cell factor suggests increased proliferation and differentiation of the lingual mucosa during the juvenile stages.
