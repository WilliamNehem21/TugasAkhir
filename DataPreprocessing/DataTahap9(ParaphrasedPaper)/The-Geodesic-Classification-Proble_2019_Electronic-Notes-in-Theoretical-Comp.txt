The paper discusses the geodesic classification (GC) problem, which concerns defining problems on graphs using geodesic convexity as an analogy for Euclidean convexity in multidimensional space. The authors propose an integer programming formulation for the GC problem as well as a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve it, and they conduct computational experiments to assess the efficiency of the proposed approach in combinatorial optimization and classification accuracy.

Supervised learning is described as the automatic prediction of unknown data behavior based on a set of samples. The two-phase procedure involves an initial training phase, in which a set of samples, each consisting of attributes and a corresponding class label, is analyzed to determine a mapping from all possible objects to a set of possible classes. In the subsequent phase, the mapping derived in the training phase is utilized to classify objects outside the sample set.

Outliers, misclassified objects within the sample set, pose a challenge to classification methods as they deviate from the underlying pattern of their class, affecting the accuracy of solutions. These outliers need to be identified and excluded for precise solutions.

The authors detail the methods and implementation used to solve the problem, as well as computational experiments performed on an Intel i7-7700 processor with 3.6 GHz, 8 cores, and 32 GB RAM running a 64-bit Linux OS. The algorithms were implemented in C++ and utilized CPLEX 12.8 as the optimization solver, incorporating separation procedures into CPLEX's default branch-and-cut method.
