The problem of determining the complexity of vertex coloring in graph theory has been extensively studied. It is known that the problem is NP-complete or solvable in polynomial time for most cases, with a few exceptions. One of these exceptions is the category of graphs that are free of the structures claw and 4k1. Further research has shown that vertex coloring can be solved in polynomial time for graphs that are free of claw, 4k1, and k5\e. This category is particularly important as it includes the line-graphs that are free of 4k1.

The line-graph of a given graph is a separate graph with vertices representing the edges of the original graph and edges connecting vertices that correspond to incident edges in the original graph. Beineke provided a description of line-graphs in terms of a set of nine forbidden induced subgraphs, including claw and k5\e. Given the association between graphs that are free of claw, 4k1, and k5\e with 4k1-free line-graphs, it is natural to inquire about the polynomial-time solvability of vertex coloring in graphs where k5\e is replaced by a different forbidden induced subgraph. In fact, we extend this question to a more general category that we define as "hole-twin," which includes induced cycles of at least a certain length.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the problem of vertex coloring can be addressed in polynomial time for graphs that are free of claw, 4k1, and hole-twin structures. It is known that vertex coloring is NP-hard for claw-free and 4k1-free graphs, and the complexity for graphs free of both claw and 4k1 is still unknown. We conclude our paper by leaving this as an open problem. This work is significant for its implications in graph theory, and we also discuss some potential future research directions. The main theorem is proven in Section 3, along with the necessary lemmas and ancillary results, while in Section 2, we provide background information essential for understanding our results.
