The advancement of FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission System) devices has been driven by the increasing capabilities of power electronic components. These devices are now available for high power levels and can be used in converters for high and even the highest levels of voltage. Initially, network elements that influence the reactive power or impedance of a portion of the power system served as the foundation for the development of these devices. Series devices are used to compensate for reactive power, and by influencing the effective impedance of the line, they can impact the stability and power flow in the system.

The results indicate that the STATCOM (Static Synchronous Compensator) enhances system performance during both transient and normal conditions, and is effective in controlling power flow in the transmission line. The addition of STATCOM leads to a reduction in fault current magnitude and excitation voltage oscillations. Maintaining an adequate "current margin" is crucial to prevent misfiring of the thyristor valves. In addition, the use of DC filters and AC filters not only helps eliminate harmonic effects but also reduces total harmonic distortion (THD). In systems with a conventional controller, the current waveform exhibits numerous peaks and troughs and suffers from prolonged oscillations, whereas a fuzzy controller enables the DC current to quickly return to its nominal value. The overshoot in the case of the fuzzy controller is slightly lower than with conventional controllers. For HVDC (High-Voltage Direct Current) transmission systems, it is more cost-effective to transfer more power when the power factor is close to unity and energy loss is minimized. STATCOM has demonstrated its flexibility in alleviating line congestion and facilitating more controllable flow in the lines. In a deregulated energy market, STATCOM could prove to be a valuable alternative for supplying additional power to load areas.
