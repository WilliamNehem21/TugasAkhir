The paper explores the synchronous product of two nondeterministic automata with fuzzy transitions. It also demonstrates that any set of fuzzy synchronous languages and the previously defined signature form a systematic algebra. Additionally, section 5 outlines potential areas for future research.

In the example mentioned in the introduction, the paper discusses the joint fuzzy flow of two reagents, where fuzziness in the flow reflects potential malfunctions in the control apparatus. To model the confidence values of execution, the paper assumes the structure g as discussed in example 2.6. As an illustration, if the machine releases the reagents c and m with certainty values of 0.95 and 0.93, respectively, this situation is modeled by taking the action corresponding to adding c with certainty.

Many of the results in the field of fuzzy languages are based on using either the real interval [0, 1] or a generic residuated lattice L to model the possible many-valued membership values. However, one of the key results of this paper, theorem 4.6, relies on properties provided by a specific characterization of a lattice ordered structure: the operator; of the parameter must be idempotent and commutative. The definition presented for h-nfa differs from the semantic structure used for membership values. While the original definition uses the unit interval [0, 1], the paper considers values from a more generic structure, a complete Heyting algebra.
