The process of verifying a concurrent system through model checking involves thoroughly examining the state-space linked to a finite state model of the system, and verifying whether a given temporal property holds at each state. As the number of system components grows, such as processes or channels, the size of the state-space associated with the model increases exponentially for realistic systems. This exponential growth can result in an unmanageably large state-space for systems with many components, making exhaustive search impractical within reasonable time limits.

To address the issue of state-space explosion, symmetry reduction techniques have been developed to exploit replication in concurrent systems. These techniques aim to alleviate the problem by taking advantage of the presence of identical processes in a regular system topology, such as a star or clique. By organizing the states of the system and leveraging efficient vector swap procedures, it is possible to swap process identifiers in parallel using vector instructions commonly found in modern processor architectures. This technique has been implemented in a tool called topspin, and experimental results demonstrate the speedups achieved by vectorizing symmetry reduction in two case studies running on the cell broadband engine processor.

An illustrative example is discussed, where a simple concurrent system is composed of eight client processes that exchange messages in a peer-to-peer manner. This system, referred to as the message passing system, represents the state of each client using an integer program counter and two variables storing process identifiers relevant to the messages being routed.

While the vectorization techniques presented are rooted in the basic approach to symmetry reduction, they are adaptable to more complex settings. More advanced techniques for computing replication have also been developed, involving the minimization of states with respect to chosen subsets. The application of the vectorization methods is demonstrated through an example illustrating how data types and operations can be utilized to implement a swap operation on a vector.

In one such example, a vector swap procedure is invoked to efficiently swap occurrences of certain elements in a vector, followed by the swapping of local states of client processes in the original state. It is noted that the observed speedups achieved through vectorization do not reach the theoretical maximum due to the significant contribution of memory copy and comparison operations to the computation time. These operations are more costly when performed on augmented states compared to standard states.
