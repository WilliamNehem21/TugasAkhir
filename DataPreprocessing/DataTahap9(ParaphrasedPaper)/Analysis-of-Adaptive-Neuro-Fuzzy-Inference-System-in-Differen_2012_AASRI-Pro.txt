The design of a fuzzy control system encompasses numerous design parameters, including scaling factors, membership functions, and control rules. Generating membership functions for fuzzy systems poses a significant challenge, as the performance of a fuzzy controller is highly reliant on these functions. Several methods have been proposed to optimize fuzzy membership functions over the years. However, control engineers face difficulties in accessing fuzzy controllers due to certain limitations.

A lab model for a temperature controller can be divided into five parts, with the system modeled using a chamber with a capacity of 0.5 litres. The chamber includes a heater coil at the water inlet, a temperature sensor near the outlet, and a signal conditioner to transfer the sensed signal to the computer using PCL-207.

A graphical representation of the controller output demonstrates faster response and rise times, as well as settling time. Initially, the outlet temperature is approximately 25°C, reaching the set point within seconds with minimal overshoots observed after the first crossover point. The mean error value is calculated based on readings available after the first crossover point.

At the initial stage, the outlet water temperature is 21°C, gradually increasing towards the set point. The rise time and controller response are similar to those in the first case. However, in this scenario, the system is unable to reach and maintain the set point consistently. The output water temperature remains at the lower end, creating an average difference of 1.5°C. Oscillations in the outlet water temperature lead to an increase in the error mean value.

This paper showcases the application of artificial intelligent techniques to control the temperature of flowing water. The effectiveness of the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) controller across a wider range of practical conditions is tested, with different case studies proposed to demonstrate its performance during actual application implementation.

A comparative study on various weather conditions and the analysis of an ANFIS-designed controller are presented using an identical industrial lab model. The ANFIS controller designed at the start of summer is tested over the course of a whole year, and both graphical and analytical analyses are presented to assess its performance. It can be concluded that the ANFIS controller is well-suited for the conditions for which it is designed; however, it may need to be retuned or redesigned for each possible disturbance in practical implementation.
