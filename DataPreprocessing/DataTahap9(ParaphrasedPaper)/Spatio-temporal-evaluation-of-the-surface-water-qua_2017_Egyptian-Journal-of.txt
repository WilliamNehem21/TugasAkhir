The purpose of this study is to assess the spatio-temporal variations in surface water pollution in the middle Nile Delta using the Palmer algal pollution index. Water samples were collected during winter and summer from 18 stations located along the water pathways from south to north, including two main irrigation canals (Qudaba and Mit-Yazed) and two drains (El-Gharbia main drain and Janag drain). The algal analysis was based on the species and genera mentioned in the Palmer index, with high index scores observed at most stations, particularly during the summer, indicating potential sources of pollution. Some stations showed low scores, suggesting relatively clean water. In winter, the irrigation canals exhibited similar spatial distribution patterns, with index values peaking in the middle of the water pathways and then decreasing. In summer, the Qudaba canal showed no clear trend, while the Mit-Yazed canal showed a decreasing trend in the northern direction. The El-Gharbia main drain had increasing and decreasing trends in winter and summer, respectively, while the Janag drain exhibited opposite patterns compared to the El-Gharbia main drain.

Organic pollution in the River Nile is a significant environmental concern, driven by population growth and urbanization, with waterways being contaminated by sewage, food waste, and farm effluents. Algae play a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems, influencing primary productivity and acting as indicators of water quality due to their responsiveness to physical and chemical changes in the water. The Palmer index, developed to identify the most pollution-tolerant algal species and genera, is a rapid and reliable method for assessing water pollution across multiple sites. It has previously been used in Egypt by other researchers.

During the summer, certain algal taxa associated with clean water disappeared, and there was an increase in chlorophycean taxa indicating eutrophication. Additionally, the presence of dinophycean taxa suggested an advanced trophic level. The Palmer index value revealed a higher pollution load in the summer compared to winter, particularly in the drains. The findings suggest that the surface water of the Nile Delta is affected by organic pollution in most sampled stations, with pollution levels varying spatially and temporally along the water pathways. Mit-Yazed canal exhibited higher organic pollution than Qudaba canal due to higher urbanization along its pathway. It was also noted that the El-Gharbia main drain had higher Palmer index scores than the Janag drain. Considering the intended use of the water from these water bodies, caution and treatment measures are necessary to mitigate the adverse effects of pollution.
