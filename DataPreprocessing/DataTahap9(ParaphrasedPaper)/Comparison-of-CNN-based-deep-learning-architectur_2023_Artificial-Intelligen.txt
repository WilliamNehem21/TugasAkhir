The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in detecting and localizing rice diseases in leaves has led to an increased use of CNNs in this area. Diseased rice leaves exhibit distinct features such as spots, colors, and diseased shapes, making them suitable for analysis using CNNs to identify inconsistencies among pixels. Several CNN models, including ResNet152V and SeResNext101, have been employed for classifying rice plant diseases, with the goal of achieving the highest accuracy rate. This study also explores transfer learning of Densenet121, MobilenetV2, ResNet152V, and SeResNext101, as well as ensemble learning of Densenet121, EfficientNetB7, and Xception networks.

As rice is a major staple food for a significant portion of the global population, diseases affecting rice plants can have a substantial impact on the national economy, particularly in developing countries like Bangladesh. Various rice diseases, such as bacterial panicle blight, rice hispa, leaf scald, leaf smut, sheath blight, and tungro, have been identified and characterized in the context of their impact on rice cultivation.

CNNs' ability to extract hierarchical representations from input data through convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers makes them well-suited for image recognition and computer vision tasks, such as the detection of rice leaf diseases. Different CNN architectures, such as AlexNet, ResNet, and DenseNet, have been developed and evolved by researchers, and various image processing techniques have been applied to rice leaf disease detection.

Ensemble learning, a method that combines multiple primary learners to improve overall generalization performance, has been highlighted as a promising approach for enhancing classification accuracy in rice disease detection. Previous studies utilizing CNNs, such as those conducted by Zhou et al. and Sanyal and Patel, have reported high accuracies in identifying and diagnosing rice diseases using deep learning methods.

In this study, various CNN models, including Densenet121, InceptionV3, MobilenetV2, ResNext101, ResNet152V, and SeResNext101, were individually evaluated for their performance in classifying rice diseases. Additionally, an ensemble model consisting of Densenet121, EfficientNetB7, and Xceptionnet was developed using a transfer learning strategy to improve accuracy.

The training and evaluation of these CNN models were conducted using the Keras library in Google Colab, with different strategies employed to enhance the models' convergence and performance. Furthermore, image acquisition and augmentation techniques were utilized to expand the dataset and improve model generalization.

To measure the performance of the CNN models, standard deviation and categorical cross-entropy were used as performance metrics and loss functions, respectively. The models underwent rigorous training and evaluation processes, with specific attention given to combating overfitting and addressing class imbalance in the dataset.

The study compared the classification performance of original CNN architectures with those that underwent transfer learning, showcasing the potential of transfer learning in improving accuracy, especially for smaller datasets. Additionally, the study made substantial contributions by experimenting with a wide range of rice diseases and conducting a comprehensive evaluation of different CNN architectures and transfer learning approaches.

In the future, the researchers aim to develop a user-friendly interface for the detection and localization of rice leaf diseases, providing guidance on disease control. This interface is intended for use on mobile devices and aims to facilitate disease detection for farmers in developing countries.

Ultimately, the study found that the Dex model, consisting of Densenet121, EfficientNetB7, and Xceptionnet, demonstrated superior performance in classifying rice diseases from leaf images, outperforming other CNN architectures in both original and augmented datasets.
