The algorithm for threshold crossing intervals (TCI) is centered on identifying the number and location of signal crossings through a designated threshold level. It operates by generating binary signals based on signal positions relative to the threshold for each 8-second ECG segment and subsequently computing TCI indices for 3-second intervals of the binary signals. These TCI indices can then be utilized to differentiate between sinus rhythm (SR), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF) based on their calculated values.

In the context of automated ventricular fibrillation (VF) detection in cardiac care devices, this study devised indices related to triangular-like components in the waveform representation of heart function, as well as an area encompassed by the waveform. The calculated minimum ventricular fibrillation indices are then used to evaluate the probability of ventricular fibrillation based on the waveform representation, with results showing improved sensitivity and selectivity in automated arrhythmia detection, even in cases of highly chaotic waveform representations.

Arafat et al. recently introduced an algorithm based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for VF detection. This approach involves deriving the first three consecutive intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and VF using EMD and observing that the IMFs of VF are orthogonal while those of NSR are not. Utilizing the orthogonality indices, the EMD algorithm demonstrates effective VF detection for a 3-second window for digitized ECG signals in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.

Given the significance of identifying shockable rhythms within the shortest possible window to enhance the success rate of rescue interventions, there is value in exploring rapid algorithms such as EMD for accurate detection of VF and NSR within 3 seconds. Additionally, to bolster robustness, it is advisable to consider the collaborative integration of different algorithms, leveraging their respective strengths. For instance, while the focus of the invention is on detecting cardiac rhythms produced by the heart in implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), the concept of incorporating multiple discriminators for classifying cardiac rhythm may also have utility in the domain of automated external defibrillators (AEDs).
