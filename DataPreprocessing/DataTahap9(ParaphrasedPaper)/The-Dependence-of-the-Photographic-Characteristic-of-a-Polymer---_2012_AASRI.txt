In the initial phase, the preparation of both samples requires dispersing zinc oxide into the polymer matrix. To do this, 12 grams of zinc oxide(ii) moistened with water was added to 100 ml of a 10% PVA water solution (which had been homogenized on a bain-marie). After allowing the mixture to settle for one hour, 60 grams of the resulting mixture was applied to a glass plate with an area of 234 square centimeters and then dried horizontally at room temperature for 24 hours.

Subsequently, the sensitization of the compositions was achieved by treating the PVA-ZnO composition with either a 1 m bismuth chloride aqueous solution for 30 seconds (to create the PVA-ZnOBiCl3 photosensitive composition) or a 0.1 m lead acetate aqueous solution (to create the PVA-ZnOPb(CH3COO)2 photosensitive composition). The photosensitive compositions were then dried in a heated air flow for 5 minutes to remove moisture.

To accomplish the objectives, samples of the photosensitive compositions were exposed to the integrated spectrum light of a DRT-125 mercury-vapor lamp for various exposure times. The surface illumination on the samples was measured at e=0.105 w/sq.cm., and the determination of optical blackening was carried out using the author's hardware-software complex.

The influence on the photosensitive composition sensitized by bismuth chloride or lead acetate was examined. For the PVA-ZnO-BiCl3 composition, it was found that the acetate group volume in the PVA structure had no significant impact on the contrast and maximal density of the optical blackening, but it strongly influenced the photosensitivity. In contrast, for the PVA-ZnO-Pb(CH3COO)2 photosensitive composition, increasing the acetate group rate in the PVA structure led to a significant decrease in the maximal density of the optical blackening and practically had no influence on the contrast and photosensitivity.
