The use of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) holds significant importance across various applications, such as vehicle safety and consumer electronics. In the testing of these devices, large and diverse datasets are recorded, encompassing a wide range of parameters. In an effort to reduce the cost of measurements and gain a deeper understanding of the relationships among these parameters, the study explores the application of graph neural networks (GNNs). The study aims to determine whether utilizing graph structures leads to improved predictive performance in inferring MEMS final module level test parameters, compared to conventional machine learning approaches on tabular data. Furthermore, the study seeks to investigate how the graph structure and learning algorithm contribute to the overall performance.

The study is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related work on predictive modeling in MEMS and integrated circuit testing, as well as graph-based representation learning in the context of manufacturing and testing. Section 3 provides a brief introduction to learning on graph structured data and the considered GNN architectures. In Section 4, the study specifies the use case of sensitivity estimation during final module level testing and outlines the experimental setup. Section 5 describes the results, which are then discussed in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 presents the conclusion.

The study emphasizes the relevance of graph-based methods in manufacturing, where components are assembled from sub-components that can be represented as entities within graphs. This approach extends to process and assembly planning, as outlined by Weise et al. Another representation of relational information is through knowledge graphs, particularly in datasets with numerous types of entities and relations. However, learning methods operating on numerical attributes in knowledge graphs are limited. The study focuses on graph schema representations and common GNN methods, and does not delve into specific learning methods for knowledge graphs.

The study investigates various graph representations of acquired test data to evaluate the performance of GNN architectures. The empirical study utilizes four different state-of-the-art GNN architectures – GCN, GAT, RGCN, and HGT – to predict raw sensitivity for a MEMS gyroscope. The study highlights that GNNs performed similarly to a light gradient boosting machine, neural network, and multivariate adaptive regression splines model on the complete dataset. However, in the presence of sparse data, GNNs outperformed baseline methods in terms of overall root-mean-square error and demonstrated significant improvement in maximum error when trained on data with similar sparsity rates as observed during validation.

The study sets up the graph structure and investigates the effects of changes to various hyperparameters of the GNN. Results indicate that the performance of GNN architectures is strongly dependent on hyperparameters and the underlying graph variant. The study identifies certain graph variants and architectures that lead to performance deterioration or improved performance, highlighting the sensitivity of GNN architectures to specific graph structures and hyperparameters.

Overall, the paper provides insights into the use of graph neural networks for predictive modeling in MEMS testing and highlights the potential benefits of graph-based representations in complex and heterogeneous datasets. The study suggests possible avenues for further improving the performance of graph-based approaches, such as incorporating additional information from system simulation and modifying the loss function towards a semi-supervised loss.
