The computational aspects of PL topology play a crucial role in various practical applications. For instance, there has been significant research into the problem of determining whether a given simplicial complex can be geometrically realized in low dimensions (e.g., see [6,7] and references therein). In contrast, the study of the computational aspects of barycentric subdivisions is a relatively recent development. Recognizing this gap, we aim to highlight some central open questions for the benefit of the readers. We commence by revisiting a fundamental result in PL topology and provide references for the relevant terminology in both PL topology and combinatorial algebraic topology.

In the specific context of simplicial complexes K and L, determining the exact number of simplices in their intersection can pose significant computational challenges, particularly in special cases. In our previous work, we investigated the case where the dimension of L is 0, and found it to be more intricate than initially anticipated. While numerous open questions remain, we outline some of the established facts.
