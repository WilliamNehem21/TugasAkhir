The recognition of signatures is an important aspect in various fields such as forensic science, historic document analysis, and archaeology. Segmentation, the process of dividing a text line into individual characters, is a crucial step in signature recognition. However, this task is challenging due to the large number of characters and the tendency for characters to overlap and touch each other, making it difficult to separate them. One commonly used approach to address this is unsupervised clustering, but the nonlinearity of separation boundaries between characters often causes traditional clustering methods to fail.

To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel method for segmenting signatures, specifically designed to effectively segment characters with nonlinear separability. The proposed approach involves segmenting the entire signature into strokes, computing a similarity matrix based on stroke gravities, and applying a nonlinear clustering method called normalized cut (NCut) on this similarity matrix to assign cluster labels to the strokes. These cluster labels are then used to combine the strokes into characters. Experimental evaluations conducted on four databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Furthermore, the paper compares the proposed method with existing techniques such as the probabilistic Viterbi algorithm, stroke bounding boxes method, connected components algorithm, project profile histogram, and k-means clustering. The comparison considers correct segmentation rates and average segmentation time per character to assess the performance of each method.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background information, Section 3 details the proposed segmentation method, Section 4 presents experimental results, and Section 5 concludes the paper. Overall, the new approach presented in this paper offers an effective solution for segmenting nonlinearly separable characters in handwritten signatures.
