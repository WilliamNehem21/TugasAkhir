This academic paper discusses the application of machine learning, particularly the artificial neural network algorithm, in the field of computer vision for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and localization. The study specifically focuses on weed detection for robotic weed control research. The research is motivated by the need to understand the impact of different background conditions on the performance of deep learning models used for weed and crop classification under greenhouse conditions.

The study involved training deep learning models using convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures on images captured under two different background scenarios: non-uniform background scenario (S1) and uniform background scenario (S2). After training the models, they were tested with different background scenarios to evaluate their robustness and performance. The results indicated a decline in model performance when models were tested on images with backgrounds different from those used during training.

Two popular CNN architectures, VGG16 and ResNet50, were used for training the models. Transfer learning techniques were applied to adapt the pre-trained models to the specific weed and crop classification task. The study analyzed the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The results revealed significant differences in model performance when tested with different background scenarios.

The findings suggest that the performance of the deep learning models declined when tested with images from different background conditions. However, the performance improved when the models were trained using a combination of datasets from both background scenarios. The study also highlighted the importance of incorporating a wider variety of training data, including images from diverse geographical areas and cultivation conditions, to improve the robustness of the models.

The paper emphasizes the need to create background environments similar to field conditions inside the greenhouse to ensure the applicability of deep learning-based weed detection models in real-world agricultural settings. Additionally, the study recommends further research to incorporate a fusion of greenhouse and field images to build more robust deep learning models for weed detection and localization.
