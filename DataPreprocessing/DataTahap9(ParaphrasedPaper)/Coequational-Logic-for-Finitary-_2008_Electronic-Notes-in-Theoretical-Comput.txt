The transition from k to k+1 is assumed to be possible, with the existence of a tree tk satisfying statements (i)k to (v)k. It is then demonstrated that these statements also hold for k+1. The completeness aspect of Theorem 4.7 was straightforwardly established, requiring only the existence of initial representative trees, which is assured for every finitary functor. However, for soundness, additional effort was necessary, particularly in propositions 4.1 and 4.6, which form the basis of the simpler logic and ensure the efficacy of the simplification outlined in section 4.3. These propositions necessitated the assumption that the functor preserves preimages. Subsequently, the necessity of this assumption for Theorem 4.7 will be proven.
