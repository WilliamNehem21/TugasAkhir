Theoretical principles of vibrational spectroscopy suggest that under controlled conditions and with defined mixtures of soil constituents, distinct infrared electromagnetic radiation absorption patterns can be linked to functional groups and chemical bonds (Socrates, 2004). However, practical challenges arise when analyzing soil constituents such as kex at low concentrations, as they may only be observed through their correlation with other spectrally active major soil components. Despite these challenges, it is crucial to interpret and attribute spectral features to fundamental vibrations of specific soil properties in order to develop more efficient models, gain insight into model output, enhance understanding of soil processes, and build trust in machine learning-based technologies (Viscarra Rossel and Behrens, 2010; Lundberg and Lee, 2017).

To predict kex in soil for the remediation of radioactive contamination in agricultural land, models trained on a large MIRs spectral library must achieve a sufficient level of accuracy. We aim to evaluate the role of data regime and model capacity in this analysis using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) as a baseline and investigate the performance of models across different soil taxonomy orders. Additionally, we aim to assess the robustness of models and mitigate the limitations of relatively small sample sizes for specific soil taxonomy orders such as Oxisols, Vertisols, Gelisols, and Histosols. This evaluation involves utilizing various performance metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) on training, validation, and test datasets.

We employed the GradientSHAP model interpretability algorithms to identify important spectral features for predicting kex content by examining overall model performance and performance across soil taxonomy orders. The results indicate that both PLSR and CNN models perform poorly with a dataset of 5000 samples, but show improvement with a dataset of 10,000 samples. The CNN model's performance continues to increase with larger datasets, reaching an R2 of approximately 0.79. Furthermore, when evaluated by soil taxonomy orders, the variability of performance metrics increases as the sample size of the test set decreases.

Applying the standard normal variate (SNV) preprocessing step makes MIR spectra translation and scale invariant, allowing machine learning algorithms to exploit deformation/distortion patterns. The GradientSHAP values indicate the effect of local deformations of the spectra on predicted values. Correlation analysis reveals relationships between the GradientSHAP values calculated for different soil taxonomy orders, providing insights into how spectral features are utilized across soil orders.

The study provides a methodology to inform the decision of whether to stratify MIRs modeling by soil taxonomy orders, based on the spectral features learned and reused by the prediction algorithm. It is demonstrated that the prediction of kex is dependent on data volume and model classes capable of leveraging it, and that stratifying modeling by soil taxonomy orders can yield beneficial results for certain classes. This analysis is informative and could be extended to the prediction of other soil analytes.
