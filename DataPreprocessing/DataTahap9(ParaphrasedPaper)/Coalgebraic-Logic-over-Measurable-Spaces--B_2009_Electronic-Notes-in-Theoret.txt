The use of coalgebras for an endofunctor provides a consistent framework for examining reactive systems. This paper investigates coalgebras for functors in the category of measurable spaces and maps. The subprobability functor, denoted as "s," facilitates the treatment of stochastic aspects, comparable to the role played by the powerset functor in handling non-deterministic aspects.

We will establish two technical conditions for sets of predicate liftings: separability and admissibility. Our concept of separable predicate liftings is derived from the one employed in coalgebraic logic over sets, as introduced for sets of unary predicate liftings.
