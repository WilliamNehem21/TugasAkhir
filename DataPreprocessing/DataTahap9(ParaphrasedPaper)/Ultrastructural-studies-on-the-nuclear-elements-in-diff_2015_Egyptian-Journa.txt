This research examines the previously uninvestigated detailed structure of the nucleus during various phases of neural differentiation and degeneration within the adult olfactory neuroepithelium of p. lanceolatus. The goal is to establish a connection between the subcellular processes of neurogenesis and neural degeneration.
