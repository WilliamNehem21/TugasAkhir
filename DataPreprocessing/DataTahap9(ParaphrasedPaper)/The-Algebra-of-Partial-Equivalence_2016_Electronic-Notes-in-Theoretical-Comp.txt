Props (product and permutation categories) are symmetric monoidal categories whose objects are the natural numbers. Over the past twenty years, they have gained popularity as a framework for studying various computational models in a manner that is sensitive to resources and allows for composition. For instance, they have been used in algebraic methods for analyzing petri nets, bigraphs, quantum processes, and signal flow graphs.

An interesting case study involves cospans represented by "and," which have the same pullback but represent different partitions of 2. The solution to this issue requires a more nuanced approach: by rewriting as , it is sufficient to pull back the region of the cospan where all sub-diagrams of shape are located. Formally, we...
