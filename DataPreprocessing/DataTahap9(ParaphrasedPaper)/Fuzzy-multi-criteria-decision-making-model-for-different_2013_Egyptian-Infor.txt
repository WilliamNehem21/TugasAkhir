This academic paper introduces an efficient fuzzy Analytic Network Process (ANP) model, which aims to assist decision-makers in selecting among alternative scenarios for electrical power generation in Egypt. The model utilizes variables and Gaussian fuzzy numbers for pairwise comparisons in order to derive priority weights for different selection attributes and sub-attributes. By combining the priority weights for main attributes, sub-attributes, and alternatives, the model identifies the best alternative.

The paper begins by providing an overview of fuzzy sets, linguistic variables, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and fuzzy AHP applications in the literature, followed by an illustration of the Analytic Network Process (ANP). The paper then introduces the Gaussian fuzzy ANP (GFANP) model and details the steps involved in each stage of the procedure. The results obtained from the model are discussed in a subsequent section, and the paper concludes with final remarks.

The paper points out that while AHP addresses deficiencies in the measurement and evaluation steps of problem analysis, it does not account for potential dependencies among factors. The paper suggests that the assumed independence of factors presented in hierarchical structures by AHP may not always be a reasonable presumption. To address this, the proposed GFANP model enables the use of interval values in preference matrices and utilizes Gaussian fuzzy numbers to avoid the issue of zero weights. The paper concludes by recommending the Egyptian government to construct additional nuclear power stations to cover 25% of the generated electricity and to build solar power stations to cover 5% of the generated electricity.
