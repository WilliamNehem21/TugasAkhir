The emergence of quantum programming languages as a burgeoning field at the intersection of programming languages and quantum computation is not primarily concerned with the pursuit of suitable notation and semantics. Instead, the focus is on identifying the structural aspects of quantum computation. The unique features of quantum computation, such as the inability to copy or discard quantum information, entanglement, superposition, and the probabilistic nature of measurement, present unprecedented challenges in establishing structure within this domain. The field of quantum programming languages aims to address these challenges by seeking out this structure.

This paper presents an approach to game semantics for quantum programming languages. Classical game semantics have historically been utilized to construct precise denotational models for various programming languages and logics. The interest in game semantics for programming languages was piqued in the mid-90s with the introduction of game-based fully-abstract models for PCF. This approach has subsequently been successful in providing fully abstract models for a range of languages with diverse features, such as non-determinism, probability, and concurrency. The paper introduces the concept of quantum strategy, which bears conceptual similarities to classical game semantics.

The paper delves into a detailed analysis of game semantics for a specific language: the measurement calculus of Danos et al., which is grounded in the one-way model of Raussendorf and Briegel. While this language is highly specific to the one-way model and operates at a low level, it represents an innovative model of quantum computation that has garnered attention from physicists as a potential foundation for implementations. The fundamental role of measurements in this model suggests that game semantics for this language could provide insights into its connection with interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as the consistent histories interpretation. The overarching objective is the development of a higher-order quantum programming language informed by the theory of game semantics. The work in this paper builds upon probabilistic game semantics, as introduced by Danos and Harmer, but defines games in terms of quantum elements like projective measurement operators.

The quantum game presented in this paper differs from traditional games in that its basic components, the arena and moves, are quantum in nature. The strategies defined in this context are probabilistic, but their probabilities arise from quantum measurements, rather than arbitrary distributions. Notably, quantum strategies are subject to more constraints than general probabilistic strategies in order to adhere to the laws of quantum mechanics.

The paper also highlights the link between plays in a game and consistent histories, suggesting that understanding the connections between game theoretic constraints on strategies and consistency conditions on families of histories may provide insights into which strategies are physically realizable.
