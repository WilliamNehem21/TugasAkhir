Wang, X., Luo, L., Xiang, J., Zheng, S., Shittu, S., Wang, Z., & Zhao, X. (2021) conducted a comprehensive review on the usage of nanofluids in heat pipes with the integration of machine learning techniques. The study covered the theoretical background, practical applications, and predictive capabilities of nanofluid-based heat pipes. 

Meanwhile, Jamei, M., Olumegbon, I. A., Karbasi, M., Ahmadianfar, I., Asadi, A., & Mosharafdehkordi, M. (2021) presented a study on the evaluation of thermal conductivity in oil-based hybrid nanofluids using an extended Kalman filter combined with a feed-forward neural network, which was published in the International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer.

Furthermore, Wang, J., Zhai, Y., Yao, P., Ma, M., & Wang, H. (2020) developed prediction models for the thermal conductivity of hybrid nanofluids based on artificial neural networks (ANN) in waste heat systems, as detailed in their paper in the International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer.
