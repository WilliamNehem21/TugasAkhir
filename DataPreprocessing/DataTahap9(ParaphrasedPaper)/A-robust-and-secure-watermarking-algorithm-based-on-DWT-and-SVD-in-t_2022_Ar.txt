The utilization of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is a potent and valuable technique for analyzing and processing signals. DWT decomposes a 2D image into four independent sub-bands: ll (approximate component details), hl (horizontal component details), lh (vertical component details), and hh (diagonal component details). By repeatedly applying DWT to an image, multi-scale wavelet decomposition can be achieved, resulting in multiple approximations and details. The highest coefficient in the low-resolution band ll of DWT represents the most significant information. DWT possesses the dual characteristics of multi-resolution and multi-layering, aligning with the human vision system, and offers certain advantages in enhancing watermark imperceptibility. The DWT formula is expressed as follows:

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a highly effective algebraic feature extraction method in linear algebra, finds broad application in data dimensionality reduction algorithms, recommendation systems, natural language processing, and other domains due to its desirable properties, such as good stability. When an image is subjected to slight disturbance, its singular value does not undergo significant alteration. In many digital watermarking schemes based on SVD, the majority of watermark information is embedded in a cover image formed by a new matrix of singular values.

The primary focus of this paper is to present a resilient and secure watermarking technique based on a novel fusion of DWT and SVD in the Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT) domain, thereby offering an alternative for more secure watermark embedding technology. In the realm of image watermarking predicated on FRFT, the transformation order of FRFT can serve as a secret key in the watermark information embedding and extraction process.

The subsequent sections of this paper are organized as follows: Section 2 provides an introduction to the fundamental theories, Section 3 expounds on the proposed watermarking scheme in greater detail, Section 4 presents comprehensive experimental results and analysis, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed scheme compared to existing ones, and finally, Section 5 summarizes the paper and draws conclusions.

The robustness of the algorithm pertains to the watermarked imageâ€™s ability to withstand various attacks, primarily encompassing image processing and geometric transformations. Normalized correlation (NC) and bit error rate (BER) are two widely used measures for assessing the quality of extracted watermarks. They quantify the dissimilarity between the extracted watermark image and the original watermark image. A larger NC value corresponds to a smaller BER value, signifying a higher similarity between the extracted watermark image and the original, and vice versa. Moreover, the proposed scheme demonstrates pronounced advantages in resisting geometric attacks. The NC values against geometric attacks are calculated and compared with those of other watermarking schemes.
