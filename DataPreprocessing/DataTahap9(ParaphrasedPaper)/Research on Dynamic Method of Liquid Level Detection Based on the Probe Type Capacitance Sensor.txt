This research addresses the limitations associated with the single-direction method in absorbing samples for automatic clinical analysis instruments, such as low accuracy, inaccuracies in liquid absorption, short sample, and tip blockages. To mitigate these issues, the study proposes a dynamic level detection method using a capacitance sensor. This approach aims to reduce the influence of motor drive inertness and microcapillarity caused by the interaction between the probe and the liquid. Additionally, a dynamic gm(1, 1)-based grey dynamic filtering technique is employed to enhance the stability of the capacitance sensor output. Experimental trials are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the dynamic method, which demonstrates an improvement in accuracy from 0.3mm to 0.1mm compared to the single-direction method.

The probe-type capacitance sensor utilized in this study differs from traditional plate capacitance sensors in that the probe acts as a conductor, establishing a capacitance effect with the sample cup at the bottom of the metal frame. Given the irregular shape of the probe and the air-filled electrical insulation medium, it is challenging to establish an accurate mathematical model. Therefore, only a rough estimation can be obtained.

Considering the influence of minor fluctuations, a standard value of 0.1V is determined for experiments after conducting multiple trials. The ADC module of tms320f2812 initiates sampling of capacitance sensor output values when the probe makes contact with or moves away from the liquid level.

The selection of the standard value necessitates comprehensive consideration of motor motion inertia and the error resulting from minor fluctuations introduced by infiltration. Compared to the unidirectional method, the dynamic method effectively eliminates the error introduced by motor motion inertia. Furthermore, the selection of a smaller standard value improves the elimination of motor motion inertia error, although choosing a value that is too small could lead to significant errors due to the infiltration phenomenon. Hence, the standard value should be selected to minimize the influence of the infiltration phenomenon while maximizing the elimination of motor motion inertia error. In this study, a standard value of 0.1V was chosen for the experiment.

Noise filtering of the sampling results enhances the output of capacitance sensor and ensures stable variations in output values for accurate determinations. Through extensive experimental trials to select the optimal variation as the liquid surface detection standard value, the study effectively eliminates errors resulting from the infiltration phenomenon. Ultimately, the dynamic measurement method for probe-type capacitance sensor enables accurate liquid level detection while minimizing probe contamination caused by hanging fluid.
