Information theory concepts have proven useful in this area. Specifically, the concept of a noisy channel has been employed to simulate protocols for concealing information and the transmission of information within computer programs. In this context, the input of the channel represents the information intended to be kept secret, while the output represents the observed information. The channel noise is a result of the protocol's efforts to disguise the connection between the secret information and the observed information, often achieved through the use of randomized mechanisms.

The primary inquiry centers on how to quantify information and, correspondingly, what is meant by uncertainty. Two potential approaches are explored. The first yields a multiplicative measure of information leakage, following the proposed framework of Smith. The second approach results in an additive measure, representing a new concept.

We first examine the concept of ml+. Due to Corollary 6.5, it is known that ml+ is achieved at a corner point, which can be represented by a distribution of the form (q1,..., q2k), where each qi is either 0 or 1/r, and there are r elements with a value of 1/r in the distribution.
