Simulation has been widely utilized in academic and business settings for tasks such as modeling system performance, workflow analysis, and process improvement. It has also been employed for the management of assets and personnel. Organisations use simulation software tools like [reference to specific tools] to identify system bottlenecks and gain insights into the impact of resource or personnel investments on overall system performance. This enables decision makers to experiment with various scenarios and make cost-effective comparisons, avoiding the need for real system implementations. However, some simulation tools may have certain limitations.

Loctrackjinqs shares many features with jinqs and includes two main Java packages, "network" and "tools." The "network" package is used to define the structure of queueing networks, while the "tools" package provides utility classes for setting up simulations, defining probability distributions, and calculating performance metrics. Both packages are designed to be easily extended, allowing developers to add application-specific features by subclassing existing classes and overriding inherited methods.

Unlike jinqs, which can only be used for high-level abstract simulations without physical geographical locations, loctrackjinqs introduces features for location-aware simulations. In this system, entities in the queueing network are assigned geographical locations in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system, and their movements occur along user-defined paths at speeds sampled from a user-specified distribution.

The "transportcustomersevent" class is responsible for triggering events that invoke the "movecustomers()" method of each "transportlink" entity. By scheduling such events to occur regularly, it becomes possible to simulate customer movement at a high resolution.

In the simulation, different colored entities are used to represent moving pilots and flight attendants, EU passengers, and non-EU passengers. Various shades of green are employed to distinguish customers from each class who are receiving service.
