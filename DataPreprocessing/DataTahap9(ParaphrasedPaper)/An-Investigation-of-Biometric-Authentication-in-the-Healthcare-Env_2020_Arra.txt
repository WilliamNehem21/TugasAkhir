The field of biometrics and the healthcare industry have experienced significant growth. Biometrics enables the identification of individuals based on their physical and behavioral traits, and its fusion with information systems in healthcare has ushered in a new method for patient identification. This research examines the use of periocular biometrics for authentication within the healthcare system and proposes a novel technique that integrates periocular biometrics with the electronic master patient index. The paper includes a comparative analysis of various periocular biometric recognition methods against traditional and deep learning-based approaches.

In situations where an individual is unconscious or unresponsive without any form of identification, a biometric system that can identify individuals based on the periocular region of their face would expedite the identification process. Additionally, smartphone technology has incorporated sensors and security features for effective individual authentication without the need for passwords or personal identification numbers.

The paper is structured as follows: an overview of biometric systems and the advantages of periocular biometrics are presented, along with a discussion of biometric system functionality and performance metrics. It also provides an overview of healthcare systems, patient arrival and registration processes, and the health information management system. The proposed approach for integrating biometrics into the healthcare system, alongside a literature review, is discussed, followed by conclusions and insights for future work.

The research identifies seven factors for assessing the suitability of a trait for biometric authentication, and explores the use of periocular biometrics for identification. It also delves into healthcare system considerations, the implementation of hospital information systems, and the integration of multi-factor authentication within healthcare management systems. Various biometric techniques used in healthcare systems, as well as the performance of combining different biometric modalities, are analyzed.

Furthermore, security concerns, privacy considerations, and the role of deep learning techniques in biometric-based authentication systems are discussed. The paper proposes a deep learning-based method for classifying biometric data in healthcare authentication systems, focusing on the use of convolutional neural networks and experimental evaluations using the BIPA+ MICHE-I periocular dataset. The research is supported by grants from the NSF and the U.S. Department of Education.

In summary, the paper presents an in-depth exploration of the fusion of biometrics with healthcare systems, offering insights into authentication processes, system functionality, security concerns, and the application of deep learning techniques.
