The main advantage of developing coalgebraic semantics for modal logic is the ability to derive results for various types of modal logics in a consistent manner. The characterization of a modal logic type is determined by the endofunctor t. While there has been research focused on inductively defined Kripke polynomial functors (cf. [10,13,30]), there has also been investigation into arbitrary endofunctors t (see [24,19,26,27]).

This paper aims to briefly introduce key concepts and findings from the algebraic duality theory of monotone modal logic. In addition to establishing notation, this section seeks to provide readers with an understanding of the connection between algebraic duality and the upv-functor described in section 3.2.

The proof of this lemma closely resembles that of lemma 5.2.6 in Marx, relying solely on the kripke version of bisimulation products and the fundamental duality between kripke frames and baos. The counterparts for monotone frames and bams are demonstrated.
