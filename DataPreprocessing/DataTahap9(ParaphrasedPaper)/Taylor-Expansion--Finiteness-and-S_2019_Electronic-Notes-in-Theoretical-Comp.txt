We define degx(m) as the number of non-overlapping instances of the variable x in the term m. These instances can be represented as x1, x2, ..., xk, especially when considering resource reductions.

From a resource perspective, we observe that the terms mentioned above correspond to call-by-value terms. If we exclude the terms with labeled lambdas (lxt), the syntax remains the same, and the difference lies solely in operational semantics. In particular, when we define the taylor expansion of call-by-need following this presentation, the process is similar to that of call-by-value. Consequently, Corollary 2.8 applies immediately when the concept of parallel reduction is defined conveniently. Upon examining the dynamics, it is evident that limits on size and depth can be established for this calculus.

The coherence relation we have introduced enables the comparison of terms with identical structures. In particular, if two terms are coherent and are reducible expressions, there is a method for pairs of reductions leading to corresponding reductions, even if coherence is not generally preserved by reduction. This is expressly articulated in the following lemma.

Continuing our exploration of the connections between taylor expansion and reduction strategies, Ehrhard and Guerrieri introduced a fine-grained calculus that permits the incorporation of call-by-name and call-by-value. More recently, Guerrieri and Manzonetto have studied the correspondence between these incorporations and the respective operational semantics of call-by-name and call-by-value. We briefly outline how our finiteness result applies in this particular context.

We have introduced the requisite definitions to examine taylor expansion in various contexts, each requiring distinct proof methods. An extension of this work could involve generalizing these results in a unified framework, building upon our collaboration with Vaux-Auclair on linear logic-proof nets. Notably, there are already established embeddings of call-by-name and call-by-value into proof nets, and our results about taylor expansion become a syntactic endeavor, involving the presentation of these translations and establishing their compatibility with taylor expansion (e.g., demonstrating that the taylor expansion of the proof net derived from a call-by-value translation corresponds to the translation of call-by-value taylor expansion as presented in section 2.1). An endeavor to construct proof nets corresponding to call-by-need, bang calculus, and PCF would be particularly valuable in this context.
