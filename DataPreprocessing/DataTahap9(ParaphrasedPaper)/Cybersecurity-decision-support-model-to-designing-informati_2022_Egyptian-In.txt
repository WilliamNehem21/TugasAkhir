The number of cybersecurity breaches has substantially increased, causing companies to be more vigilant. In 2020, there was a marked rise in the incidents of cybersecurity breaches, with a staggering increase of 36 billion. This made it the worst year on record for information technology security. Proper cybersecurity policymaking is crucial to effectively mitigate security threats and attacks. In the realm of technology and information security management, risk assessment and measuring security readiness are integral. Companies must incorporate risk management in information security to minimize security risks and ensure business continuity. It is essential for critical infrastructure to employ an effective risk management process to safeguard stakeholders from financial, organizational, and reputational losses. The cybersecurity framework has proven to offer best practices for developing security infrastructure and organizational systems.

This paper introduces a novel approach from previous studies. The proposed approach involves integrating risk assessment and the cybersecurity framework ISO/IEC 27001 to derive the most accurate recommendations for policymakers in developing information technology security systems. The model developed can assess the priority value of threat mitigation, based on the relative threat score against the relative evaluation score of ISO/IEC 27001 compliance implementation. The mitigation priority value is crucial in determining priority recommendations for constructing an information technology security system based on the ISO/IEC 27001 framework. Furthermore, the proposed model maps the ISO/IEC 27001 domain and threat mitigation priorities, facilitating decision-making for policymakers. This approach is focused on the extent to which a threat and the application of a cybersecurity framework can impact business continuity. The paper also offers a comprehensive analysis of the results of implementing recommendations for information technology security systems through security testing. Additionally, the paper concludes with a statistical evaluation of the system built based on the recommendation of an information technology security system, using the proposed model to obtain a significant level (p-value) between the system conditions before and after the implementation of information technology security system recommendations. The author presents two cases to probe the relationship between differences in system conditions before and after the implementation of security system recommendations, an area not previously addressed in the design of information technology security systems.

The factors considered in this study encompass governance, risk management, framework, asset management, and technology aspects of information security. The governance factor assesses the readiness of information security governance, including the responsibilities of information security managers. The risk management factor evaluates the readiness to implement information security risk management as the foundation for an information security strategy. The framework factor assesses the completeness and readiness of information security management framework (policies & procedures) and its implementation strategy. The asset management factor evaluates the completeness of securing information assets throughout their lifecycle. Lastly, the technology aspect factor scrutinizes the completeness, consistency, and effectiveness of utilizing technology in securing information assets.

A cybersecurity attack is a virtual world criminal's assault against one or more computers or networks. Such attacks may aim to disable computers, pilfer data, or utilize compromised computers as launching points for other attacks. Various methods are employed by virtual world criminals to launch such attacks, including brute force, port scanning, malware, phishing, spam, ransomware, denial of service (DoS), and other tactics.

In this study, the PDCA cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act) is adopted for problem-solving stages, with each cycle encompassing all activities in the study. The proposed method is positioned in the "Do" stage, serving as a combination of risk analysis using the OCTAVE Allegro method and compliance evaluation of the cybersecurity framework ISO/IEC 27001. This amalgamation produces the priority value of mitigation for each security threat, as well as mapping the cybersecurity framework ISO/IEC 27001.

The "Plan" stage involves discussing and formulating research problems and ideas, conducting literature studies, determining the organizational scope of research, and planning the models used in the research. The "Do" stage entails analyzing the proposed method to generate cybersecurity recommendations in support of decision-making, conducting direct observations and interviews with each business process owner (BPO) asset technology, and making decisions on the list of recommended implementations.

Step 4 involves identifying the area of concern by developing risk profiles for information technology assets based on potential threats and their impact on the organization. The "Defer" stage involves situations where risks are neither accepted nor mitigated based on the organization's preferences, and further information gathering and analysis are needed. The "Correlation" layer involves combining the results of risk analysis and compliance evaluation analysis of the cybersecurity framework to determine the mitigation priority value for each type of threat relative to the dimensions of the ISO/IEC 27001 framework.

The relative threat score represents the probability of occurrence achieved by a threat, where a higher score indicates a greater impact on the organization, and it is obtained from the weight value of a threat divided by the maximum value each threat may have. The relative evaluation score reflects the implementation of cybersecurity framework compliance, where a higher score indicates better compliance in the organization.

In the evaluation stage, a quantitative analysis of the implemented security recommendations is conducted to assess the differences before and after implementation. The evaluation process utilizes programming with R language for statistical analysis, aiming to determine whether there are significant differences before and after implementation based on a significant level value of 5%.

The paper concludes by discussing the statistical evaluation process and the proposed model, which presents a unique approach compared to previous studies.
