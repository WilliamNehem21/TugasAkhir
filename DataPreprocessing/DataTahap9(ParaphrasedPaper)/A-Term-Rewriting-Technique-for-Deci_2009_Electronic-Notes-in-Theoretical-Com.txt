The academic paper discusses the need for defining an ordering on terms of logic in order to establish an ordering on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). The paper explores different orderings that have been attempted and explains the shortcomings of these approaches. The paper introduces a new ordering on terms that results in simpler representations of terms in the context of proofs. This new ordering also offers an alternative technique for transforming BDDs. The paper also describes substitution rules that differ from those used in previous work and presents an automatic method for transforming formulas into ordered BDDs using a sorting algorithm.

The paper outlines the process for making a BDD ordered, which involves simplifying its guards in isolation, and presents a new order on terms and an ordering on guards. It notes that these definitions differ from those used previously. Additionally, the paper introduces a term rewrite system for simplifying BDDs to their most reduced form, referred to as (0, s,=)-r-obdd. The paper suggests that finding the appropriate ordering on terms is not a straightforward task and remains a challenge for larger theories.
