For the purpose of showcasing the application of precise terminology and the construction of cases in coalgebraic description, an example drawn from[9, section 4] is provided. Let a denote a collection of (potentially infinite) binary trees. Each tree x is either a lone node without any offspring, or possesses precisely two offspring generated by removing the top node.


Here, "st" signifies a symbol for type that will represent the state set of a specified coalgebra. A type is considered rigid if it does not have "st" as a subtype. The set of rigid types is thus the smallest set that encompasses "o" and satisfies conditions (1) and (2).


The requisite tools for presenting a structural characterization of logically definable classes of coalgebras are now available. The following outcome is the analogous counterpart for polynomial functors to Theorem 9.2 for monomial functors, with the underlying rationale remaining unchanged.
