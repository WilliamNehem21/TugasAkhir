The current focus of scientists and researchers is on the development of 5G networks, which are crucial for providing a reliable internet connection to IoT devices in smart cities. However, there are challenges in providing coverage using high-range spectrum due to its poor propagation qualities and limited range, particularly in urban areas. As a result, the concept of micro-infrastructure is seen as the future of 5G, as it enhances capacity and improves network coverage at a low deployment cost. In addition, the potential existence of non-cellular scenarios requires an assessment of other supporting radio technologies to aggregate such connections to the radio access segment. Thus, researchers are exploring various methods to set up a heterogeneous network infrastructure.

In this context, this paper sets out to propose an efficient vehicular-based virtual network infrastructure (VVNI) for smart cities, using future intelligent vehicles as the builders of the communication network. The article outlines the related work in Section 2, presents the basic framework and problem statement of the proposed infrastructure in Sections 3 and 4, and describes the theoretical model, design, and processing of the proposed network infrastructure in Sections 5 and 6. Furthermore, it provides a set of performance results in Section 7 to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed infrastructure and concludes by summarizing the findings in Section 8.

The paper discusses the limitations of current cellular networks in providing efficient communication and computation infrastructure for the increasing number of IoT devices in smart cities. To address these limitations, several promising technologies have been introduced, such as ultra-dense networking (UDN) and mobile edge computing (MEC). The integration of MEC-enabled UDN into IoT is seen to offer potential benefits to numerous smart city applications, but there are open challenges in these technologies, such as severe co-channel and adjacent interference for IoT devices due to the denser deployment of small cells in UDNs.

Aside from existing technologies, the paper discusses the potential of connected vehicles as infrastructure for computation and communication. It introduces the concept of vehicles as a resource (VAAR) and proposes the car4ict architecture, where smart vehicles can offer various services to consumers. The paper also presents the concept of Vehicular Cloud Networking (VCN) to create a vehicle cloud for advanced vehicular services.

The paper emphasizes that 4G LTE and 5G are essential solutions to support large and heterogeneous IoT devices in future smart cities. It also highlights the role of connected vehicles in integrating various wireless technologies to communicate with everything in the smart city, including vehicular communication (DSRC/WAVE), cellular communication (4G/5G and LTE-A), and short-range static communication (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth).

The article aims to use vehicles not only to provide services but also to act as centralized communication hubs in future smart cities. It introduces the concept of a VVNI framework consisting of service providers (smart vehicles) and users (IoT devices). The vehicles are responsible for forming and maintaining the network, providing access to user devices, and enabling multihop connectivity.

The paper also discusses the decision-making process in selecting the best vehicle for the VVNI infrastructure and presents a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem framework to evaluate alternative vehicles based on various criteria. It highlights the importance of selecting the best vehicle that maximizes the efficiency of the network infrastructure.

Moreover, the paper proposes algorithms for vehicle selection, voting, and handover within the VVNI framework. It discusses the importance of maintaining an efficient wireless network infrastructure for smart cities and outlines the process of verifying and granting access to network users.

Additionally, the paper presents simulation results that demonstrate the potential improvements in network infrastructure efficiency and performance achieved by the proposed VVNI. It also identifies areas for future research, including the privacy of vehicles and the utilization of parked vehicles to enhance network performance.

In conclusion, the proposed VVNI has the potential to significantly enhance ICT in smart cities, and further research and development are needed to integrate the technology into city operations in a safe, secure, and effective manner. The paper also discusses the potential benefits of the VVNI, such as improved communication, increased safety, enhanced traffic management, and new applications and services, and emphasizes the need for continued research and development to fully realize the potential of the VVNI in smart cities.
