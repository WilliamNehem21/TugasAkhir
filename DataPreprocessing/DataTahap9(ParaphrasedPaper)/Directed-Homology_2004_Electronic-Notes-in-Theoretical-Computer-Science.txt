One can acquire valuable knowledge about concurrency theory by examining the geometric aspects of concurrent systems. This perspective has been advocated for a while and seems to be gaining popularity. In this paper, we introduce the concept of directed homology for semicubical sets, which is expected to have diverse applications as a robust invariant for higher-dimensional automata, systems of weakly synchronized pv processes, and similar formalisms for concurrent systems.
