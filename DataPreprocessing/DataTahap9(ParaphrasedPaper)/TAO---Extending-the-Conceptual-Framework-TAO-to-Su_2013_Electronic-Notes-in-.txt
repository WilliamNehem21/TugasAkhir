To address the diversity of members in a system, governance or law enforcement systems have been established. These systems define a set of norms or laws that must be adhered to by the system entities. The norms are used to regulate the behavior of agents in multi-agent systems by describing permissible actions, obligatory actions, and prohibited actions. Additionally, norms are used to manage the autonomy, diverse interests, and desires of the agents within the system. Recent works have explored the relationship between norms and architectures.

Simple reflex agents utilize condition-action rules to make decisions based on current perceptions, assuming that the agent receives information from the environment through sensors. Model-based reflex agents, similar to simple reflex agents, also use condition-action rules, but they can handle partially observable environments by storing the current state of the environment and using a "next function" to select the next action. Utility-based agents introduce a utility function to measure the desirability of particular states in order to optimize the agent's performance.

The extension of TAO focuses on representing internal architectures and static elements that constitute a norm using templates. These templates define the characteristics and relationships of each element. Norms are represented through templates that define the state to be restricted and the behavior of instances. Adaptations to existing abstractions in TAO are necessary to incorporate the concept of norms. For example, the concepts of right and duty in the agent role template are replaced by deontic concepts of permission and obligation as defined by norms.

The MOISE+ organization model presents permission and prohibition norms for roles within an organization, but it has limitations, such as not defining agent properties and not supporting the specification of norms for agents and environments. The OPERA organizational model allows the description of norms related to obligation, permission, and prohibition for agents, agent roles, and groups, but it has its own limitations, such as not supporting the modeling of structural aspects of agent organizations and not allowing the restriction of agent behavior in the context of an environment.

TAO+ allows for the representation of the structural and dynamic properties of entities in multi-agent systems in conjunction with the static elements of norms that govern the behavior of these entities. It also represents all internal agent architectures defined in TAO. Therefore, normative multi-agent systems with different agent architectures can be modeled using TAO+.
