Ceramic tiles are commonly used for indoor finishing because of their decorative qualities and cost-effectiveness. These tiles can be either glazed or unglazed. Zircon, a common opacifying agent in glazes for ceramic tiles, is also utilized as an opacifier in porcelain tiles by being directly integrated into the tile body mixture. Zircon sand contains naturally occurring radionuclides, primarily from the uranium and thorium decay series. Although the concentrations of these radionuclides are low, they are notably higher than those found in typical rocks and soil. Consequently, the presence of zircon in the glaze can result in an increased level of natural radioactivity in ceramic tiles. Given their nature as construction materials, it is important to assess the radiological impact of ceramic tiles on the public, with specific consideration of gamma radiation and inhalation of radon released from the product as the primary exposure pathways.

There is a notably strong correlation between 40K and other variables, except for 232Th, where the correlation is weak. The high positive correlation coefficient between 232Th and 238U is attributed to the natural co-occurrence of the radium and thorium decay series in the environment.
