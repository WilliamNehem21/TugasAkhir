The atel logic is widely used for reasoning about knowledge, time, and strategies, but there are still unresolved issues related to its interpretation. This paper contributes to the ongoing discussion by demonstrating that agents do not need to know a specific strategy to possess a capability, and they can have strategic knowledge derived from their understanding of the strategies in play. The paper presents an alternative interpretation of atel over extensive game forms, using strategy domination for abilities and incorporating strategy profiles to address strategic knowledge. The authors illustrate interpretation issues using small examples and characterize perfect recall and perfect memory.

The paper discusses the application of atel logic to the formal analysis of various systems, including distributed protocols, synchronization, security, and extensive games such as argumentation, auctions, and language games. The original interpretation of atel had computational advantages but suffered from counterintuitive properties, leading to refinements. The paper provides a new interpretation for atel, focusing on turn-based systems and suggesting that this approach could be extended to concurrent systems.

The paper challenges the notion that a coalition must know a specific strategy to be able to achieve something, arguing that this condition is too restrictive. It proposes that a coalition can act without identifying a foolproof strategy, choosing instead the best strategy available that is not dominated by any other strategy. The authors also argue that a coalition's knowledge does not solely depend on the state of a game or system but also on the strategies they employ, describing this as strategic knowledge. They propose an interpretation in which all agents know their own strategies, emphasizing that this is not the final answer but a demonstration of how to incorporate strategic knowledge.

The paper defines extensive games as models for agent interaction with competing objectives and describes an extensive game as a detailed representation of such interactions. It introduces the concept of a game form, an extensive game without a preference function, and discusses the idea of extensive games with imperfect information. The authors see a game form as a description of a protocol for interaction between autonomous agents with private preferences and restricted communication.

The paper presents examples to illustrate the strategic abilities of agents in game forms and discusses the conditions under which agents can have a uniform strategy to achieve specific goals. It concludes that demanding agents to have a uniform strategy from a unique starting point is sufficient to obtain intuitive results, but the situation is more complex when starting from multiple points. In these cases, agents may have multiple undominated strategies and may need to choose among them without knowing the current situation, leading to uncertainty in strategy selection. The paper argues that agents can achieve goals with undominated strategies, even when uncertainty exists about the current situation.
