This paper presents new findings that partly address the explanation of a particular phenomenon. Specifically, our results demonstrate that a broad range of realizability-style constructions consistently yield c, rc, or heo (as appropriate). The proofs rely heavily on a technique developed by Dag Normann. In this concise summary, we present precise statements of our theorems and briefly outline the proof methodology.

Furthermore, we introduce the concept of realizing a type structure over a partial combinatory algebra (PCA). This concept is a straightforward adaptation of Definition 4.1. In the more comprehensive context of applicative morphisms, a single notion of realization suffices.
