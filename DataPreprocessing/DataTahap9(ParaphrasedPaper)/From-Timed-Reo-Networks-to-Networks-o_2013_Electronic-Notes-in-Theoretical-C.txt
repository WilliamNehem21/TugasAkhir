In the field of software engineering, a service refers to an independent software entity that operates on one or more machines and provides specific functionality to its clients. These clients are typically other software systems that require the offered functionality to achieve their own objectives. Consequently, within a single system, various services interact with each other, exchanging data or collaborating to carry out specific activities. Because there is often limited information available about the functionalities provided by different services, ensuring effective communication between these services is crucial.

Creating a connector that implements a specific behavioral protocol is not a straightforward task. There are several tools available to assist connector designers in identifying potential errors in their models, such as the animation engine, which displays a flash animated simulation of designed connectors. For more complex connectors, formal verification can be carried out using simulation and model-checking tools integrated with the Extensible Coordination Tools (ECT), an environment for designing and analyzing Reo models. Previous work involved mapping timed Reo to the process algebra mCRL2, which provides a special operator for defining relative time constraints on the occurrences of process actions. However, the verification capabilities of the mCRL2 toolset with respect to time properties are currently limited. Specifically, a model checker dealing with real-time, time-aware simulation facilities, and a system property specification language supporting time constraints are not available. Therefore, a more powerful tool is needed for analyzing timed workflow and service composition models designed with Reo.

This paper aims to bridge this gap by integrating ECT with UPPAAL, a robust and widely used toolset for real-time system modeling, validation, and verification. In UPPAAL, distributed real-time systems are modeled as networks of communicating timed automata. Rigorous modeling of the behavior of concurrent and distributed systems has been shown to be highly effective in uncovering design flaws. The subsequent sections of the paper are organized as follows: Section 2 explains the basics of Reo, Section 3 describes the UPPAAL networks of extended timed automata, Section 4 explains how Reo channels are modeled with UPPAAL timed automata templates, Section 5 illustrates the use of UPPAAL to analyze a sample Reo workflow model, and finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and outlines future work.

The paper further discusses the formal semantics of a Reo connector, highlighting the most basic model that expresses the semantics of Reo using constraint automata. The behavior of a Reo circuit can be obtained from the semantics of its constituent parts using the product operator. The paper then delves into the detailed technical aspects of UPPAAL, describing the behavior of UPPAAL channels, defining automata templates in UPPAAL models, and addressing the modeling of various Reo nodes and their corresponding channels in UPPAAL.

The paper concludes with a discussion of the approach presented for mapping Reo networks to networks of timed automata for their timed analysis using the UPPAAL model checker. Comparisons with related work show that the proposed approach provides a more straightforward method using the well-established UPPAAL model checker. The authors also highlight the need for future work to establish the formal relation between the semantics of constraint automata and the generated UPPAAL networks of timed automata. Furthermore, the paper presents findings from related work discussing a translation from a subset of constraint automata to timed automata in the context of schedulability analysis of real-time actors coordinated by Reo.
