The assessment and ongoing enhancement of software maintenance are vital factors in elevating the quality of software. However, the software maintenance function lacks appropriate management models to facilitate these activities, leading to a lack of attention and planning. This paper provides an overview of measurement practices introduced for level 3 and higher in the software maintenance maturity model (S3M).

There is a perception that software maintenance is costly and ineffective, resulting in a crisis management approach and a dearth of widely applicable best practices. The software engineering community anticipates that improving the maintenance process will result in enhanced product quality. Nevertheless, existing technical solutions developed by researchers are challenging to implement, particularly within small maintenance groups with limited resources. While some organizations have implemented successful maintenance best practices, these are not widely recognized and need better documentation for industry-wide adoption.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the interfaces and key processes of software maintenance, while Section 3 introduces measurement topics for practices at maturity level 3 and higher. Advanced measurement practices at maturity level 3 and higher are presented in Section 4, with a summary and acknowledgments in Section 5. The IEEE 1061 standard offers examples of measures without specifying particular ones, and the IEEE 982.2 guide proposes a dictionary of measures for reliability, an important characteristic of software quality.

Service level agreements (SLAs) are crucial for documenting consensus on maintenance services, but many IS/IT organizations still lack them. SLAs should reflect the customer's desire for seamless service while also accommodating the responsibilities of software maintainers and other IS/IT components. Integrated measurement of all software components necessitates the involvement of all relevant groups, and an overarching SLA encompassing all IS/IT services should be established.

Section 3 details the sources used for identifying advanced measurement practices of the maturity model. At maturity level 3, measures of process, product, and service have been defined and implemented, with the integration of measurement into organizational improvement projects. Software maintenance measures should be aligned with software development and operations measures, and key activities, services, and quality attributes of application software should be identified for measurement. Measurement objectives and baselines should be documented in line with the organization's business objectives and specific context.
