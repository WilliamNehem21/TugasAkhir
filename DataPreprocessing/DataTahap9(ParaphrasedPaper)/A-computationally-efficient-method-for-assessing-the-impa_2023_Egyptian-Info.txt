Current machine learning techniques allow for the creation of evolving viral cyber threats that can circumvent traditional protective measures of information systems. It is anticipated that attackers will soon have the capability to automatically generate new viral cyber threats with properties tailored to specific target environments, incorporating heuristic properties and swarm organization. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop models to study the behavior of such cyber threats and devise effective countermeasures.

Previous studies have examined the impact of viral cyber threats using various methods such as autoregression and Fourier analysis to predict the trend of cyber infections. In the context of critical infrastructure networks, models that account for the topology of blocking nodes become relevant. One such model is the cayley tree structure with a random number of connections, which facilitates the calculation of infection probabilities of specific nodes based on their distance from the source of cyber infection in a heterogeneous network. Additionally, large-scale graph technology has been utilized to incorporate hierarchical growth processes in network structures.

To conduct experiments, data for a set of elements was obtained from the situation center of the information technology department of Vinnytsia city council. The study focused on the distributed information and communication system that manages video surveillance and traffic lights in Vinnytsia, involving over 1000 elements susceptible to viral cyber threats.

The article investigates the influence of an active viral cyber threat on a high-availability cluster using the theory of Markov processes, graph theory, and mathematical analysis. The primary contribution of the research is the development of a computationally efficient method for estimating the average number of affected elements in the target high-availability cluster under the influence of an active viral cyber threat. Furthermore, the study proposes a criterion for assessing the trend of a quantitative parameter of the model at medium and long time intervals. To achieve these results, the authors formulated a Markov model of the process, established a compact metric for assessing the average number of affected elements, devised a method for estimating the metric's parameter, and proposed a criterion for evaluating the metric's trend over time.
