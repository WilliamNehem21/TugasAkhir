The study focused on the azomethine group and utilized polarographic data and spectrophotometric methods to determine the acid-base pKa values. A reduction mechanism pathway was proposed, and it was found that the azomethine group exists in the azo form due to the presence of the nitro group in the para position. The reduction of the nitro group (6e wave, wave c) occurs at a more negative potential than the 4e reduction wave of the azomethine linkage, highlighting the significance of the nitro group in distinguishing between an azo or hydrazone tautomeric structure of the azomethine linkage. This differentiation is important and is evident in the literature on azo compounds with a nitro substituent at any location.
