The toxic effects of arsenic on the nervous system are well-documented, as it can lead to increased vulnerability of the brain to oxidative stress. Thymoquinone (TQ), an antioxidant derived from Nigella sativa seeds, has shown strong potential in scavenging free radicals and mitigating cell damage caused by oxidative substances. This study aimed to explore the protective effects of TQ against arsenic-induced neurotoxicity. Rats were subjected to different treatments for 21 days, including distilled water, sodium arsenate, TQ, and a combination of arsenate followed by TQ. The researchers examined various physiological parameters in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brain stem, and conducted histopathological studies on the cerebellum.

The results indicated that arsenate treatment led to decreased levels of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and acetylcholine esterase (AChE), as well as reduced activities of Na+-K+-ATPase and antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in the tested brain regions. Conversely, post-treatment with TQ resulted in increased levels of NE, DA, AChE, and Na+-K+-ATPase activities, along with a restoration of antioxidant enzyme levels. These findings suggest that TQ ameliorated the neurotoxic effects of arsenate and alleviated oxidative stress within the nervous system through its antioxidant mechanisms.

Neurotoxicity can arise from exposure to various chemicals that impact the nervous system, leading to neuronal cell degeneration and a range of symptoms including brain damage, dementia, anxiety, depression, limb weakness, and visual impairment. Natural and synthetic toxic substances known as neurotoxins, such as arsenic, aluminum, mercury, copper, lead, and manganese, are capable of disrupting normal nervous system activity and causing neuronal damage.

Arsenic is commonly found as an environmental contaminant in groundwater and can also be encountered through other sources such as incinerated wood products containing arsenic, indoor air polluted by coal combustion, tainted foods, kitchen dust ingestion, and tobacco smoke inhalation. It is considered one of the most significant toxicants posing potential threats to human health. Arsenic exposure can render the brain tissue vulnerable to free radical assault, leading to abnormal apoptosis of neural cells. Additionally, it can breach the blood-brain barrier, invade the brain parenchyma, and induce brain toxicity, resulting in altered cholinergic and monoaminergic functions.

Sodium arsenate and TQ were utilized in the study, with TQ being dissolved in DMSO and subsequently diluted with normal saline. The nitrite/nitrate assay was employed to measure levels of these compounds in brain homogenates, and the resulting data showed a significant increase in NE levels following TQ treatment, as well as a decrease in DA concentrations in arsenate-treated rats compared to control values.

In summary, the study revealed that TQ supplementation could counteract the neurotoxic effects of arsenic by restoring normal neurotransmitter and antioxidant enzyme levels, thereby mitigating oxidative stress in the nervous system. These findings suggest the potential of TQ as a therapeutic agent for combating neurotoxicity induced by arsenic exposure.
