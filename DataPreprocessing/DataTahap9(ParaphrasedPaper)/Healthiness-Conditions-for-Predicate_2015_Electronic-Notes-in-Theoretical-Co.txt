This paper presents a framework for establishing criteria for the healthiness of predicate transformers. The framework is believed to be applicable to most situations where healthiness conditions for predicate transformers have been developed, and may serve as a guide for discovering new results. However, it also has significant limitations.

In denotational semantics, two complementary approaches are distinguished, referred to as state transformer semantics and predicate transformer semantics. The paper uses the example of angelic nondeterminism to illustrate its aims. The semantic domains are directed complete partially ordered sets (dcpos), and the maps are Scott-continuous, meaning they preserve the order and suprema of directed subsets.

The methods outlined in the paper can be applied to examples found in existing literature, particularly in the context of nondeterminism and probability. The monads in these examples are typically presented in the form of powerdomains. To apply the results presented in the paper, one must find functional representations for these powerdomains (e.g., frx). The paper is an extension of prior work by the author, which includes explicit examples not covered due to space constraints. Readers are encouraged to refer to the original source for these examples.

The framework for deriving healthiness conditions for predicate transformers, as developed in the paper, is quite limited in scope, despite its applicability to most known situations. However, it may not be suitable for characterizing predicate transformers in scenarios that do not fit within this framework.

The research was conducted within the category of directed complete partially ordered sets (dcpos) and Scott-continuous functions. The findings are particularly relevant to the subcategory of sets within this framework. Similar arguments can be applied in other Cartesian closed categories, such as the category of qcb-spaces (quotients of countably based topological spaces) and the category of posets (partially ordered sets) and order-preserving functions. In a more relaxed setting, poset enriched categories would be necessary.

The author, Hasuo, has addressed predicate transformers for monads enriched with order in a very general manner. It is noted that results from his main examples on weakest precondition semantics for two-player games can be obtained using the methods outlined in the paper, by transferring them to the category of posets which encompasses the category of sets.

The paper has been subject to review, and the referees expressed a desire to see a compelling new example where the methods described in the paper can be applied. However, it is indicated that the theorems 6.4 and 7.6 point to significant limitations of predicate transformer semantics; it is uncommon for operations to commute or subcommute. This suggests that extending beyond known examples may be challenging, and if operations do not commute, identifying a manageable collection of operations that do can be a difficult task, particularly in more complex cases.
