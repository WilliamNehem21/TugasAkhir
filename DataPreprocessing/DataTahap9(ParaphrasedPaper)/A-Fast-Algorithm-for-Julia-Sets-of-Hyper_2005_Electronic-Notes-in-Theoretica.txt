In this section, we will introduce fundamental concepts and notations pertaining to Julia sets. Many of the findings outlined in this section are derived from a comprehensive source, and additional valuable references include...

As is standard, we denote the n-th iterate and the derivative of a function f by fn and f', respectively. A complex number z is considered a fixed point of a function f if f(z) = z. Z is designated a periodic point of f if it is a fixed point of some iterate of f. A fixed point z is labeled as repelling, attracting, or indifferent if f'(z) > 1, f'(z) < 1, or f'(z) = 1, respectively. Similar classifications apply to periodic points (with f being replaced by a sufficient iterate). A critical point of f is defined as z for which f'(z) = 0.

That is, the preimages of z0, the preimages of the preimages of z0, and so forth. Concurrently, we strive to identify a set A of open balls B(z) of points z in these preimages and an index n such that: a) z âˆª u(z), b) for each u(z) a.

Several observations on this process are pertinent: given that we can only compute the mentioned sets up to finite precision, properties a) to d) are intended to be assured by the algorithm. Lemma 5.1 provides sufficient leeway to achieve this through appropriate approximations. Another issue concerns the roots of q.

A constant c'' that does not depend on k. Consequently, in accordance with Corollary 1, we can initially utilize the algorithm reduce([log2 n(k)|) and subsequently address the reduced problem using the algorithm reduce(2), which is bounded by exponential time. This approach results in a polynomially time-bounded algorithm, as the length of the reduced input is less than log2 n(k) = log2 k compared to the original input length of k. By using reduce(log2 n(k)) and this polynomially time-bounded algorithm, we obtain the following outcome.
