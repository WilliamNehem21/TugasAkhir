The author presents a model as an approach to addressing complex documentation tasks, facilitating consistency across documents by referencing a common underlying model. This model also aids in overseeing and implementing change management. Additionally, the model ensures consistency in the design process. The structure of the document is derived from the use of structured text, which is generated by a repository of syntax constructors. The structured text incorporates a hierarchical structure through the nesting of constructors. The user operates tool interactions through a specific document known as the normative design document (NDD), which is closely linked to the datastore, serving as the declaration point for all entries in the datastore within the current project. The user directs the system to process a command, which in turn triggers the relevant module to carry out the desired transaction using the tool. The output of the transaction is presented in the command's output arguments, and new facts are added to the datastore. Moreover, error messages are managed and displayed appropriately to the user.
