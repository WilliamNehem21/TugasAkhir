This paper discusses a method for designing a simulation platform for simulating network attacks and defenses. It begins by analyzing the components and functions of the platform, and then uses the Visio second development method to build the virtual network topology. The paper also delves into the parsing of virtual network topology and presents a flow sheet describing its relative aspects. Finally, the paper provides an example to test the platform's performance, and the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The paper presents a design method for a virtual network attack and defense simulation platform, analyzing its composition and function. It explores the establishment and parsing of virtual network topology using the Visio secondary development method and provides a simulation as well.

Creating a virtual network topology is crucial for establishing a virtual network environment, and there are various methods to achieve this. The paper highlights the effectiveness of the Visio secondary development technology for simplifying the development of the graphics editing module and programming software capabilities. Thus, the paper employs Visio secondary development technology to create the virtual network topology.

The paper discusses the capabilities of the Microsoft Office Visio 2003 ActiveX control (Visio drawing control) to embed full functionality for the Visio application as a component. It describes how the control can be driven by events or codes in the host application, and provides a chart production environment within the user interface of the application.

In describing the establishment of the mold, the paper outlines the mapping out of the drawing cell symbol in the drawing area, followed by the use of the shape sheet spreadsheet to set properties for the drawing cell and the subsequent dragging of the completed drawing cell to a new mold, which can be saved with a new name.

Furthermore, the paper details the aspects of programming control on the drawing cell, including obtaining information of the drawing cell and writing information to the drawing cell, and controlling the state. It explains the function shape.getcells() for obtaining information of the drawing cell and determining specific values selected from the shape sheet in accordance with relevant parameters.

In conclusion, the paper analyzes the composition and function of the virtual network attack and defense simulation platform, and presents the creation and parsing of virtual network topology using Visio secondary development technology. It then tests the platform with network attack and defense instances, demonstrating that the main function of the platform is realized, and the design objectives are achieved.
