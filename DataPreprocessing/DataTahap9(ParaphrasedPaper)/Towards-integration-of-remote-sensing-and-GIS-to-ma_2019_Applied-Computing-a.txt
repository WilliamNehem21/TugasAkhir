The primary objective of this study is to examine, monitor, map, plan, allocate, and locate government primary healthcare centers (PHCCs) within a specific research area. The data obtained from this investigation will be stored in a database. Additionally, the research aims to assess the supply and demand of PHCCs, manage healthcare facilities in accordance with the standards set by the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP), and integrate remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) for optimal healthcare services. The study is conducted in the El-Salam medical region, Cairo, Egypt, which is a densely populated urban area. The methodology involves several procedures, including the use of satellite images, GIS, demographic and health data, and field data. The results indicate a shortage of PHCCs in the selected area, although this shortage is more theoretical than practical due to the presence of other governorate and private health services that should be further examined.

Egypt's healthcare system faces various challenges in improving the health and well-being of its citizens. The growing population with longer life expectancy places pressure on the healthcare system, and a lack of knowledge and awareness of responsibilities can lead to frustration or reluctance in individuals. The main objective of the primary healthcare (PHC) system is to enhance the overall health of the population throughout their lifetime.

PHC focuses on individual patients and considers all health determinants. It addresses significant community issues through preventive, curative, and rehabilitative services. In Egypt, PHCCs are crucial for providing high-quality healthcare services. Collecting information and data about PHCCs is essential for improving healthcare and developing monitoring plans. However, PHCCs are often constructed without sustainable development plans and fail to consider the rapid growth of urban areas and populations. Therefore, there is a need for further research in this area.

The World Health Organization (WHO) plays a vital role in addressing public health concerns at the international level. The Alma-Ata Declaration emphasizes the urgent need for action to promote the health of people worldwide, including various services such as income, housing, education, and environment.

The PHCCs program in the USA and Malaysia, as well as the guidelines set by the Egyptian MOHP, provide examples of standards and practices for PHC units. The proposed methodology for this study involves several steps, including data collection, satellite image pre-processing, database design for PHCCs, population projection, and evaluation of results.

The study also examines the spatial distribution of PHCCs and considers accessibility for the population, taking into account factors such as road networks and public transportation. Furthermore, it addresses the predicted population growth and the challenges of acquiring land for constructing new PHCCs.

In summary, the study highlights the importance of advanced techniques, data collection, and adherence to international and national guidelines in the planning and management of PHCCs. It also emphasizes the need to consider alternative solutions and conduct further research to address the challenges faced by the healthcare system in Egypt.
