The use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) has transformed the construction industry by providing an integrated platform for design, modeling, asset planning, and collaboration. However, BIM tools often use native formats that present challenges for data reuse and exchange. In response to this issue, the paper proposes a method for mapping BIM data into specific domain concepts and advocates for the use of semantic web tools to facilitate data and information exchange. The approach involves enriching domain ontologies through the mapping of BIM entities and attributes to domain classes and properties. The paper emphasizes the application of this method in the context of facility management, particularly within the airport operations domain.

The paper highlights the increasing adoption of semantic web technologies within the architecture, engineering, construction, and operations (AEC/O) sectors, positioning them as complementary to BIM software. It underscores the utility of ontologies in formalizing domain knowledge and enabling semantic interoperability in information exchange between computer applications. The paper also discusses the benefits of using OWL formats and cites various contributions in the AEC/O field that leverage ontologies to facilitate interoperability and information mapping from BIM models into different business processes.

Furthermore, the paper outlines a method for mapping BIM information into domain concepts to enable reuse by applications. This approach aims to enhance the retrieval, exchange, and utilization of BIM models within specific application areas, with a particular focus on facility management. The authors exemplify the practical application of the method through a case study based on the management of airport facilities.

The paper discusses the benefits of utilizing OWL formats and highlights the interest of multiple authors in transforming express schemas to OWL formats. It references specific ontologies, such as OntoSTEP and IFCOWL, and suggests that an intermediate mapping mechanism between the IFC file and the semantic data on the specific domain would simplify interoperation and enhance knowledge extraction.

The proposed method involves the use of a mapping file containing global and specific parameters for each domain class, facilitating the correct mapping between BIM entities and domain classes. The method involves classifying BIM elements based on IFC entities and types, creating custom IFC properties for unclassified elements, and using the mapping file to drive the classification. It also allows for enriching the management information used to provide infrastructure services.

To validate the proposed method, a case study based on airport operations was implemented, using Java and Apache Jena semantic web libraries. The paper provides an overview of the mapping file and the RDF output file resulting from the application of the method to the case study. The case study is based on a subset of the AIRM-MONO ontology, and the complete mapping file used in the implementation of the case study is presented within the paper.
