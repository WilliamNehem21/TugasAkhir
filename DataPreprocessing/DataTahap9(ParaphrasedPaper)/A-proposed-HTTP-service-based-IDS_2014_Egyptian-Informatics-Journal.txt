Nowadays, the majority of universities, organizations, and companies deliver their services using computer networks and internet technologies, with many tasks being carried out through web-based applications. However, the internet can be exploited by attackers to breach local networks and gain access to confidential information or compromise network resources. To mitigate these risks, security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) are utilized.

An IDS based on the integration of Snort and Bayesian theorem is proposed for implementation in a cloud environment. This IDS captures packets from the network and utilizes Snort for signature-based detection, storing suspicious packets in a log database. Subsequently, a Bayesian classifier identifies intrusion and normal packets, logging intrusion packets in an alert database and allowing normal packets into the system. This IDS achieves a 96% detection rate and a 1.5% false positive rate. While the sequential filtering techniques may result in processing overhead and increased delay, parallel execution of both filtering techniques through parallel programming can potentially mitigate this delay.

In this IDS, network connections are classified as either normal or attack events, with the IDS having the capability to classify connections without necessarily identifying the specific type of attack. Furthermore, the classification process may yield multiple classes, with one class for normal connections and a separate class for each attack type, enabling the IDS to identify the specific type of attack.

Following the exclusion of records causing false positives (e.g., 344 normal records that lead to false positives were removed after a certain step), the IDS had zero false positives and zero false negatives, marking the end of the training phase. The resulting data set from the training phase is then used as the training data set in the subsequent testing phase, consisting of 20 features. During the testing phase, the HTTP data set with the same 20 features is employed to evaluate the IDS's performance.
