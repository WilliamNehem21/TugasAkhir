The research on circular-arc graphs and their subclasses, including helly, normal, and proper subclasses, has been extensively explored in the academic literature. However, the study of circular-arc bigraphs, a bipartite variation of circular-arc graphs, is relatively new, with limited existing research on this class and its proper and unit subclasses. This paper presents a helly subclass for circular-arc bigraphs, based on the concept of bipartite-helly families, and provides a polynomial-time recognition algorithm for it. Additionally, it introduces an alternative proper circular-arc bigraph subclass, as well as two different normal circular-arc bigraph subclasses based on the definition of normal circular-arc graphs. The paper also discusses containment relations between the different proper and normal classes.

Circular-arc bigraphs are a bipartite variation of circular-arc graphs in which a bipartite graph is considered a circular-arc bigraph if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between its vertices and a family of arcs on a circle, such that for every pair of vertices in different parts, they are neighbors precisely if their corresponding arcs intersect. While matrix-based characterizations and a polynomial-time recognition algorithm for the proper subclass of circular-arc bigraphs exist, the class has not been widely studied. Furthermore, no previous mention of a helly or normal subclass of circular-arc bigraphs can be found in existing literature.

The paper also defines helly interval bigraphs as graphs admitting a bi-interval model that satisfies the bipartite-helly property. It establishes that a bipartite graph is a helly interval bigraph if and only if its square is an interval graph. Moreover, the paper introduces a similar result for helly circular-arc bigraphs in lemma 3.2 and provides thorough definitions and notations for the study.
