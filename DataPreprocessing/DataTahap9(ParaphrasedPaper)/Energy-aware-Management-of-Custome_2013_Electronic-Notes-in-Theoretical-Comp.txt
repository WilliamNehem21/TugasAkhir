This paper discusses an optimization issue in the computer services market, where a service provider utilizes a cluster of servers to offer various services to users. Users pay for job execution and expect a certain quality of service. The provider must balance the trade-off between minimizing energy costs by powering up fewer servers and maximizing revenue by using more servers to accept incoming jobs without penalties. Dynamic policies are needed to determine server power-up/down and admission policies in response to demand changes. The problem addressed in this paper appears to be novel, despite existing literature on server allocation and energy-saving. The paper compares performance of different policies through simulation experiments, considering various factors like server allocation and stream arrival rates. Additionally, the paper highlights the challenges in making the process Markov and discusses assumptions about server power-up/down times and policy decision intervals.

The study's novel contribution lies in its focus on the economics of user streams, the associated admission policies, and the dynamic powering up and down of servers. Previous related work has examined different aspects, such as individual job costs, server allocation among user types, and the costs associated with server provisioning. The paper suggests that future research could explore the allocation of active servers to different user streams and the potential costs associated with switching servers between different queues.
