The process of enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) involves several methods. To begin, the input data is partitioned into smaller segments and the C/A code is removed, followed by the utilization of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) based parallel code phase search technique. This technique, referred to as coherent detection, was described by Bao-yen and Tusi in 2005. In contrast, non-coherent integration involves summing the blocks of squared correlation values from the acquisition process, resulting in improved correlation and a twofold increase in signal strength relative to noise.


The differential and spiking filter combined differential detection methods were examined in relation to a 10 ms integration period for coherent detection. Due to issues related to the transition of navigation data, the integration time cannot exceed 20 ms. Consequently, this method is capable of detecting a signal with a C/N0 level of 35 dB-Hz with 100% probability. For non-coherent integration over 36 ms, the method achieves 100% probability of detection only within the signal range of 30 dB-Hz. However, both methods are unable to detect a weak signal at a power level of 20 dB-Hz. Differential detection also faces challenges in detecting the signal, achieving only a 50% detection rate at the same input power level. When the inverse spiking filter is integrated with the differential detection, it performs better and is capable of identifying PRN 3 with a 90% detection rate.
