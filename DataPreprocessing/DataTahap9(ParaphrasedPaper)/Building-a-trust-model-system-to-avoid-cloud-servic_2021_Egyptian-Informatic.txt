Although trust management and reputation attack detection systems are available, cloud computing systems continue to face targeted attacks from various sources. The existing literature indicates a lack of detection strategies specifically aimed at reputation attacks. This study aims to provide insights into the effective use of reputation attack detection for evaluating cloud services and addressing reputation attacks that undermine trust assessment in cloud computing. By doing so, this research will make a substantial contribution to the literature on enhancing the security and privacy of cloud services for both consumers and providers, thereby improving the overall user experience.

Cloud computing platforms, as publicly accessible systems, have significantly expanded the storage capabilities of data while eliminating the need for additional hardware. However, the digital availability of data in the public domain poses challenges for privacy and security, as trust management services are vulnerable to security threats that can manipulate the reputation of entities. Sybil attacks, for instance, involve a single entity emulating multiple behaviors through multiple accounts, which may impact the reputation of online systems. This study will review the literature to determine effective approaches for detecting reputation attacks and preventing sybil attacks.

In the proposed design, the trust management system (TMS) will evaluate the reliability of cloud service providers and the extent to which consumers can depend on them. It will also ensure the provision of promised cloud services and evaluate rules based on feedback from service providers. The TMS will track user activities for easy identification of unauthorized consumers or attackers and oversee the authorization of feedback into the system. Additionally, the role behavior analyzer will assess shared resource access in relation to trust regulations, link roles to collect information, and report any potential data leakage.

The research will aim to address concerns surrounding cloud service trust by introducing additional security criteria to the trust model and proposing solutions to mitigate other types of reputation attacks that threaten the security of the cloud computing environment in future work.
