The truck scale is a crucial device for weighing vehicles, and the practice of truck parking cheating can result in substantial financial losses for businesses. This paper introduces a novel method for detecting truck parking cheating by analyzing voltage waveforms. By comparing the number of turning points in the output voltage signal waveform with the number of truck axles, the method can identify the presence of truck parking cheating. Based on this principle, a detection system is designed using an 8031 microcontroller unit to transmit the voltage signal to a control computer. Experimental results demonstrate that the system can effectively detect instances of truck parking cheating in real time.

The weighing platform is equipped with four transducers, which generate mV signals proportional to the weight of the truck due to deformation caused by the truck's force. The output voltage signal is amplified and transmitted to the system control module (SCM), and the truck data is then sent to a central computer. The weight of the goods is calculated as the difference between the fully loaded and empty truck weights.

When the truck wheels are not entirely on the platform, the output voltage waveform deviates from the normal condition. For example, if the front wheels drive off the weighing station, the pressure on the transducers decreases, leading to a smaller output voltage signal and the appearance of an additional downward inflection point in the voltage curve. Conversely, when another truck's wheels are on the platform during weighing, the pressure on the transducers increases, resulting in a larger output voltage signal and the appearance of an additional rising inflection point in the voltage curve.

In summary, this paper presents a new method for detecting truck parking cheating in truck scales based on analyzing the output voltage signal waveform from the weighing sensors. Experimental tests conducted at a factory's truck scale weighing platform confirm that the proposed detection system effectively identifies instances of truck parking cheating in real time, providing an efficient means of detecting cheating methods in truck scales.
