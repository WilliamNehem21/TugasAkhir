We propose a lexicalized representation of dependency grammar that encompasses both immediate dependence and linear precedence. Our approach involves the differentiation of two independent but mutually restrictive dependency trees: an id tree of syntactic dependencies and an lp tree of topological dependencies. The id tree is non-ordered, non-projective, and its edges are assigned grammatical functions as labels. The lp tree, on the other hand, is ordered and projective, representing authorized linearizations, and its edges are labeled by topological fields. We conceptualize the lp tree as originating from the id tree through a process of emancipation guided by lexicalized constraints and principles. In this article, we outline the formalization of valid id/lp analyses and demonstrate how they can be characterized as solutions of a constraint satisfaction problem, which can be resolved through constraint programming and serves as the foundation of our implementation.

We depict the principles governing climbing conditions and have previously applied them to an analysis of word-order phenomena in the German verb complex. In this paper, we concentrate on their formalization and articulate a precise formal well-formedness condition that defines valid analyses. Moreover, this condition can be interpreted as a constraint program, forming the core of our implementation.

Principle 2 states that a node may not ascend through a barrier, meaning none of its id ancestors, up to but excluding its host, may impede its emancipation. We only consider a simplified concept of barrier in this article, where a node can obstruct a set of syntactic relations.

Regarding verbs, our grammar makes a distinction between coherent position (field vc) and extraposed position (field xf). Although xf is denoted as the extraposition field, it should not be perceived as solely dedicated to the extraposition phenomenon. For instance, both "oberfeldumstellung" and extraposition can be elucidated by migration to the xf field. As previously explicated, several phenomena including vp extraposition, partial vp extraposition, optional auxiliary flip, v-projection raising, intermediate placement, obligatory auxiliary flip, double auxiliary flip, and obligatory coherence can be modeled as arising from the interaction of our lexicalized constraints.
