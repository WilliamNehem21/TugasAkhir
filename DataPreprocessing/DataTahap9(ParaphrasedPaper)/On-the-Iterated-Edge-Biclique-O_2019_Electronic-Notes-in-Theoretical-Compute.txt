The clique graph can be viewed as a function that maps graphs to graphs. The graph obtained by applying the clique operator k times is known as the iterated clique graph kk(g). This concept was originally introduced by Hedetniemi and Slater. Several studies have focused on characterizing the behavior of graphs within the clique-helly graph class, particularly those that converge to the trivial graph. Additionally, divergent graphs have been considered, with families of divergent graphs being identified. Periodic graphs have also been studied, with proofs demonstrating the existence of graphs with a period i as well as graphs that converge in i steps. A number of further findings about iterated clique graphs can be found in previous literature.

A biclique is a maximal bipartite complete induced subgraph with applications in various fields, such as biology, social networks, genetics, and medicine. The biclique graph of a graph g, denoted as kb(g), is the intersection graph of all bicliques of g. While this concept has been defined and characterized, there is currently no known polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing biclique graphs. The iterated biclique graph, kbk(g), obtained by iteratively applying the biclique operator k times to g, has been introduced, and its various behaviors have been characterized. It has been demonstrated that a graph is either divergent or convergent but never periodic with a period greater than 1. General characterizations for convergent and divergent graphs were also provided.

This study examines edge-biclique graphs due to both their mathematical interest and their practical relevance in representing relationships between entities. The iterated edge-biclique graph, denoted by kbk(g), is the graph obtained by applying the edge-biclique operator k successive times to g. The paper introduces nontrivial sufficient conditions for a graph to be convergent or divergent under the kbe operator and presents conjectures aimed at fully characterizing the behavior of a graph under the kbe operator.

The rest of the work is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the necessary notation, Section 3 and Section 4 present some results about convergent and divergent graphs, and finally, in Section 5, some conjectures on the subject are outlined.
