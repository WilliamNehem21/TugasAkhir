The paper discusses systems that consist of multiple instances of a small number of fundamental building blocks. These systems can include collections of concurrent processes running the same program, as well as compositions of different types of homogeneous subsystems, such as the readers-writers protocol. Such systems often lead to state explosion during temporal logic model checking, resulting in a state graph much larger than the system description.

The paper proposes techniques for algorithmically reducing the complexity of these systems. These techniques operate on the source code, which is typically smaller than a Kripke model, making them efficient. Importantly, the reductions are exact, ensuring that the behavior of the reduced system is equivalent to that of the original system.

The paper assumes a system of concurrently executing process components using an interleaving model of computation. It allows for replicated processes, each derived from a program template, and permits the composition of fully symmetric subsystems. This approach enables the modeling of systems like readers-writers or microprocessors with separate symmetries in channels, memory addresses, and registers.

High-level modeling languages are used to specify the behavior of processes in terms of global and local variable assignments. The paper addresses the need to extract the concept of local states from the program, where a local state is defined by the valuation of local variables. The number of local states significantly impacts the efficiency of counter abstraction. The proposed techniques help in identifying situations in which monitoring a local state is unnecessary, such as when certain variable values are unused or when the local state is known to be unreachable.

Additionally, the paper presents a formal definition of the local reachability problem and discusses techniques to approximate reachable local states, drawing from concepts used in program optimization in compilers.

The paper also delves into the challenges involved in implementing synchronization constructs in modeling languages for asynchronous systems and describes an alternative approach to abstractly implement these constructs using counters, which leads to a more efficient solution.

Finally, the paper provides examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in reducing the complexity of symbolic representations and overcoming challenges related to state explosion in model checking.
