Incorporating solar energy into surface water source heat pump systems is anticipated to decrease electricity consumption and carbon emissions. This study establishes a model for a solar-surface water source heat pump system with the aim of optimizing system performance and reducing costs. An improved arithmetic optimization algorithm (IAOA), integrating elite opposition-based and nonlinear acceleration functions, is proposed to identify the optimal operation scheme. The effectiveness of the model and algorithm is validated through its application to a surface water source heat pump district energy system in Xiangtan city. Experimental results affirm that integrating solar energy into the system enhances performance and reduces operational costs. In comparison with other optimization algorithms, the IAOA demonstrates faster convergence and greater accuracy, making it an effective method for addressing solar-surface water source heat pump district energy systems.

Moreover, a household ground source heat pump system utilizing waste heat from photovoltaic power is developed to enhance net power generation and maintain soil heat balance. Previous studies have focused on the performance of solar-ground source heat pump systems, showcasing improvements in operating efficiency.

The study also explores the importance of maintaining a harmonious relationship between the exploitation and exploration phases in the arithmetic optimization algorithm. The Model-Based Oppositional Algorithm (MOA) is highlighted as a control component for balancing these phases. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the algorithm is validated through scenarios that demonstrate its advantages over existing operational schemes.
