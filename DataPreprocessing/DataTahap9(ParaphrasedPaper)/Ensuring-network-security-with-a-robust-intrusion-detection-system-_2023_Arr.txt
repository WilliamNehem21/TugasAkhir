In recent years, researchers have presented various machine learning-based intrusion detection methods using publicly available datasets. Although some machine learning models may perform well on specific datasets, they may struggle to generalize to new data from different sources. For instance, Jain et al. achieved an accuracy of over 99% for datasets such as KDDCup, CICIDS, and Cyber Clean Center (CCC). However, these models may face challenges in generalizing to new data and addressing the limitations of existing intrusion detection systems, indicating the need for more reliable and accurate approaches.

The paper provides a summary of earlier research on machine learning and detection systems for intrusions, emphasizing their strengths and weaknesses. In response to the limitations observed in existing approaches, the paper introduces an ensemble-based machine learning approach aimed at addressing these shortcomings. Various machine learning-based model approaches have been proposed over the years, and the proposed ensemble-based approach is compared with current models to demonstrate its significance in detecting intrusion and ensuring network security.

Papamartzivanos et al. developed a method for detecting network intrusions using an approach called Dendron, which involves creating decision tree (DT) classifiers using genetic algorithms (GA). They employed three distinct publicly available datasets, including NB15, achieving an average accuracy of only 52%. This indicates that the detection performance varies significantly across different datasets and cyberattacks, emphasizing the limitations of this model in adapting to new intrusions.

Another model employed by Elmasrya et al. utilized a dual particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based approach for choosing feature subsets and hyperparameters simultaneously. However, this approach was only tested on two specific IDS datasets and might not adapt well to other datasets, potentially requiring substantial computational resources.

Furthermore, Turaiki et al. used the CNN technique to evaluate their model, achieving high accuracy levels above 96% for the datasets but also exhibiting higher error rates and lower true positive rates. Prasada et al. proposed a Bayesian-rough set (BRS) feature selection-based model for intrusion detection with the CICIDS2017 dataset, attaining an accuracy of 97%. However, the reliance on specific datasets highlights the importance of high-quality, diverse datasets for training machine learning models.

To address the need for diverse and high-quality datasets, researchers have developed several new datasets for intrusion detection. These include the NF-UQ-NIDS dataset for network intrusion detection, NF-TON-IoT for IoT intrusion detection, UKM-IDS20 for intrusion detection systems, and the WSN-DS dataset for detecting intrusions in wireless sensor networks. Additionally, the NSW-NB 15 dataset and datasets from the Cyber Clean Center (CCC) were utilized for testing intrusion detection models.

The paper emphasizes the importance of data preprocessing in machine learning, as it plays a crucial role in cleaning and transforming the data to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the final model. It helps remove inconsistencies and errors, normalizes the data, and enhances its manageability for machine learning models.

The paper proposes an ensemble-based machine learning approach for intrusion detection, which combines multiple individual models to improve accuracy and robustness. Various ensemble techniques, such as bagging, gradient boosting, and stacking, are evaluated and compared based on their performances.

The evaluation of the proposed intrusion detection model, particularly with an ensemble technique like random forest, demonstrates its high accuracy and low false positive rate, indicating its potential for robust and accurate intrusion detection. The paper concludes that the proposed approach has shown promising outcomes and has the potential to enhance network security.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of machine learning-based intrusion detection methods and datasets, highlights the significance of ensemble-based approaches, and presents promising results for intrusion detection using the proposed model. The authors affirm that there are no conflicts of interest and that the submitted manuscript is original and not under consideration elsewhere. Additionally, the paper includes descriptive details of the features used in the evaluation dataset, along with the assessment of the proposed model's performance using various ensemble techniques.
