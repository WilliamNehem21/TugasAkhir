The study demonstrated the storage of procedures in state variables and their use as arguments. It also established the existence of extensions for adjoint simulations in this programming language. However, due to the allowance of procedures to have both global variables and parameters, the relationship with exponents is not directly evident, and the categorical aspects are not fully explored in the referenced work. The explicit connection with lambda calculus was only introduced later on.
