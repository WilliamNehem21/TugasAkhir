In this scholarly article, Jensen and Milner introduced the concept of "kind" as a refinement of pure bigraphs, resulting in what they termed "kind bigraphs." This refinement extends the idea of atomic and non-atomic controls, allowing a control to encompass a subset of the set of controls. They proposed assigning a kind to each node of a bigraph, which dictates the controls the nodes can contain. The formalization of this suggestion led to the development of kind bigraphs, which represents a generalization of pure bigraphs while preserving many aspects of the original theory.

The authors refined the notion of atomicity by permitting a control of a signature "k" to contain a subset of the set of controls of "k." This enhancement facilitates more accurate modeling of abstract systems, such as smart buildings, and also encompasses the sorting used to model finite CCS. Kind bigraphs retain the necessary RPO constructions for generating the labels of the canonical labeled transition systems (LTS) associated with a bigraphical system, as well as the property that bisimilarity over this LTS is a congruence. As expected, the reaction rules of kind bigraphs are more expressive than those of pure bigraphs.

Additionally, the authors discussed how modal logics for process calculi and frameworks allow specifications to be verified. They expressed interest in how the additional structure in kind bigraphs may enable a modal logic to satisfy certain specifications that pure bigraphs are incapable of meeting.

The article introduced the notion of interfaces as objects of S-categories, and kind bigraphs as the arrows. Kind bigraphs are characterized as being akin to pure bigraphs, with the key differences being that a control may only contain controls specified by the signature, and the roots and certain leaves of the place graphs must be sorted sensibly under composition. The authors aimed to demonstrate that this generalization preserves the useful properties of bigraphs, making use of the forgetful functor UK to prove many of the required properties.

The concept of relative pushout was identified as central to the theory of bigraphs, capturing the notion of minimal overlapping. The authors outlined the proofs that these constructions exist for kind and fitting bigraphs, with the full proofs provided in the technical report.

The authors highlighted the expressivity afforded by kind bigraphs, enabling the guarantee of the absence of certain controls in the set of possible parameters of a reaction rule. They presented an informal scenario demonstrating how this enhanced expressivity can introduce a level of flow-control to the dynamics of a system.

Furthermore, the authors introduced a scenario modeling an office building using a kind bigraph representation, with reaction rules encoding various behaviors related to key holders, thieves, and locked and unlocked doors. They illustrated how the expressiveness of kind bigraphs facilitates the formulation of flow-control rules in the system dynamics.

Lastly, the authors expressed the desire to define a modal logic where it is possible to prove that, starting from a state with all doors locked, all keyholders outside the rooms, and a thief present, a thief will eventually gain access to an unlocked room. This logic would serve as a means to analyze and verify security specifications within the bigraphical reactive system.
