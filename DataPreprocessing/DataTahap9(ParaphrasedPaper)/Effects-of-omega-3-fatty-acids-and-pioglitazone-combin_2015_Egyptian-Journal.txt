Worldwide, the prevalence of diabetes among diabetic patients is a significant concern. The Middle East and North Africa have seen a high incidence of diabetes in adults, with about 1 in 10 adults being affected. Egypt, in particular, ranks among the top 10 countries with the highest number of individuals with diabetes, totaling 7.5 million in 2013, with expectations for this number to increase to 13.1 million by 2035. Diabetes, characterized by hyperglycemia, is predominantly associated with type 2 diabetes, which represents 90-95% of diabetic cases and is largely influenced by social and lifestyle factors that can be managed. Obesity, for instance, contributes to insulin resistance in fat, skeletal muscle, and liver, subsequently leading to type 2 diabetes. In addition to medical intervention, lifestyle modifications should also be considered for the management of type 2 diabetes.

Research has shown the potential benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in managing type 2 diabetes and its related complications through their anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering effects. Studies in animals have demonstrated that these fatty acids can prevent insulin resistance, obesity, and dyslipidemia. Additionally, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has emerged as a significant hormone in regulating glucose and lipid homeostasis, with potential glucose-lowering effects through various mechanisms, including the stimulation of glucose uptake and the preservation of beta-cell function and survival.

In animal-based studies using a high-fat diet, the effects of omega-3 fatty acids and pioglitazone on diabetic rats were investigated. These studies found that omega-3 fatty acids could decrease fasting blood glucose and triglyceride levels, while also exhibiting a synergistic triglyceride-lowering effect along with pioglitazone. Furthermore, omega-3 fatty acids were shown to lower total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations through various mechanisms related to lipid metabolism.

The role of FGF21 in regulating carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and its potential as a compensatory mechanism in insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes, has been highlighted in various animal and human studies. Moreover, the regulation of FGF21 by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) activation and its correlations with fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and lipid profiles have been investigated in several studies. 

In summary, the prevalence of diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, is a significant concern in the Middle East and North Africa, with Egypt being one of the countries at the forefront of this epidemic. Omega-3 fatty acids and FGF21 have shown promise in managing type 2 diabetes and its related complications, and understanding their mechanisms of action is crucial for developing effective interventions for diabetic patients.
