The field of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by their wide range of applications, including military, environmental monitoring, healthcare, and home automation. However, due to the nature of their deployment and use, WSNs are vulnerable to security threats. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) have emerged as a crucial defense mechanism against attacks in WSNs, leading to a surge in research on developing and enhancing IDS for WSNs. This study evaluates and compares prominent anomaly-based IDS systems for hierarchical WSNs, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. It presents a comprehensive analysis of the architecture, functionality, and performance of these IDS, focusing on operational aspects and security considerations. The analysis is carried out using a set of critical evaluation metrics, covering both performance and security, to derive design principles for future research in the field.

Besides benefiting from the practical applications of WSNs, such as traffic control, they are susceptible to various types of attacks due to their remote deployment, unattended operation, and use of publicly accessible communication channels. Consequently, securing WSNs presents a crucial and challenging task.

The paper introduces a comparative evaluation of newly applied anomaly-based IDS techniques, presenting the main ideas and functionality of each technique and evaluating them based on critical metrics. It includes a comprehensive overview of IDS functionality and classification, an analysis of anomaly-based IDS for hierarchical WSN architecture, a comparison and evaluation based on performance and security metrics, and a conclusion summarizing the findings and proposing ideas for future research.

One of the evaluated anomaly-based IDS utilizes fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) with a hierarchical network architecture to detect routing attacks caused by abnormal data flows. The IDS employs an agent strategy, with multiple agents installed on each node to collaborate in intrusion detection. The agents are categorized based on their roles and work together to detect attacks.

Another evaluated anomaly-based IDS combines discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with a competitive learning self-organizing map (SOM) neural network to accurately detect anomalies. The SOM neural network extracts statistical regularities from input data vectors and encodes them in weights, while the DWT is applied first to gather input data features before feeding them into the SOM network.

The evaluation process aims to assess the accuracy of anomaly detection for each technique based on a set of different evaluation metrics, including technique processing overhead, communication overhead, and fair distribution of processing workload among network nodes. The results suggest that data mining and artificial intelligence techniques are crucial for effectively distinguishing abnormal behavior in WSNs, and feature selection and clustering parameter optimization significantly impact IDS performance. The study concludes that choosing an optimal IDS involves a trade-off between security and performance metrics.

For future research, the paper suggests that designing a new anomaly-based IDS presents a significant challenge that requires addressing performance and security aspects. It recommends exploring new feature selection methods and leveraging innovative data mining techniques to enhance the refinement process and improve IDS efficiency.
