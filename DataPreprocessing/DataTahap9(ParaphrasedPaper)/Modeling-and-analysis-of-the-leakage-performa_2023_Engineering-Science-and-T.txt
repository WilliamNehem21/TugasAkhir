The discrete hydrostatic model was employed to investigate the piston flow characteristics in this study. Chen et al. conducted calculations using the SVPP method to determine leakage between the slipper and swashplate in the pump, but lacked experimental validation. Meanwhile, Zhao et al. utilized CFD software to simulate the submerged cavitation jet in the unloading groove, as the theoretical analysis was missing.

The non-inertial forces, including FP, FSP, and FN, are relevant to the piston-slipper assembly. FP acts at the piston bottom in the direction of its axis and is concentrated at point B for ease of solution. The matrix expression for the force and force arm is presented.

Under FP, FSP, and FA, the piston-slipper assembly presses the swashplate, which results in the generation of the support reaction force, FN. The z-component force of FN cancels out the three aforementioned forces. The specific expression for this cancellation can be derived, and the reaction point of FN is at point A.

The shaft splines offset the forces FP, FSP, and FN in the z-axis. The ccb in the z-axis is influenced by a balance between the oil pressure in the piston chamber, the oil film carrying force, and the central spring force, which determines the lubrication state of the oil film. The oil pressure and the oil film carrying force form a pair of mutually canceling hydraulic forces. Ordinarily, the oil film reaction force slightly exceeds the piston chamber pressure, causing the oil film to push the ccb away from the svp. The central spring force is determined from the established oil film lubrication model.

The model for calculating SVPP leakage is derived from the established oil film lubrication model. For instance, qinner represents the leakage at the inner boundary, which can be computed by considering the longitudinal velocity and flow area of a fluid element. It should be noted that the oil film thickness is non-uniform, resulting in varying numbers of fluid elements on the inner boundary for different angles. The qinner is calculated as follows. The increase in speed and spring stiffness causes the ccb tilt azimuth to approach ODC, but the variation of the ccb tilt angle is opposite. The reasons for this tilt behavior were specifically analyzed in conjunction with ccb dynamics.

Regarding the ccb tilt azimuth, the load pressure governs the moment MCY_y of ccb, regardless of speed and spring stiffness. Additionally, an increase in spring stiffness and speed leads to improvements in the swashplate reaction force and radial inertia force, causing the ccb to tilt toward ODC.

The central spring stiffness influences the z-axis force and x-axis moment of the SVPP. A lower stiffness worsens the ccb's tilt behavior, resulting in increased leakage and metal contact. On the other hand, a higher stiffness has a beneficial effect on SVPP, but this enhancement is limited. This research received support from various grant programs.
