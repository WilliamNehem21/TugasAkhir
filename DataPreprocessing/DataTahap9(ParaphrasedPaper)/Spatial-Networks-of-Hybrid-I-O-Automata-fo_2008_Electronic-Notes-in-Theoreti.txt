The entry of calcium facilitates muscle contraction, and subsequently, a faster repolarization process brings the potential back to its resting state. The universality of these action potential phases across different species and regions suggests their potential use as a framework for constructing modeling approaches in the field.

Recent studies have utilized modified calcium models to investigate cardiac excitability and to compare with empirical data. A body of literature has established connections between the traditional continuous representation of partial differential equations and the more ad hoc calcium-based approach as an alternative method for describing reaction-diffusion systems. However, the discrete nature of calcium representation poses challenges in capturing nuanced non-stepwise features of excitation.

In this section, we present a model using an isotropic arrangement of cells in cardiac tissue behavior, using symbolic reachability analysis. Each hybrid automaton in the model represents the behavior of the action potential of a single cell, with a triangular lattice chosen to mimic the isotropic layout. Exchange of values between automata is facilitated by input/output variables, mediated by a distance-based weight function.

Furthermore, models based on hybrid automata lend themselves to formal analysis. Symbolic reachability analysis, a well-established technique in the model checking of linear hybrid systems, is now supported by various tools such as d/dt and hytech. There is the potential for extending these techniques from linear to cyclical linear hybrid automata. The study of spatial properties of hybrid automata networks is a relatively new endeavor, and in pursuing this direction, we performed automatic reachability analysis on a hybrid automaton model for the delta-notch signaling network.
