In this research, healthcare professionals examine the electrical activity of the human heart to anticipate various health conditions by analyzing data obtained from electrocardiograms (ECG). A bundle branch block (BBB) is a cardiac disorder that arises when there is an obstruction along the pathway of an electrical impulse, causing irregular heartbeats due to slower pulse transmission. This study aims to diagnose BBB using the adaptive bacterial foraging optimization (ABFO) algorithm. The ABFO algorithm is applied to data collected from the MIT/BIH arrhythmia BBB database to select the most important features from each ECG beat, which are then input into a Levenberg Marquardt neural network (LMNN) based classifier. The findings demonstrate that the proposed classification method using ABFO outperforms several recent algorithms found in the literature.

BBB develops when there is an obstruction in the conduction pathway of electrical impulses in the heart, leading to difficulty in effectively pumping blood through the circulatory system. This delay can be observed through changes in the ECG. The study aimed to automate the standard rule set followed by physicians for diagnosing heart diseases to ensure accurate diagnosis of BBB. The successful detection of ECG features is crucial for achieving good performance. The ABFO technique is employed in this study for feature extraction and optimization.

The movement of E. coli bacteria involves two steps - swimming and tumbling - driven by the flagella. This bacterium alternates between swimming in one direction and tumbling to change direction.

Here, the deviation in the last step of chemotaxis is multiplied with the previous step-size to adjust the step size accordingly and obtain the value for the next step.

In 2002, Passino designed the BFO algorithm to mimic the foraging strategy of E. coli bacteria to reduce the population size. Using the ABFO algorithm, the size of features can be reduced by selecting only the features with good fitness strategy among n bacteria, each with six features.
