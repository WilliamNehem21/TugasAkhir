Utilizing a comprehensive exploration algorithm is essential for validating a large system such as the SCA, as it is crucial to quantify the extent of verification activities carried out. When validating an SDL model, the concept of coverage, widely employed in software testing, can be adapted to measure the percentage of the system exercised by the tests performed. Various program structures are selected as the unit of coverage, with metrics like statement coverage, branch coverage, and condition coverage commonly utilized.

Adding signals to the environment (in the form of dashed lines) up to the filtering process in the state of DRT requires understanding the communication semantics of both the new component and the existing ones. This knowledge can be obtained by understanding the internal structure of the component or having MSCs describing all its potential behaviors, although the latter is only applicable to small components. Furthermore, it is observed that the closer the added component is to the starting point of the processing chain, the lower the coverage in the regression validation, as the MSC is likely to be violated earlier. Nonetheless, in such cases, reusing the MSCs will be more cost-effective, as fewer modifications will need to be made from the new component backward to the environment.
