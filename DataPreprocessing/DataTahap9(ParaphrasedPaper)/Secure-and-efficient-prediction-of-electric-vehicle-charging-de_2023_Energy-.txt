The development of battery management technology has led to an increased need for sustainable electric vehicles (EVs), with government policies promoting clean energy further fueling the demand for EVs. Research indicates a significant rise in global EV sales, with over 3 million sold in 2020 and more than 3.8 million in 2021, highlighting the growing demand for electrical power in the coming years. As the demand for EVs rises, so does the need for charging stations. However, the International Energy Agency estimates that only 8% of public EV charging stations are currently available for the total number of EVs sold. To address this, governments are taking steps to install and increase the number of both AC and DC charging stations by the end of 2022.

Ghanbanzadeh et al. proposed a hybrid approach using particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization to assess the demand for charging stations, conducting a sensitivity analysis on the reliability of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems and addressing the unit commitment problem related to EV charging demand patterns. Their research revealed that operating costs increase in relation to reliability limits.

Tan et al. utilized distributed optimization to reduce electricity bills and flatten demand response, while Xydas et al. introduced a fuzzy model and data mining approach to predict EV charging demand in various geographical regions. Additionally, Yagetekin and Uzunoglu developed a smart charging management algorithm strategy to prevent overloading transformers, thereby reducing charging costs and EV charging demand.

Luo et al. employed the Monte Carlo technique to forecast EV charging demand in the long term, testing their algorithm on various types of electric vehicles for different years. Similarly, Xing et al. used ride-hailing trip data to predict EV charging demand and considered driving and charging characteristics in their model.

Li and Zhang et al. employed a probabilistic power flow model and queuing theory to simulate the energy pattern of EVs over a specific timeframe and estimate the overall demand for EV charging facilities. Likewise, Bae and Kwasinski utilized fluid dynamics and queuing theory to evaluate charging demand patterns at highway charging stations, studying simulation results to help vehicle owners optimize their charging infrastructure planning.

Louie and Buzoan analyzed the performance of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model in predicting the demand for EV charging stations in San Diego, California, and the Netherlands, respectively, emphasizing the significance of geographical location and station characteristics in accurate demand prediction.

Compared to traditional statistical methods, machine learning (ML) offers a more accurate approach to forecasting EV charging demand, with ML algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) being applied for both short-term and long-term predictions. However, this technique may lack the ability to effectively simulate temporal data correlation, leading to less precise predictions.

Xi Chen et al. introduced a two-fold approach to enhance EV usage and promote renewable energy utilization, including a prioritization ranking algorithm for EV drivers based on their driving and charging patterns, as well as a secure, anonymous, and decentralized blockchain-based EV incentive system involving utilities, EV drivers, charging service providers, and RE providers. Their system guides EV users to charge during periods of higher RE generation.

In another work, Xi Chen et al. discussed the modeling of the EV charging network as a cyber-physical system integrating transportation networks and smart grids, introducing an EV charging station recommendation algorithm and emphasizing the importance of deploying a charging scheduling algorithm to transform EV charging into a load-balancing tool within unbalanced distribution grids.

Furthermore, the NNAR model, a type of artificial neural network (ANN) model, was utilized to analyze time series data by feeding lagged values into the system and building a relationship between input and output variables. Data imputation methods such as back casting and forward casting were applied, and the data set was split into training and testing sets for model training. Python platforms such as Spyder and TensorFlow-enabled Spyder were used for analysis and deep neural network analysis.
