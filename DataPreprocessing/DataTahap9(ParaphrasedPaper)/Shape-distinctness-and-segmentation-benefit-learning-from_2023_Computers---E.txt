Research on realism often relies on cognitive load theory, which posits that there is a limited capacity in working memory that can be occupied by relevant (intrinsic) and irrelevant (extraneous) cognitive load. According to this theory, learning can be improved by minimizing extraneous cognitive load so that mental resources can be devoted to engaging with intrinsic cognitive load. This raises the question of whether realism should be viewed as a form of extraneous cognitive load.

Previous findings suggest that the effects of realism may be more pronounced in tasks focused on learning about the shapes of objects. For example, while learning about the process of mitosis does not benefit from more realistic visualizations, learning about the shapes of objects presented in their complete form rather than as cross-sections consistently benefits from realistic details. These findings suggest that realism may have a positive effect when the dimensionality of a visualization is high.

In the context of realism research, studies have found that the use of color coding in realistic visualizations can enhance retention scores, particularly when the visualizations contain detailed features such as small bumps and ridges. However, the effectiveness of color coding may depend on factors such as the level of detail and whether color cues are presented during both the learning and testing phases.

Experiments were conducted to explore the relationship between realism and visual design factors such as dimensionality and perspective. The findings suggest that the dimensionality and perspective of visualizations have limited impact on learning, and that changes in shape and perspective may not significantly influence learning outcomes.

Additionally, studies have investigated how visual features that convey semantic knowledge, such as shape distinctness and color coding, can improve learning with realistic visualizations. The results suggest that incorporating distinct shapes and visual segmentation into realistic visualizations can enhance learning outcomes.

Further research is needed to explore how age-related differences may influence the impact of realism on learning. Additionally, investigations into the effects of alignment factors in extended reality (XR) applications could provide valuable insights for designers of static visualizations and XR experiences.
