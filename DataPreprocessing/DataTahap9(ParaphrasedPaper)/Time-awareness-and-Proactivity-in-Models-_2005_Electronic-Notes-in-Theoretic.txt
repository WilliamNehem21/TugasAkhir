The author of this academic paper introduced the concept of "kenetic engineering" as a method for developing artificial systems by utilizing interacting autonomous and proactive components. This approach, coined by J. Ferber in the context of distributed artificial intelligence research, draws intentional parallels with genetic engineering in natural biological systems, emphasizing common principles between proactive artificial and biological systems. The paper further discusses the emergence of new concepts in ubiquitous computing, such as autonomic and proactive computing, and their relationship to interactive and real-time systems.

Additionally, the paper explores the significance of computational interactions in different environments, referencing H. A. Simon's essays on the science of the artificial. It also discusses the evolving role of interactive computing since the 1990s and the relaxation of traditional restrictions on the church-turing algorithm theory, highlighting the development of new concepts, theories, and models in interactive computation.

The paper goes on to propose a taxonomy of models of computation based on the dimensions of the feature space to compare and analyze different computational methods and approaches. It also introduces the concept of a time model for software-intensive systems that directly interact with their environment, highlighting the need for a sophisticated time model to address the time-awareness problem in such systems.

Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the importance of a detailed taxonomy for classifying various methods in the feature space to support the comparison of different approaches in interactive computing. The authors note that the development of a time-aware model for interactive computation is essential for the applications of software-intensive systems.
