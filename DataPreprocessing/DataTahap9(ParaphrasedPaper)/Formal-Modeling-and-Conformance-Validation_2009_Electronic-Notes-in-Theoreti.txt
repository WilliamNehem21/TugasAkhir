This paper introduces the use of Reo and Constraint Automata with State Memory (CASM) for modeling choreographies and conducting conformance validation. Reo is an exogenous coordination model that allows the composition of complex coordinators called connectors from simpler ones. Constraint Automata, along with its variation CASM, are proposed as operational semantics for Reo. The key advantage of Reo lies in its ability to model both communication and coordination of web services. In this paper, the authors aim to establish a unified formalism for both choreography and orchestration, and leverage it for the automatic analysis of conformance in both contexts.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 provides a brief description of Reo and CASM, while Section 3 offers an overview of WS-CDL and the authors' proposed model for WS-CDL components. Section 4 addresses the theory of endpoint projection and conformance problems, with a practical example presented in Section 5. Finally, Sections 6 and 7 cover previous related works and conclusions, respectively.

The paper defines a choreography as a container for a set of activities that may be performed by the participants. Each participant is treated as a Reo component in the model. To adapt CASM for modeling activities, a convention is imposed on its name set to include both a component name and a port name. The choreography in WS-CDL is described as a container for activities to be performed by one or more participants, consisting of choreography life-lines, exception blocks, and finalizer blocks.

The authors propose that a Reo circuit can be used to model each choreography, and the behavioral interface of a choreography with respect to a specific participant can be extracted through endpoint projection. This involves hiding all nodes in the Reo circuit except those of the desired component, enabling the extraction of the component's external behavior from the CASM of a Reo circuit using the hide operation. The conformance problem is then reduced to comparing the behavior of the given party with the specification obtained through endpoint projection, with the simulation relation defined for CASM serving as a suitable tool for this purpose.

The paper also demonstrates the application of the unified formalism to choreographies specified by BPEL, as well as the conformance validation process. Additionally, the authors discuss the use of the simulation relation in CASM for conformance validation, and provide a practical example of a bartering protocol to illustrate the application of their approach.
