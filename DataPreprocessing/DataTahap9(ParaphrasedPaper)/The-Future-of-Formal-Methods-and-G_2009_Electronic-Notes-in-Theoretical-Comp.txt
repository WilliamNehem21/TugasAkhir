Over the past two decades, the prevalent approach in computer design and architecture has been focused on clocked architectures and circuit design, while asynchronous design methodologies have declined in prominence. Nonetheless, there is growing interest and potential for a resurgence of asynchronous circuit and design technologies in the semiconductor industry. According to the authors of the semiconductor technology roadmap, a significant shift towards handshake clocking, which is essentially asynchronous design, is anticipated, with an expected 40% of designs using this approach by 2020.

The paper explores the current state of asynchronous design and speculates on its potential return as a common design methodology in the semiconductor industry. It makes bold predictions about the impact of asynchronous design and globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GALS) design on the industry by 2020. The authors advocate for a shift towards formal verification-based design flows, citing the need to address the increasing modularity of designs and the complexity of communication between blocks. They foresee formal verification becoming fundamental in ensuring the correctness of complex modular systems and enabling a smoother transition to asynchronous design and handshake clocking.

The paper also discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with the increasing focus on formal verification. It highlights the potential benefits of integrating data validity information into clocked pipelines, revolutionizing clock gating techniques, and facilitating the transformation of clocked designs into elastic designs. Additionally, the paper addresses the impediments to the commercialization of asynchronous design, including the lack of unity in methodology and terminology, and the need for custom CAD tools.

Furthermore, the authors anticipate a convergence of clocked and asynchronous design, with bundled data asynchronous designs emerging as the de facto standard. They predict that commercial CAD vendors will begin to improve support for asynchronous CAD in their products and foresee an evolution in programming logic to accommodate asynchronous design. The document concludes by highlighting the significant implications of these potential changes for the semiconductor industry and the broader field of digital electronics.
