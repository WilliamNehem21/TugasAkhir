The reason for organizing this conference arises from the increasing interest in reduction strategies in rewriting and programming in recent years. There has been a surge in the creation and exploration of new types of reduction strategies, as well as the acquisition of new findings regarding rewriting and computation under specific strategies. Research in this area spans from fundamental theoretical inquiries about reduction strategies to practical application and implementation considerations. It is evident that there is a pressing need for a more comprehensive understanding of reduction strategies in rewriting and programming, both in theory and in practice, as they serve as a bridge between unrestricted general rewriting (computation) and more deterministic rewriting with specific strategies (programming). Additionally, reduction strategies offer a natural progression from operational principles (such as graph and term rewriting, narrowing, lambda-calculus) and semantics (such as normalization, computation of values, infinitary normalization, head-normalization) to the implementation of programming languages.
