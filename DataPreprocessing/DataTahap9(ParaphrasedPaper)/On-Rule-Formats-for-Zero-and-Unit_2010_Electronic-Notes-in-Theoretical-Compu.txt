This paper introduces a rule format for structural operational semantics that ensures certain constants serve as left or right zero elements for a set of binary operators. The proposed design is also used to reframe a previously developed rule format for unit elements. The paper demonstrates that examples of left and right zero, as well as unit, elements from existing literature can be verified using the provided formats.

The study of structural operational semantics (SOS) in the literature typically focuses on rule formats for fundamental algebraic properties of operators, such as commutativity, associativity, and idempotence. This approach offers the advantage of enabling verification of desired properties through mechanizable syntactic checks. Additionally, developing rule formats for establishing semantic properties is of interest as the results derived from this approach apply to a broad class of languages.

The paper formulates a format for zero elements within the GSOS (Generalized SOS) languages of Bloom, Istrail, and Meyer. The authors leverage the logic of transition formulae developed in a previous work to reason about the satisfiability of premises of GSOS rules. The full version of the paper includes a syntactic rule format for left and right zero elements applicable to SOS rules that are more general than GSOS ones.

The subsequent sections of the paper present standard definitions from the theory of SOS and from the logic of initial transitions. The format for left and right zero elements is provided in Section 3, and Section 4 demonstrates how several examples of left and right zero elements from the literature conform to the format. In Section 5, a rule format for unit elements is presented based on the ideas from Section 3. The paper concludes in Section 6 with an overview of its main contributions and references to further results available in the full version.

The formalization of the rule format for left and right zero elements involves the use of logic, particularly two kinds of entailment. Notably, semantic entailment is employed in a simplified manner, where only the closed substitutions mapping a variable to the left or right zero element constant under consideration need to be checked.

The paper proceeds to express the concept of identifying a set of rules in the context of defining conditions for the rule format. It illustrates examples to demonstrate the application and validity of the defined conditions. Furthermore, the paper includes a discussion of a theorem regarding the necessity of a specific condition for the validity of the theorem.

The paper also provides examples, such as the inaction constant 0 being a left and right zero element for a specific operator, and demonstrates how the conditions for the rule format are satisfied in this context. Moreover, it discusses the case where a closed term is a left unit element for a specific operator, providing a rationale for this assertion based on bisimilarity of closed terms to certain constants.

In addition, an example of synchronous parallel composition is discussed, showcasing the application of the rule format to a specific scenario. The paper also alludes to the full version, in which a format for zero elements not restricted to GSOS languages is presented and applied to various examples from the literature. Lastly, the paper mentions the management of premises in deduction rules as an area not covered in the present work, highlighting its potential for future investigation.
