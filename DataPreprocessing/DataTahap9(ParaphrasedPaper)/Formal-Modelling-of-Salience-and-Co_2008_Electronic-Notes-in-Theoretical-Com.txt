In this academic paper, the authors discuss the importance of well-designed interfaces that utilize procedural and sensory cues to emphasize appropriate actions and intentions. They also explore the influence of cognitive load on these cues as indicated by empirical studies. The paper presents a formalization of the relationship between salience and cognitive load within their abstract cognitive architecture, which is designed for verifying usability properties. The authors then apply these rules to formally verify the interface of a fire engine dispatch task used in the empirical studies to assess salience and load rules. They also discuss how the formal modeling and verification suggest potential improvements to the rules derived from the informal analysis of empirical data.

As part of an extension, the authors formally model the fire engine dispatch task to detect systematic errors identified in the experiments. They aim to demonstrate that their extended cognitive architecture generates behaviors similar to those of real people and to identify potential new empirical studies for refining the salience and load rules. The paper also reviews related work on salience and cognitive load, including theories on extraneous load and perception, as well as the use of interactive cognitive subsystems as models of human information processing.

Furthermore, the paper introduces a formal user model based on abstract cognitive principles and describes its components and state space. It discusses the influence of salience on user choices and the role of pre-determined goals in guiding user behavior. The authors also detail the termination of interactions and the structure of subgoals within the user model.

Additionally, the authors outline the verification process and its alignment with empirical data, noting discrepancies and potential explanations for mismatches. They conclude by emphasizing the formalization of procedural and sensory salience within their cognitive architecture and the refinement of salience hierarchy based on verification attempts.

Overall, the paper focuses on the formalization of the relationship between salience and cognitive load, the modeling and verification of user behavior, and the refinement of principles governing the interaction between human users and interfaces.
