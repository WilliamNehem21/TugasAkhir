Following a disaster, the rapid response of air ambulances plays a crucial role in determining the survival of patients. However, various challenges, such as geographical remoteness and limitations in vehicle placement, make this task difficult. Therefore, the strategic arrangement of responders is of utmost importance. This study addresses this issue by formulating an optimal coverage problem using real mission data and employing integer linear programming. The performance of the developed model was compared to the Gurobi optimizer, and a solution combining base ranking, local search, and tabu search-based algorithms was proposed. The tabu search algorithm demonstrated near-optimal results, minimizing total vehicle travel distance and outperforming the runtime generated by Gurobi. Furthermore, parallel CUDA processing was utilized to further reduce the algorithmic runtime, particularly as the number of test missions increased.

Previous studies have proposed multiple solutions, including near-optimal metaheuristics and scheduling-specific methods. In contrast, this research focuses on maximizing coverage while minimizing solution runtime, utilizing real-mission data to develop a more realistic scenario. The study emphasizes the importance of algorithmic metaheuristics in emergency situations where vehicles must be rapidly repositioned to meet demands. The paper aims to bridge the gap with near-optimal, fast algorithms that can be efficiently utilized over exact methods and can be customized for different environments.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 presents the problem domain and description, Section 4 describes the base ranking, local search, and tabu search-based solutions, and Sections 5 and 6 provide the results and conclusions.

The optimization of air assets is crucial not only in the healthcare industry but also in other sectors. While this work focuses on minimizing total distance for placement, other studies have examined cost in conjunction with distance. The challenges of vehicle placement have been addressed in various industries, such as the oil industry, using heuristics for optimizing the position of fleets of helicopters. Empirical data allows for the use of past trends to devise present solutions. For instance, simulation models based on empirical data have been used for fleet assignment in the context of land-based ambulances and for optimizing vehicle placement in the context of the oil industry.

The study defines a mission as consisting of a pickup, a delivery, and a return to base. The calculation simplifies by ignoring distances between pickup and delivery points, as they do not affect the final coverage determination. The formulation ensures that each base can only hold a single aircraft, and dispersing vehicles is more beneficial as missions become more spread out over a large area.

Algorithm 2, using ranked data and unused bases from Algorithm 1, generates permutation matrices to explore varying neighborhoods for minimization of total haversine distance across all missions. In a city-wide EMS system, ambulance placement is simpler, whereas in an air ambulance service, the vast coverage regions and dispersed bases require alternative algorithms for optimal vehicle placement.

In summary, this paper develops and evaluates algorithms for optimal air ambulance placement to maximize coverage and minimize total distance. The study also highlights the need for algorithmic metaheuristics in emergency contexts and emphasizes the generalizability and scalability of the proposed system to other environments.
