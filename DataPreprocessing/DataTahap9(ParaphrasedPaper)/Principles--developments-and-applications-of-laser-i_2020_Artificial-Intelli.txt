The primary nutritional elements present in soil, such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), silicon (Si), sulfur (S), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg), are essential for reflecting soil fertility and sustaining plant growth and physiological activities. Various studies have been conducted to investigate the application of Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) in analyzing different soil properties and nutrients.

Glumac et al. (2010) conducted LIBS analysis on dried and pelletized soil samples with varying organic carbon (OC) content, and developed a strategy to minimize interference from adjacent atomic and ionic lines of Fe I and Fe II.

Erler et al. (2020) used a handheld LIBS spectrometer for spatially resolved determination of soil nutrients in agricultural fields, and compared three multivariate regression methods for measuring soil parameters, with LASSO and GPR yielding better results than PLSR.

He et al. (2018) compared single-pulse (SP) and collinear double-pulse (DP) LIBS techniques for soil nutrient element detection, finding that DP-LIBS coupled with PLSR offered an accurate and reliable quantitative determination.

Nicolodelli et al. (2014) developed a method to separate the aluminum interference from the carbon emission line in LIBS measurements of Brazilian forest soils.

Martin et al. (2010) discussed the variation of LIBS spectra collected on different soil types and the exploration of calibration models independent of soil properties.

Additionally, studies by Martin et al. (2013), Knadel et al. (2017), Izaurralde et al. (2013), Ding et al. (2019), and Zhao et al. (2019) also explored the application of LIBS in determining soil nutrient elements and properties, with various methodological and technological advancements.

Furthermore, researchers have expanded the application of LIBS technology beyond soil analysis to include detection of heavy metals, agricultural products, and chemical analysis, which has yielded promising results.

These studies collectively demonstrate the potential of LIBS technology in soil analysis and emphasize the need for continued development of novel techniques to enhance its robustness and applicability for detecting and controlling environmental pollution. Additionally, LIBS has shown promise in fields such as coal quality testing, water analysis, mineral exploration, and early diagnosis of plant diseases.
