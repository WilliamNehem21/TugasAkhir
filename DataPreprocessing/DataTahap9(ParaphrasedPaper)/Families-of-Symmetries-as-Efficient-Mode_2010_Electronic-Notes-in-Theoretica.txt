The ordinary pullback can be understood as the limit of a cocone consisting of only two arrows. It is important to note that in the specific case of the schanuel topos, these diagrams are necessarily finite, and therefore wide pullbacks are determined by the binary ones. Moving forward, we will use "setc" to denote the wide-pullback-preserving full subcategory of setc. Our theory can be applied under the following conditions.

In pursuing our objective, we refer to proposition 3.5. The embedding of the object f and the indecomposability of objects in its image are not influenced by the additional hypothesis. However, it is necessary to demonstrate that each presheaf in the image of f preserves pullbacks.

According to lemma 4.5, if x and y belong to the same orbit, and n is the pullback object of dx while m is the pullback object of dy, there exists an isomorphism between n and m, thereby making n a pullback of dy.

Multi-(co)products can be seen as a specialization of the concept of multi-(co)limits, which has been extensively studied by Diers. It is a well-known fact (see, for example, remark 5) that fam(c) has products whenever c has multi-products, and conversely, fam(cop) has products if c has multi-coproducts. Here, we present a specific characterization of the functor that emphasizes the distinction between global and local interfaces. The results presented in this context do not depend on arrows of c being mono.

The symmetry of elements of tn1 for each n needs to be determined. The efficient computation of this symmetry depends on the chosen functor. The paper demonstrates how to achieve this for polynomials, name abstraction, and subfunctors of the power set. It is conjectured that these results can be generalized to other categories of finite structures.

Applications of these concepts are of significant interest in the field of service-oriented computing, where resource allocation in the presence of network topologies or constraints is an active area of research. Finite representations hold vital importance for the implementation of analysis algorithms. It is imperative to study the efficient implementation of the generic symmetry reduction algorithm outlined in this paper. This may involve leveraging algorithms on permutation groups that exploit the generators. Additionally, similar considerations apply to model checking. One of the long-term goals is to study a stone-type duality for coalgebras over families in a manner similar to previous work, and to develop a corresponding model checking algorithm that takes advantage of cases where the representation is finite.
