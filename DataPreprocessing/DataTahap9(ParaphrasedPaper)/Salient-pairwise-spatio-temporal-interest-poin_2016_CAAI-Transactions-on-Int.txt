Several studies have introduced and utilized various local and holistic features for human action classification. Some researchers have focused on reducing the task of human action classification to 3D object recognition, while others have employed traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with limited capability for handling 2D inputs. In response, a novel 3D CNN model was developed to directly process raw videos. 

One approach involves using spatial-temporal correlograms to capture the co-occurrences of pairwise words in local spatio-temporal regions. Another method utilizes a naive Bayes formulation to represent spatio-temporal relationships and augments quantized local features with relative spatial-temporal relationships between pairs of features. Yet another method explores both local and global relationships of pairwise words and proposes a space salient pairwise feature (SSP) to describe the geometric distribution of space-time interest points (STIPs).

The proposed algorithm, which is not limited to human actions, has achieved high accuracy and can improve the performance of content-based video retrieval. It involves the use of a camera mounted on a mobile robot and a curved mirror to convert the camera into a 360-degree panoramic camera.

Furthermore, the directional information inherent in the natural structure of human actions is used to develop the Time Salient Pairwise Feature (TSP) to describe the relationships between pairwise STIPs. Additionally, SSP is designed to describe the geometric distribution of STIPs that is ignored by TSP. Both TSP and SSP have proven to be effective for action classification, with SSP achieving compatible results with baseline models on different datasets.

The experimental results on four challenging datasets show that salient motions are robust against distracted motions and efficient for distinguishing similar actions. Future work will focus on modeling the geometric distribution of STIPs more accurately, considering high-level models and features, and designing more real-time applications. This work was supported by various research funds and grants.
