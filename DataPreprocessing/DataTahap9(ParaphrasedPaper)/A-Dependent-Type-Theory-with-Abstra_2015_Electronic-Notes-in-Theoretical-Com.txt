We cannot apply the same approach to concretion and consider its result type as t(n/nj) because, as mentioned at the end of section 2.1, the validity of freshmltt judgments is not generally preserved by name-substitutions, but only by name-permutations.

The proof (outlined) is achieved through mutual induction on the judgments of the freshmltt type system. We skip the induction steps for those judgments already present in mltt, as a detailed proof (employing contextual categories) can be found in [22, chapter 3]. The remaining induction steps derive from the properties of the cwf nom established in section 3. We provide detailed explanations for the interesting cases.

We have presented a semantic interpretation for freshmltt by identifying suitable structure within the specific cwf of nominal sets. It should be feasible to formalize that structure as a generalized algebraic theory, expanding upon the theory for categories with families described by Dybjer [8, section 2.2]. This would lead to an algebraic version of the type theory examined in this paper.
