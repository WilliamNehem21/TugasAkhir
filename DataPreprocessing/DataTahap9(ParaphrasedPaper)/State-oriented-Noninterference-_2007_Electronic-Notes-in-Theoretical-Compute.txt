The paper discusses the issue of typability in the context of a secure process, indicating that the process may not be typable due to certain constraints. The authors propose a replacement for the existing rule(sum) and highlight a scenario where the proposed translation fails to preserve security.

Furthermore, the paper points out the surprising nature of obtaining a full abstraction result for a time-sensitive security notion, which is stronger than the discussed security properties. The authors emphasize the importance of using special tick actions in the translation to enforce a correspondence between steps in the source program and their encodings in the target process, as the absence of such tick actions would lead to the failure of full abstraction for time-sensitive security.

The paper also addresses the issue of typability in a security type system and presents conflicting constraints for assigning security levels to channels lock, unlock, and d in a given program. The authors propose a possible solution to this problem, suggesting the relaxation of the type system for certain channels, which are deemed as data flow irrelevant.

In summary, the paper delves into the challenges of typability in secure processes, discusses the implications of a proposed translation on security preservation, and explores potential solutions for conflicting constraints in a security type system.
