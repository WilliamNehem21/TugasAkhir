As network technology advances, software systems are transitioning from a closed, centralized architecture to an open, distributed one and from using homogeneous components to incorporating heterogeneous ones to build the entire system. To effectively utilize the ubiquitous components in a distributed system and tackle the inherent complexity of this paradigm, the functional and non-functional properties of components need to be formally captured, and a method is required to ensure the specified quality of service for the system composed of these components. The Uniframe framework is designed to address these challenges by utilizing a Unified Meta-Component Model (UMM) to encode the meta-information of a component, including its functional properties, implementation technologies, and cooperative attributes.

The paper introduces an approach to apply aspect orientation in the generative domain modeling phase and then utilize the aspect weaver to assist in the assembly of components, specifically for assembling components of a client/server architecture. The framework uses two repositories, the aspect library, and connector repository, aligning with the distributed component assembly style. It employs a type-based join point model to efficiently decouple the aspect definition and aspect usage for promoting aspect reuse. In contrast to the invasive composition approach, the paper focuses on weaving assembly-related concerns towards generating stub/skeleton code for gluing/wrapping components, without affecting the original components representing the business logic core and their references to stub/skeleton code. This is crucial for black-box components that do not allow invasive methods.
