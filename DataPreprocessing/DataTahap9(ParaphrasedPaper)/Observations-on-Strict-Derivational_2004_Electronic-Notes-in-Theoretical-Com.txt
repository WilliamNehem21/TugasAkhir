The paper defines a set of mildly context-sensitive formalism classes, including multicomponent tree adjoining grammars (MCTAGs) with set local adjunction, all of which generate the same class of string languages that is known to be a full AFL (AFL is a language family). The paper introduces a revised type of MG (Minimalist Grammar) inspired by linguistic work presented elsewhere. The revised MG type does not employ head movement or covert phrasal movement, and imposes an additional restriction on the move operator regarding which maximal projection may move overtly. Deviating from the original definition of the move operation, a constituent must belong to the transitive closure of the complement relation or be a specifier of such a constituent in order to be movable.

The paper also introduces the concepts of linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS) and linear context-free rewriting languages (LCFRL). Furthermore, it defines an MCFG1;2 (LCFRS1;2) as an MCFG (LCFRS) with a rank of 2 and a specific condition involving maximal projections.

Additionally, the paper presents definitions and concepts related to tree structures, including subtrees, maximally projected trees, and specifiers. It also defines operations for expression shifting and introduces the concepts of Minimalist Grammar (MG) and Strict Minimalist Grammar (SMG).

The paper further presents a method for transforming an MG into an MCFG, and discusses considerations related to this transformation. It also demonstrates the adaptation of this method to transform an SMG into an MCFG1;2, highlighting the non-trivial nature of this adaptation.

Overall, the paper discusses various formalism classes, grammatical structures, and transformations, presenting several definitions and concepts related to these topics.
