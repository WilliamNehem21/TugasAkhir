In recent years, there has been a growing interest in visualizations across various scientific disciplines. Psychology has seen a surge in research projects examining the role of pictures and animations as aids for learning. A particularly intriguing area of study within the realm of visual learning focuses on the inherent distinctions between verbal and visual communication. Notably, visualizations are often more tangible than verbal descriptions, as they rely on concrete illustrations rather than generalizations. For instance, a drawn triangle always represents a specific example and cannot encapsulate the concept of a general triangle. This raises questions about the effectiveness of pictures and animations in facilitating learning, specifically with regard to the learners' capacity to generalize the material presented to them.

In the field of computer science, several sub-disciplines are dedicated to visualizations. Notable breakthroughs have been achieved in computer graphics, enabling the generation of near photorealistic views with various light sources in real-time on standard personal computers. These advancements have found wide application in various forms of gaming, and it is anticipated that virtual, augmented, and mixed realities will become increasingly prominent in the future.

A third area of computer science that deals extensively with visualizations is program and algorithm visualization, encompassing techniques such as algorithm animation for computer science education, as well as visualization methods for comprehending complex, large-scale programs and their interdependencies and usage patterns.

Historically, the investigations of psychologists and computer scientists have operated independently, with limited cross-pollination of knowledge. Psychologists often lack awareness of developments in computer science, while computer scientists tend to focus primarily on technological aspects, neglecting considerations related to human perception, cognition, and learning.

When designing experiments to study the effectiveness of learning with visual aids, a crucial question pertains to the comparison of learning outcomes against other methods, such as constructing animations with or without peer reviews, and with or without presentations. Prior experiments have explored varying levels of engagement taxonomy, comparing activities such as passive viewing versus active responding, viewing versus modifying, and viewing versus creating. Due to constraints related to time and the number of participants, our experiment will compare peer reviewing with a single alternative method. Specifically, we have chosen to compare the construction and peer reviewing of animations with the sole construction of animations, without providing any feedback to the creators. We plan to conduct two separate experiments, each with two groups: one where participants engage in animation construction and peer reviewing, and the other where participants focus solely on animation construction. The second experiment will mirror this setup in reverse.
