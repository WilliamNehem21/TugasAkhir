The use of classification as a low-cost method is limited by its focus on cocoon characteristics, thereby making it unable to analyze pupa characteristics. To address this limitation, the x-ray method is proposed as a promising alternative that can capture the shape characteristics of the pupa without the need to cut the cocoon.

The following sections of the paper are organized as follows: Section 2 details the materials and methods employed, covering sample collection, image pre-processing techniques, feature extraction, and classification method. Section 3 presents the classification results, which are further discussed in detail in Section 4. The main conclusions are summarized in Section 5.

A new method is proposed in this study to address the limitations of ellipse fitting and minimum rectangular fit methods in accurately measuring the dimensions of regularly shaped objects.

Dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, truncated singular value decomposition, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and multidimensional scaling (MDS) were applied and their results were compared.

Ensemble learning, which involves training multiple learners to solve a single problem, was utilized to boost the performance of weak learners. The proposed model for pupa gender classification uses LDA + Adaboost with logistic regression as the weak learner. Hyperparameter tuning was carried out using the grid search method, resulting in a final model with 100 estimators and boosting terminated with a weight of 0.0005. SAMME was employed as the boosting algorithm. The proposed model was externally validated with 232 images of fc1 (111 males and 121 females) and 245 images of fc2 (137 males and 108 females) obtained under the same acquisition conditions as the main dataset.

The width and height computation methods proposed in this study were found to provide better results compared to existing methods, and feature extraction was identified as a key factor affecting classifier performance.

Research by Cai et al. reported an accuracy of 93.31% using an LDA classification model based on features such as ellipse major axis, ellipse minor axis, the ratio of major axis to minor axis, eccentricity, concave-convex characteristics, roundness, rectangularity, and complexity. The sample size used was 1071, comprising around 531 female and 540 male cocoons of four hybrid varieties.

The present research involved 1156 fc1 and 1226 fc2 samples, thereby contributing to a better understanding of pupa features. Other methods used for pupa gender classification, including NIR spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging (HSI), and the optical penetration method, have been discussed in prior literature.

The application of LDA as a dimensionality reduction method was found to enhance the efficiency and performance of the classifier. The proposed model with 10-fold cross-validation in the training data yielded a mean accuracy of 96.3% for both fc1 and fc2 varieties. In external validation, the proposed model achieved accuracies of 95.3% for fc1 and 95.1% for fc2.
