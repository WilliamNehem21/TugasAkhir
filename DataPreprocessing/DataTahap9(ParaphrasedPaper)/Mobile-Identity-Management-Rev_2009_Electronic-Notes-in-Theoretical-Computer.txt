Mobile identity management can be seen as a subset of identity management, but this view may overlook the unique characteristics of new contextual data, particularly location data. Not all identity management solutions are suitable for mobile identity management due to these distinct characteristics. This paper focuses on a specific context-aware application, the friend finder, and evaluates its privacy implications specifically from the perspective of mobile identity management. While the aspects discussed are not exclusive to mobile identity management, their evaluation is skewed towards mobile-centric considerations.

The friend finder application operates by mobile users periodically sending their location data to a central location provider from which they can query the locations of specific friends and relatives. The location provider typically presents this information as simple text, although the functionality can be enhanced by a map provider to display the location data on a visual map with navigation instructions.

Mobile identity management is crucial for users interacting with mobile applications to protect their personal data in the digital realm, mirroring how they safeguard their information in physical life. In society, individuals have multiple roles and relations, each associated with distinct partial identities mapped to specific attributes. Mobile identity management enables users to intuitively select which partial identity to use when communicating with different parties, easily switch between partial identities, and control their trust relationships. These functionalities should also be pervasive in the digital domain.

The paper demonstrates how the friend finder application safeguards the privacy of personal data and pseudonymity against mobile operators and service providers, with a specific focus on pull services. However, it does not address aspects such as context relations and dependencies, nor does it delve into blurring in levels, which are not within the primary focus of location-based services (LBS).

The FIDIS (Future of Identity in the Information Society) project, supported by the European Union, focuses on future identity management, identity theft, privacy with legal-social content, mobility and identity, among other topics. The project extensively surveys identity management solutions in both academia and industry.

The concept of blurring in levels can be applied to different location granularities, such as outdoor and indoor locations, to enhance service quality. For example, releasing only the zip code rather than exact GPS coordinates when searching for nearby restaurants can improve privacy while still providing relevant information. Blurring in levels can also be beneficial for quality of service optimization.

The specification language for privacy preferences is crucial for mobile identity management. While the Appel privacy preference language has limitations for identity management, it is not straightforward to extend it to accommodate the aspects outlined in the paper. The privacy preference language for the friend finder application should consider various static and dynamic context data, their dependencies, relations, and blurring in levels.

After releasing personal data to a service provider, individuals have limited control over potential misuse. Building trust relationships with service providers through technologies like P3P (Platform for Privacy Preferences) can help users make informed decisions about sharing their data. P3P allows service providers to transparently communicate their data collection practices and policies, empowering users to assess whether to engage with the provider. While P3P does not guarantee policy enforcement, it serves as a promise from providers.

With the increasing prevalence of mobile devices, ensuring the confidentiality of mobile data has become increasingly critical. The loss or theft of unencrypted mobile devices, such as laptops, PDAs, and mobile phones, poses a significant risk to the privacy of personal data.

Lastly, the paper discusses the communication and decision-making process involving release of location information and privacy preferences to pertinent entities. It emphasizes the need for evaluating the provider's P3P policy and adherence to privacy preferences before transmitting data, as well as the automatic establishment of anonymous communication networks to support anonymity.
