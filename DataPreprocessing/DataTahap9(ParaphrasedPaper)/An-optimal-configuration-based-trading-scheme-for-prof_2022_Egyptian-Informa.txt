The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related works, while Section 3 outlines the system model. In Section 4, the problem is formulated and our proposed scheme is described. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in Section 5. Finally, the paper concludes and offers future research directions.

The alternating renewal process involves a period denoted as 1(0), which indicates whether the channel is occupied or free and ineligible for trading. Although 1/0 transitions can be detected by spectrum sensing, this aspect is not the focus of our paper. We use a specific condition to specify the state of the channel.

Maximizing profit for a primary user is a significant challenge due to the fluctuating availability of spectrum and the dynamic nature of the spectrum market. Many factors related to the spectrum market, such as demand, spectrum cost, and supply, change over time. Consequently, primary users must consider both spectrum usage and eviction.
