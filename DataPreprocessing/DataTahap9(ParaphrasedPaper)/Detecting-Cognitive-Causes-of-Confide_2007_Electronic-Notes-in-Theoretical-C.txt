Most security research focuses on the technical aspects of systems, but our work takes a user-centered approach to security. We examine how cognitive processes affect the security of information flow from the user to the computer system. We build on a framework developed for verifying usability properties and apply it to the detection of security issues, particularly those arising from the combination of design features and human cognition. Our work sits at the intersection of information-flow security and user-centered security, with a specific focus on the cognitive processes that influence information flow from the human user to the computer system.

Our cognitive architecture has previously been useful in detecting systematic user errors related to usability and task completion. Here, we extend this architecture to identify security problems and improve security in user interaction design. We illustrate our approach through small examples, showing how certain confidentiality leaks, caused by a combination of inappropriate design and aspects of human cognition, can be detected using our framework.

A central aspect of our work is the consideration of user goals, representing the predetermined sub-goals that users aim to achieve during an interaction with a system. We model user goals as an array and examine how users may attempt to discharge these goals, even when prompted for a different action by the system. The formal model we develop incorporates the cognitive processes involved in user actions, considering perception, memory, and environment.

We particularly focus on the task completion behavior of users, including instances where users prematurely terminate interactions after achieving their main goal, thus leaving subsidiary tasks incomplete. Such post-completion errors, which are also security breaches, can arise due to the cognitive architecture allowing users to stop once the main goal is achieved. We demonstrate how our verification framework can detect and address such errors, contributing to improved security in user interactions.

Furthermore, we explore how user habits in combination with interface designs can lead to the incorrect interpretation of system prompts, potentially resulting in the leakage of confidential information. To address this issue, we introduce a new entity into our framework, the generic module tester, which checks for security breaches related to user interpretation of interface prompts. The analysis of concrete examples using this module highlights the potential for confidentiality leaks and provides insights for improving interface designs to mitigate cognitive susceptibility.

In summary, our work extends previous research by identifying and addressing security issues stemming from user cognition and interaction with computer systems. We demonstrate how cognitive processes influence security aspects and provide a framework for detecting and mitigating security problems in user interaction design.
