In earlier versions of this calculus, distinct clocks were used to represent different time systems, and the synchronization of these clocks was not allowed. However, our research demonstrates that permitting clock synchronization is secure by creating a new model of guarded recursion and clocks. This finding will significantly simplify type theory by eliminating the need for freshness restrictions in typing rules, and it is an essential step in defining rewrite semantics and ultimately implementing the calculus.

It should be noted that the interpretation presented in this paper is consistent with the standard interpretation, as seen in works by Jacobs, for example. However, it is important to highlight that the availability of general clock substitution gr(f) for any arbitrary f is crucial. This ingredient was missing in previous models, which is why there were restrictions on clock instantiation rules.
