This study involved the collection and examination of over 100 research papers on deep learning-based computer vision in the context of agriculture from various scientific databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. The research focused on evaluating the extent to which deep learning-based computer vision approaches have been applied to address key agricultural tasks, including plant health monitoring, disease and weed identification, irrigation management, soil analysis, livestock management, and yield estimation. The aim was to provide useful insights for agriculture researchers and general computer vision researchers interested in applying computer vision solutions to agricultural problems. The study also highlighted the practical implications and major challenges associated with implementing large-scale applications of these technologies.

The use of convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, which are widely used for image classification tasks, was discussed. CNNs are capable of extracting relevant features from input images and have been instrumental in advancing computer vision-based models. The paper also mentioned the introduction of the ImageNet dataset, which provided a foundation and benchmark for building advanced computer vision-based models, and discussed the early CNN model, LeNet-5, proposed by Yann LeCun.

The paper described image classification and object detection as two important tasks in computer vision. While image classification aims to identify the class to which a specific image belongs, object detection focuses on locating objects in images or videos, involving both class and location information. Various object detection architectures such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector), and Faster R-CNN (Region Convolutional Networks) were highlighted for their widespread use in object detection across different domains, including agriculture.

The study also discussed the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for unsupervised learning and their effectiveness in mimicking given data distributions, reducing data into fundamental properties, and generating new data points with varied properties. In addition, examples of GANs' applications in image generation tasks such as text-to-image synthesis, super-resolution, and image-to-image translation in the context of crop productivity were mentioned.

The paper further discussed the potential of deep learning-based computer vision approaches for addressing various agricultural challenges, including disease identification, weed detection, plant species classification, and yield estimation, emphasizing their ability to automate and enhance agricultural processes.

Furthermore, the study provided examples of specific applications of deep learning-based computer vision in agriculture, such as soil texture analysis using wavelet transform, autonomous weeding and variable watering using computer vision and multitasking, plant stress monitoring, weed detection, and livestock management.

Overall, the paper highlighted the increasing potential of deep learning-based computer vision approaches in addressing key agricultural problems and emphasized the need for strong business cases for scaling these technologies in agriculture. The study also acknowledged the challenges associated with implementing large-scale applications of these technologies and the need to ensure data and device integrity, accuracy, and availability in the context of precision agriculture.

In summary, the paper provided a comprehensive overview of the current state of deep learning-based computer vision applications in agriculture, highlighting their potential benefits and challenges, and offering valuable insights for both agriculture and computer vision researchers.
