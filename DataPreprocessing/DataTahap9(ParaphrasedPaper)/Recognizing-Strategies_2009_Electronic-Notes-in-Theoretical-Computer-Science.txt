The paper discusses the use of strategies in specifying incremental solutions for a wide range of exercises, such as converting a logic proposition to disjunctive normal form, reducing a matrix, or performing calculations with fractions. By employing a strategy, the paper aims to automatically generate worked-out solutions, monitor a student's progress by examining submitted intermediate answers, and provide suggestions if the student deviates from the strategy. The authors assert that the ability to calculate feedback automatically from a strategy specification reduces the labor and ad-hoc nature of specifying new exercise domains and exercises within those domains.

The paper presents an examination of the similarities between parsing and solving exercises incrementally, along with the implementation of a recognizer for strategies. It offers a comprehensive implementation of the recognizer and discusses several design choices made in the process. The authors also highlight the importance of strategies in various domains, including programming, rewriting, compiler construction, and theorem proving. They emphasize that strategies play a vital role in exercise assistants that support incremental problem solving in mathematics, logics, physics, and other subjects.

Additionally, the paper addresses the significance of the information provided by the strategy recognizer in determining the type of feedback to provide to users of exercise assistants. The authors argue that while current feedback from exercise assistants is typically limited to indicating correctness or incorrectness, the diagnosis offered by the strategy recognizer can significantly enhance this feedback.

The paper is organized into several sections, covering the introduction of the language for specifying exercise strategies, the implementation of components to obtain a strategy recognizer, extensions to the recognizer, the utilization of the strategy language for diagnosing potential problems in user input, discussions of related work and ongoing research, and conclusions.

Moreover, the paper explains the elements of the strategy language, such as transformation rules, labels, and strategy combinators. It discusses the design choices made in developing the strategy recognizer, focusing on the representation of recursive grammars, the use of smart constructors, and the function run that produces results. Furthermore, the authors address the challenges they encountered in the design of the strategy recognizer, particularly regarding error diagnosis, and offer insights into their development process, including the use of a functional programming language (Haskell) and practical testing of the library in various domains.

In summary, the paper outlines the development of a strategy recognizer for specifying exercises and highlights its potential to improve error diagnosis in exercise assistants. The authors draw parallels between strategy recognition and parsing, and emphasize the similarities between the strategy language and languages used in parser libraries, strategic programming, data conversion, and other domains.
