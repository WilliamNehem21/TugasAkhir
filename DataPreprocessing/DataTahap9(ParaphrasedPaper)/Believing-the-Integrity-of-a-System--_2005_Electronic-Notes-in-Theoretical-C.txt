Characteristics of security properties such as confidentiality (preventing unauthorized disclosure of information) and integrity (preventing unauthorized alteration of information) are essential in ensuring the protection of sensitive data. While confidentiality has been extensively studied and well understood, integrity as a formal security property has been relatively overlooked in the research community.

Traditional security models focus on operational and implementation-oriented controls to achieve integrity, but they do not formally define the meaning of integrity itself. For instance, they may recommend the use of separation of duties, access controls, and auditing as a means to ensure integrity without providing a clear conceptualization of the property. This can lead to a lack of certainty about whether the intended integrity objectives are met, particularly in complex systems where unexpected circumvention may occur.

In this paper, we argue that the integrity-algebraic approach is limited in its scalability to address integrity in large and intricate systems. As an alternative, we propose a logic-based approach, which allows for a high-level analysis of complex systems that are not amenable to algebraic methods. We hypothesize that belief logics can offer a valuable complementary method for integrity and external consistency analysis.

Furthermore, we highlight the importance of trust and honesty in upholding integrity. For instance, if a customer does not believe that a bank will honestly reconcile the amount in an envelope, the consistent state of the account cannot be inferred. This suggests the need for additional operational checks and balances to ensure account consistency in the presence of potential dishonesty within the system.
