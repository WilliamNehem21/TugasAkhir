The visual system is of great significance to vertebrates, including fish, and is crucial for their adaptation to their aquatic environment. The eyes of fish are specialized for their specific habitats, with notable differences in the distribution of lens proteins and refractive indices. Studies have shown that fish species living at different depths exhibit variations in their optometric characteristics.

Researchers have focused on examining the lenses and retinas of fish, particularly studying the distribution of lens proteins, refractive indices, and retinal thickness and layers. These investigations have utilized methods such as electron microscopy, protein content determination, electrophoresis, and isoenzyme analysis to understand the structural and functional aspects of fish vision.

Different fish species have been found to display variations in retinal layers, pigmented epithelium, photoreceptor composition, and retinomotor movements in response to diurnal and nocturnal conditions. Furthermore, the observed differences in the distribution of lens fibers, retinal structures, and the presence of acid phosphatase isoenzymes indicate distinct adaptations in the visual systems of the studied fish species.

In conclusion, the research findings highlight the remarkable diversity in the visual systems of fish, shedding light on their structural and functional adaptations to their aquatic environments and daily light cycles. These insights provide valuable knowledge for understanding the unique visual capabilities of fish species inhabiting different ecological niches.
