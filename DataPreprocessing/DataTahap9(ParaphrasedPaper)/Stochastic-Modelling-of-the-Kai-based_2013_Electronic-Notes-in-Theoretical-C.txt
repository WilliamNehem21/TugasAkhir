This academic paper presents two process algebraic models of a circadian clock system based on Kai-proteins. The models are developed in the bio-PEPA and continuous pi-calculus process algebras. The circadian clock in question operates independently of transcription and has been observed to exhibit rhythmic behavior even when isolated from living cells. The models are used to explore the mechanisms underlying this rhythmic behavior and are validated by reproducing previous results based on ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. Furthermore, the models serve as the basis for conducting stochastic simulation and enable the investigation of the role of stochasticity in the system.

The models are formulated based on previous work by van Zon et al., who utilized an ODE-based model to replicate experimental observations. By constructing a bio-PEPA model, the authors were able to reproduce the ODE results and investigate the impact of stochasticity through stochastic simulation algorithms. The process algebraic approach is believed to be more conducive to in silico experimentation, as demonstrated by an investigation into "shortcut reactions" discussed in the paper.

The KaiC proteins form hexamers, each of which can exist in seven distinct phosphorylation levels based on the number of phosphorylated monomers within the hexamer. Additionally, each hexamer can be in an active or inactive state, resulting in a total of 14 possible states. The paper explains the cycling of hexamers through these states and the role of KaiA and KaiB proteins in coordinating this process. The model affirms the 24-hour cycling of phosphorylation levels in KaiC hexamers and uses logic to capture the oscillation of mean phosphorylation levels across the KaiC population, confirming this behavior through model-checking.

The authors also leverage the continuous pi-calculus workbench (CPIWB) to develop and analyze their models. This software tool offers access to alternative ODE solvers, a model-checker for logic of behavior in context, and a temporal logic for analyzing time series generated from numerical analysis. The CPIWB is emphasized as a novel open-source software package capable of performing in silico experiments, including the ability to modify the model mid-evaluation. Overall, the paper presents an advanced and comprehensive approach to modeling and analyzing the Kai-protein based circadian clock system.
