Biologists model biochemical networks by specifying the list of reactions involving the molecules of the system. Given this list, it is straightforward to construct a model in Stochastic Concurrent Constraint Programming (SCCP) and to associate a set of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) with the list. It is therefore desirable for the ODEs derived from the SCCP model of a list of biochemical reactions to align with the usual ODEs, a property referred to as preservation of rate semantics. In our study, we demonstrate that the translation methods for SCCP indeed satisfy this property. However, it is important to note that preservation of rate semantics does not guarantee the preservation of dynamical behavior, as the behavior can differ between the SCCP model and the associated ODEs.

In our language, we allow "tell" instructions with infinite rate, which are executed instantaneously when encountered by an agent. To handle these instructions and procedure calls, we define two transition relations: one for instantaneous actions and one for stochastic actions. These transitions are applied in an interleaved manner, where the instantaneous relation is applied until possible, followed by the execution of one step of the stochastic relation. Syntax restrictions ensure that the instantaneous transition is confluent and becomes quiescent after a finite number of steps, thereby defining the stochastic semantics.

Additionally, we have developed an interpreter for the language that can be used to run simulations. This interpreter, written in Prolog, utilizes a standard constraint solver on finite domains as a manager for the constraint store. All simulations of SCCP presented in the paper were conducted using this interpreter. For further details, please refer to the paper.
