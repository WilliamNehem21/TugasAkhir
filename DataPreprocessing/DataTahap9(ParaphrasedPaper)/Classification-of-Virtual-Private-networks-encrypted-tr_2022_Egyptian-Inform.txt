The categorization of network traffic has gained popularity in recent times owing to advancements in technology. The escalating demand for high-speed internet traffic has underscored the necessity of such tasks. Efficient management of network resources is facilitated by network traffic classification, which is crucial for network management and security. Accurate classification of network traffic ensures the provision of quality of service (QoS) to customers and efficient network management.

Currently, there are various encryption methods such as HTTPS, SSH, SSL, and programs like Tor and TrueCrypt that are commonly used for internet traffic encryption to protect the privacy of internet users. As a result, there is a need to classify network traffic generated by these applications, which would aid in network management and prevent malware.

This study proposes the use of ensemble learning techniques to classify encrypted network data, utilizing deep learning and machine learning methods. While many researchers have employed different statistical features to develop models, the disparity in feature selection has led to varying levels of overall accuracy. The motivation for this research stems from the need to address network usage demands and to achieve better tradeoffs for identification, ultimately enhancing network activities. Furthermore, the diversity in application types significantly impacts the accuracy of machine learning-based and ensemble learning classification.

One approach for classifying encrypted communications involves feature selection using the Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS) algorithm, which has proven to minimize errors. Additionally, the use of machine learning algorithms for network traffic classification requires retraining to handle new and diverse data efficiently. Ensemble learning, which integrates various machine learning techniques, has shown promising performance for the classification of VPN traffic.

The proposed ensemble model in this study leverages three machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (R.F.), Neural Networks (N.N.), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Experimental results with the VPN-Non-VPN dataset indicate that ensemble learning outperforms individual machine learning classifiers and exhibits significant differences in performance.

In conclusion, the study suggests a new approach for classifying VPN and non-VPN traffic based on stacking ensemble learning, and empirical results demonstrate improved performance. The selection of base classifiers with minimal complexity, along with the application of measures such as 10-fold cross-validation and statistical tests, contributes to the robustness and validity of the proposed ensemble model.
