This paper introduces a method for designing non-fragile controllers based on system quadratic performance optimization. It provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of non-fragile state feedback controllers in the presence of additive controller gain variations. These conditions are then transformed into linear matrix inequality (LMI) problems to simplify the solution process for obtaining non-fragile state feedback controllers. The reliability and validity of the approach are demonstrated through flight control simulation results.

System modeling is inherently imprecise, leading to engineering plants that are not described exactly. Many researchers have shown interest in addressing optimal control problems in the presence of system and external uncertainty (Zhou et al., 1996; Yu et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2006). Chang (Sheldon et al., 1972) introduced guaranteed cost control as an extension of the linear quadratic optimal problem to address this issue. However, feedback controllers that address the uncertainty of the controlled plant and closed-loop performance are needed.

The robust control approach considers the fragility issue in the analysis and synthesis of a closed system comprising the plant and controller. The results of robust control theory are beneficial for addressing non-fragility issues. The relationship between robustness and non-fragility is interactive, with stronger robustness leading to a closed system that is fragile or sensitive to controller uncertainty. Keel et al. (1997) conclude that higher-order controllers exacerbate fragility, highlighting the importance of considering controller uncertainty in controller design and synthesis, such as in the context of non-fragile control.
