The transmission of data faces numerous storage and security threats, particularly in scenarios such as the remote access of medical data over open wireless channels, where there are risks and challenges in maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and security. Similarly, the deployment of Internet of Drones (IOD) in military and civilian applications introduces serious security and privacy challenges when communicating with other drones or ground control stations. Moreover, the use of 5G networks in smart grids introduces privacy and security risks due to the continuous connection of smart devices to the network, making them vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) attacks and impersonation.

It is clear that 5G-IoT networks gather large amounts of data that require protection, given the private and sensitive nature of the data. IoT message exchanges lack privacy and security protection, which underlines the importance of authentication and device location identification in preventing network invasion by malicious devices. To address these issues, the paper proposes a lightweight authentication, authorization, and key agreement scheme based on ECC and biometrics, which provides mutual authentication, session key agreement, anonymity, untraceability, and backward and forward key secrecy.

In the subsequent sections, the paper discusses related work, describes the system model of the proposed scheme, presents a security analysis of the proposed scheme, and provides a comparative performance evaluation of the protocol. Additionally, the paper introduces a protocol to handle user access to IoT devices, as well as a process for updating user credentials and admission rights. The proposed scheme is also demonstrated to be robust against various attack vectors under the Canetti-Krawczyk (CK) threat model. Finally, the paper compares its proposed scheme with existing protocols, showing that it offers the most security features, making it the most secure among the schemes considered.
