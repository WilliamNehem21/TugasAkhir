Plant hormones play a crucial role in enabling plants to adapt to diverse environments by influencing growth, development, and nutrient distribution. This study aims to examine the combined effects of seawater salinity and certain plant growth regulators (gibberellic acid, indole acetic acid, or abscisic acid) on various aspects of wheat flag leaf, including leaf area, pigment and chloroplast structure, as well as sugar and protein content. The findings reveal that seawater at 10 or 25% concentration generally increased pigment content, particularly carotenoids, while reducing leaf area, hill activity, sucrose, polysaccharides, and protein. The interaction between seawater and growth regulators resulted in enhanced production of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids. Pre-treating wheat grains with these growth regulators also led to increased leaf area, hill activity, sucrose, polysaccharides, and protein. Additionally, irrigation with seawater caused significant changes in the chloroplast ultrastructure of the flag leaf, including disorganized membrane systems, altered bounding membranes, reduced starch grain size and number, and an increase in plastoglobuli. Presoaking wheat grains in gibberellic acid, indole acetic acid, or abscisic acid enhanced plant tolerance to seawater, particularly at a 10% concentration, as evidenced by the presence of normal chloroplasts.

Furthermore, the study shows that salt stress significantly affected pigment content in various plant species, with both increases and decreases observed. The interaction of salinity and phytohormones, including gibberellic acid and indolyl-3-acetic acid, resulted in an increased number of chloroplasts per mesophyll cell in wheat flag leaves.

The plant growth regulator kinetin has been found to modulate key physiological processes under abiotic stresses in different crops, and phytohormones such as abscisic acid, ethylene, and salicylic acid have been implicated in stress responses and adaptation. Limited research has focused on the influence of water stress on plant cell organelles, but observations suggest that salt stress can lead to significant changes in chloroplast and mitochondrial structure. Additionally, presoaking wheat grains in specific plant hormones has been linked to increased tolerance to seawater and maintenance of chloroplast integrity.

In conclusion, the findings underscore the importance of plant hormones in mitigating the adverse effects of seawater salinity on plant physiology, particularly through the regulation of pigment content, chloroplast ultrastructure, and stress response. Further research in this area may help develop strategies to enhance plant tolerance to environmental stress.
