In this academic paper, the authors explore complexity problems related to three types of combinatorial structures: cyclic orders, order varieties, and cycles. They demonstrate that determining if a cyclic order is a part of some cycle is NP-complete, and they establish that the same question for order varieties, a specific type of cyclic orders, can be solved in L. To do this, they draw connections between the entropy relation in partial orders and the forcing relation in graph theory.

The paper focuses on complexity problems related to three types of combinatorial structures: cyclic orders, order varieties, and cycles. Cyclic orders are defined as ternary relations with the property that when a point in the support is fixed, the induced binary relation forms a partial order. Order varieties are a special class of cyclic orders where fixing any point does not result in the loss of information. The authors introduce order varieties and discuss their relevance in proof theory, concurrency theory, and linguistics. Cycles are a specific type of order varieties where the induced binary relations form linear orders. 

The authors further provide background information on cyclic orders, order varieties, and cycles in Section 2. They highlight that a cycle is a type of spreading cyclic order and explain the relationships between different types of cyclic orders.

The paper also discusses the relationships between cyclic orders and order varieties in terms of complexity. It is noted that order varieties are more general than cyclic orders, leading to the conclusion that determining if a cyclic order is a part of some cycle is NP-complete. Conversely, it is shown that the reverse problem, determining if an order variety is a part of some cycle, can be solved in polynomial time. This is accomplished by transforming the given set of triples into a cyclic transitive relation, checking for cyclic orderhood, and applying the algorithm for order varieties.

In summary, the paper explores complexity problems related to cyclic orders, order varieties, and cycles, providing insights into their interrelationships and computational complexity properties.
