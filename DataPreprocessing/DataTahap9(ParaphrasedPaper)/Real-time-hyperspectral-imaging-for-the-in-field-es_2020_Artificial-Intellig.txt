The study aimed to assess the ripeness of strawberry fruits in both laboratory and field conditions using hyperspectral imaging and deep learning, as identifying ripeness in the field remained a challenge. The research involved estimating ripeness at early ripe and ripe stages using hyperspectral imaging in both field and laboratory conditions. The study utilized a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which is known for its superior performance in hyperspectral imaging classification. The training and test datasets were split with a ratio of 70:30 for both field and laboratory conditions. The results demonstrated that hyperspectral imagery could distinguish between early ripe and ripe strawberries in the field with an accuracy of 98.6%. However, limitations were identified, such as the inability to identify strawberries hidden under leaves using hyperspectral imagery. The study also suggested the potential for real-time estimation of strawberry ripeness in the field using portable hyperspectral imaging systems, which could support precision harvesting. The researchers recommended collecting a larger dataset with a wide range of strawberry quality variations for future studies. The research was supported by various funding sources and the team acknowledged the assistance provided by Tai'an Xinlv Farm in conducting the experiments.
