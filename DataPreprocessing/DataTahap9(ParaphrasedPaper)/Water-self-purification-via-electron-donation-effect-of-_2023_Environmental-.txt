The presence of emerging contaminants (ECs), including endocrine disruptors, persistent pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and synthetic dyes, has been widely observed in natural water environments (references 1-3). Even small quantities of ECs in the water can lead to bioconcentration and ecotoxicological effects, posing a significant threat to public water safety (references 4-6). Human exposure to ECs primarily occurs through consuming contaminated food and beverages from tainted soil, water, plants, animals, and microorganisms. Because of their hydrophobic properties, ECs tend to accumulate in biological tissues with high lipid content. Particularly, species at the top of the food chain show increased bioaccumulation and biomagnification (references 7, 8). The specific risks to humans manifest as disruptions to the endocrine and immune systems, often involving the mimicry, suppression, or alteration of hormone function. These disruptions may lead to delayed brain development, early puberty in children, reproductive issues, and an increased risk of cancer and associated complications (references 9, 10). However, the removal of ECs presents a significant challenge, both in terms of relying on nature's self-purification abilities and the conventional wastewater treatment processes used in municipal treatment plants (references 11-13). Despite the utilization of relatively simple and cost-effective technologies in contemporary wastewater treatment plants, effectively eliminating ECs remains an elusive goal. This is mainly due to the exceedingly low concentrations of ECs in water, the complex composition of the actual wastewater, and the inherent resistance of ECs to removal processes.
