A controlled experiment was conducted to assess the potential benefits of applying spermine (0.15 mm) and spermidine (0.3 mm), individually and in combination, to presoak grains of wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L.) variety Sakha 94 in order to mitigate the effects of heavy metal pollution in waste water on crop yield and biochemical aspects of the harvested grains. The study found that irrigating wheat plants with waste water contaminated with heavy metals led to a significant decrease in various yield components and water use efficiency. However, the application of polyamines appeared to alleviate the negative impact of heavy metal pollution on crop yield and water use efficiency. The treatment also seemed to mitigate the adverse effects of waste water on the biochemical aspects of the harvested grains, as evidenced by changes in protein banding patterns and levels of certain compounds such as abscisic acid. The study also examined the physiological processes affected by waste water irrigation, such as the translocation of photo-assimilates and the balance of elements in plant organs. In addition, the experiment investigated the effects of waste water irrigation on the mineral content and protein levels of the harvested grains. The findings suggest that presoaking grains in spermine, spermidine, or their combination could help mitigate the adverse effects of heavy metal-contaminated waste water on wheat plants. The paper also discussed the significance of waste water quality on crop growth, soil health, and consumer well-being, as well as the potential impact of urban and industrial effluents on soil physicochemical properties and seed germination. Moreover, the study emphasized the role of polyamines in plant development and stress responses, and explored the impact of waste water irrigation on plant growth regulators and protein synthesis. Finally, the paper referenced several relevant studies that support and complement the findings of the experiment.
