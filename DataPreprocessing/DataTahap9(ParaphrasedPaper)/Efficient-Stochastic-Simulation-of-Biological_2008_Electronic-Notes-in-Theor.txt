Unfortunately, the computational complexity of the modified stochastic simulation algorithm (MSSA) is heavily influenced by the number of compartments, making simulations infeasible when the number of compartments becomes significantly large. Previous attempts to improve the original stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) have not been effective for the MSSA due to its unique consideration of multiple stochastically varying volumes.

Despite these challenges, the computational complexity of the MSSA can be reduced to O(log m + log c) by leveraging the same data structures proposed for enhancing the SSA directly. These structures are supported by two key observations. Firstly, only a few propensity functions change with each transition, and these can be easily identified by constructing a dependency graph. Secondly, the linear representation containing information on propensity functions of reactions within each compartment allows for independence from specific volumes, eliminating the need for recalculation as volumes change.
