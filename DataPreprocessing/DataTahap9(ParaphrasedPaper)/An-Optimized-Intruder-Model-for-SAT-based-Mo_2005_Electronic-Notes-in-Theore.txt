In the past ten years, there has been a significant increase in the speed of satisfiability (SAT) solvers, as they are now able to routinely solve problems with thousands of variables in milliseconds. This advancement has had a profound impact on areas such as planning and model-checking. Motivated by these developments, in recent work, the authors proposed methods to reduce protocol insecurity problems to satisfiability problems in propositional logic, with the goal of effectively identifying attacks on protocols. The authors developed a model-checker, SATMC, based on these reductions.

The paper begins in Section 2 by presenting a model, using a well-known authentication protocol, with a focus on an optimized intruder model based on the concept of axiom. Section 3 introduces the concept of protocol insecurity problem with axioms, while Section 4 provides a formal description of the automatic compilation of protocol insecurity problems with axioms into a set of propositional satisfiability problems. Experimental results and implementation details are discussed in Section 5, and the paper concludes in Section 6 with final remarks and a discussion of future work.

The model assumes that the network is controlled by a Dolev-Yao intruder, which has the ability to intercept, manipulate, compose, decompose, encrypt, and decrypt messages, as well as send messages with a false identity. Additionally, the model makes standard assumptions of perfect cryptography and strong typing.

The authors describe a high-level security protocol template parametrized by free variables, representing a session of the protocol. The successful execution of the protocol should ensure that both parties are convinced they are communicating with each other. The paper discusses how a malicious agent can deceive one party into believing they are communicating with someone else.

The paper also discusses labeled rewrite rules used to specify the evolution of the transition system, distinguishing between rules for honest agents and intruder rules. The authors describe techniques for increasing the values of k and the use of state-of-the-art SAT solvers to identify satisfiable formulas and report corresponding models back to the user.

The authors tested their tool against several flawed security protocols from the Clark/Jacob library, generating protocol insecurity problems for scenarios with a bounded number of sessions where principals exchange messages controlled by either the Dolev-Yao intruder or an optimized version. This optimization involves modeling the intruder's ability to decompose messages using axioms instead of rules.
