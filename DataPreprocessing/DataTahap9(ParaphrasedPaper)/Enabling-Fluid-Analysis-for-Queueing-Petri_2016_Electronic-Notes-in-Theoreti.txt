The paper discusses the potential of queuing Petri nets (QPN) as a performance modeling formalism, combining queueing networks and colored generalized stochastic Petri nets. Although QPN models can represent data center infrastructure and software at an architecture level, their complexity often makes it impractical to use existing analytical solution techniques, necessitating time-inefficient discrete-event simulation.

The authors propose leveraging layered queueing networks (LQN) and its solvers as an alternative. They detail a model-to-model transformation approach to convert QPN models into LQN models, thereby enabling users without expertise in QPN or LQN to benefit from the features of LQN solvers. The paper outlines the transformation process, its limitations, and its impact on performance predictions, solving time, and memory consumption.

Additionally, the authors present a comparison of existing transformations for Performance Constraint Modeling (PCM), Descartes Modeling Language (DML), and Descartes Network Infrastructures (DNI), emphasizing the value of the contributed QPN-to-LQN transformation.

The paper is organized into sections that provide background on QPN and LQN formalisms, analyze the prior works on fluid analysis and model-to-model transformations, and introduce the authors' approach for the QPN-to-LQN model transformation. The limitations of the transformation process, peculiarities of fluid analysis, and comparisons with existing solvers are also discussed.

The authors conclude by highlighting the benefits of using LQN solvers for QPN models, emphasizing the improved solving times and memory consumption. They posit that the proposed transformation approach allows for widespread support for these solvers in existing QPN models, facilitating the use of model-to-model transformations for PCM, DML, and DNI models.
