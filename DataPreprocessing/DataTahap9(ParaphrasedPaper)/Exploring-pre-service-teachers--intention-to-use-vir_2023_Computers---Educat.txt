The adoption of virtual reality (VR) technology has gained popularity across various fields, such as arts and humanities, marketing, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The potential benefits of VR in education and research are being widely explored, particularly in creating innovative instructional methods and providing learners with access to otherwise inaccessible real-world scenarios. VR's capability to create interactive and hands-on learning environments, as well as its flexibility and cost-effectiveness, makes it an impactful tool for education, particularly in fields where exposing learners to potentially dangerous situations is not feasible. The intention to use VR in education has been identified as a significant factor influencing its actual adoption, as individuals' behavioral tendencies play a crucial role in technology usage.

A study conducted among 231 pre-service teachers in Nigeria revealed their positive inclination towards integrating VR technology in education. However, the participants' responses also indicated a limited practical experience with VR, and their perception of VR technology was influenced by factors such as its novelty, unfamiliarity, complexity, and cost. Nonetheless, positive attitudes towards VR's usefulness and ease of use were found to predict a higher intention to adopt VR in education.

In summary, the study suggests that pre-service teachers' attitudes and perceptions towards VR technology play a vital role in determining their behavioral intention to use VR in education. These findings have important implications for teacher training programs and curriculum development, as they underscore the need to emphasize the practical and methodological benefits of VR technology to promote positive attitudes and increased adoption among future educators.
