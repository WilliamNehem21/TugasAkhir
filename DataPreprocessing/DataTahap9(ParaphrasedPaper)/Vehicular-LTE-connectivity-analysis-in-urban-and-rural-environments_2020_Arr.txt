The rapid development of information and communication technologies has spurred the evolution of connectivity solutions for vehicles aimed at enhancing traffic safety and management. This development is a crucial component of the intelligent transportation system (ITS), which has the potential to revolutionize modern travel. Vehicles are now able to communicate not only with each other, but also with nearby road-side unit (RSU) infrastructures in order to alert drivers to potential accidents or other hazardous situations. Ongoing initiatives, such as the connected vehicle pilot deployment programs in New York City, Tampa, and Wyoming, are focused on improving the safety and mobility of road travelers. The US Department of Transportation (USDOT) asserts that connected vehicle technology has the potential to reduce up to 80% of non-impaired crashes.

The paper examines architecture enhancements necessary to enable LTE-based vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications. It discusses how vehicles can receive V2X messages through unicast or broadcast setups, such as the multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS) over LTE-Uu interface for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Additionally, the paper details new modes introduced for direct vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, including a mode where V2V resource allocation is managed by the base station. The paper emphasizes the importance of ubiquitous coverage to facilitate efficient V2X communication and the use of publicly available base station location data for evaluation purposes.

The study also assesses the path loss characteristics of V2I communication channels, noting that the behavior of path loss can be described using the two-ray ground reflection model. Furthermore, the paper delves into the post-processing methods used to identify base stations and analyze vehicular communication performance. It highlights the importance of extracting E-UTRAN Cell Global Identifier (ECGI) information from measurement data for accurate performance assessment.

The paper then provides an overview of the methods used to extract ECGI information for unique identification of base stations and to determine the impact of actual network deployments on V2I connectivity performance. It discusses the limitations of cell identification using Physical Cell Identity (PCI) and the need for alternative methods, such as decoding ECGI information from the system information broadcast on the downlink control channel.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the process of acquiring downlink control information and the use of blind decoding to check all possible standard DCI formats using System Information Radio Network Temporary Identifier (SI-RNTI). Additionally, it details the extraction of ECGI information from System Information Block Type 1 (SIB1) bits using an ASN.1 compiler installed on a Linux platform.

The study also explores the process of handover decision making in LTE networks, highlighting the role of Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) measurements and the conditions that trigger handovers. It also investigates the impact of RSRP and Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) parameters on packet error rate and jitter for voice traffic, demonstrating the potential consequences of low signal strength conditions on packet transmissions.

Finally, the paper includes information on the authors' contributions and roles in the development of the research, including conceptualization, methodology, formal analysis, and writing and editing of the paper.
