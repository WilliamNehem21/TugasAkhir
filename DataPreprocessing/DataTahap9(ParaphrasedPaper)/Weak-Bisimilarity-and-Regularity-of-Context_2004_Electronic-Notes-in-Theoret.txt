It is possible to decide weak bisimilarity for a subclass of bounded Petri nets with only one unbounded place. However, the decidability of weak bisimilarity for general bounded Petri nets remains an open question. This uncertainty arises due to the lack of a global finite control in bounded Petri nets, which prevents them from remembering control information when decreasing the stack. In contrast, weak bisimilarity for pushdown automata (PDA) has been proven to be undecidable, a result obtained by Srba using a reduction from Minsky 2-counter machines. Notably, this proof does not extend to bounded Petri nets due to the absence of a global finite control, implying that the undecidability of weak bisimilarity in pushdown automata is affected by the nature of their control-states. Moreover, the undecidability of weak bisimilarity for normed 1-counter machines has also been established, indicating that bounded Petri nets and one-counter machines are incomparable in their expressive power.
