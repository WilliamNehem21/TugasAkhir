The process of citation screening is a time-consuming part of conducting a systematic literature review. This involves identifying citations that meet the criteria for inclusion in the review. In this paper, the authors introduce an automatic text classification approach designed to prioritize eligible citations over ineligible ones, thereby reducing the manual labeling effort required for the screening process. This is achieved by automatically excluding lower-ranked citations. To enhance the performance of the text classifier, the authors propose a novel feature extraction method based on neural networks. Unlike previous approaches, which use unsupervised feature extraction methods for a supervised classification task, the authors' method extracts document features in a supervised setting. Specifically, the proposed method generates a feature representation for documents that is explicitly optimized to differentiate between eligible and ineligible citations.

Due to the increasing volume of published literature, the manual production of systematic reviews has become a time-intensive process, with an average completion time of approximately 2.4 years. The authors also highlight the potential application of their method in sentiment analysis and demonstrate its substantial improvement in text classification performance. Furthermore, they discuss integrating their method with text search engines to identify documents relevant to individual user preferences.

Existing semi-automatic citation screening methods mostly utilize unsupervised document representation techniques, such as the bag-of-words model, to address a supervised classification task. In contrast, the authors put forward a new supervised feature representation technique that leverages the class-membership information of manually screened citations to generate informative document features. This involves training a multi-layer feed forward neural network to establish a latent representation of documents that encodes discriminative and class-specific information about the citation screening task.

The authors conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of their supervised feature induction method in the context of citation screening for 23 publicly available systematic review datasets from the medical domain. Results illustrate that their proposed feature extraction method can reduce the number of items that require manual screening while maintaining the sensitivity of the review, with at least 95% of relevant studies being identified by the semi-automatic screening method. Additionally, the authors report substantial performance improvements of their neural network-based feature extraction method compared to 10 baseline feature extraction methods. These findings contribute to the advancement of automatic citation screening and demonstrate the potential of the proposed method in improving the efficiency of systematic literature reviews.
