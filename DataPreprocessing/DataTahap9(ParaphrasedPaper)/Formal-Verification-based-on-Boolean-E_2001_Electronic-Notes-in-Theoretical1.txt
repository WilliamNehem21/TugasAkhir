The process of symbolic model checking involves verifying temporal specifications of finite state machines, which can be expressed using boolean formulae. This paper focuses on demonstrating how to manipulate these expressions using beds and emphasizes on examples that pose challenges for standard symbolic model checking techniques.

The problem of determining the satisfiability of a formula is common in verification of combinational circuits and in symbolic model checking, often used for error detection. The paper explores the use of the bed data structure for satisfiability checking.

Additionally, the paper introduces an operator for computing minimal p-cuts in fault trees, which are boolean formulas that express system failure based on component conditions. A minimal p-cut represents the most likely reasons for system failure and can be used to approximate the probability of system failure based on the failure probabilities of each component.
