The paper introduces a power flow tracing method for the allocation of usage and losses, which incorporates flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) devices. Utilizing graph theory, the method allocates usage, and a modified Kirchhoff matrix is employed for this purpose. FACTS devices, such as thyristor-controlled series controllers (TCSC), are utilized in the system for functions like reactive power compensation and voltage profile improvement. The paper focuses on the usage of TCSC with voltage source modeling to analyze its impact on transmission usage and loss allocation, using a sample 5-bus system. In addition, the authors present a modified load flow method for power flow analysis, incorporating TCSC, and compare results with and without TCSC on a sample 5-bus system.
