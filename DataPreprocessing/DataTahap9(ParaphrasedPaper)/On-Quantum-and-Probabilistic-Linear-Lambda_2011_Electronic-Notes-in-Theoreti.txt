In this context, the meaning of a term m in the probabilistic linear lambda-calculus (PLLC) is represented by a completely positive map from vectors of dimension m to vectors of dimension n, where m and n are natural numbers. It is important to note that in this setting, a completely positive map is equivalent to a (partial) stochastic map from the m-dimensional unit interval [0, 1] to the n-dimensional unit interval [0, 1]. The outcome derived from this approach is applicable to this scenario, and the meaning is fully abstract.

A preliminary approach to establish a comprehensive and exhaustive interpretation for the probabilistic linear lambda-calculus is as follows. Consider a category where the objects are polytopes and the morphisms are completely positive maps that transform polytopes into polytopes. Subsequently, the language of the PLC is to be interpreted within this category.
