Sure, here's the academic paper paraphrased in a random format:

A group of researchers found that traditional methods of encryption and decryption are time-consuming and proposed a new algorithm based on region-selective image encryption. This technique allows for selective encryption and reconstruction of images. The proposed nonlinear chaotic algorithm (NCA) by Gao et al. uses the power and tangent functions instead of the linear function.

Yu et al. suggested that the efficiency of image encryption depends on characteristics of neighboring pixels when reconstructing images. Their encryption system proposed reconstructs bit-level characteristics. They also discussed the computational complexity of sub-image permutation and suggested using lower bits for lower complexity.

Independent Component Analysis (ICA) defines a generative model for observed multivariate data, assuming the data variables are mixtures of unknown latent variables. It seeks to find independent components of the observed data through decorrelation and whitening.

The SSIM index measures interdependencies between pixels, with an ideal value of 1 indicating identical data sets.

The proposed encryption method combines independent component analysis with the Arnold Cat Map matrix, yielding better performance compared to random matrix using the JADE algorithm. The encryption results using the Arnold Cat Map matrix were found to be superior to those using the random matrix.
