The paper discusses the dynamic and distributed nature of computational problems in network optimization, particularly in the context of balancing competing interests such as sharing available capacity. It suggests the potential value of developing high-level programming languages to analyze and organize network functionality and structure. The proposed approach entails formulating a network task as a mathematical optimization problem, relaxing the problem by incorporating constraints into the objective function, and finding a saddle point of the modified objective function. This method is then illustrated using an example involving finding the shortest paths in a communication network.

The paper also outlines the general mathematical setting of the model, which involves finding a saddle point of a convex-concave function with many real-valued variables. It explains how the saddle point problem can be distributed and introduces a running example of seeking the shortest paths in a communication network. The paper argues that the network as a whole is in a saddle point if and only if all nodes are simultaneously in a saddle point of their local lagrangian, and suggests that the decomposition into sub-problems can be continued recursively.
