Delphin is a programming language designed to facilitate the representation, manipulation, and reasoning over dependent higher-order data structures. It is structured as a two-level system that separates data-level functions from computation-level functions. The data level is based on the logical framework LF, which supports dependent types and higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS), while the computation level provides mechanisms such as case analysis and recursion for data manipulation.

In addition to supporting complex data structures, Delphin also provides strong tools for metareasoning, enabling the determination of whether functions are total, which allows it to be used for formalizing proofs. Due to these capabilities, Delphin is well-suited for use in the Logosphere project, a digital library of formal proofs that aims to facilitate the exchange of mathematical knowledge across different logical formalisms. Delphin has been successfully employed in expressing translations between HOL, Nuprl, and various other logics.

The language distinguishes LF terms from computation-level expressions by enclosing the former in angle brackets (<...>). It also distinguishes between LF types, parameter types, and computation-level types. Delphin functions expect arguments that are constructed from both constants in the signature and dynamically introduced parameters. Functions are defined with the parameters they can handle using the "params" keyword, and they can call functions with different parameter specifications as long as the callee can handle all the parameters of the caller. This ability is known as world subsumption.

The language also features type inference based on the Hindley-Milner algorithm, and it supports an interactive loop for writing, executing, and experimenting with programs. Error and warning messages are reported in a format similar to SML of New Jersey, allowing for easy navigation to error locations using the SML Emacs mode. Delphin provides options for pretty-printing expressions and allows the enabling/disabling of the coverage checker and the termination checker for illustrative and debugging purposes.

Coverage checking, which involves determining if a list of cases is exhaustive, and termination checking are important aspects of Delphin's functionality. The language provides mechanisms for handling coverage on computation-level expressions and features a termination checker that currently supports lexicographic extensions of the subterm ordering over inputs. If a function passes the coverage checker and is terminating, it is considered total and can be interpreted as a proof. However, the termination checker for Delphin is still a prototype and supports lexicographic extensions of the subterm ordering, with implicit arguments being omitted. 

Unlike Delphin, Twelf does not support parameter functions, as its meta-logic is not higher-order. Instead, Twelf uses blocks to specify the introduction of certain parameters together. Twelf programs can be converted to Delphin, where blocks are replaced by parameter functions, and their extensions can be expressed using the "with" keyword.
