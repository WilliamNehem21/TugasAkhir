This study examines the potential extension of the covering steps graph (CSG) technique, originally developed for untimed Petri nets by Vernadat et al., to be applied to time Petri nets (TPNs). The paper investigates how the CSG technique can be employed to create a more efficient abstraction of the state space of TPNs, with the aim of preserving relevant properties while minimizing computational resources.

The proposed extension of the CSG technique for TPNs involves grouping a set of transitions to be fired in a single transition step, such that the union of states reached by their different interleavings is convex. The study establishes two sufficient conditions (SC1 and SC2) that ensure the convexity of the contracted state class graph and outlines a method for computing this union without requiring intermediate state classes. The paper presents examples to illustrate the potential differences in state classes resulting from the interleaving of concurrent transitions in TPN state space abstractions.

The findings of this research, as presented in Theorem 4.4 and Lemma 4.5, establish conditions for the convexity of the union of state classes reached by different interleavings of the same set of transitions, and demonstrate how to compute this union effectively. The paper also outlines an extension to the CSG technique that is better suited for TPNs and offers potential applications for modeling timed linear properties in model checking.

This work by H. Boucheneb and H. Rakkay was presented at the 7th International Conference on Application of Concurrency to System Design (ACSD) and is scheduled for publication in a special issue of the "Fundamenta Informaticae" journal by the IEEE Computer Society Press in 2007.
