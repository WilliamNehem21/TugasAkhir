This academic paper introduces transformations from a generalized form of left-linear term rewrite systems (TRSs), known as quasi left-linear TRSs, to TRSs in such a way that the outermost termination of the original TRS can be deduced from the termination of the transformed TRS. The goal is to apply state-of-the-art termination tools to automatically prove the outermost termination of any given quasi left-linear TRS. The paper discusses the significance of outermost termination and presents a general variant of the outermost strategy. It also highlights the need to make a transformation from TRSs to ensure the modified outermost termination property of the original TRS can be inferred from the termination of the transformed TRS.

The approach presented focuses on ground outermost termination, explaining that the difference between outermost termination and ground outermost termination arises when fixing the signature, but this difference can be eliminated by adding fresh constants. Furthermore, the paper outlines the basic transformation T1 and its soundness, followed by alternative transformations T2 and T3 using contexts. The paper also touches upon the concept of anti-matching in the context of the transformations.

The authors demonstrate that the transformations are successful, although the approach is inherently incomplete due to the limitations of capturing the first level of nesting. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implementation of the transformations, several examples, and a brief summary of the paper's contents.

Overall, the paper provides an approach to automatically prove outermost termination for quasi left-linear TRSs, discussing various transformations and their implications, and demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach through examples.
