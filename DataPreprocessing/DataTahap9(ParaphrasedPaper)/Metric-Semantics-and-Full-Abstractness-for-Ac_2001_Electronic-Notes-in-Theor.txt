This paper investigates the use of metric techniques to develop operational and denotational semantics for a nontrivial language, as well as their comparison in a probabilistic setting. The paper emphasizes the adaptation and combination of earlier results and demonstrates that the various techniques are orthogonal, with the replacement of nondeterminacy by probability not affecting the proof methods.

The paper discusses action refinement within the context of different frameworks, such as true concurrency and petri-nets, and provides a process algebra for action refinement. It also presents a metric interleaving semantics.

The language LPR does not contain nondeterministic constructs due to the modeling issues arising from the simultaneous presence of nondeterminism and probability. However, the presence of action refinement does not seem to impact the extension of a probabilistic language to one containing both nondeterminism and probability. The paper notes that while a previous approach to extending the language LPR with nondeterministic choice and parallel composition exists, it does not address full abstractness. Achieving full abstractness for parallel composition with synchronization may require a more complex approach using failure sets.

The paper then introduces the process language LPR and its operational semantics 0, which serves as a point of reference for understanding LPR and for the subsequent semantical considerations. The section begins with an overview of the syntax for LPR.
