In an academic paper, Craig (1957) defined the concept of an interpolant, which is a logical formula p that is implied by formula a, implies formula b, and contains only symbols common to a and b. Interpolants serve as interfaces through which a and b interact using shared information. McMillan has recently demonstrated the utility of interpolants for purposes such as verification, finding inductive invariants, and predicate abstraction (McMillan, 3, 4, 5).

Furthermore, the paper aims to provide further justification for the use of substitution. Substitution is utilized to facilitate the sharing of structure between c and i. This is achieved by ensuring that inferences involving a take place in a substitution, allowing them to involve both c and i. Conversely, inferences involving b do not occur within a substitution, ensuring that such inferences only involve c. This approach aims to capture the inferences involving a while excluding those involving b, thereby enabling the formation of an interpolant that reflects the same inferences performed in practice. The authors emphasize the need to record all the actions involving a in the interpolant, which is achieved by using a substitution variable v to share everything of c in the substitution part i. Similarly, v is also used to share c with i in the presence of constraints from b, but this is associated with an original copy of the constraint that will not be modified, thereby allowing the recording of actions occurring on that constraint but not the actions using that constraint.

It is emphasized that, after the application of an inference rule, the newly generated constraint must be simplified. While it is well-known how to simplify an expression or constraint, the substitution part may not be simplified after an inference rule, as the coefficient of the largest term may not be a positive one. In response to this, the authors propose the use of an inference rule called "simplify rule" to eagerly simplify the substitution part of a constraint when each new constraint is generated.
