Common and potentially fatal respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and COVID-19 pose a significant public health threat. Accurate diagnosis of these conditions heavily relies on the results of radiographic imaging. The term "consolidation" is often used in radiology to describe the increased density of lung tissue within air spaces. Various types of lung opacity seen on chest radiographs indicate pathological processes that lead to the filling of alveoli with substances such as blood, fluid, pus, protein, or cells. Detecting consolidation can aid in the identification of multiple diseases, including pneumonia and COVID-19. In this study, we utilized a dataset comprising 7512 chest x-ray images in JPEG format, which were categorized into three classes: COVID-19 (1323 images), pneumonia (4240 images), and normal (1949 images). Following a filtering process, 33 chest x-ray images from the pneumonia category were excluded from the training set.
