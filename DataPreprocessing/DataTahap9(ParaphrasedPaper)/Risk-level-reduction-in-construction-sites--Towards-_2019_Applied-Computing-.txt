There has been a growing focus on assessing risk in the construction industry, with risk evaluations being conducted for every task, function, and machine. However, the commonly used approach does not account for many site-specific variables, leading to the suggestion from literature and experience-based analysis that spatial and temporal variables significantly influence risk distribution. To study the impact of these factors, a research project was conducted on the simultaneous occurrence of risks in the construction of an aged people hostel in Braga, Portugal. A method was developed to minimize previously estimated peak risk levels by reorganizing tasks in time and space, resulting in a significant reduction of high-risk tasks. This study, along with the increasing availability of construction-related computing tools, underscores the need for new strategies for integrated risk management and planning during the project phase to effectively mitigate risk peaks during construction.

The assessment of risk began about fifty years after the industrial revolution in England, prompted by concerns over working conditions, accidents, and other risk factors prevalent in early industries. The United States led the way in initiating risk prevention efforts through the involvement of government, entrepreneurs, and specialists. In 1928, the American Engineering Council highlighted the connections between direct and indirect costs associated with accidents, such as non-productive manpower costs, financial losses, and production disruption. In 1931, H.W. Heinrich published a study outlining a method known as the domino theory, which emphasized the causal effect as a determinant for a cascade effect governed by five factors: social environment, human error, hazardous conditions, accidents, and personal damage. Risk assessment is a crucial tool for preventing workplace risks, and regardless of the method used, its assessment is essential.

Falls pose a significant challenge to healthcare and social services worldwide, as 50% of falls result in injury, leading to substantial economic and societal burdens. While several methodologies, such as those based on accelerometers and gyroscopes, have been proposed for fall detection, they face challenges in distinguishing involuntary human falls from normal movements. Organizations typically adopt safety management systems or behavior-based safety approaches to achieve performance excellence.

A literature review on the integration and management of safety with project management by Badri et al. revealed that many published books (60% of selected publications) consider integrating risk management with process control in civil construction as crucial. Various approaches, such as integrating scheduled tasks with safety measures, have been suggested to address the critical nature and high number of workplace accidents in the construction industry. Several researchers have proposed tools to integrate safety management into production programming processes. Authors like Hare et al. and Zhang et al. have attempted to integrate different aspects of risk assessment and control, but limited results on the relationship between physical and temporal risk hazard locations prompted the need for a new methodology, which is later evaluated through a case study. This study introduces a new methodology for risk assessment in construction sites, addressing previous frameworks' limitations and providing a map for easily visualizing critical risks in time and space.

The paper presents different approaches to assessing and predicting risk distribution and then compares them. It discusses traditional analyses for determining problematic periods of risk, introduces a proposed method that accounts for time and space redistribution of risk, and compares the implementation of this method, providing evidence of its benefits for assessing risk and complementary planning of tasks during construction.

After identifying the risk distribution throughout the project timeline, measures were studied to reduce risk peaks without interfering with critical activities. The accumulation of risk was found to exhibit two distinct stages, with the initial stage showing higher risk due to the cumulative effect of similar tasks, and the second stage characterized by a high number of simultaneous activities with significant accumulated risk.

The study emphasizes the importance of risk maps in project planning, as changes in workforce, conditions, and work environments make it challenging to continuously identify, evaluate, and gather data on mutating risk factors. Safety managers should have access to risk characteristic curves for each type of construction task to introduce improvements and accommodate changes in project plans. The study also highlights the potential of developing new computer-aided tools and methodologies for risk management integrated with project planning and management. The organizational measures implemented in the study were successful in reducing peak risk levels, contributing to the development of methodologies for dynamic risk control during construction. The next research step involves evaluating the efficiency of genetic algorithms in optimizing task redistribution to reduce risk peaks.
