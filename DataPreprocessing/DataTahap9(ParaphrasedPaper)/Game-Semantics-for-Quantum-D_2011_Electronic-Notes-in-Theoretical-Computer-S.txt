The quantum intervention e?f can be derived by combining each intervention em with f. Different variations of this fundamental approach are used to interpret all the quantum operations of qdl. Specifically, when f represents the superoperator u associated with a unitary operation u, the resulting quantum intervention is referred to as the unitary strategy. This method of creating new quantum interventions from the initial one motivates the usage of quantum intervention, as implementing a similar approach with other quantum measurement formalisms, such as projective measurements, would not allow for the representation of quantum operations as general as trace-preserving superoperators.

In this paper, we have not fully explored the categorical properties of the quantum arenas introduced. For instance, it is possible to consider the category of arenas in the form [h] and probabilistic strategies that correspond to quantum operations. This category or some of its subcategories could potentially offer new models for the categorical structures associated with quantum mechanics [1, 2, 13].
