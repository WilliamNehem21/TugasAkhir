The closure operations discussed in this academic paper can serve as an alternative to the Khalimsky topology for addressing problems in computer graphics and computer image processing. The paper also presents the advantages of using these closure operations over the Khalimsky topology.

It can be demonstrated that a closure operation, denoted as ur, is idempotent if and only if the pair (x, ur) forms an Alexandroff topological space. Although ur is not generally additive, the union of a system of closed subsets of (x, ur) is a closed subset of (x, ur).

The sets defined in theorem 3.9 may not always represent simple closed curves in (Z2, Vn), and thus, this theorem does not provide a satisfactory analogy of the classical Jordan curve theorem. The paper introduces a criterion for determining when a given simple closed curve in the space (Z2, Vn) separates the space into precisely two components.

In the context of the ternary digital plane, the triangle ade is considered a Jordan curve, whereas in the Khalimsky plane, it is not even a COTS-Jordan curve. To make this triangle a COTS-Jordan curve in the Khalimsky plane, the points a, b, c, and d would need to be deleted (and then it would become a Jordan curve). However, this deletion would result in a deformation of the triangle.
