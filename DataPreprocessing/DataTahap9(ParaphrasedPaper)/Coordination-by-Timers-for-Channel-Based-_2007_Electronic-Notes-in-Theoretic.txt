Time has also been explored in coordination models that rely on data-driven approaches. In systems like Javaspaces or Tspaces, timeouts can be implemented. In the context of timed Linda, a global clock is employed and fundamental actions (such as in, out, or rd) are assumed to have negligible time overhead, equating to one time unit per execution. An additional action is introduced that allows a process to wait for a specific number of time units before transitioning to a new state. Various extensions of Linda that incorporate different time concepts have been proposed. Recently, an extension of the tuple-centre model with respect to time has been introduced.

The "well-typedness" of processes is determined by a set of static rules, which govern the behavior of a process with respect to its types. If a process endeavors to communicate on a channel for which it lacks capability, it can still be deemed "well-typed" if an alternative process, denoted as q, is well-typed. This alternative process q is referred to as the safety process.

The concept of soundness is approached using a method introduced in this study. Rather than relying on denotational or structural operational semantics, this approach is syntactic in nature. The actual proofs for this approach are available elsewhere.

A coordination protocol, denoted as CP, consists of a set of rules that stipulate conditions when multiple communication options are available during a reduction step. For instance, in the scenario of choosing among processes that can send or receive messages via a common channel named "a," a coordination rule can be established to select the sender or receiver with the lowest channel timer value. This rule could potentially be extended to encompass type timers as well.

Within coordination, the set of rules, CP, assumes greater significance in coordination languages, particularly when algorithmic considerations heavily influence computation control strategies. The aspects detailed by CP are evident in the implementation of a coordination language based on its coordination model.

A channel comprises two ends, the source (designated as "a") and the sink (designated as "b"), and is denoted as "ab." At each end, only one entity can be connected at any given time. Both channels and entities are considered mobile. Messages can be written at the source end and read at the sink end. The channels support operations such as creation, end movement, read according to a pattern, and removal of a message via a take operation, which distinguishes it from a read operation.

In the described process, the channels a and b are utilized in distinct manners, as they are relocated from one location to another. It is important to note that if discrete time values are adopted for the timer, simple Reo channels can be transformed into timed channels, limiting the transmission of messages through the channel to a restricted time period.
