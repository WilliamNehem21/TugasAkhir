Several researchers have investigated the topic of biomedical ontology, which plays a crucial role in medical informatics by contributing to knowledge management, data integration, reasoning, and decision support. Biomedical ontologies provide vocabulary to support various knowledge management tasks, such as annotating data and resources, accessing biomedical information, managing and extracting relevant information, and mapping across biomedical ontologies. They are also important for semantic interoperability and data exchange in medicine, as well as for standardizing clinical information and aiding in reasoning through data selection, aggregation, decision support, natural language processing applications, and knowledge discovery. Additionally, some ontologies have been developed in the autism domain for specific purposes.

Tu et al. developed an autism ontology based on the Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry (OBO) principles, which conforms to the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). This ontology supports the integration and annotation of terminologies to enable users to perform queries and inferences for autism phenotypes from the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) repository. The ontology includes classes describing phenotypes and classes representing autism diagnostic instruments, along with Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules that enable the ontology to infer phenotypes for patient data. One year later, the same team built a project based on this ontology with the goal of assisting researchers in accessing clinical data in NDAR.

McCray et al. created a phenotype ontology based on 24 instruments, with the goal of aiding in accessing autism data, assessing ASD instruments, and comparing these instruments for better evaluation. They collected and evaluated various diagnosis instruments and tools to define ontology concepts, and used different metrics, including those from the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) BioPortal, to build the phenotype ontology and identify areas for additional ontology development.

Furthermore, a machine learning model was used to generate SWRL rules from data obtained from the NDAR repository, with the resulting dataset including medical history features and diagnosis results for subjects. The terminologies and concepts in the ontology define the autism domain knowledge and are organized in a hierarchical form to build relationships among main classes of autism. SWRL is used to add rules into the ontology, providing an additional layer of expressiveness, and the decision tree algorithm is used as the machine learning model.

The ontology also includes classes such as treatments and profiles. The treatments class represents a list of treatments for autistic individuals, while the profile class includes various attributes such as age, blood type, gender, race, and medical history. Moreover, the data used in the manuscript were obtained from the NIH-supported National Database for Autism Research (NDAR), which is a collaborative informatics system created to support and accelerate research in autism.
