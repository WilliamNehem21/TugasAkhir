This paper presents an investigation into the use of policy iteration techniques for computing greatest fixpoint approximations in order to establish sufficient conditions for program termination. The study is limited to affine programs and the abstract domain of template constraint matrices, demonstrating that the abstract greatest fixpoint can be accurately computed using linear programming, with the choice of strategies being linked to the template constraint matrix used.

The paper further explores the connection between the proposed approach and methods employing ranking functions, and provides initial insights into these relationships, particularly for programs that admit a linear ranking function. The paper also highlights the potential challenges in making ranking functions explicit when using alternative methods to compute approximations.

The use of policy iterations, also known as strategy iterations, to compute the least fixpoint of a self-map f in static analysis is introduced. The technique involves representing f as the minimum or maximum of a set of simpler maps, with a strategy being a selection of an element of this set.

The paper primarily follows a method outlined in a previous study, focusing on affine programs and template constraint matrix domains. The authors note that future research should involve further experimental validation and comparisons with related work, including recent results on conditional termination decision frameworks presented by Bozga et al.

To enhance the analysis, the authors suggest extending the use of policy iterations to other abstract domains, such as quadratic zones, and expanding the framework to accommodate linearization and non-determinism. Additionally, they propose incorporating refinement strategies for the abstract domain to improve the precision of the analysis.

In summary, this paper demonstrates the potential of policy iteration techniques in the context of termination analysis and outlines several avenues for future research and development in this area.
