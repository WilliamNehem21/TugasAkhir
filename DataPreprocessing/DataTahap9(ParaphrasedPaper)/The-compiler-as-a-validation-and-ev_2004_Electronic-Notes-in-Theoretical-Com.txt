This academic paper discusses the necessity for recompiling applications for new implementations of an architecture to achieve peak performance. The decision to recompile an application is more likely to be made by an independent software vendor (ISV) if it is cost-effective, contingent upon the reliability of the system, compiler, and source base, as well as if recompilation consistently yields noticeable performance improvements. The paper outlines efficient techniques for evaluating source code and validating the compiler during the regular software application test cycle. Additionally, the paper proposes more aggressive self-validation methods for the compiler, aiming to reduce debugging overhead in the software development cycle and thus improve cost efficiency and the practicality of recompilations.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of the Register Stack Engine (RSE) and speculation on the Itanium architecture. Section 3 describes common software glitches and how the compiler can detect them. Section 4 demonstrates methods for the compiler to use self-checking or instrumentation techniques to identify "not a thing" (NAT) consumption faults triggered by uninitialized registers or automatic variables. Section 5 presents examples for speculation and recovery code and shows how the compiler can help evaluate the correctness of the speculation code and the generated recovery code. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

The paper also discusses specific cases where the compiler could introduce uninitialized registers that may cause NAT consumption faults at run-time and demonstrates how the compiler can identify and rectify such situations. The section introduces algorithms to prevent NAT consumption faults and emphasizes the importance of detecting variables that should be declared as volatile in the source code to improve program correctness.

The paper also describes validation algorithms that can be employed by the compiler to prevent NAT consumption faults in generated code. These algorithms include post-pass algorithms to detect potential NAT consumption faults and stress-testing techniques to force NAT consumption faults at run-time during the software test cycle. Additionally, the paper proposes context-insensitive algorithms to identify variables that may need to be declared as volatile in the source code, acknowledging that the detection of such variables is inherently challenging.

The methods outlined in the paper are not only applicable to the Itanium architecture but also extend to floating-point registers. The paper also describes advanced load and load check instructions for data speculation on the Itanium architecture and presents recovery code for control and data speculation. Furthermore, the paper offers techniques for the compiler to force a NAT consumption fault at run-time in case the check instructions are not generated, and discusses stress-testing methods for recovery code using a canary address.

In conclusion, the paper details various compiler validation and evaluation methods, highlighting their applicability in general as well as their specificity to the Itanium architecture. The methods presented aim to address issues such as parameter mismatches, missing volatile declarations, and NAT consumption faults, ultimately improving the performance and reliability of software applications.
