Medicinal plants have been utilized for human benefit since ancient times and serve as an important resource for pharmaceuticals. There exists a positive linear relationship between endophytes and medicinal plants in the production of metabolites, which is a result of genetic recombination with the host over time. Endophytic fungi residing in healthy living tissues, without causing adverse effects, produce various biologically active secondary metabolites. These endophytes must synthesize metabolites to compete with co-occurring endophytes, the host, and pathogens in order to colonize the host and for nutritional purposes. They are valuable sources of structurally unique, bioactive natural metabolites such as alkaloids, benzopyranones, benzoquinones, flavonoids, phenols, steroids, terpenoids, tetralones, and xanthones. They are potent producers of antifungal, antiviral, antibacterial, cytotoxic, and immunosuppressive compounds, which have potential for the development of novel therapies.

The superoxide radical is a potent oxidizing agent that can interact with biological membranes, leading to tissue damage and acting as a precursor to the formation of singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, or hydrogen peroxide. In this study, extracts were assessed for their ability to scavenge the superoxide radical. The highest radical scavenging activity (36.158%) was observed in the PDB extract, followed by the M1D broth (29.237%). The values for inhibition percentage ranged from 7.768% to 36.158%, with the YES broth exhibiting the lowest superoxide radical scavenging activity.

Hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive oxygen species responsible for lipid peroxidation and significant biological damage. The percentage of hydroxyl scavenging activity ranged from 31.262% to 50%, with the PDB extract (50%) exhibiting the highest radical scavenging activity, followed by the YES broth (43.085%). The extract from the MGYP broth demonstrated relatively low hydroxyl radical scavenging activity.

In addition to reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide is associated with inflammation, cancer, and other pathological conditions. Extracts were tested for their ability to compete with oxygen, thereby reducing the production of nitric oxide, which was measured using Griess reagent. The extracts displayed nitric oxide radical scavenging activity ranging from 30.78% to 53.752%, with the PDB extract exhibiting the highest activity. The order of decreasing nitric oxide radical scavenging activity was PDB > MGYP broth > M1D broth > MEB > YES broth.

The reducing power of the extracts was evaluated by measuring the formation of Prussian blue color at 700 nm, with increasing absorbance indicating an increase in reducing ability. The range of reducing power for the extracts was 17.5% to 74.81%, with the PDB extract demonstrating the highest reducing power (74.81%), followed by the M1D broth (52.3%), and the YES broth with a relatively low reducing power (17.5%).

Further research is necessary to determine whether the inhibitory effect of fungal extract on cancer cell growth is due to the inhibition of cell proliferation or the induction of cell death. The mechanism underlying the anti-proliferative effects of purified metabolites also requires investigation. It has been suggested that an in vivo study should be conducted in conjunction with the in vitro study to provide more comprehensive information about the anti-proliferative properties of the purified metabolite.
