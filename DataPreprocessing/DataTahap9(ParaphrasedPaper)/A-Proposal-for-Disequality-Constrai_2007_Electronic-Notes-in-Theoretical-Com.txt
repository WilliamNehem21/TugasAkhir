Moreover, functions that return boolean values can be utilized to identify both positive and negative responses (i.e., responses that satisfy the goal and those that do not) while functions returning success only identify positive responses, discarding others (this is due to the fact that success is a single-point domain). The selection of the appropriate operator depends on the programmer's desired outcome from the program.
