This research investigates the denotational semantics of newly created names within a continuation-passing style (CPS) framework. Newly created names play a critical role in various computational effects and are inherently intriguing. They can be employed to symbolize confidential information like cryptographic keys. The characteristics of names in a functional context are complex and have been explored using operational and denotational methods in prototypical calculi such as the nu-calculus.
