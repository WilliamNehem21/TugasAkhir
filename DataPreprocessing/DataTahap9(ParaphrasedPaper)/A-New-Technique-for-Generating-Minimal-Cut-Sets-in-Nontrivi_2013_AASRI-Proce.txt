The issue of network reliability analysis is at the forefront of numerous scientific endeavors, involving the assessment of the all-terminal reliability of networks. This problem has prompted the development of two primary classes of methods: exact and approximate. This paper aims to introduce a precise and effective method for enumerating minimal cuts (MCS) of R-networks. The proposed algorithm involves identifying a minimal paths set (MPS) and generating minimal cuts by utilizing binary decision diagrams (BDDs). The manipulation process encompasses a series of transformations, reductions, and filtering operations. The approach successfully reduces computation time and memory space and has been employed to evaluate the reliability of a national radio communication network.

Reliability engineers commonly use networks to model the physical connectivity of system components. Mathematically, a network is represented as a graph g(u, e), where the edges e denote the components (such as devices, computers, routers, etc.) and the nodes u represent the interconnections.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides some relevant background information, Section 3 elaborates on the principle of BDD manipulations, Section 4 and Section 5 respectively present the algorithm for generating MCS from ROBDD and demonstrate its computational efficiency using benchmark networks. In Section 6, it is explained how an OBDD can be reduced to a ROBDD by iteratively eliminating instances of duplicate and redundant nodes through a bottom-up graph traversal procedure. In case of duplicate nodes, one of them is removed, and all of its incoming pointers are redirected to the duplicate. If a node is deemed redundant, it is removed, and all incoming pointers are redirected to its sole child.
