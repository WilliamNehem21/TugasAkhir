Encryption and signature techniques play a crucial role in cryptography by ensuring privacy and authenticity in the public-key setting. Both privacy and authenticity are essential in ad-hoc network applications where participants can freely join or leave the network. Despite the apparent solution of combining signature and encryption, this multi-user setting presents new potential for subtle attacks not present in standalone signature and encryption settings, rendering a simple composition inadequate for achieving the desired properties.

The security of signcryption tag-kem is defined based on a previous security definition that restricts the adversary's access to the signcryption oracle for the attacked user, depending on whether the adversary is attacking privacy or authenticity. A modified security definition allows the adversary to access both oracles irrespective of the intent of the attack, resulting in a stronger security notion. However, the security of signcryption tag-kem is not sufficient to meet this modified security of signcryption.

When addressing security, two key aspects are considered: security goals and attack models. For privacy and authenticity, a common security goal and attack model known as indistinguishability (ind) or strong existential unforgeability (suf, seuf, or sef) and chosen ciphertext attack (cca2) or chosen message attack (cma) are taken into account. This results in a security notion denoted as ind-cca2/suf-cma.

In a specific step (iv) of the process, certain restrictions are placed on the attacker to prevent them from accessing the de-signcryption oracle for a particular user. The successful completion of the process is only achieved if certain conditions are met.

The proof for the ind-cca2 security is essentially similar to that for the previous security definition, and the ind-cca2 security of hybrid signcryption is established in a manner comparable to the ind-cca2 security of hybrid encryption.
