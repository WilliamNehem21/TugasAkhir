The paper discusses the use of Twitter as a platform for students to share their experiences, emotions, and seek social support. The study analyzes data from Twitter to understand the issues and challenges faced by students in their educational experiences. The findings of the research can be utilized by educational institutions to identify students who may be facing difficulties in their studies. Traditionally, demographic, academic, social network, or a combination of these data are used to detect academic failure, but using social media as a data source for this purpose is a relatively new approach. The paper introduces a new method, called the Indonesian Bigram Word Rule for Multi-label Student Complaints (INA-BWR), which aims to overcome the limitations of the bag of words method in identifying student complaints through semantic analysis.

The paper identifies seven factors related to student problems: personal, family, peer-related, subject/content, institutional agent, institutional, and social. Four factors are selected for prominent labels: personal, relation, subject, and institutional agent. The personal label covers complaints related to personal issues, while the relation label encompasses complaints about family and peer-related issues. The subject label includes complaints about heavy study loads and course materials, and the institutional agent label covers complaints about lecturers, faculties, and advisors. These labels are used as category labels to classify student complaints.

The study utilizes the INA-BWR method to identify student complaints in Indonesian text. This method involves three processes: preprocessing informal text, identifying complaints, and identifying objects. The preprocessing step involves modifying existing techniques for Indonesian social media data to suit the identification of multi-label student complaints. The identification of complaints is done using a bigram word rule, while the identification of complaint objects is achieved through matching object words with specific corpuses related to the four prominent labels.

The paper also discusses the motivations for the research, including the production of Indonesian object corpuses related to multi-label student complaints and the development of Indonesian pattern rules for student complaint identification. The study identifies dominant complaints for different labels in the first semester, such as heavy task load and material difficulties for the subject label, love relationships and difficulty in making new friends for the relation label, and issues related to lecturers and advisors for the institutional agent label.

The paper provides an overview of previous research using Twitter data for sentiment analysis, emotion/mood recognition, opinion mining, topic modeling, and complaint mining, highlighting the importance of understanding multi-label student problems through Twitter data. The study also emphasizes the differences between English and Indonesian text, and the informal features that appear in Indonesian tweets, which necessitate a precise approach for identifying student problems in Indonesian language.

The paper introduces the concept of opinion mining and discusses its application in Indonesian language, as well as the InaNLP toolkit for natural language processing in Indonesian. The study also evaluates the accuracy and effectiveness of the INA-BWR method in comparison to traditional bag of words methods in identifying student complaints.

The findings of the research are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the challenges and issues faced by students during their transition to university, while the proposed INA-BWR method aims to improve the accuracy of identifying student complaints in Indonesian text.
