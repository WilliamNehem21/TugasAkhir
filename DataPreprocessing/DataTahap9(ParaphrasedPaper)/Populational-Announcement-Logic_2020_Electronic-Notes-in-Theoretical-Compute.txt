The paper introduces Populational Announcement Logic (PPAL), a variant of Public Announcement Logic (PAL) that utilizes a fuzzy-inspired semantics and replaces individual agents with populations and groups. It defines the semantics and announcement logic of PPAL, provides an example, and demonstrates validities analogous to PAL axioms as well as proof of decidability. Furthermore, the paper briefly discusses model checking and compares PPAL against probabilistic logic, concluding that the main advantage of PPAL over PAL is the flexibility to work with previously defined agents.

The motivation behind this work is to develop a framework that can represent knowledge across populations and groups of populations, rather than discrete agents as commonly done in PAL. This framework is particularly suited for applications where the aim is to reason about the evolution of knowledge across populations. PPAL is designed for model checking, as it does not require the prior specification of agents (or populations in this case), allowing populations to be defined dynamically during execution through the announcement operators of the language.

To illustrate the utility of PPAL, the paper presents an example involving a famous politician under suspicion of money laundering and bribery, who anticipates re-election but faces public skepticism due to the charges against him. The paper then discusses how PPAL can model announcements made by a TV program to only a portion of the population, and subsequently assess the overall knowledge of the population regarding the politician.

Unlike in DEL, where individuals are directly expressed or referenced, a population in PPAL represents multiple individuals without explicit individual representation. This is motivated by the focus on representing and working with the knowledge of populations or fractions of populations rather than individual entities. The paper also introduces the concept of groups and explains how announcements in PPAL, which apply to fractions of a population or group, are akin to private announcements. It further describes the many worlds approach, wherein each population has its own model representing its current knowledge of the world.

Additionally, the paper covers fuzzy functions used in the definitions of satisfaction and provides classes for each operation without defining a specific fuzzy semantics. The authors outline properties that the fuzzy functions should satisfy and offer examples for each class.

Furthermore, the paper mentions the development of a general-purpose Java library that implements the PPAL language and semantics, as well as a model checker. Both programs are extensively tested through unit and integration testing to ensure compliance with the PPAL language and semantics. The source code for both the library and model checker is available on GitHub.

The paper also underscores a distinction between PPAL and probabilistic logic, stating that while announcements in the probabilistic logic cannot increase the quantity of states in the model, PPAL announcements can create new groups and models for these groups, regardless of their scale.
