Furthermore, the level of reputation of a mobile node is determined by the rate at which it forwards packets to its neighbors. This reputation can be calculated using both first hand and second hand reputation mechanisms. The first hand mechanism calculates reputation based on direct interactions with the mobile node, while the second hand mechanism manipulates reputation based on information obtained from neighboring nodes.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed discussion on existing reputation-based selfish node mitigation mechanisms along with their limitations. Section 3 explains the ERCRM approach for selfish node detection, which involves computing the estimated energy metric and exponential reliability coefficient, along with their corresponding algorithms and illustrations. Section 4 outlines the comprehensive simulation study conducted to evaluate the performance of the ERCRM approach, including an analysis of the results. Section 5 concludes the paper and suggests potential areas for future research.

Marti et al. introduced a reputation mechanism that incorporates watch-dog and path-rater for the effective detection and mitigation of malicious nodes in ad hoc networks. This mechanism detects malicious nodes based on two levels of rating obtained through link level and forwarding level monitoring by each mobile node. It also employs suspected and neutral ratings to identify misbehaving nodes. Michardi and Molva proposed a collaborative reputation framework using watch-dog as the detection component, incorporating subjective, indirect, and functional reputation approaches to detect selfish nodes, along with a mechanism for identifying misbehaving nodes based on a threshold level of packets dropped by a mobile node.

Additionally, Kargl et al. developed a mobile intrusion detection system that incorporates overhearing capabilities through an embedded secure architecture called SAM. This system utilizes the SDSM routing protocol to optimize routing strategy through negotiation among participating nodes in the network. Farad and Askwith introduced the Packet Conservation Monitoring Algorithm (PCMA) to detect malicious nodes in ad hoc scenarios, targeting specific types of malicious nodes in the routing path to enhance overall network performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput, total overhead, and control overhead. Zouridaki et al. proposed a reputation mechanism for detecting malicious nodes based on an opinion metric calculated using trust and confidence limits derived from statistical values obtained from reliable packet delivery, considering both first hand and second hand reputation information.

The paper also discusses the commit protocol proposed by Eidenbenz et al., which integrates a game theoretic approach with VCG payment scheme to identify misbehaving nodes and the cooperative MAC protocol introduced by Dehnie and Tomasin, which performs uniformly powerful tests and probability ratio tests to analyze the effects of fading and interference caused by selfish nodes in ad hoc environments.

The performance of the ERCRM approach is evaluated using NS 2.26 simulator through a comparative analysis with existing selfish node mitigation algorithms, including PCMA, SHRCM, and AODV-selfishness.

The presence of selfish nodes in the routing path degrades network performance by reducing packet delivery ratio, increasing packet drop rate, and the number of retransmissions. Therefore, the evaluation of ERCRM's performance is based on parameters such as packet delivery ratio, throughput, control overhead, and total overhead.
