The Data Encryption Standard (DES) utilizes a key for custom conversion to enable decryption with knowledge of the specific key used for encryption. DES operates as a standard block cipher, transforming a fixed-length plaintext bit string into a ciphertext bit string through complex operations, with both strings being the same length. In the case of DES, the block size is 64 bits, and the key comprises 64 bits, with 8 bits uniquely allocated for parity checking and subsequently discarded, leaving 56 bits effectively utilized by the algorithm and resulting in an effective key length of 56 bits.

Similar to other block ciphers, DES requires a mode of operation to ensure secure encryption. The key is typically transmitted or stored as eight bytes, with one bit in each eight-bit segment utilized for error checking in key distribution, generation, and storage, and bits eight, sixteen, through sixty-four utilized to maintain odd parity throughout the key.

Designing circuits with a large number of basic gates using illustrative diagrams can be quite challenging. Hardware Description Language (HDL) provides standard text-based expressions of circuit behavior and structure and is therefore the preferred approach for designing logic in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). VHDL is a language designed to describe the behavior of application-specific circuits in FPGA design, with its application extending to many areas for describing the function of electronic components. To enhance the precision of electrical circuits, VHDL simulation models are created, serving as the foundation for building larger circuits through a combination with schematics and system-level descriptions.

Upon completing the design, the first step in verifying its correctness involves simulation, followed by programming the result into the FPGA chip on the board. Simulating the design is crucial for ensuring its accuracy, and the software Quartus II can be employed to simulate the design's behavior, with the results visualized in an oscillogram.
