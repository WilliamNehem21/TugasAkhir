Due to its status as a pure form of human intellectual thought, the automation of reasoning through computers presents a fundamental and challenging scientific problem. The issue of propositional entailment is particularly significant, with implications for various aspects of artificial intelligence such as belief estimation, belief revision, abductive explanation, logical diagnosis, and other procedures. While the propositional entailment problem is known to be challenging due to its co-NP-hard nature, certain fragments of propositional logic offer efficient reasoning methods, notably horn formulas. A novel method for addressing the entailment problem in conjunctive forms is presented, with an application to solving the incremental satisfiability problem (iSAT). This involves determining if an initial knowledge base maintains its satisfiability when new clauses are added. The method considers the computation of a 2-CNF formula and a partial assignment, and addresses the presence of contradictory unit clauses. Various methods, including branch and bounds procedures, have been employed to address the iSAT problem. Among these, the idpl procedure, a variant of the Davis-Putnam-Loveland (DPL) method, has been shown to significantly outperform DPL for a large set of satisfiability problems. This approach draws from the work of Mahajan, Y. S., Zhaohui, F., and Sharad, M. on the ZChaff2004 efficient satisfiability solver, which was presented at the 7th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT) in 2004.
