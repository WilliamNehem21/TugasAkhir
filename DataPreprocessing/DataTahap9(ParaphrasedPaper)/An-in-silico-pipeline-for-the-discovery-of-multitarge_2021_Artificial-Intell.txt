The paper discusses the use of HDAC decoys in the Oxford Protein Informatics Group site. A method was developed to generate counterparts for DNMT1 inhibitors using the deepcoy algorithm and the active compounds dataset as a reference. The generated compounds were designed to match DUD-E descriptors in a 150:1 decoy-to-reference ratio. The performance of four classification algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting classifiers) for DNMT1 and HDAC2 datasets was compared using scikit-learn and xgboost Python modules. Logistic regression was ultimately chosen as the best-performing model.

The generated molecules' structural features were balanced considering pharmacophoric elements, and a specific substructure matching query was used. The resulting structures were subjected to a semi-automated selection process to ensure molecular diversity and correctness. A set of dual inhibitors was created from the generated molecules, and XGBoost was used for classification and hyperparameter tuning. The study used a large natural product collection as the chemical space for virtual screening and emphasized the importance of naturally derived compounds in drug discovery.

The paper highlighted the challenge of overfitting in machine learning models and outlined measures to mitigate it, such as the use of validation sets, early stopping, hyperparameter tuning, and penalty methods. Additionally, it discussed the use of a consensus approach for hit pruning and the increasing interest in polypharmacology in drug discovery. The study introduced a general CADD pipeline that integrates LBDD and SBDD to support dual-target compound discovery and design and successfully developed a classifier for DNMT1/HDAC2 inhibitors using public datasets and open-access software. The paper concluded by emphasizing the predictive capabilities and adaptability of the proposed pipeline for the discovery of small molecules targeting therapeutically relevant proteins.
