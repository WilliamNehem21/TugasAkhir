The absence of a fixed infrastructure in the network requires nodes to forward traffic for each other to enable communication between nodes that are not within physical radio range. Additionally, nodes must be capable of adjusting how they forward data over the network as they move and gain or lose neighbors within radio range. Routing protocols are employed to determine how to forward data and adapt to changes in network topology resulting from mobility.

Deng et al. discuss energy consumption attacks, black hole attacks, impersonation, and routing information disclosure. Jakobsson et al. categorize attacks as manipulation of routing information and exhaustive power consumption, and offer detailed examinations of various characteristic attacks.

The study details the hardware and software setup for the implementations, provides information on the implementation of each of the three protocols, and outlines the design of the experiments conducted to evaluate the protocols and elucidate why these tests are more pertinent than other commonly used metrics.

The process and update of RREP and RACK messages are addressed. To overcome the issue of certain operations having runtimes less than the resolution of the timer, a large number of operations are performed back-to-back for each measurement, and multiple measurements are conducted.

The results indicate considerably lower per-packet overhead for TAODV compared to SAODV, primarily attributed to the overhead involved in the RACK packets due to the need to allocate a packet buffer in the message sending system for each RACK packet. The round trip tests for route discovery were carried out for all three protocols, with TAODV demonstrating only 1.11 times longer duration than AODV, highlighting the potential for trust-based calculations and additional information exchange without incurring the overhead of SAODV.

The study concludes that there exists a wide spectrum in the tradeoff between cryptographic security and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and suggests that a hybrid protocol can be developed by adding a lightweight security mechanism to secure the trust information in routing packets, which would be less expensive than SAODV and more secure than TAODV.

The paper compares SAODV and TAODV protocols for securing ad hoc network routing and presents the results of the implementation and evaluation of both protocols on resource-limited hardware. The experiments illustrate substantial potential for the development of a secure hybrid protocol that leverages the strengths of both SAODV and TAODV.

Furthermore, future work should explore various trust metrics for ad-hoc routing, develop hybrid protocols, and test their performance, as well as evaluate the routing decisions produced by these protocols in a malicious environment.
