The stochastic population-based search method known as differential evolution (DE) was introduced by Storn and Price and is considered as a recent evolutionary algorithm strategy for addressing real-parameter optimization problems. DE sets itself apart from other evolutionary algorithms due to its use of distance and direction information to guide the search process. This study focuses on stochastic programming (SP) problems, specifically linear stochastic fractional programming problems and multi-objective stochastic linear programming problems. The models proposed by Charles are considered for these SP problems, assuming that the input is characterized by a probability distribution rather than being deterministic. The problem of optimizing the sum of multiple ratios of a function when the data under study are random in nature is referred to as the stochastic sum-of-probabilistic fractional programming (SSFP) problem. The subsequent section presents the general model of the SSFP problems. 

A set of inequality equations is presented where each one has a probability associated with it, with the variables subject to certain constraints. A total of 50 runs for each experimental setting were conducted, and the best solution among the runs was recorded as the global optimum. To evaluate performance, the results obtained by the Distance-based Evolutionary Stochastic Programming (DESP) versions are compared with those of Linear Differential Evolution (LDE), basic DE, basic particle swarm optimization (PSO), and previously reported results. Further details about LDE algorithms can be found in the referenced literature.

The study also aims to explore methods for controlling the crossover rate through a self-adaptive mechanism and to apply the DESP approach to benchmark constrained and mixed-integer programming problems. Future research will focus on assessing the performance of the DESP algorithm in solving unconstrained and constrained multi-objective optimization problems, as well as real-world applications. Additionally, an interesting direction for future research is to integrate the proposed triangular mutation with various evolutionary algorithms, including genetic algorithms, harmony search, particle swarm optimization, and foraging algorithms such as artificial bee colony, bees algorithm, and ant colony optimization.
