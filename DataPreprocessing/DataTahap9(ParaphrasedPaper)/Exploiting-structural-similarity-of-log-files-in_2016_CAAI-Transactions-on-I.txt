The rise in the use of web services has led to increased research interest in the dependability and availability of web service composition. Unexpected faults in web service composition at runtime have prompted the use of log analysis as a data-driven approach for fault diagnosis, particularly in architectures that support XML or JSON formatted logs which offer flexibility and interoperability. However, existing fault classification approaches have shown poor performance due to their neglect of the structural information of logs. To address this limitation, we propose a similarity-based Bayesian learning approach for fault classification of semi-structured logs. Our approach estimates the degree of structural similarity among log files, constructs a Combined Bayesian Network (CBN), and uses a similarity-based learning algorithm to compute probabilities in the CBN, resulting in improved fault classification accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other learning methods on structural log datasets.

In recent years, service-oriented computing (SOC) has significantly impacted the design, delivery, and consumption of software applications. Web services, as a key technology in implementing service-oriented architecture, have been widely adopted by organizations and businesses, leading to a higher complexity in web service composition. Ensuring dependability and availability in web service composition is crucial, and fault diagnosis through log analysis has become an important area of research, especially for semi-structured XML/JSON logs. However, existing classification methods for log analysis tend to overlook structural information, hindering the accuracy of fault classification. To address this, our proposed approach leverages structural similarity of log files to construct a CBN model based on log data from different structures, leading to improved fault classification performance.

Our proposed similarity-based Bayesian learning approach focuses on estimating the similarities of structural elements in heterogeneous log data and constructing a CBN model with computed probabilities, which is then used for fault classification. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Related work and existing classification methods are discussed in Section 2, an overview of the proposed structural classification approach and the CBN model is provided in Section 3, the details of CBN generation and probability computation are presented in Section 4, experimental results are shown in Section 5, and the conclusion is drawn in Section 6.

Our approach aims to address the limitations of existing fault diagnosis mechanisms and frameworks by providing a data-driven approach for fault diagnosis of web service composition. By focusing on learning from semi-structured log data that are similar in content but not identical in structure, we aim to exploit the structural information contained in XML/JSON documents for improved fault diagnosis.

To achieve this, we propose a dynamic similarity-based learning algorithm for constructing the CBN model and calculating its probabilities when new training data are introduced. This algorithm enables the incremental updating of the classification model based on new training data, leading to more accurate fault diagnosis in dynamic environments.

In conclusion, our proposed similarity-based Bayesian learning approach offers a promising solution for fault classification of web service composition based on semi-structured logs. Through experimental evaluation, our approach has demonstrated superior performance compared to other classifiers on real and synthetic log datasets, particularly in dynamic and heterogeneous environments. This work is supported by various research programs and foundations, and future research will focus on enlarging the size of log datasets from real-world service flows and optimizing the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency of fault diagnosis for web service composition.
