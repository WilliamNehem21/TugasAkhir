This academic paper introduces the concept of two-dimensional linear algebra, which involves replacing sets with categories in the context of linear algebra. The paper discusses categories that function as both algebras for a monad and coalgebras for a comonad on a category such as symmons, the category of small symmetric monoidal categories. It outlines important notions such as pseudo-closed 2-category, symmetric monoidal lawvere theory, commutativity of a symmetric monoidal lawvere theory, and the role of coalgebra in this setting.

The paper also explores the relationship between linear algebra and the study of coalgebras, and it discusses the potential applications of this study to computer science. The paper is organized into sections that outline the conception of two-dimensional linear algebra, introduce the notion of a symmetric monoidal lawvere theory, define commutativity in this context, and discuss the construction of a comonad for non-commutative symmetric monoidal lawvere theories.

The paper suggests two approaches to address the challenges in this area: first, by defining a notion of pseudo-symmetric pseudo-monoidal pseudo-closed 2-category and proving that the 2-category symmon has that structure, and second, by exploring the construction of a comonad for non-commutative symmetric monoidal lawvere theories.

The paper provides examples of pseudo-commutative monads and discusses the notion of a symmetric monoidal lawvere theory as a generalization of the ordinary lawvere theory. It also discusses the expansion of this generalization to consider non-commutative symmetric monoidal lawvere theories.

The paper does not provide detailed definitions, as the work is still ongoing, but it points the reader to relevant sources for further information. It also outlines future directions for research in this area and discusses examples of non-commutative symmetric monoidal lawvere theories.
