In this research paper, we introduced a novel approach that combines the description logic ALC with coalition logic, enabling the application of modal operators to both formulas and concepts. However, this combination maintained a clear separation between the agent and concept layers, preventing the use of first-order elements of description logic to specify how agents and their groups can influence themselves. To address this limitation, we extended the language of concepts to include names of individuals (including agents) and allowed for more complex terms to define coalitions. This simple extension enabled the expression of surprisingly sophisticated properties, as demonstrated in section 2.4. Additionally, we expanded the satisfiability procedure to handle the new language and established complexity bounds for the satisfiability problem.

We defined a run R over all states, such that an individual (in the classical sense) corresponding to R is represented by some type in every state, validating the constant domain assumption. However, several properties need to be imposed on runs to preserve satisfiability.

We also presented an algorithm, based on Theorem 3.12, which constructs a finite representation of a compact Hintikka quasistructure for a CLALCO-formula and can be used as a decision procedure for the satisfiability of CLALCO-formulas. In this section, we described the algorithm and proved its termination, soundness, and completeness.

Furthermore, we discussed Pauly's achievement of the PSPACE lower bound for the satisfiability problem of CL by polynomial reduction from the satisfiability problem of KD (the normal modal logic over serial frames). The formula satisfiability problem of KDALC is NEXPTIME-hard, leading us to conjecture that the NEXPTIME-hardness of CLALC (which is subsumed by CLALCO) could be demonstrated by a similar reduction.

On a methodological level, this study provides an interesting reflection. In our previous work, we proposed a general framework for combining strategic and descriptive elements of a multi-agent system. However, we discovered that a nontrivial semantic machinery does not necessarily lead to exciting specifications. Here, we presented a small extension of the framework that allows for the specification of surprisingly sophisticated properties, as demonstrated in section 2.4. This highlights that the practical usability of a language may depend on elements that appear minor from a theoretical perspective.
