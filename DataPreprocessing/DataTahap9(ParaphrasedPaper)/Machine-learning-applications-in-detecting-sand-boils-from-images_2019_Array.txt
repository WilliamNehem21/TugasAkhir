Levees are built to provide protection from natural bodies of water and to prevent low-lying areas from flooding. The presence of sand boils along the outside of the levee is an indication of potential structural failure, which can lead to significant damage to property and loss of life. Currently, the analysis and monitoring of sand boils are performed manually. This study aims to automate this process by identifying machine learning models capable of accurately detecting sand boils near levees, allowing for more targeted monitoring by personnel. Due to the lack of a centralized dataset for relevant images, the dataset for this study was manually collected from various sources and includes satellite images of challenging terrain for machine learning algorithms to identify sand boils. The study resulted in the development of a robust predictor capable of accurately identifying potential sand boils, which was compared to other potential machine learning approaches to ensure its accuracy.

Levees and floodwalls degrade over time due to various factors such as severe weather, development of sand boils, land subsidence, seepage, and the development of cracks. For example, coastal Louisiana lost approximately 16 square miles of land between 1985 and 2010. Failures of levees and floodwalls can have catastrophic consequences, as demonstrated by the 50 failures following the passage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which caused flooding in 80% of the city of New Orleans and all of St. Bernard Parish. Proper maintenance and active monitoring of levees are essential for flood control to avoid significant property damage and loss of life. The study aims to expedite this process and assist in monitoring levees and coastal changes by detecting sand boils from images, expected to be collected by drones for levee monitoring.

Computer vision involves using algorithms to manipulate image-based data, extracting features from images and passing them to machine learning models for identifying specific regions of interest. Object detection combines computer vision and machine learning, recognizing instances of target objects and drawing bounding boxes around them. Image detection focuses on locating objects within an image by drawing bounding boxes, while object recognition compares the similarity between two images.

The study collected dataset images from various sources, as there is no centralized, easily accessible data for levees and sand boils. The collection was primarily done manually due to the lack of such centralized data. The annotation of positive regions within the samples was a manual, time-consuming process, resulting in 956 images labeled as positive samples. Different methods were used for annotation, and features from positive and negative samples were extracted and fed into the machine learning methods. The Viola-Jones algorithm used haar features, calculated internally by OpenCV, while the features for the YOLO algorithm and SSD method were extracted internally by the convolutional net itself. The study also utilized the genetic algorithm to select the best set of features among a total of 700, ultimately determining that the complete set of features performed better compared to the feature set selected by the genetic algorithm.

The research involved training and testing different methods for detecting sand boils, and it emphasized the importance of automating the monitoring of levees for timely intervention and prevention of disasters caused by levee failures.
