Even in the absence of wind, the movement of the vehicle generates forces that cause the blades to rotate. These blades are connected to the generator through a shaft, allowing them to produce power. The electrical energy produced can be used to charge batteries or power accessories.

This system offers two key advantages compared to other solutions. Firstly, when the device is inactive, there is no impact on aerodynamics. Secondly, the system can be utilized during downhill motion, as the kinetic energy is more substantial than on a level surface.

This section introduces a novel device for converting suspension motion into power. The contact between the ground and the wheel induces a translational movement, which can be converted into electrical energy through the addition of a simple mechanism. It is simply a matter of transforming the translational movement into rotational movement in order to generate power.
