The analyses mentioned in the paper both rely on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). A downside of this approach is that it can be challenging to handle circuits that are difficult to represent using BDDs, as the method relies on computing a BDD that represents the function implemented by the circuit. Additionally, the analyses involve a fixed point computation over BDDs, which may introduce additional costs.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: 
- The first three sections serve as a tutorial on the topic, providing background material that is also presented elsewhere. 
- Section 2 introduces the definition of circuits and their classical semantics. 
- Section 3 explains how to verify safety properties of circuits under the classical semantics using a propositional theorem prover. 
- Section 4 presents the constructive semantics of circuits, which aligns more closely with the behavior of electrical circuits. 
- The main result is presented in section 5, demonstrating how safety properties of cyclic circuits can be proven under the constructive semantics. 
- Finally, section 6 discusses related work and concludes the paper.

Elsewhere in the paper, the concept of a safety property is introduced, stating that a property (denoted as "p") is valid if it holds true for all solutions of a combinational circuit. The paper also discusses the use of a propositional logic theorem prover to check the validity of safety properties for combinational circuits.

The paper acknowledges that the method of temporal induction described is sound but not complete, noting that there are safety properties that are valid but cannot be proven using the proposed method. The paper suggests addressing this issue by adding the assumption that all states used in the induction step are unique, in order to exclude loops and make the method complete.

The concept of cyclicity is introduced, defining the direct dependence between variables in a combinational circuit. Furthermore, the paper outlines the correspondence between the mathematical definition of circuits and their electrical implementation.

The concept of constructiveness as a safety property is discussed, where a combinational circuit is referred to as constructive if all solutions are defined for all defined inputs.

The paper also outlines the formulation of the constructiveness condition as a safety property, describing how the analysis can be implemented independently from the underlying verification method.

The paper touches upon possible improvements, suggesting the investigation of circuit structure and the application of the analysis specifically on the strongly connected components of the circuit.
