Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) serves as a crucial cash crop for farmers in both developed and developing countries. Currently, it is harvested using machines such as stripper or spindle pickers in developed countries, while manual harvesting is common in developing countries. While hand-picking offers advantages such as better preservation of fiber characteristics and high harvesting efficiency, it also presents several challenges, including health hazards due to pesticide residues and the labor-intensive nature of the work. With the anticipated decrease in agricultural workers and an increase in labor costs, mechanical harvesting is becoming increasingly necessary. However, existing non-selective cotton harvesting machines are associated with drawbacks when compared to manual hand picking, including increased trash content productivity and higher field losses. Therefore, there is a pressing need for mechanical harvesting systems that can achieve a high recognition rate with minimal errors, lower harvesting time, and reduced trash content. The current accuracy of cotton segmentation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is below 80.0%, prompting the development of lightweight CNN models with improved accuracy, minimal errors, and faster inference times. This study aims to evaluate the performance of these developed models in terms of intersection over union, F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall values, and to compare their performance with existing state-of-the-art networks.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 details the image dataset preparation, methodology for CNN model development, training procedures, and performance evaluation criteria. Section 3 presents the results of the trained models in segmenting cotton bolls. Finally, Section 4 concludes the findings of the study.

The image acquisition, labeling, preprocessing, and augmentation process is described, as well as the development of three new CNN architectures and the training procedures for these models. Non-linear activation functions were applied after each convolutional layer to extract non-linear features and improve the accuracy of the proposed CNNs. The ReLU activation function was used due to its faster convergence and resistance to vanishing gradient problems. Weight initialization using the He initialization method was implemented to prevent exploding and vanishing gradient issues during the training process. The models proposed in this study consist of encoder and decoder parts, and were built using the Keras v2.4.0 deep learning API with TensorFlow v2.6.1 as its backend. 

The study assessed the impact of applying dropout layers in fully convolutional neural networks and found that an increased dropout rate resulted in decreased mean-IoU, cotton-IoU, F1-score, and pixel accuracy values. The dropout layer was deemed ineffective and was found to decrease the overall performance of the fully convolutional neural network, possibly due to the strong spatial correlation present in cotton field images and the extracted feature maps.

Additionally, the study compared the cotton-IoU scores and inference times of different models, indicating that a reduction in the number of filters led to a reduction in the cotton-IoU score but also resulted in a decrease in inference time. Furthermore, the study observed that the proposed models achieved comparable mean-IoU values to existing state-of-the-art networks while having fewer trainable parameters. Specifically, the proposed model with the highest number of trainable parameters achieved a mean-IoU of 94.65%, which was only slightly lower than the values achieved by other networks with significantly higher numbers of trainable parameters.
