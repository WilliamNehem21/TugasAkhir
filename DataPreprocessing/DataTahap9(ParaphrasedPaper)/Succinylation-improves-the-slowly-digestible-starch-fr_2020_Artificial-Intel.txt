The research aimed to enhance the slowly digestible starch (SDS) fraction of cardaba banana through the octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) modification process. Nonlinear (Response Surface Methodology [RSM] and Artificial Neural Network [ANN]) and linear (Partial Least Square [PLS]) models were used, and their predictability was assessed. The findings demonstrated that all the modeling techniques accurately predicted the experimental process. The optimized RSM values for generating the SDS fraction were an OSA concentration of 4%, a reaction time of 47.49 minutes, and a pH of 10, resulting in a predicted SDS value of 44.64%. Among the modeling techniques, ANN was identified as the most effective model for enhancing the SDS yield. The regression coefficient and Variable Important in Projection (VIP) values of the PLS model indicated that the OSA concentration was the most influential factor for achieving a high SDS yield. Furthermore, the optimized starch exhibited a highly ordered crystalline structure compared to native starch, due to the introduction of the modifying agent to the hydroxyl group of the cardaba banana starch.

Cardaba bananas (Musa abb) are commonly utilized for food product development, particularly in the production of fried chips. These bananas are considered under-utilized and are susceptible to post-harvest spoilage due to their high moisture content and metabolic features. Notably, cardaba bananas have a high pulp starch content, making them significant in starch production. Resistant starch, which resists digestion in the small intestine and undergoes fermentation in the colon, offers health benefits and is associated with low glycemic index. However, native starches typically contain a high fraction of rapidly digestible starch, leading to a high glucose response. Thus, modification of native starch is crucial to address this issue.

Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is a statistical and mathematical modeling method used to optimize experimental conditions for maximizing or minimizing experimental response, and it has diverse applications in food processing. On the other hand, Partial Least Square regression analysis (PLS) is a nonlinear modeling method used to establish the relationship between two experimental data sets. Finally, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modeling and optimization were conducted using various transfer functions and learning algorithms to predict the SDS output variable, resulting in the determination of an optimal network topology.
