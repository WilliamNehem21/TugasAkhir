This paper explores the relationship between two prominent models for interactive systems. Leifer and Milner's reactive systems enable the derivation of an interactive semantics from a reduction semantics, ensuring, under certain limitations, the compositional nature of the abstract semantics (bisimilarity). Universal coalgebra provides a categorical framework where bisimilarity can be defined as final semantics, specifically as the unique morphism to the final coalgebra. Furthermore, while lifting a coalgebra provides a clear representation of the intended state structure, reaction rules, often unconditional, directly account for potential system steps. Notably, the transitions resulting from reaction rules are unlabeled, signifying system evolutions without external interactions. Consequently, reduction semantics are neither inherently abstract nor compositional.

Following a formal introduction to the theory of reactive systems (section 2) and the theory of coalgebras and structured coalgebras (section 3), we initially establish a coalgebraic characterization of the derived LTS of reactive systems (section 4). Subsequently, we extend this construction from sets to algebras representing the syntactical category of reactive systems (section 5). The paper concludes by summarizing the findings and outlining future research directions (section 6). Detailed proofs of key lemmas are available.

It is important to note that PC is not an endofunctor on set, unlike in the aforementioned standard PL case. Instead, it is defined on set|c2|, i.e., the category of sets sorted by pairs of objects in |c|. In an ILTS, the states are arrows of a category and are thereby typed by their source and target objects. As a result, the carrier of a coalgebra encompasses not only a set but a family of sets indexed by their types.

Leifer and Milner's theory of reactive systems facilitates the derivation of a labeled transition system from a reduction semantics (i.e., an unlabeled transition system) by considering the possible contexts (environments) in which the system can interact as labels. The primary outcome of this theory is that if the fundamental category defining the syntax of the formalism possesses special colimits (i.e., RPOs), then bisimilarity on the distilled LTS is a congruence.
