The use of camera-based object tracking systems in enclosed environments raises concerns about privacy and confidentiality. To address this issue, the study implemented light detection and ranging (lidar) technology for object tracking, ensuring privacy and confidentiality. The main purpose of the study was to validate the effectiveness of this technique through carefully designed experiments conducted in two scenarios. The first scenario demonstrated the capability of the proposed technique to detect the locations of multiple objects on a flat surface by analyzing lidar data collected from various locations within the closed environment. The second scenario showcased the effectiveness of the technique in detecting multiple objects using lidar data obtained from a single, fixed location, with real-time experiments involving human subjects navigating predefined paths. The results revealed that a strategically positioned lidar can effectively detect moving objects around it. Additionally, the study compared various regression techniques for predicting bounding box coordinates, with Gaussian process regression (GPR) combined with particle swarm optimization (PSO) achieving the lowest prediction mean square error of 0.01. The findings pave the way for the extension of the proposed technique to real-time applications such as crowd management in malls, surveillance systems, and various internet of things scenarios. The paper also discussed the significance of lidar usage and the fusion of deep learning techniques in object and human detection across diverse environments, highlighting the potential benefits in improving operational efficiency and mitigating risks in high-risk locations. Furthermore, the study addressed challenges in precise object location within complex scenes, emphasizing the need for advancements in segmentation methods. It also examined the combination of 2D lidar with camera data to estimate indoor environment layouts, leveraging motion cues and optimization algorithms to demonstrate the versatility of this sensing modality. Moreover, the study introduced an innovative approach centered on estimating object coordinates using camera target values derived from lidar data to minimize error and reduce reliance on visible light, addressing computational complexity and privacy concerns. The paper also discussed hyperparameter tuning of GPR using PSO to minimize object detection errors in closed environments. Additionally, the study presented standardized and processed lidar data matrices for further analysis and modeling, highlighting their potential use in statistical or machine-learning techniques to gain insights or make predictions. Finally, the study discussed the algorithmic approach to particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the use of polynomial interpolation to obtain the length of lidar data. Target points were collected for both closed environments using an Android mobile phone camera mounted on the top view to capture the target image of multiple objects at different locations.
