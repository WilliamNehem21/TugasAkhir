This paper introduces a novel clustering ensemble approach based on the Dempster-Shafer theory. The method involves generating base partitions using evidential clustering algorithms such as evidential c-means or evclus, converting these partitions into relational representations, and then combining them by averaging. The combined representations are made transitive using intuitionistic fuzzy relations, and a consensus solution is obtained by minimizing an error function. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through experiments with both simulated and real datasets.

Clustering is a widely used statistical method in machine learning and pattern recognition, with applications in fields such as data mining and image segmentation. Evidential clustering, which utilizes Dempster-Shafer theory to compute credal partitions describing cluster membership uncertainty, has garnered significant attention from researchers.

The proposed method combines base credal partitions generated by various clustering algorithms and constructs a combined relational representation to provide a more informative output. The approach uses a co-association matrix to capture the relationship between objects in different clusters and applies a transitive closure to make the combined relational representation transitive. The final output is an evidential partition that encapsulates a richer description of the clustering structure of the dataset.

The paper also discusses the challenges and potential future research directions, such as determining the number of clusters and extending the approach to combine partitions from different clustering algorithms.

Overall, the proposed clustering ensemble method based on Dempster-Shafer theory shows promising performance and presents a new approach for handling uncertainty in clustering. However, further research is needed to fully explore its capabilities and limitations.
