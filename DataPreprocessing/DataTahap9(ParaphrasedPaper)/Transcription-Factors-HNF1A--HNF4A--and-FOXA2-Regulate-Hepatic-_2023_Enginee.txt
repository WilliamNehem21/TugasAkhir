In this investigation, we utilized advanced CRISPR/dCas9-based molecular techniques to explore the potential regulation of glyco-genes, which encode the primary glycosyltransferases and corresponding glycans, by the transcription factors HNF1A, HNF4A, and FOXA2 in HepG2 cells, a model for the human liver. To avoid lethality or significant reduction in cell viability caused by total knock-down of these transcription factors, we opted to downregulate HNF1A, HNF4A, and FOXA2 genes individually or in pairs (HNF1A/HNF4A, HNF1A/FOXA2, and HNF4A/FOXA2) using the CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB molecular tool. Our focus was on fine-tuning the protein glycosylation process under physiological conditions.

Our findings revealed a link between the transcriptional activity of several glycosyltransferases responsible for glycan branching and the composition of the N-glycome in HepG2 cells. This relationship between glycosyltransferase expression and the N-glycan structure was not straightforward, as previously observed in other studies. For instance, during the maturation of murine embryonic stem cells to embryonic endodermal (exe) cells, an increase in the expression of certain glyco-genes did not correspond to changes in the associated glycan structures. Similarly, the levels of certain glyco-genes were not elevated, yet the proportion of specific glycan structures increased. Furthermore, recent research has demonstrated that the overexpression of a subset of glyco-genes had an impact on immunoglobulin G (IgG) glycosylation in Chinese hamster ovary cells.
