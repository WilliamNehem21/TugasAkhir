The second editor possesses an additional state parameter, namely the count of characters read, and functions by reading a character. If the character is normal, it continues as usual. However, if the character is a backspace, it will delete the last character if there is at least one character remaining. If no characters are left, it will produce a beep sound.

Previously, the only termination condition for our programs was when r(s, c) is empty for some s, c. If a program reaches this state, it never provides any response and becomes unresponsive. We aim to have our programs terminate and return a certain value, which we can interpret as the output of the function computed by the program. Therefore, we grant our programs the ability to terminate in a state s with a specific value a from a set a(s).
