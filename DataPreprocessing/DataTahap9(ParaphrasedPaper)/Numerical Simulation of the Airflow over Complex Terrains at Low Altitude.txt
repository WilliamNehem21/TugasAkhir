To address the limitations of current methods, this paper introduces a numerical simulation technique for analyzing two-dimensional airflow over intricate terrains, with applications in engineering for flight dynamics. Drawing upon potential flow theories, the impact of terrain on the wind field is accounted for through a series of two-dimensional vortices, whose strengths are determined in conjunction with ground boundary conditions. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical examples and is validated by comparing its outcomes with those obtained from an existing method. The findings indicate that the two-dimensional profile of complex terrains can be accurately represented by a cubic spline curve. The computational procedure outlined in this paper is straightforward and efficient, yielding wind field results with significant accuracy. Consequently, this method holds promise for the evaluation of flight principles and flight simulators.

Similarly to the solving approach of the vortex lattice method in aerodynamics, the terrain curve is discretized into n straight line elements. At the quarter point of each element, a two-dimensional vortex is positioned, with the three-quarter point serving as the colocation point where the actual boundary condition is applied. As a result, the effect of terrains on the wind field can be captured by summing the induced velocities of all the vortices at any arbitrary point in the wind field. When the wind field is devoid of terrains, the stream function can be defined using a uniform free stream.

In a related study, airflow over a single mountain is simulated by modeling the ideal flow around a cylinder. A streamline has been selected to depict the shape of the terrains, with a parameter s used to achieve different mountain shapes. Furthermore, airflow over multiple mountains is simulated through the superposition of ideal flows around multiple cylinders. However, this method has inherent limitations as it can only model a restricted range of terrain shapes, and manual adjustments are required for the parameters to approximate the mountain shape.

The flow around a cylinder can be solved by superimposing two fundamental potential flow solutions: the doublet and the uniform free stream. Notably, the wind field's stream function can be expressed in terms of the speed of the uniform free stream along the x-axis, the number of doublets, the coordinates of each doublet, and the radius of the relative cylinder.

In summary, this paper presents a numerical simulation method for analyzing two-dimensional airflow over complex terrains based on aerodynamic potential flow theories. The technique incorporates the influence of terrains on the wind field using a series of two-dimensional vortices, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through numerical examples and comparison with an existing method.
