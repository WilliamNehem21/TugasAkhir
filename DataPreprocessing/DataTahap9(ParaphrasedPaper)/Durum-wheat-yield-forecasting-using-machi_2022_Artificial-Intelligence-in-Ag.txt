Fortunately, data impurities such as noise, outliers, missing data, duplicate data, or any other anomalies can be addressed using data cleansing methods, while small data set issues can be resolved through data augmentation methods. Data augmentation involves techniques to increase the diversity of training data without explicitly collecting new data, which is aimed at improving the generalization ability of training models, especially for real-world data. Generalization is important for helping networks overcome small data sets, and it is used to regularize and reduce overfitting when training machine learning models (Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019).

Data augmentation is widely applied in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, particularly in computer vision and pattern recognition for generating more labeled data, and in natural language processing (NLP) for augmenting patterns. Additionally, data augmentation techniques have been used in time series classification for crop management and yield forecasting (Iwana and Uchida, 2021).

This paper aims to demonstrate potential applications of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) for crop management, particularly the prediction of crop yield. The study focuses on two trends for crop estimation, which are related to data sources that directly impact crops, such as soil data, weather data, and environmental parameter data. The authors also discuss the integration of small data sets from different provinces to create a larger training base for crop yield forecasting.

The study focuses on durum wheat, the most important crop in the chosen regions. Historical data on durum wheat yields were obtained from the agricultural services of two provinces, Constantine and Setif. The yield data covers multiple seasons and is expressed as harvested production per unit area.

Climatic data from both provinces were also collected, with one source providing daily-level records and the other providing data from 1945 but with limited features and download options. The authors selected common attributes from both sources, such as monthly mean temperature and precipitation, as predictor variables for the study.

The data sets were divided into training and test data, and three-fold cross-validation was used to train the ML algorithms. The study compared the performance of different regression methods, such as artificial neural network (ANN), deep neural network (DNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR), for crop yield prediction.

The results indicated that certain ML methods performed better with larger data sets, while others performed well with fewer input variables. The authors observed variations in model performance across different evaluation metrics and experiments, with different methods showing strengths and weaknesses in predicting crop yield.

The study also highlighted the potential impact of weather features on crop yield prediction, especially in different climate zones. Furthermore, it discussed the limitations of using aggregated provincial data and the potential benefits of obtaining field-level information for more accurate forecasting.

The authors emphasized the importance of data augmentation in improving the quality of predictions for ML models and suggested potential avenues for future research, such as leveraging field-level information for yield forecasting and exploring deep learning models for image-based crop yield prediction using satellite data.

Overall, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of data augmentation in improving ML model performance for crop yield prediction, highlighted the importance of considering climate variability in forecasting, and raised potential areas for further research and improvement in crop yield forecasting models.
