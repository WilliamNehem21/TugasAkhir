The occurrence of oscillation in rotor angle due to contingencies in power systems can lead to power swings. To prevent erroneous relay operation during power swings, distance relays are designed to block their operation. However, this blocking scheme is susceptible to preventing trip signals during fault occurrences within power swings. Therefore, there is a need to develop a proper fault detection technique to address this issue. This paper introduces a new fault detection technique during power swings utilizing the s-transform. The validity of this technique is verified using the IEEE 14 bus test system, and simulation results demonstrate its capability to detect faults occurring during power swings.

Existing techniques have limitations in properly operating during high resistance faults and/or symmetrical faults. In response to these shortcomings, a new fault detection technique based on the s-transform features of bus voltage during power swings is proposed. The proposed technique's validity is established through evaluation and simulations conducted on the IEEE 14 bus test system.

This paper presents a novel fault detection technique for distance relays during power swings. It employs the utilization of the s-transform processing tool to analyze distance relay input signals based on bus voltage and detect faults occurring during power swings. This technique has been proven effective in detecting different types of faults with varying fault resistances.
