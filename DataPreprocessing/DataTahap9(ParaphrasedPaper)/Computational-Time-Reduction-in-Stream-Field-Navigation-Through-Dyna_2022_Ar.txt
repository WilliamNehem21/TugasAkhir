The local minima problem in APF algorithms can be addressed by approximating obstacles as cylinders and then computing fluid stream only around these cylinders using specific potential functions. However, a limitation of this approach is that complex obstacles are approximated as cylinders, which may not always be a valid representation. Another potential solution involves the use of machine learning techniques.

This research introduces an additional layer of efficiency improvement for kinematic environments. The mathematical model and fundamental SfN approach are detailed in the next section, while section 3 illustrates how a path can be dynamically updated to avoid recalculating the stream in special cases. Section 4 presents the results and time improvement of the introduced approach.

It is ensured that a path always exists from the start point qs to the goal point qg, as the underlying physical model conserves momentum and mass. In other words, it guarantees that if mass is flowing inside the system, there will be mass flowing outside.

Two approaches are generally used for addressing the variable field problem: the online approach (local approach) and the offline approach (global approach). A robotic system using the former approach updates the path while navigating the environment and while the robot is in motion towards its target. In the latter approach, the path is recalculated from the beginning before the robot takes further actions. In the event of an impending collision, the local field planner processes the situation.

The experiment was conducted 100 times in each field to obtain empirical statistical results of execution times. For each field, the results are presented as the mean (average) execution time and the standard deviation of the execution times from the 100 runs. The standard deviation is included in the results, as the mean alone is not an effective statistical measure for execution times.
