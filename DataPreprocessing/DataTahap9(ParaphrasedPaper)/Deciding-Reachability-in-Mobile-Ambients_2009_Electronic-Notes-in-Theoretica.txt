In this research, we examine the reachability problem for subsets of mobile ambients, a robust computational model for distributed and mobile systems. Through an association with associative-commutative term rewriting, we demonstrate the decidability of reachability in the open-free subset of pure mobile ambients with name restriction and weak reduction semantics. The model's processes exhibit three sources of infiniteness: the depth of ambients, the width of parallel composition, and the number of restricted names. Our findings build upon previous results obtained for public subsets of mobile ambients.

Prior studies have explored the expressive capabilities and verification challenges of variants of mobile ambients [2,10,1,3,5,7,8]. This paper focuses on the reachability problem, which inquires whether there exists a computation from process p to process q. This problem has been previously investigated for public subsets of mobile ambients without name restriction. Notably, our work investigates the relationship between public subsets of mobile ambients and a subset of associative and commutative term rewriting, referred to as TUC. We show that the computational mechanisms of public mobile ambients can be naturally represented using rewriting systems that operate on terms with multiset-variables. We also establish that reachability between ground terms, under a set of rules with multiset-variables, is decidable for the structure preserving subset of TUC, known as TUCSP. Within TUCSP, structure preserving rules are unable to remove internal nodes of a tree term, but they can still generate and consume leaves. We further demonstrate that the decidability of reachability in TUCSP extends the results obtained for the subsets of mobile ambients. Specifically, the semantic and syntactic constraints for mobile ambients can be reformulated uniformly using a set of structure preserving TUC rewrite rules. It is noteworthy that TUCSP exhibits distinct characteristics from other subsets of associative and commutative rewriting, such as PRS and AC ground rewriting, due to the need for synchronization rules to express the movement operations of mobile ambients.

To demonstrate the decidability of the reachability problem for the subset of pure mobile ambients defined earlier, we establish a reduction to reachability in a specific subset of associative and commutative term rewriting named structure preserving, which is itself decidable. In the subsequent section, we introduce the syntax of structure preserving rewrite rules.
