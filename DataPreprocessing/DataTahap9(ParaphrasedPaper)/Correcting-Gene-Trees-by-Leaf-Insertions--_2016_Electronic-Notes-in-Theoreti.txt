This academic paper aims to identify the evolutionary events that occurred in the evolution of a specific gene family by comparing gene trees and species trees. Gene trees and species trees may differ due to differences in evolutionary histories, and the reconciliation of the two trees is used to infer the evolutionary events depicted in the gene tree.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides definitions and properties of gene trees and species trees, and introduces the two combinatorial problems of interest. Section 3 demonstrates that the leaf insertion problem is NP-complete, while Section 4 presents an approximation algorithm with a factor of 2 for the minimum leaf insertion problem. The paper concludes with a discussion of open problems.

Errors in the gene tree are associated with "nad nodes," as noted in related research. The paper discusses two combinatorial problems that focus on modifying the gene tree by inserting leaves. The proof shows that a node labeled as "nad" can be modified by inserting leaves with specific labels to ensure consistency in the gene tree. The algorithm removes specific labels and inserts new leaves to maintain consistency without affecting the mapping of other nodes in the gene tree.
