The use of manifold alignment is valuable for extracting the common underlying structure among multiple datasets and for determining the similarity between different datasets. Given that various real-world datasets can be analyzed using low-dimensional representations, manifold alignment algorithms can have broad applications, including in data mining. In this paper, we present a three-stage approach to manifold alignment using discrete surface Ricci flow. Our proposed method involves transforming the original intrinsic manifolds to hyperspheres through conformal mapping in the first stage, followed by scaling these hyperspheres to the same size and aligning them in subsequent stages. We provide a detailed description of our algorithm, its theoretical basis, experimental results, and a comparison with previous alignment methods. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we present three types of experiments, including a small toy dataset, a parallel corpus of parliament proceedings, and a dataset containing both images and texts. These experiments showcase the ability of our algorithm to reveal similarities among diverse datasets, whether within the same type of data or across different modalities of data.

Our approach, based on discrete surface Ricci flow, transforms the original intrinsic manifolds of the datasets to hyperspheres using conformal mapping. The relative distances between each pair of data points on the surfaces are preserved, after which the hyperspheres are aligned. The generated manifolds are scaled to the same size and then aligned to minimize the distance between corresponding points.

We introduce the necessary notations for describing our manifold alignment algorithm, outline the entire structure and details of the algorithm, and provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating its effectiveness. Experimental results and discussions are also presented, along with concluding remarks. Additionally, we define discrete Gaussian curvature for a mesh with a discrete metric in euclidean background geometry.

The algorithm is decomposed into three stages: the conformal transformation stage, the scale adjusting stage, and the alignment stage. As the surface structures of manifolds are complex, it is challenging to precisely describe their shape. Therefore, our aim is to transform the original intrinsic manifolds in the first stage to approximate hyperspheres, which are then adjusted and aligned in the subsequent stages.

In the first step, we transform the manifolds into hyperspheres and use the distances between each pair of points on these hyperspheres to determine the connectivity of points on the manifolds. It is crucial to ensure that the transformation preserves connectivity properties on the manifolds, which we analyze and illustrate in this section.

To validate the effectiveness of our alignment algorithm, we conduct experiments using three datasets: protein, the European corpus for cross-lingual retrieval, and Wikipedia's featured articles for cross-media retrieval. These experiments include both a toy dataset, which is easily visualized, and real-world datasets, which are more complex. The results demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to effectively handle datasets of varying sizes and complexities.

In future work, we plan to focus on finding the most appropriate approach to construct triangle meshes for approximating manifolds with complex intrinsic structures. This is particularly important for aligning two manifolds with complex structures.

The proposed algorithm utilizes manifold alignment to not only explore similarities within the same type of data, but also to identify similarities across different types of data. This demonstrates the versatility and potential of manifold alignment algorithms in various applications.
