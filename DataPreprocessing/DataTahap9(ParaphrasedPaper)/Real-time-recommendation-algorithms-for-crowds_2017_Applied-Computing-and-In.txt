In section 3 of the paper, the authors introduce two new recommendation algorithms, top-k-t and top-k-w. Section 4 presents and discusses the experimental results, while in Section 5, the authors provide commentary on related works and compare them with their own approach. Finally, the article is concluded in Section 6.

The paper discusses the challenge of providing real-time recommendation in future crowdsourcing systems due to the potentially large number of users and items. The authors propose two different methods, top-k-t and top-k-w, to address this issue.

The top-k task recommendation is described as the computation of a restricted 1-to-k mapping from workers to tasks, while the top-k worker recommendation is described as the computation of a restricted 1-to-k mapping from tasks to workers. To efficiently compute these mappings, the authors design specific data structures to facilitate the process.

The top-k-t algorithm is designed with the assumption that in a crowdsourcing system, there is a large list of available tasks and a large list of online workers, with the goal of recommending the top 50 tasks to each worker. The performance of the algorithm remains relatively constant when varying the dataset sizes and increasing the value of k from 20 to 50. The authors note that even with a large value of k, the algorithm remains extremely efficient, taking only a couple of milliseconds in their experiments.

The running time of the top-k-t algorithm is shown to be influenced only by small numbers, a and k, regardless of the size of the data. The experimental study confirms the validity and constant time performance of the algorithm.

The rapidly increasing number of tasks in crowdsourcing systems, with very short life spans, makes traditional recommendation algorithms inapplicable for providing real-time recommendations in most crowdsourcing systems. This is due to the fact that they were not designed to handle the huge flow of tasks with very short life spans, which are common in crowdsourcing systems.
