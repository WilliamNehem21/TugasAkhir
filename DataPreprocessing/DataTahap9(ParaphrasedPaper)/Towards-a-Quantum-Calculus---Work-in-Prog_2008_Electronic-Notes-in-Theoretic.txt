The quantum gate array model utilizes unitary transformations to carry out the computational aspects of quantum information processing, while the one-way quantum computer relies on one-qubit projective measurements followed by unitary Pauli corrections for computations. A formal model known as the measurement calculus has been introduced to facilitate one-way quantum computation. This paper aims to introduce a unified and generalized model of quantum computation called the quantum calculus, which allows for both unitary transformations and one-qubit measurements, and is generalized in terms of quantum operations and classical control. The quantum calculus accommodates any permissible transformation or general measurement, including the denotational semantics, which is a pure denotational semantics based on valuations over pure quantum states, as opposed to the semantics based on density matrices.
