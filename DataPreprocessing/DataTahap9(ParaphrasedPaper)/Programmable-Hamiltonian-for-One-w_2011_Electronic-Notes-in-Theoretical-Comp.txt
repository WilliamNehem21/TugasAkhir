This research aims to advance the exploration of the structural relationship between measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) and adiabatic quantum computation (AQC). Previous work has proposed various methods for adiabatic simulation of a given circuit, typically involving breaking down the circuit into rounds of computation with few gates in each round, used to construct a corresponding local Hamiltonian. Another approach has utilized adiabatic evolution to enhance the robustness of MBQC computation. In contrast to existing results, our study introduces a programmable Hamiltonian construction.

A key benefit of one-way quantum computation is its inherent parallel structure and the rich toolkit of graph theory for algorithm design. Our primary objective is to develop a model that possesses these properties, along with the advantage of programmable and robust continuous-time evolution. To achieve this, we first translate the one-way pattern into Hamiltonian evolution.

In our construction, to match the depth complexity of the one-way pattern, we eliminate the z dependency of measurements using the signal shifting scheme, as introduced earlier, and then parallelize the resulting controlled gates using the techniques from a prior work. However, this approach may affect the dimension of the program register. The examination of structural connections between locality and parallelism is beyond the scope of this paper and warrants further investigation. This work contributes to the study of the relationship between MBQC and AQC, and we hope it will contribute to further understanding of these quantum computing models.
