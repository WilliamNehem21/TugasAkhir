Metal intermetallic laminated (MIL) composites are created through the reaction sintering of titanium and aluminum foils with varying thicknesses. The formation of the intermetallic phase Al3Ti during this process results in enhanced hardness and stiffness for the composite, while the unreacted titanium contributes to its necessary strength and ductility. This paper presents findings from studies on the microstructure and mechanical properties of layered composites within the titanium-aluminum system. The results of static and dynamic tests are discussed for cases where the intermetallic reaction was either partially completed or fully accomplished during the sintering process.

Electron microscopy analysis and mechanical property measurements were conducted at the Electron Microscopy Center and Testing Center of Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, both part of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Impact toughness measurements were carried out at the Plastometriya Center, located within the Institute of Engineering Science at the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
