In the second phase, a group G consists of nx users who are chosen as relays, forming a relay set Re. These selected relays then transmit data to the users in set B. To ensure that all users can decode the data accurately in both stages, the relays multicast the data at a rate such that even the user with the weakest channel state information (CSI) can decode the data correctly. As a result, the multicasting rate of the relays in the second stage is determined by this consideration.
