This academic paper introduces enhancements to the robust transform based on the weighted median operator algorithm, which aims to compute the transform of a signal affected by impulsive noise. The original algorithm is found to be inefficient for real-time signal processing due to its long execution time. To address this limitation, the paper proposes several strategies to enhance the algorithm's performance. These strategies include reducing redundant calculations, optimizing memory access, and implementing a multithreaded version of the algorithm. Additionally, modifications are made to the original estimation method to further reduce the average execution time while maintaining the quality of the numerical results. Experimental results demonstrate performance improvements of up to 30% by reducing redundant calculations and optimizing memory access, 93% with modifications to the estimation method, and 97% by incorporating multithreaded processing.

The paper discusses impulsive noise as a type of noise that negatively affects signals, characterized by sharp increases in signal intensity with short durations. This kind of noise, often described using distributions with heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution, such as the Laplacian distribution, can degrade the performance of the algorithm.

Specific techniques are detailed to improve the algorithm's execution time, including the reduction of redundant calculations, hierarchical memory system utilization, and the employment of multiple execution threads. Alterations to the algorithm's structure are also implemented to enhance execution time while maintaining result quality. The optimizations achieved a 30% improvement in performance without modifying the estimation method or using multithreaded processing, a 93% improvement with modifications to the estimation method, and a 97% improvement by incorporating multithreaded processing.

The paper is organized into sections that describe the basis of the algorithm, improvements related to redundant calculations, memory access, and the estimation method, the multithreaded version, and experimental results. It concludes by discussing potential applications of the developed scheme and the methods used in the investigation, including their application to similar algorithms dependent on median calculations. Furthermore, it suggests potential use of graphics processing units to achieve even greater performance improvements due to their optimized arithmetic calculation capabilities.
