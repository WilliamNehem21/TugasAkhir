The instruction list (IL) is a commonly used simple typed assembly language in embedded control, yet it lacks tool support and a formal semantics within the IEC 61131-3 standard. This paper addresses these issues by developing a formal operational semantics for IL and presenting an abstract semantics that allows for approximative program simulation for a potentially infinite set of inputs in a single simulation run. The framework is extended to an abstract interpretation based analysis, embodied in the tool "Homer." Notably, these analyses can be conducted without requiring formal methods knowledge, which is typically lacking in the IL community.

Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) utilized in automation control are programmed using a variety of languages, including IL, specified by the IEC 61131-3 standard. IL, as a low-level language with limited structuring possibilities, presents challenges for readability and manual analysis due to its reliance on goto-like jumps and the absence of formal semantics within the standard.

Given the predominant use of PLCs by control engineers with expertise in technical plant design rather than formal methods, any proposed analysis techniques need to be primarily automatic or fitting within this context.

The developed operational semantics enables code simulation for specific inputs, though achieving complete coverage is arduous or even unfeasible. To address this, the paper discusses an abstract simulation approach that estimates variable ranges for simulation runs spanning potentially infinite input sets. Additionally, the framework is extended to abstract interpretation, which provides an approximation of the program behavior for all runs and at all program locations.

Abstract simulation allows for the execution of IL programs for sets of inputs and tracks program behavior for specific paths, while abstract interpretation approximates the program behavior for all possible inputs and paths, guaranteeing termination of the analysis process. Acceleration techniques are employed to expedite convergence, albeit at the cost of potential loss of precision.

The authors implemented the abstract interpretation framework into a prototype tool called "Homer," which serves to test the proposed methods and analyses. Notably, the tool is not optimized for speed, and memory consumption is high. However, it shows promise, with a case study of approximately 2000 lines of code with around 100 variables taking nearly 20 seconds to be analyzed.

In summary, the paper presents a formal operational semantics for IL programs, an abstract counterpart for approximating program simulation, and an abstract interpretation analysis implemented in "Homer." The significance of these methods lies in their applicability to PLC programmers without formal methods expertise.

Future work may involve the development of a tool for guided abstract simulation to explore specific paths and exploit jump conditions to constrain variable values. Furthermore, exploring various abstract domains for IL code analysis, such as interval-based abstraction, octagons, or polyhedra, can enhance precision and incorporate relationships between variables.
