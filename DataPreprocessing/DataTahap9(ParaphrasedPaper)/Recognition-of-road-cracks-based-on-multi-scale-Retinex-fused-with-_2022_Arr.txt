Cracks are a common issue with road surfaces and pose a significant risk to road safety. Detecting and repairing cracks is a major focus in the field of intelligent transportation system research. However, automatic crack detection often falls short due to challenges such as uneven illumination, low contrast, and the presence of shadows that resemble cracks. In this paper, we propose an improved multi-scale retinex algorithm to enhance crack images. By integrating wavelet transform into the traditional multi-scale retinex algorithm, we aim to address issues such as halo generation and image distortion. Additionally, we perform shadow removal preprocessing to effectively eliminate interference from high-intensity shadows. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates better performance in highlighting crack information, with enhanced recognition accuracy of the overall detection system reaching 95.8%. This suggests that the algorithm holds significant research and engineering value in realizing shadow removal and crack enhancement functions, which can ultimately reduce maintenance costs and extend pavement life.

Traditionally, crack detection heavily relies on manual visual inspection, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and lacks objective evaluation of road deterioration. Therefore, there is a need to develop an automatic, accurate, and efficient pavement crack detection method. With the advancements in computer vision and civil engineering image processing, various research has been conducted worldwide, with two main categories of methods emerging: those based on image characteristics and those based on machine learning. Image characteristic-based methods include edge detection, histogram analysis, mathematical morphology, and filtering, while machine learning-based approaches include supervised and unsupervised learning. Image characteristic-based crack recognition technology is currently more widely utilized in engineering.

One example of an image characteristic-based method is Canny edge detection, which extracts the crack quickly but requires manual adjustment of many thresholds. On the other hand, histogram analysis fits a Gaussian curve to the grayscale histogram of the crack image but heavily relies on threshold selection. Mathematical morphology suffers from varying crack segmentation effects due to differences in structural element size and threshold selection, resulting in poor segmentation outcomes for different crack thicknesses. Moreover, threshold-based segmentation methods used for crack recognition often struggle with road surface images captured under unfavorable weather and illumination conditions, leading to difficulties in accurately detecting crack edges. Uneven illumination can cause the crack information in pavement damage images to be missed or incorrectly recognized, while poor contrast, low brightness, and noise further complicate information extraction and analysis by machine vision.

Road crack images collected in natural environments are often affected by shadows, which can be mistaken for cracks, creating significant interference in crack extraction. To address this challenge, our study proposes different shadow removal schemes based on the characteristics of different shadows, aiming to eliminate their interference.

Overall, the novel multi-scale retinex algorithm introduced in this paper effectively enhances crack images, achieving a better crack line extraction performance than traditional algorithms while also improving contrast and distinction between crack and non-crack areas in damaged pavement images. Consequently, our proposed algorithm demonstrates clear advantages in crack image enhancement performance.
