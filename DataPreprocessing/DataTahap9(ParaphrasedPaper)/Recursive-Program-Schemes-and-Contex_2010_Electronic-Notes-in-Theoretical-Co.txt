The brackets on the left side represent the coproduct of fh and fv in h/mon(a), while those on the right side represent h+ v in funf(a). The verification process relies on the universal property of the free monad on h+ v, and is not overly complex. The validity of equation (20) can be deduced from the same diagram.

Furthermore, the rational monad rh and the monad th are both defined by their universal properties; rh being the free iterative monad, and th being the free completely iterative one. The question remains whether ch can also be characterized by a universal property. Unfortunately, context-free trees cannot serve as an illustrative example in this regard, as no universal property for them is currently known.
