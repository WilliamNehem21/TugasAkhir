In this study, we focus on modeling and analyzing the public transportation system in Edinburgh, particularly the bus network. The buses in Edinburgh are equipped with GPS positioning technology, which transmits their location data to a central server every thirty seconds. This data is used to predict bus arrival times at bus stops, which are then relayed to passengers through on-street signage, a website, and smartphone apps.

After developing and implementing the predictive model, we aim to compare the real data obtained from MyBusTracker with the results of our model. To do this, we plan to use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. This statistical test will help us determine if there are significant differences between the empirical distribution of the real data and the cumulative distribution of our model's results. We will conduct the KS test using MATLAB, and interpret the results based on the hypothesis test outcome (h), p-value (p), test statistic (ksstat), and critical values (cv).

Traviando is a tool that can analyze simulation traces in state/event format. It is compatible with traces generated from Bio-PEPA models. These traces represent a single, discrete execution of the model within a finite time horizon.

The primary objective of a bus punctuality improvement partnership is to enhance bus punctuality, which may involve implementing a stricter definition of the acceptable time window for bus departures. A narrower window indicates a better service, with buses departing closer to the scheduled time.

We can use the logical language CSL to explore this goal by formulating a simple model-checking problem. Specifically, we can evaluate the CSL bounded until formula to determine the probability of a transition to the specified stage of the journey occurring within a given time interval. Varying the lower and upper bounds of the time window allows us to assess different scenarios.
