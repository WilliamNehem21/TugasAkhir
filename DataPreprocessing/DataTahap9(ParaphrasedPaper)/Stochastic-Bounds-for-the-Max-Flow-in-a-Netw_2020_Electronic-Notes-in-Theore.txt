This academic paper demonstrates how to derive stochastic bounds for strong stochastic ordering and concave ordering of the maximal flow in a network where the capacities are non-negative discrete random variables. While the deterministic version of the problem can be solved in polynomial time, the stochastic version with discrete random variables is proven to be NP-hard. The study focuses on simplifying the input distributions and obtaining bounds on the results by leveraging the monotonicity of the min-cut problem for these stochastic orderings. This tradeoff allows for a balance between the complexity of computations and the accuracy of the bounds. The authors provide examples to illustrate their approach.

Given that information often changes over time due to noise, contention, and incidents, the paper addresses the challenge of dealing with randomness in measures that were previously considered deterministic. It introduces a method to address this randomness for a classical problem in operations research, specifically the computation of maximal flow in a network. The polynomial complexity of computing maximal flow for deterministic capacities becomes NP-hard when the capacities are associated with random variables. Consequently, the paper reviews various approaches proposed to obtain approximations or bounds for this challenging problem and emphasizes methods associated with stochastic ordering.

The technical part of the paper covers the introduction of strong stochastic bounds and increasing convex stochastic bounds, algorithms for changing the size of distributions to build bounds, and the combination of these bounds to obtain more accurate results. The authors propose reducing the number of atoms in input distributions while preserving qualitative and quantitative information using stochastic orderings. They also discuss methods for computing upper and lower bounds for the input distributions with minimal complexity. Furthermore, the paper explores the selection of parameters for determining the size of the distributions and the combination of these bounds to improve accuracy.

Several lemmas and propositions are presented to support the development of lower and upper bounds for the stochastic ordering, demonstrating the complex operations involved in fusion and splitting of atoms to derive bounds. The paper also explains the role of stop loss functions in deriving probability distributions from bounds and emphasizes considerations specific to the increasing concave ordering. Additionally, it explores the aggregation of input distributions and provides insights into deriving more accurate bounds using different aggregation patterns.

In conclusion, the paper proposes an approach to derive stochastic bounds for the maximal flow problem in networks with random discrete capacities, showcasing the tradeoff between computational complexity and the precision of the bounds. It improves understanding of the challenges and strategies for addressing randomness in measure computations, providing a valuable contribution to operations research and network analysis.
