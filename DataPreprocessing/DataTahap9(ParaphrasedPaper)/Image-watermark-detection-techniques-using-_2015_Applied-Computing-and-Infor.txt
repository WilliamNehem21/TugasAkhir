Over the past decade, digital image watermarking has garnered significant attention from researchers, driven by the desire to enhance information security, concealment, authentication, and fingerprinting. Various approaches to digital image watermarking have been proposed, with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) emerging as a popular method due to its capability to decompose images into subbands for selective watermark embedding. Additionally, the combination of DWT with other methods such as quadtrees, discrete cosine transform (DCT), and code division multiple access (CDMA) has been explored in published studies. In this paper, a semi-blind algorithm is proposed, and quadtree decomposition is utilized as an analytical technique to subdivide images into homogeneous blocks, providing insights into image structure. These insights are then used to compare different watermarking methods – namely, DWT, DCT, least significant bit (LSB), and CDMA – in terms of watermark insertion.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents related theories, Section 3 addresses subjective and objective performance evaluation, Section 4 outlines the proposed system, Section 5 presents experimental results and discusses the proposed system, and Section 6 concludes the paper. The modulation index, denoted as "a", plays a crucial role in optimizing the amount of allowed distortion and necessary watermark energy for reliable detection. Depending on whether "a" is a function of image coefficients, watermarking schemes are categorized as either signal adaptive or non-adaptive.

A natural gray-level image can be segmented into regions of varying sizes and details, which is beneficial for efficient image data coding. Quadtree (QT) decomposition, a powerful technique, divides images into 2D homogeneous regions, thereby facilitating segmentation. A quadtree representing an image is a tree in which deeper levels represent finer subdivisions of picture areas. Each node in the tree represents a quadrant of its parent, and the tree is recursively filled by subdividing the image matrix into four quadrants until a quadrant consists of a single color. Each leaf node in this application represents a block of pixels that are either all 0s or all 1s. In this paper, the region quadtree is assumed. The paper also introduces the point quadtree, which is an efficient representation of two-dimensional ordered data points and typically operates in O(log n) time.

The paper introduces quantitative performance representation for each classifier in terms of class recognition or detection and proposes objective metrics based on structural similarity index (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), Pearson correlation, false positives, and false negatives. The performance of quadtree decomposition is evaluated in the context of four watermark techniques (CDMA, DWT, DCT, and LSB). The results reveal differences between the watermarked and original images across the techniques, as confirmed by the quantitative evaluation. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of quadtree as a watermarked image detector and highlights performance differences across various watermarking techniques.
