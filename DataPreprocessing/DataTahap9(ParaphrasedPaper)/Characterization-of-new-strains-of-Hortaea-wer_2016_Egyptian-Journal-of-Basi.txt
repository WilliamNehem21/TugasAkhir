The extreme halotolerant fungus Hortaea werneckii, a member of the black yeast group, was discovered in various marine environments and has been documented to withstand extreme conditions. This species belongs to the Capnodiales order within the Ascomycota phylum. Its endoconidia buds are of the enteroblastic annellidic type, arising as polar, lateral, and bipolar forms from yeast-like structures. Both conidiogenesis and budding modes are characterized by the complete separation of developed abscission lines in septa. Furthermore, when cells are successively generated from the same locus, an increase in the neck (collars) of the mother cell leads to the formation of bottle-shaped cells marked by multiple rings. The number of rings is contingent upon the number of buds or conidia released. Conidia primarily emerge from the generative apex of unbranched intercalary hyphal cells known as annellidophores. While the majority of conidia are unicellular, two-celled conidia separated by conspicuous dark cross walls have also been observed. H. werneckii forms hydrophobic dematiaceous septated mycelia composed of cohesive thalli that extend from the mother cell wall, with lateral branches occasionally emerging from them.

This study marks the first report of H. werneckii strains isolated in the Egyptian environment. The isolated strains were characterized using molecular, biochemical, and morphological analyses, with a focus on distinguishing them from previously characterized H. werneckii strains.

Several tests were conducted to characterize the isolated strains, including the catalase test, proteases test, amylases test, and cellulase test. Positive results were obtained in the catalase test through the observation of instant effervescence reaction, indicating the presence of the enzyme catalase. In the proteases test, the formation of a transparent zone around the growing isolates was considered indicative of positive results. Amylases activity was detected by flooding the surface of inoculated media with grams iodine in the amylases test. The cellulose activity was visualized by staining the media with Congo red dye followed by de-staining with a sodium chloride solution in the cellulase test.

This research has led to the isolation and characterization of new black yeast strains, all identified as H. werneckii. Among the isolates, two (egynda08 and egynda16) were found to be ecotypes of each other, while egynda90 belonged to a separate branch. These isolates displayed morphological and enzymatic differences, and further studies are underway to verify their pleomorphic characterization and adaptation mechanisms to their saline habitat.
