The findings indicated that the system effectively identified microcalcifications of all varieties. No incorrect identifications were made during testing, and all microcalcifications were detected in every test image, even when noise was added to the images. On average, each image took around 2.7 seconds to be processed, and no limitations were observed when running the system on the Altera DE2-115 board. This suggests the potential to develop a cost-effective, compact, and energy-efficient computer-aided detection (CAD) system compared to one intended for regular computers [16-17].
