The influx of large volumes of expression data has highlighted the need for computational methods to address the challenges of interpreting experimental data. Rather than offering a straightforward understanding of biological systems, the data exposes the complexities involved in their analysis. The diverse components and their interactive capabilities necessitate dealing with their intricate nature, thus paving the way for the exploration of computational modeling of biological systems.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 covers the fundamentals of BRN. The central focus of the paper is presented in Section 3, where a formal semantics for BRN is introduced. In Section 4, the use of the tool HyTech to analyze a BRN is demonstrated through a small example.
