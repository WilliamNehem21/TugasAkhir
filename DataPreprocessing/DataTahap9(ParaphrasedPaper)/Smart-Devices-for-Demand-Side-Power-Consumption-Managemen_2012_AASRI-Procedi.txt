Smart grids are a highly active area of research, with various countries proposing architectures based on smart meters and conducting small-scale pilots. Literature has discussed numerous topics relevant to smart grid development, highlighting the importance of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in measuring, collecting, storing, and analyzing energy consumption data.

The two-way flow of information facilitated by smart grid AMI allows providers to adjust energy prices to reduce consumption during peak hours. However, research on controlling appliances to reduce power consumption is limited. While centralized approaches have been suggested, they may not account for appliance-specific properties, leading to suboptimal decisions. This paper proposes a novel distributed approach based on intelligent products.

The concept of intelligent products draws on theoretical frameworks and application-oriented experience to propose a system design. Intelligent products are physical products with information-based representations stored in a database, connected through sensors to decision-making agents. In this proposed design, intelligent products are applied to electric devices to create "smart devices," each with its own decision-making agent operating at three levels of intelligence: information handling, problem detection, and decision making.

The decision-making agents use utility functions based on device-specific thresholds, owner-specific deadlines, and energy prices to autonomously determine power consumption. This approach aims to balance energy costs and task completion deadlines. The paper presents a generic system for smart devices and demonstrates its feasibility through scenarios involving home appliances and electric vehicles. A prototype of the proposed system is being developed for further validation and experimentation, with future work focusing on enhancing the decision-making behavior and enabling negotiation among agents representing electric devices.
