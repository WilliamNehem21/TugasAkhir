If the appropriate certificates are installed on the device, the code in Listing 1 would be functional. The URLConnection API handles hostname verification and certificate management, and additional libraries and middleware have been developed to manage these components for application designers. Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE), packaged with Java, allows for further customization, while other common libraries such as OpenSSL and GnuTLS offer C-based frameworks for SSL/TLS implementation. Higher-level wrapper implementations of these SSL/TLS libraries include cURL.

As shown in Listing 2, messages are concealed from users, and the application continues as if it has a secure connection. Overriding errors thrown by the system defeats the intended security and mirrors the insecure behavior of users clicking through SSL errors in web browsers. However, unlike in desktop browsers, this approach never presents the user with options for their own security.

To address errors, developers often seek help from resources such as Stack Overflow. While this platform can be beneficial in resolving code-related errors, addressing how the developer's mind operates on a psychological level is not a feasible solution and is beyond the scope of this paper. Efforts to enhance developers' ability to secure their SSL implementations should focus on providing support tools and resources. This section will discuss a few of the proposed solutions and subject areas, drawing ideas from other platforms and contexts.

Tendulkar et al. suggest removing the ability for developers to override SSL error handling, thus preventing them from concealing SSL error messages and forcing them to fix their code. Coupled with the disabling of SSL checks when the debuggable flag is triggered, this approach could prevent half of SSL vulnerabilities. However, it would restrict developers' programmatic capabilities and make debugging much more challenging. Instead, warnings or errors could effectively communicate the risks of excluding certificate checking from the application.

In order to secure SSL implementations across all platforms, SSL libraries and middleware with validation and revocation check flaws must be patched. Refactoring current libraries should prioritize hiding low-level code, and a system similar to HTTPS Everywhere should be employed in Android communication APIs. As libraries are increasingly utilized, their code needs to be scrutinized to ensure forward-looking and comprehensive security. Large companies handling critical data should contribute efforts toward improving open-source SSL libraries and protocols, despite the slow rollout of changes across the SSL/TLS ecosystem. These efforts would establish a foundation for safe Android web development.

The primary limitation remains determining the most sustainable solution moving forward, garnering both industry and academic support. While increased strictness may clearly distinguish between secure and insecure architectures, it may be challenging for developers and users seeking performance and availability over security. An escalation system for warnings may alleviate the pressure on developers and system administrators, but much innovation and discussion are needed before a proper certificate architecture that balances security and usability can be established.

Little research has been conducted on the effect of implementing HSTS and OBCS on modern cellular or wireless networks within the SSL ecosystem. Additionally, there is a lack of research on Android implementation of the DANE protocol and similar tools. Determining the effectiveness of these tools on the Android platform or as an extension in an Android browser is crucial for better securing HTTPS on Android and making it the platform's standard protocol.

Developing a sustainable internet-scanning service for security researchers would facilitate further research into the existing shortcomings of the HTTPS protocol. This tool would be accessible to researchers, commercial entities, and security organizations to identify and patch vulnerabilities, bearing resemblance to the work of Durumeric et al. following Heartbleed. Further solutions will emerge for the Android platform as research into new protocols, languages, and programming paradigms continues.
