Numerous studies have investigated task computation and resource allocation in edge computing, with the goal of formulating the computational problem as an optimization model to minimize total delay, energy consumption, and cost. However, most existing approaches focus on a single optimization objective, explore the optimal solution in a one-dimensional decision space, or consider multiple objectives but combine them using subjective weighting, potentially leading to errors in the results. In actual task computation processes, it is crucial to comprehensively consider the trade-offs between multiple objectives in response to different user requirements.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related work, Section 3 introduces the i-maowmue model, Section 4 proposes the mi-maoea method to solve the i-maowmue model, Section 5 describes the simulation experiments and presents the results, and Section 6 provides a summary and conclusions.

This paper focuses on a computational migration scenario in which the user location changes, and multiple mobile devices (MDs) are situated in overlapping regions of multiple base station subsystems (BSSs). When the user location changes, unexecuted tasks need to be migrated to multiple servers within the coverage area based on the system state. Additionally, the paper addresses the dependent task computation problem in uncertain environments, such as network bandwidth and server computing power, and formulates it as the i-maowmue model to optimize migration delay, maximum completion time, energy consumption, and load balancing. Furthermore, a real-time priority scheduling strategy is developed for workflow characteristics to achieve reasonable resource allocation and rapid task response. To solve the i-maowmue model, this paper introduces mi-maoea, which aims to address uncertainties and ensure solution convergence and diversity.
