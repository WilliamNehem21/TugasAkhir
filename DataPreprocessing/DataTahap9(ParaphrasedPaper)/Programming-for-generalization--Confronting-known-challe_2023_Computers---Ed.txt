This study presents the findings of a long-term design-based investigation focused on creating, implementing, and assessing a virtual reality (VR) learning intervention, called Virtuoso, for adults with autism. The VR training program aimed to assist autistic adults in learning how to use public transportation services in a safe, effective, and controlled manner. The report discusses the challenges associated with designing VR for autistic users, particularly focusing on the transfer of skills learned in the virtual environment to real-world public transportation settings. It emphasizes the potential benefits of VR technology for autism interventions, including the possibility of acquired skills in VR generalizing to real-world situations. The report offers a comprehensive overview of the research and its findings, providing valuable insights into the potential of VR technology to support the learning needs of autistic individuals.

The paper details the development and implementation of Virtuoso, a suite of VR technologies designed in collaboration with autistic adults in a day program and their service providers at a large university. Virtuoso aimed to provide an immersive learning intervention to teach skills related to using public transportation within the university campus. The ability to access and use public transportation is crucial for independent living, as it provides essential access to medical, vocational, and community opportunities.

The study employed a robust methodology that included the collection and analysis of field notes, video analysis using V-Note Pro, and statistical techniques such as one-way within-subjects ANOVA. The results indicated high completion rates of tasks both in the VR sessions and in the real-world session, with minor differences in task completion times between the sessions. The study also highlighted participants' perceptions of the VR environment, including their engagement with humanoid avatars.

The paper addressed the issue of generalization from digital environments to the real world, acknowledging the limited research evidence supporting generalization in VR interventions for autistic individuals. It referenced previous studies that have incorporated generalization heuristics and emphasized the need for more rigorous research to establish an empirical basis for generalization.

The study's findings contribute to the limited evidence base on generalization in VR for autistic users and highlight the complexities involved in designing VR interventions for this population. The report also addresses the challenges associated with VR technology, such as human-computer interaction issues and the rapid pace of technological advancement. It offers recommendations for future research and intervention design, emphasizing the need to explicitly program for generalization and reconsider notions of realism in VR interventions for autistic individuals.

In summary, the report provides valuable insights into the potential and challenges of using VR technology to support the learning needs of autistic individuals, particularly in the context of public transportation training. It underscores the importance of addressing issues related to generalization and realism in VR interventions for autistic users and calls for more rigorous research in this critical area.
