In this study, we utilize uppercase letters (e.g., X, Y, etc.), possibly with subscripts, to represent variables for the upper indices in predicates such as P(X, Y). Conversely, we employ lowercase letters, possibly with subscripts, to denote variables in other cases. It is assumed that the set of uppercase variables and the set of lowercase variables do not overlap.
