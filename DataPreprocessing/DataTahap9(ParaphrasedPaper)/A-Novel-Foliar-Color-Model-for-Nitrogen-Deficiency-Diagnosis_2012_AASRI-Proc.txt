The pattern of foliar color under nitrogen deficiency stress typically varies uniformly, making it logical to develop a detection index using the average value or one of the relative forms of its color components. However, the linear correlation between these color components and the imprecise metric description of mineral contents make color modeling a challenging task. This paper presents a novel foliar color model for rubber trees that combines relative and absolute components and considers the vague nature of nutrient description. A slope angle is proposed as a metric to evaluate the fitness of the color model, and experimental results support this proposition.

Previous research using SPAD devices established the relationship between foliar color and nitrogen content, but existing literature has not yielded accurate results for developing an adaptive fertilizer recipe to prevent nitrogen deficiency in rubber trees. This paper builds on previous work to derive a more sophisticated foliar color model for nutritional diagnosis.

Various attempts have been made to use color components as an index for estimating nitrogen levels, with mixed success. Some researchers have explored linear regression models for nitrogen content using color features, while others have considered the correlation of different color features with nitrogen content. However, none of these attempts have yielded satisfactory results.

Furthermore, other factors such as shape and color distortion due to imaging errors have been considered, leading to proposed calibration methods. One such method uses known reflectance levels of flat paints to calibrate a linear regression model for real-time crop nitrogen deficiency detection during fertilization operations.

Given the inability to accurately describe nitrogen status with a linear index, it is reasonable to seek a vague index that can be measured against another index to establish the relationship between the color model and nitrogen status. In this paper, it is found that the slope angle of the distribution regions can serve as a measurement of the appropriateness of the color model for diagnosing nitrogen content. Experimental results demonstrate that this measurement can conveniently identify improved color models, including the newly proposed model presented in the paper.
