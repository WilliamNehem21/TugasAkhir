The strand space model is widely used for analyzing security protocols, despite its limitations in representing choice points in protocol execution. The key concept in the model is the bundle, which captures one possible execution of a security protocol. This paper aims to introduce branching into the strand space model through the concept of branching bundles, inspired by the branching processes of petri nets. The authors investigate the theory of branching bundles and argue that they could provide a strong theoretical basis for comparing models and providing semantics in security protocol analysis. The paper presents a formalization of branching bundles as bi-graphs of events labeled by actions of GACT, and explores the relationship of branching bundles to event structures. The authors also explore whether the branching bundles of a protocol approximate a largest branching bundle, and discuss the implications of their findings for providing a natural strand space semantics for protocols. The paper concludes by showing that every protocol has a strand space semantics in terms of its symbolic unfolding, and discusses the implications of this result.
