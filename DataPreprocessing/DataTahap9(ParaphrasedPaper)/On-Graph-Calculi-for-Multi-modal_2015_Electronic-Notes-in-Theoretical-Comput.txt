This paper presents a novel method, utilizing graphical representation, for creating comprehensive and accurate calculi for multi-modal logics, offering a consistent approach for articulating and manipulating modal formulas. The method is demonstrated through the construction of graph calculi for various multi-modal logics, including those featuring global and difference modalities and exhibiting specific characteristics.

With a focus on multi-modal logics, the study introduces a graphical method for formulating precise (sound and complete) calculi, potentially enabling the development of decision procedures for these logics. The calculi are represented as diagrams, with rules governing the transformation of diagrams, serving as graphical reflections of the semantic properties of modal operators. This approach provides a uniform framework for expressing and manipulating modal formulas, offering elegant and straightforward methods for representing and reasoning about modalities, in contrast to unconventional rule-based approaches.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the graph-based approach to modalities, Section 3 covers fundamental concepts and results regarding graphs, Section 4 introduces a basic graph calculus for modalities, with special cases addressed in Section 5. Section 6 details the method and conducts an analysis, while Section 7 provides commentary on the graph-based approach to modalities.

In this framework, a graph is defined as a finite set of alternative slices, where each slice comprises an underlying draft with a distinguished node. The draft, in turn, consists of a finite sketch, consisting of sets of nodes and arcs, with slices and graphs representing sets of states, and sketches depicting constraints on sets of states (as discussed in Section 4: basic graph calculus for modalities).

The paper introduces the concept of a "nice sketch," elucidating its properties and implications within this framework, and subsequently examines specific slices to illustrate their characteristics.

The study acknowledges previous work linking graphs and proofs, as well as the prevalent use of inference systems incorporating Kripke semantics. Correct graph calculi for various modal logics and PDL have been presented, with graphical rules reflecting the semantic properties of modal operators, resulting in intuitive formulation and application. The correctness of these calculi validates the capture of intended meanings by the rules.
