We define a program as safe if it meets the conditions specified by the begin and end assertions. In other words, a program is considered safe if, for every execution of the program and for every label l, there exists a distinct begin-event labeled l preceding every end-event labeled l. This formal definition is explained in section 5 of our paper.

For example 1, a single instance of the sender and receiver represents a single instance of the protocol. By restricting new(c), the channel c is made private to the sender and the receiver. This configuration is safe, as its only execution properly implements the handshake protocol.

Our type and effect system is built on the concept of assigning types to names and effects to processes. A type specifies the operations permitted on a name, such as the messages that may be transmitted on a channel name. An effect delineates the set of labels of events that the process may conclude without initiating itself. We calculate effects based on the understanding that end-events are balanced out by preceding begin-events; a begin-event is a credit while an end-event is a debit. According to this analogy, the effect of a process acts as an upper limit on the indebtedness a process may accumulate. If we can assign a process an empty effect, we can ascertain that all of its end-events are accounted for by begin-events, indicating that the process is safe, i.e., its correspondence assertions are true.

Our definition implies that a matching begin-event must precede each end-event in every trace of a safe process. For instance, if a safe process has a trace s, end l, t, by the definition of traces, the process also has the shorter trace s, end l, which must be a correspondence, since it is a trace of a safe process. Consequently, the end-event end l is preceded by a matching begin-event in s.

Formally, our paper presents Theorem 5.2, which states that every effect-free process is safe. This provides us with a compositional method for verifying the safety of communication protocols. This result stems from a subject reduction result, Theorem 5.1. The core segments of the formal development associated with the (proc cond) rule are particularly challenging to verify in detail, owing to its complexity.

Gifford and Lucassen introduced type and effect systems to manage side-effects in functional programming. There exists a substantial body of literature on this topic. Early work on concurrent languages includes systems by Nielson and Nielson and Talpin. Recent applications of type and effect systems encompass memory management for high-level and low-level languages, race-condition avoidance, and access control.

Another paper explores the application of these concepts to cryptographic protocols formalized in the spi-calculus of Abadi and Gordon. It has proven useful in identifying known issues in published protocols. Our initial type system for SPI is specific to cryptographic protocols based on symmetric key cryptography. In contrast to the approach presented in this paper, we attach latent effects to a new type for nonces to formalize a specific method for preventing replay attacks. An additional area for future investigation involves type inference algorithms.
