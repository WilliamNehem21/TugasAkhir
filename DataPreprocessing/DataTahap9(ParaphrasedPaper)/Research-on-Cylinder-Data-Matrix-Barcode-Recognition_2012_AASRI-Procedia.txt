The conventional methods for locating DM code edges rely on geometric shape features, but they are susceptible to contamination from scratches and noise, resulting in a high error rate. Therefore, this paper introduces a new method for positioning based on image gray projection data fitting. Initially, the horizontal gray level projection of the image is calculated. 

Given that longitudinal displacement has been rectified in section 3.1, image registration occurs solely in the x-direction. Within the x-range, the optimal matching degree and registration location g are determined by identifying the maximum of the matching function. 

Subsequently, a mean is proposed based on DM code boundary gradient projection. This algorithm utilizes normal peak characteristic values to describe the results of each module division mode, providing robustness in the presence of DM code boundary pollution. 

The distortion of the DM code image due to cylindrical curve and rotational motion blur results in breadthwise distortion. To address this, the paper segments the image into three parts and calculates the horizontal gradient projection, subsequently deriving the horizontal module number and size. The distortion ratio of the DM code is then obtained based on the calculated module sizes. 

The paper also outlines a procedure for arranging the three image parts and conducting vertical scanning to position part1 precisely, followed by the fusion of the overlapped areas using a weighted average method. Finally, a mature decoding algorithm is employed to recognize the DM code in the buffer zone.
