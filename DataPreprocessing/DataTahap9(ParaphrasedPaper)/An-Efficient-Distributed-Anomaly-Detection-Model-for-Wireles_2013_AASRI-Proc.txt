The use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is crucial for gathering environmental data and monitoring various phenomena. However, anomalies, which can be caused by hardware and software errors, unusual events, or malicious attacks, can compromise the integrity of the collected data. Detecting anomalies is thus essential for ensuring data quality and making informed decisions within sensor network systems. This paper presents a novel distributed online anomaly detection model that assesses the dissimilarity of sensor observations in principal component space. By distributing the detection process over the network, the model minimizes energy consumption while maintaining high detection effectiveness. The model's efficacy and efficiency are validated through experiments using real-world data from the Sensorscope system project. These experiments demonstrate that the model achieves a high detection rate with relatively few false positive results compared to an existing model.

To address the issues of unnecessary communication and computational effort, a distributed deviation detection model for WSNs is proposed. This model utilizes a non-parametric statistical technique known as the kernel density estimator and does not rely on a hierarchical structure for its implementation. Instead of a hierarchical approach, the model emulates hierarchy by assigning groups of low-capacity sensors to a limited number of more powerful sensors based on spatial proximity. An in-network outlier detection algorithm is introduced to reduce the communication overhead resulting from massive data transmission in WSNs. This algorithm leverages distance similarity measures to identify global anomalies in WSNs, with each node applying the measure and broadcasting its results to neighboring nodes. However, the broadcast communication in this model leads to high energy consumption, especially in large-scale WSNs.

While various distributed models have been designed based on the Quadratic Support Vector Machine (QSSVM), they commonly suffer from the high computational cost associated with applying QSSVM on limited sensor resources. Additionally, the dependence of Support Vector Machine (SVM) on specific parameters significantly affects detection effectiveness and practicality. Therefore, the authors propose statistical-based outlier detection methods as an alternative approach.

In this paper, a new distributed online anomaly detection model is presented using the One-Class Principal Component Classifier (OCPCC) to detect anomalies in real time. The model differs from previous work in its selection of detection threshold and the variant of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm used. The model employs the Candid-Covariance Free Incremental Principal Component Analysis (CCIPCA) algorithm for data reduction, with experimental validation conducted using data from the Sensorscope GSB dataset. The results demonstrate the high detection rate and low false alarm rate of the proposed model compared to an existing distributed model.

The paper also discusses the selection of the detection threshold, termed the local normal model (LNM), as the maximum and minimum bounds of the dissimilarity vector. The details of constructing the global normal model (GNM) at the central hub (CH) are briefly mentioned, with the strategies used not being the focus of the paper.

The experimental evaluation of the proposed model utilizes data from the Grand St. Bernard (GSB) Sensorscope project deployment, which consists of 23 sensors recording meteorological environmental data such as ambient and surface temperature, and humidity. A small cluster of 5 sensors and a large cluster of 18 sensors are formed in this deployment. The paper employs observations from the small cluster to evaluate the proposed model, specifically using ambient temperature data recorded on March 5th, 2007.

In conclusion, this paper introduces a new distributed anomaly detection model for WSNs and provides initial experimental results. The model, based on dissimilarity calculation in principal component space, demonstrates promising potential in achieving high detection effectiveness while efficiently utilizing limited network resources. Future experiments will explore the model's performance with multivariate data and additional real-world datasets.
