Rule-based languages such as kappa and bngl provide a means to describe complex models of protein interactions, allowing for the representation of a large, potentially infinite, number of different types of bio-molecular compounds resulting from proteins with multiple binding and phosphorylation sites. Understanding whether a model may involve an infinite number of different types of bio-molecular compounds is crucial for the modeler, as it can indicate potential modeling flaws and impact the choice of semantics for the models. Enumerating different bio-molecular compounds, especially when phosphorylation states are taken into account, becomes a challenging task as the complexity of the model increases. The paper introduces case studies to illustrate the property being inferred and outlines the organization of the subsequent sections. It also presents a method to decide whether a set of bio-molecular compounds compatible with a contact map is finite or infinite, and discusses the challenges of scaling enumeration engines to large combinatorial networks.

The paper continues by providing reminders about the kappa language, focusing on static reasoning about graphs and introducing two families of graphs to reason about the finiteness of the set of bio-molecular compounds in a kappa model. It also discusses the notion of morphisms, chains, and how to combine consecutive edges in the graph. The paper defines and explains the steps involved in refining the graph of potential successive links in bio-molecular compounds, and describes the integration of the approach into the static analyzer kasa. Additionally, it outlines plans for implementing a generalization that can handle models generating cyclic structures without creating arbitrarily long bio-molecular compounds.
