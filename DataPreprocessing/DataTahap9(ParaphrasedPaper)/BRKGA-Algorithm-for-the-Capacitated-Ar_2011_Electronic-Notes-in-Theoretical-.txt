The study discusses the complexity of the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) in the context of urban waste collection and street maintenance. It examines various algorithms and heuristics that have been proposed to address this problem. The paper then introduces Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithms (BRKGA) and presents a specific algorithm for CARP using BRKGA. Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the algorithm's performance. The study also compares its results with other existing methods in the literature.

The authors present a branch-and-bound method and a cutting plane algorithm developed by Belenguer and Benavent. These algorithms are tested on instances of CARP, and their effectiveness is demonstrated through computational experiments. The study also explains the concept of genetic algorithms (GA) and how they are applied to evolve a population of solutions for CARP. The process involves probabilistic transition rules and operators such as reproduction, crossover, and mutation. The study highlights the advantages of using BRKGA for solving combinatorial optimization problems, including CARP.

The paper proposes a method for generating feasible solutions for CARP by partitioning tours and applying local search operators. It also presents a strategy for introducing diversity in the populations generated by BRKGA to avoid getting trapped in local optima. The study discusses the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and identifies areas for further improvement, such as exploring alternative heuristics for generating the initial population and considering mechanisms to analyze the diversity of solutions. Overall, the paper concludes that the BRKGA-based algorithm offers competitive and efficient solutions for CARP.
