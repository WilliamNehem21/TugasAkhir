In recent years, the use of big data from medical examinations for intelligent diagnosis and medical treatment has emerged as a key trend in the future of healthcare. This study introduces a method for examining the variance in medical attributes between men and women and identifies differences in medical attributes across different age groups. The cluster analysis method is then applied to further analyze these gender-based differences in medical attributes and identify common significant attributes for gender recognition within specific age ranges. The study goes on to propose two gender recognition models (GRMs) that employ the identified significant attributes to accurately identify gender. The effectiveness of the proposed GRMs is validated through a series of experiments, with results indicating that medical attributes with substantial differences indeed contribute to accurate gender recognition. Notably, within a specific age range (17 to 51 years old), the proposed GRM achieves a 92.8% accuracy using only six medical attributes.

Furthermore, the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the dataset and conducts an analysis of the disparities in medical examination findings between males and females. Section 3 delves into a deeper analysis using cluster analysis to identify medical examination items that are crucial for gender recognition within each specific age subgroup. Section 4 introduces two gender recognition models, one for examples with known ages and another for those with unknown ages, and evaluates their performance. Section 5 evaluates the proposed models and the role of data analysis in gender recognition, while Section 6 concludes the paper.

The study evaluates the performance of the GRMs and discusses the significance of significant medical attributes as well as the division of age ranges. Additionally, the study employs five learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) for each experiment, demonstrating a 2.8% increase in accuracy when the age range of the samples is known, further emphasizing the importance of age range division for gender recognition. For instance, in age subranges C1 and C2, the proposed GRM1 achieved approximately 92% recognition accuracy, while GRM2 experienced a 10% recognition accuracy loss. Conversely, in age subranges C3 and C4, the recognition accuracy loss was approximately 20%.

Thus, the paper introduces a method for assessing the variance in medical attributes between males and females at specific ages through the distribution of medical attributes. The study finds that only a small number of medical attributes exhibit clear differences between males and females. Additionally, the study applies cluster analysis to further examine gender differences and identifies significant attributes within specific age subranges. Furthermore, the study develops two GRMs based on the results of data analysis to identify the gender of samples based on whether their age is known or not. Experimental results demonstrate that within a specific age range (e.g., 17 to 51 years old), the proposed GRM can achieve 92.8% accuracy using only six medical attributes. The study also validates the effectiveness of GRM recognition and cluster analysis as well as significant attributes through comparative experiments.
