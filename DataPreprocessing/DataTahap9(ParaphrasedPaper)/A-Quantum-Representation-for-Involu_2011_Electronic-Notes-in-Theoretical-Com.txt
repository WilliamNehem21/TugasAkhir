The paper addresses a question raised by Martin and others at MFPS XXVI, affirming that the free affine monoid over a finite involution group has a quantum representation, in addition to its established classical representation. This finding implies the existence of non-trivial classes of quantum channels with classical representations in every dimension, including ones not found in lower dimensions. The paper also provides two characterizations of diagonal n-qubit channels, and discusses the calculation of the scope of unital channels and its relation to the capacity of diagonal channels. Additionally, it emphasizes the significance of diagonal qubit channels in the context of teleportation schemes and expresses gratitude to individuals who contributed to the development of the research.

The authors are grateful to Johnny Feng for engaging in numerous discussions and providing insights into the formalisms of quantum channels and density matrices. They also acknowledge Keye Martin for valuable conversations on quantum mechanics and for encouraging them to explore this topic.
