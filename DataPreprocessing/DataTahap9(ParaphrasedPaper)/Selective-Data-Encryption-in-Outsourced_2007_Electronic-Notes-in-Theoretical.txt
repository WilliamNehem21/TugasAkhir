This paper proposes the concept of outsourcing access control enforcement to a third party using a combination of cryptography and authorizations. The approach involves enforcing access control through selective encryption and discusses the management, specification, representation, and enforcement of authorizations in a dynamic scenario.

While the outsourcing of databases has been extensively studied, the issue of access control in such scenarios has not been considered. Existing access control mechanisms assume a client-server architecture, with the server responsible for defining and enforcing access control. However, in the proposed scenario, this assumption is no longer applicable, as the server is unaware of the access control policy defined by the data owner. Current solutions for querying encrypted outsourced databases involving the data owner in access control enforcement are impractical for real-world scenarios that require selective access by different users or applications.

The paper addresses the problem of enforcing access control through data encryption, proposing the use of different encryption keys for different data, such as XML documents, to grant different access rights to users. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the main concepts of access control and presents the selective encryption solution, Section 3 describes the proposed algorithm for efficient access control enforcement through selective encryption in a specific scenario, Section 4 illustrates how changes in access control policies can be efficiently managed, and Section 5 contains the conclusions.

The paper also discusses the process of selecting vertices to be part of a tree representing access control policies and explains the efficient management of changes in access control policies. Furthermore, it proposes a preallocation strategy to mitigate the disadvantages of updating the tree.

Additionally, the paper aims to demonstrate the complexity of the proposed problem by showing that it is at least as complex as 3-SAT, by mapping instances of 3-SAT to instances of the minimum tree representing access control policies.
