The dose rate was examined by assessing the U/Th concentration ratio in surface soil samples, which ranged from 0.05 to 1.72 with an average of 0.43. This average ratio was significantly higher (by 80%) than the world average of 0.26. To analyze the radiological parameters and understand their relationships, cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA), and Pearson correlation coefficient analysis were employed. The results of CA and PCA revealed three distinct groups of soil variables. The background radiation, resulting from natural radionuclides, depends on the amount of radioactive materials in the environment and can be elevated due to pollution from both natural and human activities. Radioactive materials from deposits may be transported to the surface soil through processes such as weathering of rocks and soil formation, as well as leaching into the groundwater system, ultimately leading to pollution.

The ability of hydrogenous migration was demonstrated to follow the sequence U > Ra > Th. Uranium can remain in a soluble state for an extended period and travel long distances through the flow of streams or rivers. Horizontal transfer of uranium and thorium is influenced by the interchange of sorption and desorption. The rapid increase in population and the widespread use of agricultural fertilizers are contributing to soil contamination at trace levels across all ground formations. Monitoring the release of gamma radiation from natural radionuclides is vital for protecting humans from lung cancer. The primary sources of gamma radiation are the two major radionuclide chainsâ€”uranium-eradium and thorium. The geological and geographical conditions of a study area determine the radioactivity and associated external exposure due to gamma radiation at varying levels in the soils of different regions around the world.

A previous study in Yelagiri hills reported the activity concentration of natural radionuclides at different locations, indicating that the average activity concentration of 232Th was 1.19 times higher than the world median value, while the activity of 238U and 40K was lower. The enrichment of 232Th content in soils was found to contribute to the major gamma radiation exposure to humans in Yelagiri hills. This study represents a continuation of the previous research in Yelagiri hills, Tamil Nadu, focusing on the spatial distribution of natural radionuclides and employing multivariate statistical methods to analyze the data and identify relationships between radiological parameters.

Yelagiri village, situated at an altitude of 1410 m above mean sea level and spread across 30 km2, is characterized by orchards, rose-gardens, and green valleys. Comprising 14 hamlets and numerous temples, as well as the Swamimalai hill, which stands at 4338 ft and is popular among trekkers, Yelagiri offers various trekking trails, including those that notably reduce background cosmic ray components by almost 98%. The inner sides of the lead shielding are lined with 2 mm thick cadmium and 1 mm thick copper to block lead x-rays and cadmium x-rays, respectively, further reducing background, especially in the low energy region. Standard sources of primordial radionuclides, obtained from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in the same geometry and with the same density as the prepared soil samples, were employed to determine the efficiency of the detector for various energies in the specified geometry.

For each soil sample, count spectra were obtained using a multichannel analyzer, with each radionuclide being detected directly or indirectly. The radioisotope 40K emits gamma rays with an energy of 1.461 MeV, making its determination direct. The determination of 238U depends on the detection of the 214Bi radionuclide, a member of the 238U decay series emitting an energy of 1.764 MeV, making its detection indirect. Likewise, the determination of 232Th concentration is indirect, as it is referred to the 208Tl radionuclide with an energy of 2.615 MeV, originating from the 232Th decay series.

In addition to external exposure, radon and its short-lived products pose risks to respiratory organs. The internal hazard index (Hin) was used to quantify internal exposure to 222Rn and its radioactive progeny. Qualitative and quantitative statistical analyses were applied to radioactive measurements acquired through spectrometric gamma techniques in order to draw valid conclusions about the nature and significance of the distribution of radioactive elements in soil samples from Yelagiri hills, Tamil Nadu, India. The primary statistical software used was SPSS 16.0, and the activity concentrations of natural radionuclides 238U, 232Th, and 40K were analyzed.

The data were further analyzed using hierarchical clustering to group similar soil samples based on their characteristics and similarities. The degree of similarity represents the distance between clusters relative to the largest distance between any two individual variables, with 100% similarity indicating that the clusters were zero distance apart in their sample measurements.
