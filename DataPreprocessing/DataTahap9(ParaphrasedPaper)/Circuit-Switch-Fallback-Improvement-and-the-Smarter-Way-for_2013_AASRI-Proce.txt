The sections that follow are as follows: a summary of the CSFB solution, its advantages and disadvantages, actual implementation, and call scenarios impacting user quality experience in Section 2. Section 3 introduces a smarter deployment approach for the CSFB procedure and a modified call flow to address call setup time delays in the most affected cases. Section 4 presents experimental results, and finally, Section 5 provides a summary.

Based on the points discussed, operators looking to add voice functionality to their LTE networks are faced with a dilemma. The first option is to wait for handsets supporting SRVCC, potentially ceding ground to competitors who have already declared support for voice services on their LTE networks using alternative solutions like CSFB for UMTS operators or active dual-mode operation for CDMA2000 operators. The second option is to opt for less elegant alternatives like CSFB, which could adversely affect user experience and introduce additional costs to the deployment of voice over LTE projects. Ultimately, all operators will likely have to adopt the SRVCC solution as the next logical step in the 4G LTE voice roadmap. The current CSFB implementation also requires time to complete upgrades on all MSC servers, complicating the selection process as handset makers are expected to have the necessary phones available in a few months.

To facilitate the decision-making process for operators, the CSFB implementation should be simplified to minimize cost and time consumption. Additionally, efforts should be made to address the biggest drawback of CSFB, which is the call setup time delay. This requires studying the current CSFB implementation to determine if the call setup time delay is consistently present across all cases or if only specific call scenarios need to be improved.
