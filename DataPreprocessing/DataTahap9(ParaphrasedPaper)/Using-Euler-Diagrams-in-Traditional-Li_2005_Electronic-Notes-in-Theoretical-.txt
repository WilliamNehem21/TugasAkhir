This paper introduces a novel graphical interface designed for traditional library settings, aimed at enabling users to develop new search strategies with ease and efficiency. The interface is based on two linked interactive Euler diagram representations. The first representation allows users to interactively explore the structures comprising the library's documentary core, navigate and select items, and gain a personalized understanding of database content, structure, and access. The second representation provides a set-based visualization of the results of a composed query, empowering users to validate their search context and devise strategies to navigate the results. The combined interfaces create a tool that facilitates users in formulating primary search strategies through graphical manipulations.

To improve accessibility of archives for the general public, it is essential to develop new navigation and search user interfaces tailored to users with limited knowledge of documentary techniques and associated tools. The documentary core comprises complex structures such as graphs, trees, and lists, while a query consists of a list of terms extracted from the core, a Boolean expression, and a list of results. Currently, there is no unified interface to visualize these objects, and this paper endeavors to propose a unified interface in this context.

Thesauri are among the most intricate objects within the traditional documentary core. They serve two purposes: defining terms for describing documents during the indexing process, and enabling more precise searches during document retrieval compared to full-text mode.

Navigation is facilitated through focus change and zoom features. Users can select any visible node to give it focus, and the view then scales to display the focused node in detail. Additionally, when changing focus from one node to another, the interface uses an animation to decompose the minimal path between the nodes, zooming out to the smallest common ancestor (if it exists) and then zooming in toward the new node.

The DocumentSearcher interface enables users to visualize the results of up to five queries in parallel. Each query is associated with a contour and is referred to as a contour query. Our aim is to provide users with a set-based cartographic representation of the database content in relation to these contour queries.

A Venn diagram encompasses all possible intersection zones between the sets, even if a zone does not contain any document. To enhance readability, we only draw diagrams with an elliptic curve for each contour, thereby limiting the maximum drawable number of contour queries to five.

Users often encounter a large number of documents and resort to iterative querying while formulating new queries on the set of results. We have observed that users typically do not use more than five queries in parallel, and iterative formulation is a common strategy.

Our graphic tool facilitates many of these tasks through easy graphical manipulation. Users can extend or refine the meaning of terms based on the documentary core by selecting parent, sibling, or children nodes in the authority explorer. The document searcher's result distribution feature allows users to quickly identify and modify inappropriate terms, which either return too many or too few documents. Iterative strategies can be easily executed by selecting zones of the diagram in the document searcher. The graphic attributes enable users to swiftly analyze the distribution of documents in relation to the documentary core or the current query. However, if terms need to be extrapolated, the user's knowledge and strategy remain pivotal in achieving quick success.
