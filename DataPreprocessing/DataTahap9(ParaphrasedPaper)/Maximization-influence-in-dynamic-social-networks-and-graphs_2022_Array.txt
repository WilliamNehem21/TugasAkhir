The phenomenon of social influence and influence diffusion has been extensively studied in social networks. However, most existing research on influence diffusion focuses on networks that are static in nature. This paper addresses the issue of maximizing influence diffusion in dynamic social networks, i.e., networks that evolve over time. The authors propose several algorithms under the linear threshold (LT) and independent cascade (IC) models, including the DM algorithm, DM-C algorithm, and DM-T algorithm. These algorithms aim to solve the influence maximization (IM) problem in dynamic networks by leveraging different network decomposition techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly enhance diffusion performance compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms and exhibit similar diffusion outcomes to the greedy algorithm. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are substantially faster in terms of computational time compared to previous methods.

Understanding influence diffusion is crucial for triggering a widespread adoption of products through social influence. It involves identifying seed users to maximize the total number of users adopting the product, a concept known as influence maximization. Various approaches have been proposed, such as the PMIA method, which focuses on identifying seed vertices based on paths with high information diffusion ratios. Additionally, degree discounting, proposed by Chen et al., penalizes nodes adjacent to selected nodes to optimize information diffusion. Cai et al. proposed the holistic influence maximization problem as a complement to traditional influence maximization, while Song et al. introduced the Bi-CLKT model to harness contrastive learning for knowledge tracking.

The paper also examines temporal network datasets, including email communication within a European research institution, contacts between children, teachers, patients, and healthcare workers in a hospital ward in Lyon, France, and private messages exchanged on an online social network at the University of California, Irvine. The authors use these datasets to investigate influence maximization in dynamic networks and compare their proposed methods with established approaches, noting superior performance in diffusion except when compared to the MC Greedy algorithm. The authors plan to explore the case of partially observed dynamic graphs and investigate influence maximization using models other than LT and IC in future research.
