In this paper, the authors examine the use of gesture language for interaction in 3D virtual space and propose a formal modeling approach that can be applied to a broader range of interface design issues, independent of the gesture recognition technology being used. They emphasize that while the gesture language design is intriguing, it presents challenges related to ambiguity and overlap that can impact usability and recognition performance. The authors advocate for the use of formal modeling techniques, specifically the use of (hybrid) automata and model checking with the tool hytech, to systematically analyze and improve the gesture language.

The paper discusses the need for addressing ambiguities and overlaps in gesture recognition, as informal reasoning alone may not be sufficient to ensure unambiguous recognition. The authors illustrate how their formal modeling approach can be used to detect and analyze such issues, as well as to explore potential improvements to the language. They demonstrate the application of the modeling technique on a subset of the gesture language, focusing on the zoom, grip, and exit gestures, and present the results of their analysis using reachability checking.

Additionally, the paper highlights the challenges associated with evaluating gesture-based interfaces a posteriori, emphasizing the difficulty of pinpointing the exact cause of usability issues and the variability in human performance. The authors argue that formal models can provide a valuable means of identifying and addressing language-related problems, as well as evaluating the impact of implementing strategies to mitigate human factor-related issues.

The authors conclude by advocating for the use of formal modeling as a complementary approach to a posteriori validation for gesture-based interfaces, noting its potential to identify problems at an early stage of development and facilitate improvements in language design. They acknowledge that formal modeling may not capture all potential issues but contend that it can be a valuable tool for addressing certain problems early in the development process.
