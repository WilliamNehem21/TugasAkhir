An hereditarily finite set, denoted as "s," can be represented as a pointed finite graph "g" in a canonical manner. In this graph, each node corresponds to a distinct element in the transitive closure of {s}, and the edges of "g" depict the membership relation. Given that the concept of bisimulation can be naturally defined for graphs, the canonical representation of "s" ensures that there are no two distinct nodes that are bisimilar. Well-founded sets are depicted by acyclic graphs, while non-well-founded sets are represented by cyclic ones. Consequently, a fundamental question arises: Is there a natural approach to engage in inductive reasoning on both well-founded and non-well-founded hereditarily finite sets represented using graphs? In other words, is there a method to inductively build/deconstruct graphs representing hereditarily finite sets? This question has been previously formalized and investigated, with authors exploring whether it is always possible to find a node in the canonical representation of a set that can be removed to produce the canonical representation of another set without causing any bisimulation collapse. A conclusive answer has not been provided. In this paper, we further explore this issue and demonstrate that there are instances where it is not feasible to remove any node without causing collapses. However, we also present positive evidence that there always exists an edge that can be safely removed, achieved by introducing the notion of n-well-founded part of a non-well-founded graph and applying Ackermann code to it.

The analysis provided a proof that if a node "v" is not disposable, then there exists a weakly connected component of "g\v" that is not hyper-extensional, and a non-identity bisimulation exists for it. Extending this bisimulation with the identity over the other weakly connected components leads to a non-identity bisimulation for "g\v," thus indicating that "g\v" is not hyper-extensional and "v" is a keystone for "g."

Another proof established that if "g" had two roots, p1 and p2, then by the definition of root, both p1 is reachable from p2 and p2 is reachable from p1, implying that "g" is cyclic, contradicting the hypothesis. Hence, "g" must have only one root, denoted as "p."

It was also observed that wf_n(v) can be represented as a graph, which can be computed by taking the unraveling of "g" of order "n" starting from "v" and utilizing only the non-well-founded nodes reachable from "x." Then the well-founded trees are attached to the leaves.

In this study, we investigated the problem of removing parts from a hereditarily finite set without causing bisimulation collapses. We utilized a Sage pipeline that we implemented to demonstrate that removing a node yields a negative answer to this problem. However, we provided a positive answer in the case of removing a single edge, on the condition that only nodes in the same weakly connected components are compared.

The results presented are based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo-based algorithm, originally proposed for generating acyclic digraphs. The key components required to demonstrate that the Markov chain converges to the uniform distribution were the irreducibility, aperiodicity, and symmetry of the chain. The idea used in constructing the Markov chain was to show that a pair of elementary operations on graphs (implemented as basic transition rules of the Markov chain, similar to the elimination of a node) could be employed to transform any graph "g" into another graph "g0" within the same family. A positive answer to the one-node elimination problem would have allowed for the immediate extension of such results to non-well-founded sets, yielding a random generator for HF1/2.
