Several scientific studies have been conducted on the properties of S. ellipticum, a plant used in traditional cancer treatment in Nigeria. Adesegun et al. found in their in vitro study that the stem bark extract of the plant exhibited significant antioxidant properties. In addition, cytotoxicity screening of Nigerian plants used in traditional cancer treatment on various cell lines showed that the leaf extract of S. ellipticum demonstrated the highest cytotoxic activity against HT29 (colon cancer) and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell lines, comparable to the reference drug cisplatin. Furthermore, Nana et al. documented the phytochemical constituents, in vitro antioxidant capacities, and antiplasmodial activities of S. ellipticum stem bark extracts. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of this plant. For the study, a sample of 2 mg of S. ellipticum extract was mixed with 100 mg of potassium bromide (FT-IR grade) and compressed to prepare a translucent sample disc (3 mm diameter). The disc was then scanned and the FT-IR spectra were recorded in the absorption range between 1000 and 3500 nm using a Perkin Elmer spectrophotometer system. This analysis aimed to detect characteristic peaks, types of chemical bonds, and probable functional groups present in the S. ellipticum sample. Peak values of the FT-IR were recorded, and the analysis was repeated twice to confirm the spectrum.
