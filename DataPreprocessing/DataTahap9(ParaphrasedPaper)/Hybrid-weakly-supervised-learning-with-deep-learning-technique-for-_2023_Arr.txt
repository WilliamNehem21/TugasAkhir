As a result of the rise of social networking sites and social media platforms, information is being disseminated to the public at a faster pace. Unverified information is frequently spread across social media platforms without regard for its accuracy, leading to significant challenges for governments and society. The propagation of false news has adverse effects on various aspects of human life. The accurate detection of fake news from online sources is a crucial and difficult issue that can be addressed through deep learning techniques. The manual annotation of large volumes of social media-generated data is impractical. In this study, a hybrid approach is proposed for identifying fake news, utilizing weakly supervised learning to provide labels to unlabeled data and employing deep learning techniques such as bi-directional recurrent neural networks (Bi-RNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) for fake news detection. Feature extraction is carried out using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and count vectorization techniques. The proposed approach achieved a 90% accuracy in detecting fake news, underscoring its effectiveness in the absence of labeled data.

The study examines the widespread dissemination of false information through social media as a form of cyber propaganda. Fake news is extensively circulated through popular social media networks like Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp, and the increasing popularity of these platforms has facilitated the creation and distribution of misleading information. Users can easily share their views and opinions across social media networks without thorough scrutiny, resulting in news reports on these platforms garnering more views than those on official news websites. Notably, research has shown that fake news stories spread 70% faster than real news on social media, as discovered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

The paper is structured as follows: the second section discusses recent related work on detecting fake news using weakly supervised and deep learning techniques, while the third section outlines the methods used in this study for detecting fake news, with a focus on weakly supervised learning techniques. The fourth section elaborates on the proposed hybrid approach for identifying fake news, and the experimental findings are presented in the fifth section, followed by a conclusion in the sixth section.

A previous study presented a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) model to identify fake news from Twitter data. The model utilized a private dataset of 58,000 tweets from five different rumor stories and adopted a two-step approach for fake news detection, involving feature extraction from Twitter posts and subsequent prediction using an LSTM and CNN hybrid deep learning model.

Another study proposed the use of weak social supervision techniques for identifying disinformation, utilizing the Fakenewsnet benchmark dataset collected from fact-checking websites. The study generated weak labels based on sentiment, bias, and credibility measures and employed CNN and robustly optimized BERT (RoBERTa) models for the classification of false information.

In a different approach, authors employed weakly supervised learning exclusively based on content features for fake news detection, using a probabilistic weak labeling system to label the content features and achieving the highest accuracy for fake news classification using RoBERTa with weak labels.

Furthermore, using the labeled LIAR dataset, authors demonstrated an ensemble-based deep learning model to recognize news as real or false, achieving an accuracy of 89% with the suggested approach.

The study also conducted statistical tests to verify the accuracy of the annotated labeled data, employing a t-test to assess differences in the measured values.

Experiments were conducted using a proposed hybrid approach, which included weakly supervised learning for data annotation and deep learning techniques for the classification of fake news. The data was split for model training and testing, and various deep learning techniques were applied, including Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU, LSTM, and CNN.

The proposed Bi-LSTM model was trained using the Adam optimizer and achieved a prediction accuracy of 90% for fake news classification, outperforming other deep learning models.

The study found that Bi-LSTM and Bi-GRU with weakly supervised SVM are the most effective models for the classification of fake news, surpassing other state-of-the-art approaches using weakly labeled data.

Overall, the proposed hybrid approach with weakly supervised learning and deep learning techniques demonstrates significant effectiveness and efficiency in identifying false information when labeled data is scarce.
