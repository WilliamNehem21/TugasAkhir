A bi-arborescence is defined as a rooted tree that is formed by the union of two disjoint components - an in-arborescence and an out-arborescence - except for their common root, which is also the root of the bi-arborescence. In the proof of theorem 3.1, it is noted that the root of the out-arborescence is contained in the first vertex of the median order. Utilizing directional duality, it can be inferred that the root of an in-arborescence is contained in the last vertex of the median order, leading to the derivation of the following corollary.

This approach is valuable as it involves considering the nodes of the tree in a different order. The key property that is utilized is that the images of all the children of a given node "a" are fixed simultaneously, without the need to specify the order beforehand. This implies that the order can be selected after the images of the children are known, allowing for the effective choice of which child of "a" is embedded to which vertex based on the knowledge of the set of the images of the children of "a".

Now, consider a non-path tree "a". In this context, a branch-node is defined as a node with a degree of at least 3, while a flat node is a node with a degree of 2. A segment within tree "a" refers to a subpath with its starting point being a branch-node and its end point being either a branch-node or a leaf, with flat nodes as its internal nodes. If the end point of the segment is a branch-node, it is referred to as an inner segment; otherwise, it is an outer segment. The opposite of an inner segment "s", denoted as "s", is an inner segment with its starting point being the end point of "s" and its end point being the starting point of "s".
