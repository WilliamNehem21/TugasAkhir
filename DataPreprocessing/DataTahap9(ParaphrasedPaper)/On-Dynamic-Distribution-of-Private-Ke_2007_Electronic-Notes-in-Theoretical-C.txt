Since the initial proposition linking threshold cryptography to mobile ad-hoc networks, threshold secret sharing has been utilized in other studies to secure ad-hoc networks in a dynamic manner. Additionally, these studies demonstrate the construction of threshold signatures in the dynamic context of a mobile ad-hoc network, suggesting the potential extension of their findings to other cryptographic operations. Recently, Saxena et al. have presented an efficient admission protocol for ad-hoc networks, employing similar secret sharing techniques as discussed in our paper.

In the context of an identity-based encryption scheme, a master public key/private key pair is produced by the package. Once this master key is established, any arbitrary identities can be used as public keys for the scheme. When a sender wishes to encrypt a message for a recipient with a specific identity, they only require the master public key and the corresponding identity. To decrypt a message, the user identity must obtain the corresponding private key from the trusted authority.

The function id.gen takes a security parameter k and outputs the system parameters id.pms and the master private key id.msk. The system parameters include the master public key and the description of sets m and c, which represent the set of messages and ciphertexts, respectively. While id.pms is publicly available, id.msk is kept confidential by the trusted authority.

Each node possesses a unique identity id, which is bound to the node for its entire lifetime, non-transferable, and verifiable. The identity of a node, denoted as idi, must remain consistent throughout its lifetime. There are various options for selecting the identities of network nodes, as noted in previous work. We categorize nodes into two types: nodes capable of providing shares of the master key, referred to as sharing master nodes or simply as nodes, and nodes in the MANET that, although connected to the set of nodes, are not able to provide shares of the master key, referred to as potential nodes.

Our proposal is specifically tailored to suit the mobility condition of MANETs. A potential node may obtain a set of shares of its secret key from a group of nodes, even if it moves away and connects to a different set of nodes in the MANET, allowing it to recover its private key after obtaining sufficient shares from nodes in the MANET.

Due to constraints on space, we focus on an honest-but-curious scenario, assuming that some set of corrupted nodes (either nodes or potential nodes) obtain information from honest nodes but execute the protocol correctly. From this point forward, we assume that any set of corrupted nodes has a cardinality of at most t.

The initialization phase of the protocol is carried out only once by the founders of the MANET at the outset of the protocol. The founders jointly generate a random secret value in zq by setting up a (t, l)-threshold secret sharing scheme using bivariate polynomials. The shares are univariate polynomials rather than field elements, increasing the complexity of the protocol depending on the selected parameter t, but providing essential dynamism to the protocols, crucial in MANETs due to their inherent mobility and unpredictability.

It is important to note that we are considering the case where t < l. If this is not the case, simple solutions can resolve this issue. For instance, founders can attempt to increase the set of founder nodes or decrease the threshold t.

As a direct application of our construction, nodes in a MANET can benefit from identity-based public key cryptography (ID-PKC). Additionally, the issue of revoking users can be addressed by incorporating an expiry date in the identity corresponding to each node.

Saxena et al. suggests using k2nm= sm(hn)= sn(hm) as a common secret key, and if the identities of the nodes include an expiry date, since k1nm depends on the identities idm and idn, k1nm changes for every period, while k2nm remains constant. Thus, a node can be compromised for a period without jeopardizing its communications for future periods.
