Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, draws inspiration from the human brain's structure. Unlike traditional machine learning, where the programmer manually designs features for the system to learn from, deep learning involves representation learning, where raw input signals are fed to the computer for feature extraction and learning. The study proposed a real-time object detection model based on the YOLOv4 algorithm, incorporating specific modules and network structures to optimize feature extraction, transfer, and reuse. This model outperformed existing state-of-the-art detection models in terms of accuracy and speed for detecting diseases in tomato plants. Similarly, the study applied the modified YOLOv4 model to detect different growth stages of mangoes and achieved improved performance compared to the original YOLOv4 model.

Furthermore, the YOLOv5 model was used for classifying and testing the quality of seeds, achieving high precision and recall in classifying different types of seeds. In another experiment, a new network structure called DAC-YOLOv4 was proposed, which used depth-wise convolution and CSPNet to achieve a significantly compressed model size while maintaining high detection accuracy.

The study manually collected images of various leguminous seed types and used the YOLOv4 and Faster R-CNN models for object detection. Both models consisted of a backbone, neck, and detection head, and exhibited different architectures and trade-offs between precision and recall. The study also discussed the evaluation of object detection models using metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score.

Additionally, the study highlighted the importance of small object detection in agricultural applications and utilized mosaic data augmentation in YOLOv4 to accurately detect small seeds in complex backgrounds. Overall, the YOLOv4 model proved to improve accuracy and runtime with less computational load when applied to the detection of leguminous seeds in various environments.
