This research paper focuses on the important and actively evolving area of quantum computing, specifically the design and development of quantum programming languages (QPLs). The paper aims to address the issue of establishing a standardized methodology for verifying a QPL against key quantum computing concepts. The authors propose a dedicated framework for the meta-level analysis of QPLs, particularly functional quantum languages, using the Hybrid system. Hybrid is a logical framework supporting higher-order abstract syntax, and the authors build an intuitionistic linear specification logic on top of it to reason about QPLs. The paper provides a formal proof of significant meta-theoretic properties of this logic and presents several examples that can be addressed within the proposed framework.

The authors discuss the syntax and basic properties of the types supported by the language. They acknowledge that QPL designers often opt for defining untyped calculi to encompass a wide range of quantum features, while some sacrifice certain features to integrate specific type systems. The proposed framework accommodates both turing complete and incomplete QPLs. The formalized syntax and semantics are utilized to reason about the language, including proving subject reduction (type soundness) or turing completeness.

The paper also examines the implementation of the Hybrid system using a Coq library, specifically the file hybrid.v, which supports the expression of the syntax of QPLs. The authors highlight that one distinctive feature of this language is the inclusion of quantum variables, which are considered linear and have an implicitly known type (qubit). The definition of abstractions for quantum variables includes constants such as labs and iabs, as well as qlet for a specific type of abstraction.

The authors elaborate on the formalization of linear and intuitionistic abstractions using an HOAS representation in Coq and emphasize the importance of these formalizations in handling the meta-analysis of different fragments of linear logic. They also discuss the use of linear logic as an intermediate logic for studying object languages such as QPLs.

Furthermore, the paper delves into the constructors and rules within the logic, providing insights into the atomic formula, type constructors, and the backchaining rule. The authors also stress the significance of the non-ordered nature of their version of linear logic and highlight the exchange property of the linear context.

In conclusion, the authors present a meta-level analysis framework for functional QPLs using the Hybrid system with a linear specification logic. They demonstrate how the framework can be applied to address fundamental components and concepts of QPLs, such as operational semantics and type safety, through formalization examples of proto-quipper and q languages.
