The dnf fuzzification exhibits an intriguing relationship with the probability of a one occurring in a specific cell at a given time. Since the fuzzy values fall within the range of [0, 1], they can be viewed as probabilities. For instance, a fuzzy value xt can represent the probability that a cell yi in a boolean cellular automaton assumes a value of 1 at a particular time.

In order to proceed, it is necessary to introduce some notation. Given a random variable z, let e(z) denote its expected value. It is important to note that when z is a binary random variable, e(z) represents the probability p(z= 1). We demonstrate that by applying the fuzzification f of g to the expected values of a cell yi and its 2q neighboring cells, we can obtain the expected value of g[yi], which pertains to the cell at the subsequent time step.

This section delves into another characteristic of boolean cellular automata that has been extensively examined in existing literature: additivity (as discussed in [8,17,26]). We further explore the interconnection between boolean and fuzzy cellular automata by establishing a link between additivity and a new fuzzy property termed self-oscillation. This enables us to delineate the category of self-oscillating fuzzy cellular automata. It is noteworthy that while we focus on one-dimensional cellular automata for simplicity, the findings in this section are applicable to cellular automata of any dimension.

We initially observe that functions that approach either zero or one cannot be self-oscillating because their respective values are always greater than or always less than the convergence point. To support this claim, we proceed to prove this lemma through induction on n, which represents the number of variables in f and consequently the size of the neighborhood.
