One possible approach is to create a LaTeX document to disseminate results by inserting selected portions of the formal development into the text. However, this method has drawbacks, such as the potential for errors introduced during the cut and paste process. Users prefer to use LaTeX for writing, documenting, and publishing their work, as formal development involves definitions, theorems, and proofs rather than pieces of programs. One initial step that can be taken is to place TeX commands within comments as part of the scripts.

The ideal tool should offer high-quality visualization that uses standard mathematical notation and provides a user-friendly interface. It should also allow the presentation of formal developments using a natural syntax, while minimizing the use of automatic generation from formal development to produce article-ready text to avoid errors. Furthermore, the tool should enable the automatic importation of source code, such as theorem statements and definitions, to preserve their correctness, as well as maintain links and correspondences between the presentation and the scripts controlled by the prover.

The tool should be compatible with various theorem provers and should not be tied to a specific one. While the tool is currently focused on formal developments primarily done using the Coq theorem prover, it is intended to become an independent tool in the future.

Users may also want to modify imported fragments to enhance readability or comprehension. Therefore, the tool should allow for variable renaming, reorganization of hypotheses, or other changes at the presentation level while ensuring the formal development remains correct. Additionally, the tool should enable users to enrich their formal development with convenient documentation or informal explanations, as well as support interactive editing before the dissemination of results. While LaTeX exportation is acceptable for scientific document formatting, the tool should also be capable of recovering the script to certify the embedded code.

The tool must handle the distinction between active and inactive portions of the script to preserve structure information. To address this requirement, the tool should consider the use of structured documents, such as those supported by the TeXmacs editor, which offers many attractive features for authoring scientific documents.

The paper also discusses details related to representing nodes as special nodes in the generated structure and the automatic generation of the full Coq standard library as a set of TeXmacs files. The tool's ability to transform any program source file into a dual document source file, based on the working principles of TeXmacs, is also highlighted.

Additionally, the paper mentions the challenges of collecting documentation from source scripts and ensuring their preservation through the exportation step. To address these challenges, the tool uses a two-step exportation process and provides the capability for users to locally tune the exported material inside the document.

Furthermore, the paper briefly discusses the Coq-tex tool provided with the Coq distribution, which processes Coq phrases embedded in LaTeX files. The tool selects and re-inserts the appropriate text based on certain criteria, with consideration for whether the vernacular command or the result of its evaluation should be displayed.

Overall, the paper presents a comprehensive set of requirements and considerations for the development of a tool that facilitates the dissemination and certification of formal developments.
