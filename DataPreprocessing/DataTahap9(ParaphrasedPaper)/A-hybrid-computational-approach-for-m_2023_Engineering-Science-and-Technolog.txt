Substrate domains are typically defined using a combination of normal and sliding contact formulations, as evidenced by numerous studies. However, recent research has indicated that a more effective formulation can be established based on traction separation laws. In a study involving the spraying of pure Cu onto a Cu substrate, it was discovered that a high accuracy Lagrangian finite element (FE) scheme was able to accurately predict the experimental rebound velocities and critical bonding conditions. The FE simulations showed that approximately 99% of the particles' kinetic energy is dissipated through plastic deformation. Additionally, adhesion strength of Ti6Al-4V Grade 23 coating onto Ti-6Al-4V Grade 5 substrate was predicted using a Lagrangian FE approach.

Preliminary parametric analyses were conducted to minimize boundary effects on the outcomes of the numerical simulation, and the substrate domain was assumed to be initially at an ambient temperature of 300 K. The particle temperatures and impact velocities were varied within specific ranges. The tangential contact behavior at the interface was determined using a penalty formulation and a friction coefficient of 0.5. A finite sliding scheme was employed to allow for finite motion of the contact surfaces in the substrate.

A physics-based hybrid computational approach was introduced for modeling cold spray (CS) deposition, involving the coupling of simulation results obtained with the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and the Lagrangian FE schemes. The CS simulations were carried out for various particle characteristics and impact conditions, and the numerical results were validated by comparing them with previous experiments and FE-based simulations.

The study also explored the effects of particle morphology on impact deformation behavior. It was found that hollow spherical particles experienced significant deformation and resulted in shallow substrate penetration, while bulk spherical particles exhibited greater flowability and revealed deeper penetration depth. The study further revealed that the interface created by spherical particles showed a wavy-type morphology, indicating the potential for stronger mechanical interlocking between the particles and the substrate.

Despite the computational efficiency of the hybrid approach in predicting temperature and plastic strain distribution during the impact and interactions of multiple Ni particles, it has some limitations that could be addressed in future research work. Nonetheless, the hybrid approach has shown potential as an alternative module for selecting CS process parameters and modeling materials behavior.
