In recent years, a number of studies have demonstrated the significant role of soft computing (SC) techniques in monitoring forest fires [4, 37, 43]. Other works have utilized SC to uncover and forecast valuable information regarding the interrelationships between variables influencing forest fire occurrences [1, 17, 44], as well as to estimate burned areas under projected climate conditions [3, 9, 60]. Several recent papers have also focused on the application of SC techniques for predicting forest fires [5, 13, 18, 27, 45, 50, 65].

The multi-layer perceptron neural network (MPNN) is widely utilized due to its clear architecture, fast operations, ease of implementation, and ability to solve complex classification problems [32, 55]. Consisting of input, hidden, and output layers, the MPNN network functions by receiving, transmitting, and outputting data, with the hidden layer serving to pass results to the output layer [22, 40]. Meanwhile, support vector machines (SVM) are chosen for their capacity to address nonlinear issues and employ kernel functions, allowing for the conversion of data from a high dimensional space and achieving similar results to those in the input space. SVM aims to find hyperplanes with high generalization ability to separate training data without errors, offering an effective solution for classification problems.

Radial basis function (RBF) networks are widely applied in various domains for tasks such as system control, time series prediction, dynamic system problems, and data classification due to their capability to forecast behavior directly from input and output data [19, 35, 63]. In this work, principal component analysis (PCA) was used as an initial step to identify associations between features, and the results indicated that relative humidity (RH) exhibited weak correlation with other variables.

For the purpose of determining the effective predictor for forest fires, PCA was applied to capture correlations between features, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used to identify the number of clusters in the resultant data. It was found that SVM achieved the best results with high accuracy when compared to other methods. These findings complement the work of Felber and Bartelt (2003), who investigated the use of the nearest neighbour method for predicting forest fires in the context of remote sensing and GIS applications to forest fire management.
