Chen, Chen, Feng, Yu, Lin, et al. conducted a study involving 102,900 participants from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) to investigate 36 human quantitative traits through genome-wide analysis. The study identified a total of 1,986 significant loci, with 968 loci being previously unreported when compared to Biobank Japan, UK Biobank, and previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The researchers also demonstrated the potential of using cross-phenotype, cross-population polygenic risk scores for predicting disease risk. These findings suggest the potential for advancing gene discovery in diverse populations.

When comparing the genetic architecture of quantitative traits in East Asian (EAS) and European (EUR) populations using data from Biobank Japan and UK Biobank, the study found a consistent genetic architecture within EAS and between EAS and EUR populations. Integrating TWB and Biobank Japan GWAS identified a total of 3,825 genetic loci, including 968 novel loci not previously reported. The study also identified 24 putative causal missense variants and fine-mapped over 200 association signals to a single variant. Additionally, the polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis showed the potential utility of biomarker GWAS in predicting disease risk and the promise of multi-trait cross-population polygenic prediction.

The researchers utilized biomarker GWAS summary statistics from TWB, Biobank Japan, UK Biobank, and international consortia for disease risk prediction. They employed a polygenic scoring methodology to combine biomarker GWAS from EAS and EUR samples and demonstrated that incorporating multiple biomarker PRSs from diverse populations improved polygenic prediction for disease risk. These results suggest that expanding biobank resources to collect a wider range of biomarkers from diverse populations may further improve the clinical utility of PRSs.

The study acknowledges that its scope was limited to 36 quantitative traits for genome-wide association analysis and 5 diseases for polygenic prediction. The authors highlight the need to expand the analyses to encompass a broader range of quantitative and disease phenotypes as ongoing sample and data collection efforts in TWB continue. Furthermore, they emphasize the importance of increasing the sample size and phenotype coverage in TWB, East Asia, and other non-European populations to facilitate genetic discovery for human complex traits.

The study was supported by various grants, and the researchers express their gratitude to the organizations and institutions that provided technical and computational support. The authors also provide details regarding study permissions, including approvals from the Ethics and Governance Council of Taiwan Biobank and the Institutional Review Board of National Health Research Institutes in Taiwan, as well as the informed consent obtained from all participants for research use of collected data.

The researchers detailed the methods used for data analysis, including pre-imputation quality control (QC), genotype imputation, post-imputation QC, and sample size restrictions for different analyses. They also described the criteria for retaining variants and the sample sizes for loci discovery and polygenic risk score analysis. The study further highlighted the importance of considering ancestral origin in the analyses, particularly for comparisons of PRS distributions.

Overall, the study presents significant findings from genome-wide analysis in a large cohort of TWB participants, highlighting the potential for advancing gene discovery and improving disease risk prediction with diverse populations. The authors emphasize the need for continued expansion of biobank resources and data harmonization efforts to further facilitate genetic discovery and clinical utility.
