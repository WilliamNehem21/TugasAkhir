The method described in the paper utilizes spectral techniques to establish pairwise geometric relationships between virtual and physical sensor scans. These relationships are then used to generate 2D geometric histograms that encode the similarity between the true scan and virtual scans, allowing for the ranking of candidate poses based on this similarity measure. A threshold based on the correlation coefficient of all scan combinations is used to extract a subset of candidate poses, and the final pose is determined by identifying the one with the maximum number of correspondence pairs.

The approach presented in this paper combines odometry, scanmatching, and scan-to-map-scan matching of 2D lidar scans with cadastral maps to localize autonomous vehicles in outdoor environments. Constraints from these sources are incorporated into a graph optimization problem to compute the most likely vehicle pose based on measurements from the 2D range sensor. Furthermore, non-building objects are filtered out from the real laser observations using a split and merge approach, combined with weighted line fitting. The input range scan and the map-derived scan are aligned using generalised ICP, and the resulting pose transform is added to the graph if the ICP has converged. Additionally, a method for detecting ambiguity in the longitudinal position of the vehicle in corridor-like environments is introduced. The scan-to-map-scan matching is employed in conjunction with a particle filter, with the resulting pose estimate being fed back to the particle population, demonstrating lower pose errors compared to scenarios where only a single particle is used for feedback. It is also shown that this feedback method exhibits increased robustness compared to scenarios where the particle filter is initialized anew around the resulting estimate.

In contrast to NDT, which establishes correspondences based on the distance of point positions to voxel distributions, VGICP aggregates the distribution of each point in the voxel and establishes correspondences between these distributions and target distributions. This makes VGICP a voxel-based distribution-to-multidistribution approach, offering valid voxel distributions even with few points in a voxel and ensuring robustness to changes in voxel resolution. VGICP extends GICP to avoid costly nearest neighbor searches while reducing execution time.

Finally, the tested standard deviations were determined based on the reported maximum range errors of commercially available panoramic lidar scanners, calculated by taking a fraction of these reported errors to account for the majority of errors being within this range.
