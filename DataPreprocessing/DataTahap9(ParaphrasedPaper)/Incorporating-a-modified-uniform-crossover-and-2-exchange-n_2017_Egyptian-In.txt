The bat algorithm has recently emerged as a robust search method for addressing both continuous and discrete problems. This paper presents a novel discrete variant of the bat algorithm to tackle the quadratic assignment problem, a well-known NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization that aims to minimize the assignment cost of facilities to locations. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated using benchmark instances from the qaplib library and compared with other algorithms, demonstrating promising results.

Furthermore, many metaheuristic algorithms are inspired by swarm intelligence, biological systems, and physical and chemical systems. Swarm intelligence algorithms, including particle swarm optimization, spider monkey, cuckoo search, bee colony optimization, and firefly algorithms, have proved to be effective in solving engineering optimization problems. The bat-inspired algorithm is a recent addition to this category of algorithms.

Efforts have been made to enhance the convergence and accuracy of both the bat algorithm and other algorithms. Fister et al. developed a hybrid self-adaptive bat algorithm by incorporating self-adaptation of control parameters and hybridizing the algorithm with four differential evolution strategies as local search heuristics. Mirjalili et al. introduced a binary version of the bat algorithm using the sigmoid function to solve unimodal and multimodal problems.

Incorporating crossover operations to produce new populations has been a common practice in genetic algorithms. Various crossover operators, such as ordered crossover (OX), cycle crossover (CX), multiple parent crossover (MPX), swap path crossover (SPX), partially mapped crossover (PMX), cohesive crossover (COHX), one-point crossover (OPX), and uniform crossover (UX), have been proposed to address the quadratic assignment problem. To improve the diversity of the population and prevent premature convergence, this paper proposes a modification to the uniform crossover (UX). The modified UX aims to enhance the search strategy of the bat algorithm by retaining the basic principles of the standard UX while introducing modifications to increase diversity and maintain population balance.

The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed discrete bat algorithm efficiently solved both easy and hard instances of the quadratic assignment problem within a reasonable time. Future research will focus on applying the discrete bat algorithm to other combinatorial optimization problems, such as scheduling models, logistic network models, and vehicle routing models. Enhancements to the algorithm will also be explored through hybrid approaches and the utilization of other discretization methods to switch between continuous and discrete search spaces.
