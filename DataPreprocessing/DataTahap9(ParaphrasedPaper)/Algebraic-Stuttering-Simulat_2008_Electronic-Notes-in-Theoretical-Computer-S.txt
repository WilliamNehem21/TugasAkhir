We aim to broaden the concept of simulation in order to establish connections between Kripke structures based on different sets of atomic propositions. By doing so, we can create a more adaptable approach to relating Kripke structures and amalgamate all previous categories of simulations into a unified framework. An initial step involves defining a method to translate the properties of a Kripke structure to a new set of atomic propositions.

The concept of mapping in section 5.1 is quite comprehensive and applicable to numerous scenarios; however, it is limited by its reliance on functions. This limitation can be circumvented through a straightforward expansion of the aforementioned concepts.

It is important to note that when employing functions in recsrwth|=, we exclusively consider recursive functions, while allowing arbitrary r.e. relations in recsrelrwth|=. This extension appears to be a logical progression, as the composition of recursive relations is not inherently recursive in general.
