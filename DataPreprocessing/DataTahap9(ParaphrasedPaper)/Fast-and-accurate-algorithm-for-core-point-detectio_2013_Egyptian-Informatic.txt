In fingerprint analysis, the core point (CP) is defined as the highest curvature point in the fingerprint ridges, although Henry and forensics definitions also encompass this concept, albeit with some variation, placing the CP at the shoulder of the loop away from the delta point. Fingerprint images are categorized into five classes based on the presence of singular points (SPs), such as loops containing one core and one delta point, whorl types containing two cores and two delta points, and arch types comprising three subclasses: tented arch with one core and one delta point, up-thrust arch with no loop but a sudden change in ridges, and plain arch without any SPs.

Various methods are employed for SP detection, including those based on the Poincar√© index (PI), local ridge orientation characteristics, intersection of different ridge orientation partitions, and simultaneous detection of orientation map and SPs using mathematical models. The PI method is a classical approach, determined by the sum of orientation changes along a closed circle, offering design simplicity, robustness to image rotation, and singularity type determination, albeit sensitivity to noise. More complex filters like the semi-radial symmetry filter and orientation variation-based feature removal have also been proposed to enhance accuracy.

The subsequent sections of this paper outline the development of singular point detection, analysis of the orientation map, the proposed core detection procedure, experimental results, and conclusion. Local ridge orientation, described as the angle made by the ridges or ridges and valleys with the horizontal axis at a given point, is calculated on a high-resolution orientation map, either pixel-wise or block-wise for computational efficiency. The goal is to develop a fast technique for CP detection using a mask that scans the orientation map for a specific orientation pattern around the CP, with mask parameters derived from the distribution of orientation values around the CP.

Finally, segmentation analysis from the FVC2002 dataset is conducted to minimize errors between manual and algorithmic segmented blocks, with specific parameters set for this process.
