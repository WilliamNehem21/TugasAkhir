The transparency of a trust management framework (TMF) entails the instant availability of reputation information for users, eliminating the need for them to search for recommenders and gather evidence themselves. Trust decisions in TMF should be tailored to each node's policy, recognizing individual variations in trusting attitudes. This paper presents a distributed large-scale, self-managing TMF that addresses the challenges of collecting scattered evidence to form reputation and accommodates the evolution of reputation information. The proposed TMF is designed in layers to enhance flexibility and scalability. Reputation information is pre-calculated and stored offline, improving the timeliness of availability when making instantaneous decisions in an online environment. The placement of a reputation server (RS) is crucial to prevent bias and skewing of reputation, and the RS periodically evolves reputation values. The use of TMF is essential for successful management of information technology users and the prevention of malicious agents. The paper provides a practical and efficient approach to building a scalable trust management system, with implications for various domains such as e-commerce and mobile agent platforms.
