This research introduces a new efficient sparse approximate inverse (SPAI) preconditioning algorithm for GPUs, termed GSPAI-opt. The GSPAI-opt algorithm combines the strengths of two established SPAI preconditioning methods and offers several new features: (1) it proposes an optimization strategy to determine the use of constant or non-constant thread groups for any sparse pattern of the preprocessor, (2) it presents a parallel framework for optimizing the SPAI preconditioner on GPUs, and (3) it establishes a decision tree for selecting the optimal kernel for computing each component of the preconditioner. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of GSPAI-opt.

Recently, Dehnavi et al. introduced a static SPAI preconditioner on GPUs named GSAI, and He and Gao et al. developed a GPU-based static SPAI preconditioning algorithm called SPAI-adaptive, which demonstrated its effectiveness for large-scale matrices. However, the performance of SPAI-adaptive significantly diminishes when there are substantial differences in the number of nonzero entries in each column of the preconditioner. In response to this limitation, He and Gao et al. introduced a sorted static SPAI preconditioning algorithm, called GSPAI-adaptive, to address this issue.

The proposed GSPAI-opt algorithm effectively combines the advantages of both SPAI-adaptive and GSPAI-adaptive. It incorporates a thread-adaptive allocation strategy with both constant and non-constant thread-group sizes, drawing from the respective strategies of SPAI-adaptive and GSPAI-adaptive. The experimental findings demonstrate that GSPAI-opt successfully leverages the strengths of SPAI-adaptive and GSPAI-adaptive and yields significant performance improvements.
