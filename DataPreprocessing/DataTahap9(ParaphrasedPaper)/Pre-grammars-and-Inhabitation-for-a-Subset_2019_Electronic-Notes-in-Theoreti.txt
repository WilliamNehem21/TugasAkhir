The study explored the concept of pre-grammar within the scope of rank 2 intersection types and tackled the issue of emptiness within a rank 2 subsystem. The focus was on types in t2 that lack positive occurrences of intersections, and the study found that existing methods developed for simple types can be elegantly extended to encompass these types. As a next step, the researchers aim to expand their methods to encompass the entire rank 2 type system and also examine other more expressive type systems.
