In general, the exploration of thermophilic bacteria has been limited due to challenges in isolating and maintaining pure cultures. The biotechnological potential of thermophiles and extremophiles has been supported by their reservoirs of enzymes such as amylases, proteases, lipases, xylanases, and DNA polymerases, which are able to tolerate high temperatures, extreme pH levels, and salinity. Additionally, thermal vents, particularly the Hammam Pharaon located in South Sinai, Egypt at coordinates latitude 29.197112 and longitude 32.956179, has become a popular tourist attraction. This study aimed to investigate the bacterial community of Hammam Pharaon, characterizing the bacterial isolates at morphological, molecular, and fatty acid levels, and exploring their biotechnological potential, particularly their amylolytic, cellulolytic, lipolytic, and proteolytic activities.

Water samples were collected from thermal vents, and native bacteria were isolated from soil deposits using standard protocols. The bacterial isolates were then characterized using scanning electron microscopy, and the mineral composition of the water samples was determined. Additionally, the main effects and interactions between pH and temperature on bacterial growth were determined using the central composite design. The optimal conditions for bacterial growth were obtained, and the bacterial strains were characterized based on their morphology, gram staining, and fatty acid profiles.

The fatty acid profiles of the isolates were found to be unique and slightly different from those of previously studied thermophiles. An extensive literature survey revealed that each species establishes its own niche with specific environmental conditions, such as temperature, pH, and nutrients. The adaptability of the cellular components of native species is crucial for survival under these conditions, with cell structure and cell membrane lipids playing a key role. The type of lipids, unsaturation status, and membrane fluidity are selectively affected by temperature, which determines the ability of cells to grow at specific temperatures. Moreover, fatty acid unsaturation, chain length, branching, and cyclization all contribute significantly to the adaptability of thermophiles to their environments.

In summary, this study sheds light on the exploration and potential biotechnological applications of thermophilic bacteria, particularly those isolated from the thermal vents of Hammam Pharaon in Egypt. The unique fatty acid profiles of the isolates demonstrate their adaptability to extreme environmental conditions, providing valuable insights for their potential industrial and biotechnological applications.
