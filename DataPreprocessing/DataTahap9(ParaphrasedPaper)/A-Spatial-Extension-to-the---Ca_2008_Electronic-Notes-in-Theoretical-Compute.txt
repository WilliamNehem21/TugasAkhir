The majority of the current modeling and simulation approaches in systems biology do not explicitly represent or evaluate spatial phenomena, despite the increasing availability of spatial information from wet-lab techniques. This information highlights the importance of space in both inter- and intracellular dynamics, such as the spatial distribution of key actors in mitosis and the dependence of signaling pathways on the location and movement of their components. The relay of information in cells is influenced by diffusion and active transportation processes.

In our approach, we utilize two types of rules to denote progress in time: rules that operate during a time interval and define the processes' ability to act and interact, and a rule that specifies the transition between time intervals. These rules are used interchangeably, and the transition between intervals occurs only when there are no further actions or interactions to be executed.

Euglena, a microorganism found in inland water, exhibits phototaxis, a behavior influenced by solar irradiation. Our model focuses on this type of motion, assuming a two-dimensional top-down slice through a lake of certain dimensions.

In our model, each action at a channel in SpacePi may be associated with different radii. For example, we assume a radius of 0.15 for actions involving collision and photoreception by Euglena, and a radius of 0.05 for actions involving photoreception by photons.

Collision is a significant factor in our model, as it facilitates the absorption of light by microorganisms within their area of perception. Collisions between Euglena cells affect their motion and behavior, and occur when two processes communicate on a spatial channel, taking into account the channel name, the radius of complementary channel actions, and the processes' locations.

Molecular motion is primarily represented as Brownian motion or random walk in our model, but more sophisticated motions can be described by defining movement functions that consider internal and external forces. Additionally, molecular crowding effects and active transportation, such as in neuronal cells, can also be modeled in SpacePi.

In SpacePi, the ability of processes to communicate is determined by their location and distance, reducing the number of potential communication partners and enabling more efficient model analysis. Real Space Process Algebra, which is the basis of SpacePi, supports process movement inspired by the testing of synchronization protocols in mobile networks, integrating asynchronous aspects of communication.

Unlike other simulation packages that do not differentiate between formal modeling and model execution, SpacePi's process algebraic approach allows for mathematical analysis and flexibility in choosing the appropriate abstraction level. This enables explicit formulation of assumptions in model descriptions, preventing misunderstandings and potentially leading to new insights.

Efficient collision detection in our 2D space model is crucial to prevent slowdowns in simulation. Proposed solutions leverage the fact that many objects do not qualify for collision, allowing for more efficient calculations by avoiding unnecessary collision checks.

Overall, the SpacePi formalism distinguishes itself by being a process algebra that allows for mathematical analysis and flexibility in choosing abstraction level, with potential implications for understanding the effects of simplifying abstractions regarding particle movement.
