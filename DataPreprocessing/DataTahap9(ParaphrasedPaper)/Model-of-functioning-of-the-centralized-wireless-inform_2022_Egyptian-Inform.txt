In developed nations, the integration of technological and managerial advancements is crucial across various sectors of economic and social activity. The swift adoption of new technologies is increasingly important as risks stemming from adverse atmospheric, environmental, and biological factors continue to rise. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic presents numerous obstacles to the innovation landscape and underscores the interconnectivity of global and national communities. The widespread use of innovation is enabling national economies to discover fresh avenues for fostering economic growth and maintaining high living standards. These developments are facilitated by the availability of effective innovation mechanisms, including technology transfer.

A potentially more promising approach is the method that obviates the need for memorizing the matrix. Instead, it suffices to compute its coefficients at each iteration of the algorithm. We can adapt the aforementioned algorithm for our specific circumstances.

An analysis of the actual ecosystem utilizing the established mathematical framework has revealed that the self-restraint function serves as a means of regulating the efficient utilization of communication channel resources. This observation suggests that it would be worthwhile to focus future research efforts on determining and solving the task of identifying the optimal type and values of the controlled variables of this function. It is noteworthy that the scientific and practical findings presented in the article were validated in the 4G ecosystem. Nonetheless, the authors posit that the theoretical findings can be adjusted to characterize the competing interaction of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and massive machine-type communication (mMTC) services in the 5G ecosystem. The authors intend to substantiate or disprove this assertion in subsequent studies.
