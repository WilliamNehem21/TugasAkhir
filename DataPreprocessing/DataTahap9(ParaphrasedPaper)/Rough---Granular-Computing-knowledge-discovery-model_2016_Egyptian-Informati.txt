The utilization of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) is crucial for addressing the challenges posed by the expanding size and complexity of databases. KDD aims to extract knowledge by identifying relationships between data attributes to make predictions. Furthermore, knowledge discovery techniques based on rule induction are particularly important in the context of growing data volumes.

The paper is organized as follows: section 2 provides a review of related work on knowledge discovery models. Section 3 outlines the structure of knowledge discovery models for the classification of medical datasets. Section 4 presents the evaluation performance measures. Section 5 describes the medical datasets used, the experimental results, and a comparison with other models. Finally, the conclusion is presented in section 6.

Rough mereology, an extension of rough set theory, is employed in various application areas within the realm of knowledge discovery. For instance, Zheng and Zhan investigated a model that utilizes granular computing to enhance the performance of rule-based classification using rough mereology. However, the model was not further extended to other classifiers, and work is ongoing to develop it based on the minimum length principle.

Badria et al. proposed a rough-based granular model that leverages the fundamental concepts of rough sets to uncover dependencies between attributes, discrete-continuous attributes, and dynamic reduct for reduction. They then generated set rules for classifying HCV.

Ding et al. introduced a comparative study between two models based on the concept of granular computing: Rough Neural Networks (RNN) and Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNN). The models were then compared to lay the groundwork for future development aimed at enhancing their performance.

Finally, the rough mereology model is presented as an extension of rough sets within the framework of granular computing, replacing the indescribability relation with the similarity relation of rough inclusion. Rough mereology is dedicated to the concept of granular computing in constructing elementary information granules. It identifies relationships between information granules and builds a granular network. This model is also applied in a case study involving HCV and CAD datasets.
