Let's consider rephrasing the ideas presented in the academic paper. The paper explores the concept of meaning as the potential to alter states of information, rather than as the conditions under which something is true. It suggests that if meaning is to be defined in terms of information change, temporal reference operates on two levels. Firstly, temporal references must describe how the world changes over time, and secondly, they must explain how information about the world changes over time.

The paper argues that while information states and sets of them are essentially non-temporal structures, English sentences are not. The past and present tenses in English sentences serve to connect the temporally varying nature of sentences to the static assertions found in information states. The paper emphasizes the need to demonstrate how, through the use of tenses, the temporally varying potential for updating sentences aligns with the temporally fixed relations in information states.

The concept of information states is further explored, with the assertion that these states consist of sets of verified and unverified assertions at a specific time (denoted as t). Over time, unverified assertions may become verified, but a verified assertion cannot become unverified.

The paper goes on to discuss the asymmetry between the past and future in terms of knowledge acquisition. It notes that while knowledge about both the past and the future is possible, the origin of information about the past typically involves a causal chain linking a past event to present knowledge, whereas information about the future is often based on extrapolation from past and present knowledge.

The distinction between verified and unverified information is then examined. Verified information typically involves a causal chain linking the information to its subject, and the verification of information about an event cannot precede the occurrence of the event when a causal chain is involved. However, there are instances, such as when discussing plans or predetermined events, where verification is not causal in origin. In these cases, a certain degree of foresight seems to apply, allowing verification of events laid out in a plan well in advance of their occurrence.

The paper concludes by introducing a formal notation to represent verified and unverified assertions within information states, clarifying the classification of assertions within these states at any given time.
