This study aims to enhance the performance of existing person re-identification systems by employing a weighted ensemble of methods. The approach combines different state-of-the-art systems utilizing various color spaces and texture and color features to describe images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that amalgamates different state-of-the-art person re-identification systems and their variations to create a more robust approach.

To demonstrate the generalizability of this approach, we validate it on well-known datasets such as caviar4reid, ias, and viper. Additionally, we evaluate the system on a new dataset named viper45, which contains 45 image pairs focusing on challenging samples with strong pose changes and similar clothing. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the base approaches used in our system and provides details of our weighted ensemble; Section 3 discusses the datasets used in our experiments; Section 4 presents the experimental results; and finally, Section 5 summarizes the significance of our work and outlines future directions.

We compare and combine different recent state-of-the-art person re-identification systems, including gbicov, sdalf, cps based on ccd, ci, and sps techniques. Moreover, we propose variants of these approaches by varying the features used for image description and employing different distance measures. Each of these state-of-the-art systems, their variants, different color spaces, distance measures, and the color and texture descriptors are detailed in this paper.

To improve the performance of each system, we explore not only the RGB color space, but also other color spaces such as YUV, HSV, HSL, and XYZ. We also employ covariance descriptors and biological feature (BIF) encoding to capture differences at different scales. We further propose methods like SDALF, which models human appearance by considering chromatic content, spatial color arrangement, and local motifs. Additionally, we employ the skeleton-based person signature (SPS) technique and evaluate approaches such as CI and CPS using our recommended parameters across different datasets. The results demonstrate noteworthy improvements over baseline algorithms.

The study also introduces the VIPER45 dataset, which serves as a tool for evaluating re-identification systems against challenging image pairs. The experimental results suggest that our proposed approach outperforms standalone systems and provides substantial improvements over baseline algorithms across various benchmark databases.
