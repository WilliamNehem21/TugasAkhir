This research focuses on creating a shape-preserving interpolation method for monotone and convex data using a rational bi-cubic function with parameters for interpolation. The method introduces data-dependent constraints on these parameters within each rectangular patch to maintain the shape of the monotone and convex data. The proposed scheme is both efficient and cost-effective, generating smooth surfaces.

Monotonicity plays a critical role in the modeling of digital-to-analog converters (DACs), analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and sensors, which are widely utilized in control system applications. Additionally, monotone quantities are important in various medical and statistical contexts, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in cancer patients, uric acid levels in patients with gout, and approximations in statistics. Convexity is prevalent in datasets from nonlinear programming and scientific applications, including design, optimal control, parameter estimation, and approximations.

A previous study by Asaturyan proposed a subdivision scheme for interpolating convex surface data. It identified rectangular patches where convexity was lost and divided them into nine sub-rectangles, applying a convexity-preserving interpolation scheme to each sub-rectangle. It was observed that changes in a sub-rectangle impacted the entire domain.

The paper addresses the challenge of interpolating monotone and convex data using a rational bi-cubic function with eight parameters in each rectangular patch. The range of these parameters is determined to maintain the shape of the data. The developed schemes of this paper are designed to handle both data and its derivatives, ensure local control on the surface, and guarantee C1 smoothness.
