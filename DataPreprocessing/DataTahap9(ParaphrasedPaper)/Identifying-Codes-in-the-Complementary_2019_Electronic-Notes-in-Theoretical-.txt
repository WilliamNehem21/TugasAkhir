Determining the minimum order of identifying codes in planar graphs with large girth is a challenging algorithmic problem[1,5]. Various studies have investigated exact values, density results, and improved upper and lower bounds for identifying codes in special graphs, especially those obtained through product operations involving simple factors like grids[2,3,4,7,8,11,10,12,13,17,20]. In this paper, we focus on studying identifying codes in the complementary prism of cycles. Additionally, the concept of locating-domination has also been explored for these types of graphs.
