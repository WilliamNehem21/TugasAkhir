This academic paper discusses the vulnerability of depth-based routing protocols to sinkhole attacks caused by depth spoofing in underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). The paper proposes an energy-efficient depth-based probabilistic routing protocol (DPR) that mitigates the adversarial effects of depth-spoofing by encouraging unqualified relay nodes to randomly forward data packets. The randomized forwarding probability is adjusted to achieve a better packet delivery ratio under depth-spoofing attacks while keeping energy consumption in check. The paper presents a simulation-based methodology for finding the optimal forwarding probability and demonstrates that the proposed DPR protocol effectively resists depth-spoofing attacks with reasonably efficient energy overhead, achieving a delivery ratio exceeding 90% under attack conditions with an energy overhead as low as 35% under normal conditions. The proposed protocol is compared with existing protocols and shown to achieve better energy efficiency, resilience efficiency, and scalability.

The paper begins by highlighting the importance of securing UWSNs due to the continuous exploitation of security vulnerabilities by adversaries for political and financial gains. Various attacks on UWSNs routing protocols are discussed, with a focus on securing the depth-based routing protocol (DBR) against sinkhole attacks. The threat of depth-spoofing attacks, stemming from the opportunistic behavior of DBR relay nodes, is identified as a key concern.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a review of relevant background and related work on depth-based routing and describes the attack model. Section 3 presents the proposed DPR protocol. Section 4 details the evaluation methodology and simulation settings. Section 5 presents the simulation results and discusses the findings. Finally, Section 6 presents the concluding remarks and outlines future research directions.

The paper also discusses existing protocols such as the energy-efficient cooperative opportunistic routing (EECOR) protocol, as well as RSAR, COSAR, and SEECR protocols developed to secure depth-based routing. Compromises and limitations of these existing protocols are identified, leading to the proposal of the DPR protocol with its non-deterministic forwarding approach to mitigate depth-spoofing attacks.

Overall, the paper highlights the potency of the proposed DPR protocol against depth-spoofing sinkhole attacks, its limited energy overhead, and its approximately double the energy efficiency compared to its main competitor, RPR. The paper suggests potential areas for future research, including dynamically adjusting the forwarding probability, considering the residual energy of each node, and incorporating a master-slave architecture within the proposed DPR protocol.
