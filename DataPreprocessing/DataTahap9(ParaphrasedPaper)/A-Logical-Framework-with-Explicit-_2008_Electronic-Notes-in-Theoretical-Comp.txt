Evidence of the statement's truth lies in the existence of a derivation 2 with a length fewer than 265536 symbols. The reader can verify this by aggregating all possible derivations with a length less than 265536 symbols and observing that one of them serves as proof of the statement. Hence, the statement holds true.
