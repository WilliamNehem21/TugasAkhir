The way in which AR visualizations impact students can be discerned through their interactions during educational activities. Student dialogue can reveal areas of focus, comprehension levels, and thoughts at different stages of the activity, offering insights into how AR experiences influence learning behaviors. By considering diverse perspectives and posing questions, researchers can gain meaningful insights into the impact of AR content on student inquiry styles.

In the realm of augmented reality for education, studies have demonstrated that AR visualizations guide student inquiry, foster collaboration, and enhance problem-solving approaches among peers. Collaborative use of AR visualizations in physics activities, for example, has been found to aid in teaching and explanation, promoting balanced contributions and diminishing leadership dominance. Additionally, AR visualizations have been shown to improve student group learning and attitudes towards problem-based learning activities, as well as support active learning and experimentation in collaborative environments. These findings underscore the potential benefits of AR visualizations in engaging students in deeper thinking and more active learning.

To explore these questions, an interactive AR system for physics education was designed, and a coding scheme was developed to measure student inquiries in relation to AR visualizations. A study measuring learning and inquiry through quantitative and qualitative methods was conducted, with the results providing insights into the impact of AR visualizations on student learning and inquiry styles.

Qualitative analysis of participant videos revealed that AR visuals can stimulate student inquiries that bridge various concepts and encourage exploration within the learning domain. Differential inquiry patterns were observed between participants using full AR and basic AR, suggesting that AR visuals may influence the depth and breadth of student inquiries.

The study findings indicate that the complexity of AR content influences learning and inquiry in remote 1-1 tutoring of electromagnetism concepts. Students exposed to higher complexity AR visualizations demonstrated increased learning, diverse inquiry styles, and greater willingness to explore and take action in the learning context compared to those using lower complexity AR applications.

This study was conducted with approval from the university's institutional review board, and the privacy of the participants was safeguarded. The data collected for this study is not available for open access and adheres to ethical guidelines.
