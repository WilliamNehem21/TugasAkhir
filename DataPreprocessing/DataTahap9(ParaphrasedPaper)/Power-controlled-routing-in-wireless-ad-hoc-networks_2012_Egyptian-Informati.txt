This research introduces a novel power control routing approach designed for wireless ad hoc networks, addressing the growing interest in integrating power control into routing protocols. The proposed method aims to decrease network energy consumption while enhancing network throughput, packet delivery ratio, and other performance metrics of ad hoc networks. The authors present an on-demand routing algorithm called Power Control Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (PC-AODV) that establishes various routing entries based on node power levels as needed, and selects the lowest power level routing for data transmission. PC-AODV employs different power control policies for transmitting data and control packets at the network and MAC layers. Simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm not only reduces average communication energy consumption, lengthening network lifetime, but also improves average end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio.

The paper also addresses the complexity of power control, with Kirousis et al. simplifying it as the assignment of transmission ranges, referred to as the Range Assignment (RA) problem, and analyzing its computational intricacies. By considering a set of points in the d-dimensional Euclidean space representing network nodes and the transmission radius of each node, the paper describes the network transmission power and defines power levels as discrete grades of node transmission power. Via simulation results and empirical evidence, the authors establish the necessity of integrating power control into routing protocols for ad hoc networks.
