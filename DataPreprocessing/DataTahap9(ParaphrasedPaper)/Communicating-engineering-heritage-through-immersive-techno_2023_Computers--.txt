The study investigates how virtual reality (VR) scenarios, developed using the Unreal Engine, can enhance the learning, interaction, and immersion experiences of museum visitors. The researchers used a one-way ANOVA approach to identify significant differences between the proposed factors. The study found that the absence of interaction in the immersive scenario led to a reduction in mean scores, resulting in a lack of constructive guidance during navigation. On the other hand, the use of gamified and narrated approaches significantly increased the mean value of the participants compared to the control group.

The paper emphasizes the growing interest of museum institutions in using immersive technologies to create meaningful and engaging experiences for visitors. It discusses how VR can provide opportunities for museums to showcase their collections in new and innovative ways, thereby expanding the range of interpretations available to the public. The paper also explores the potential of VR to preserve heritage stories by constructing detailed virtual images of physical objects and providing additional explanations about their significance.

The study focuses on the Lanchester petrol-electric car as an example of an engineering heritage object and aims to provide an informative and interactive experience for visitors using VR technology. The paper highlights the design and construction of VR experiments, as well as the recruitment of participants for the study.

The results of the study demonstrate significant differences between the immersive, narrated, and gamified scenarios, particularly in terms of the immersion factor. The paper also discusses the impact of interactivity on immersion, highlighting correlations between interaction, immersion, and learning factors in the VR scenarios.

The study aims to enhance the engagement of museum visitors by utilizing VR technology and emphasizes the importance of considering specific factors, such as gamification and storytelling strategies, to maximize visitor interaction and learning experiences. The paper also discusses technical constraints related to visual aesthetics quality and hardware capabilities in implementing VR experiences.

Finally, the paper touches upon the sense of escapism experienced by users while engaging with VR content, as well as the potential for VR to bring visitors to experience events that are challenging to replicate in traditional museum environments.
