Sentiment analysis, a type of natural language processing that detects the sentiment expressed in a text, is anticipated to be valued at $3.8 billion by the year 2025 due to its numerous practical applications in business and politics. Consequently, it has emerged as a highly active research area in recent years.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses previous research on sentiment analysis in the context of Arabic. Section 3 outlines the proposed approach and model architecture, while Section 4 presents the experiments conducted, including preprocessing steps, experimental settings, baselines, results, and discussion. Finally, Section 5 offers the conclusion and suggests avenues for future work.

Afooz et al. compared their ensemble model, incorporating xgboost (xg), gradient boosting (gb), adaboost (ada), and random forest (rf), with machine learning classifiers on Arabic text sourced from YouTube comments. They found that SVM, followed by linear regression (lr), achieved the highest performance accuracy (77.00%).

Another study applied the SVM, NB, and KNN algorithms, along with three tools (sentistrength, socialmention, and aopi), to a collection of 3,015 Arabic opinions obtained from the domains of food, sports, and weather. SVM was found to be the most effective (76.33%), and the aopi tool outperformed the two free online tools.

Elfaik et al. constructed a model from a large Arabic journal corpus and achieved an accuracy of 92.00%. Subsequently, they utilized a bidirectional LSTM model on multiple datasets, with accuracies ranging from 75.85% to 91.82%.

Regarding the machine learning classifiers, it was observed that SVM was the most commonly used, while LR exhibited the highest performance. However, ML models present three primary challenges: susceptibility to noise, difficulty in selecting the perfect kernel, and slow training when dealing with large datasets.

The paper also delves into word embeddings, highlighting their ability to handle word polysemy, metaphorical or hidden meanings, and differences in word meanings. It emphasizes the use of word embeddings in a neural network model to alleviate these challenges and enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis.

The study also introduces the Multi-domain Arabic Sentiment Corpus (MASC4) for Moroccan Arabic (MOR), which consists of 8,860 ratings gathered from various sources.

In addition, the research discusses the implications of Arabic dialects on sentiment analysis, revealing that the proposed methods in the classification tasks were affected by vocabulary differences and associations with Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in the results obtained.

Finally, the research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61877050) and the Open Project Fund of Shaanxi Province Key Lab of Satellite and Terrestrial Network Technology, Shaanxi Province Financed Projects for Scientific and Technological Activities of Overseas Students (Grant No. 202160002).
