The aim of tasks focused on achievement is to enhance an individual's abilities relative to a standard level of competency (Heckhausen, 1977) in order to avoid demonstrating a lack of capability (Tanaka & Yamauchi, 2001). This concept of achievement motivation (CAM) is similar to self-efficacy in that an individual's belief in their own ability can lead to positive or negative learning outcomes. CAM, much like self-efficacy, is also influenced by the specific characteristics of the task being undertaken (Bandura, 1977). There are variations among students in terms of their motivation to achieve, as well as differences among educational activities in the challenges they present. When there is alignment between an individual and the characteristics of a task, CAM is expected to influence behavior in task-related performance situations (Bipp, Steinmayr, & Spinath, 2008; Richardson & Abraham, 2009).

A questionnaire on current motivation (QCM) is an 18-item tool designed to assess four distinct factors of current achievement motivation in specific performance situations using a 7-point Likert scale and has been established as a predictor of performance in complex problem-solving tasks. Previous research has demonstrated the validity and reliability of the QCM (Vollmeyer & Rheinberg, 2006), as well as the absence of measurement bias in the instrument (Freund, Kuhn, & Holling, 2011).

The SEAR test instrument is a 9-item multiple choice assessment of electrophilic aromatic substitution chemistry achievement developed by the authors. It was administered both before and after the study. The items on the instrument underwent a two-step validation approach to ensure their validity and reliability.

Ethical clearance was obtained in accordance with the regulations of the University of East Anglia's (UEA) School of Science Research Ethics Committee, with informed consent obtained from all participants. Anonymity and confidentiality of the collected data were ensured through the use of study codes and strict adherence to data protection principles.

During the study, each group participated in only one worked example activity to eliminate carryover effects. The pre-test stage included the administration of the SEAR test instrument and QCM in week 2 of the academic semester. A teaching session was conducted in week 3, followed by the worked examples activity and completion of the CLS in week 4. The post-test stage in week 5 involved the SEAR test instrument, semi-structured interviews, and discussions related to electrophilic aromatic substitution.

The design of the activity was based on cognitive load theory principles, aiming to optimize intrinsic cognitive load (ICL) and minimize extraneous cognitive load (ECL) by adhering to the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML) and principles related to the spatial and temporal contiguity of information.

Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in ICL, ECL, or GERL between groups, with no expertise reversal effect observed. Reliability in the analysis was ensured through negotiated agreement and the use of Krippendorff's alpha. Limitations of the study include the relatively small sample size and the absence of a delayed post-test for evaluating long-term retention.

Informed consent, voluntary participation, participant withdrawal rights, and data anonymity were strictly adhered to in accordance with ethical standards. The authors declare no conflict of interest and affirm that all procedures involving human participants were conducted in compliance with institutional research committee ethical standards.
