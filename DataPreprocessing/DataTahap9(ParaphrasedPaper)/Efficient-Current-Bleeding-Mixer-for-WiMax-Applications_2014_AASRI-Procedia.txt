The increasing demand for secure, high-speed, high-data rate communication links, preferably accessible through laptops and smartphones via wireless connections, is driving interest in WiMAX as a promising technology. WiMAX systems can cover long distances with fewer base stations compared to other wireless technologies, resulting in lower maintenance, operation, and management costs. Therefore, a new current bleeding block (R1 and R2) has been added to M1 and M2 to increase the conversion gain by boosting the current in the RF stage. This current should be sufficient to operate M1 and M2 in the saturation region while reducing the current in the LO stage, thereby causing a drop in voltage across the load resistors R6 and R7.
