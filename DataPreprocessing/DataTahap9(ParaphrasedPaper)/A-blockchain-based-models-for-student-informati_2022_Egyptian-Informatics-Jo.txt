Blockchain technology has gained widespread popularity in recent years, and one of its significant applications is in securing student information systems (SIS). This is due to blockchain's features such as sharing readiness and visibility, which are crucial for any SIS. Transactions within a blockchain, such as course registrations and exam marks, are akin to financial transactions, and once committed to the system, they cannot be removed. A transaction can only be reversed by submitting another reverse transaction, and any change in the content of a block invalidates the entire chain of blocks due to the hashing of information within the blockchain. Each block contains a list of transactions, a cryptographic hash of the transaction list, version, and other necessary values for the blockchain, including the hash value of the previous block.

The proposed model enhances security using hashing and decentralized data storage, with the information provided by the university being accessible to all interested parties. The immutability, sensitivity, and secure storage of records in the blockchain have facilitated the effective implementation of the student information system. A linked list of blockchains can record various data, including birth certificates, social security cards, student loans, and transactional data like course registrations and exam marks. The SIS roles can have several combinations, and the nodes in the system can be categorized as full nodes, which hold the entire blockchain, and light-weight nodes, which hold a partial list of blocks. A higher number of nodes in the system leads to greater decentralization.

Transactions in the SIS context typically do not involve miners, and a safe approach is to exclude miners from a blockchain tailored for SIS by allowing only known nodes to create blocks. While stateless data remains essential, it may be acceptable to retain them in a traditional system with a super admin who signs a confidentiality contract. Transactional data, on the other hand, are highly critical and can only be reversed by submitting another reverse transaction.

A modified block remains unconfirmed until the consensus protocol completes its work. For instance, if a transaction is sent by node A, it must be verified by the nearest full node according to the SIS rules. The verified block is then published to other node peers for confirmation and acceptance. Each transaction contains information identifying the creating node and the time of creation, and each block has a cryptographic hash of the previous block and the transaction data, ensuring that the data on the blockchain cannot be tampered with after achieving consensus.

The paper presents three different blockchain models suitable for organizations of varying sizes, eliminating the need for miners by utilizing consensus protocols to verify and add transactions. The models depend on trusted and well-identified nodes, with infrastructure tailored for large-scale data processing in model 3.

Overall, the use of blockchain technology offers a highly secure and reliable approach to managing a student information system, simplifying data storage and sharing through decentralized storage, and providing a trustworthy model for accessing and storing data.
