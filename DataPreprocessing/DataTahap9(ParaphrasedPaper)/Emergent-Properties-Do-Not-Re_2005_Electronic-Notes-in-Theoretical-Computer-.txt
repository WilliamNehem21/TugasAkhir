The concept of refinement is typically employed to achieve a development that is demonstrably correct from an abstract specification. However, emergent systems pose a unique challenge for achieving demonstrably correct development due to the discontinuity between global and local system descriptions. In this position paper, we explore some aspects of this challenge in relation to the traditional model of refinement.

We utilize the example of a cellular automaton (CA) generating gliders as a starting point for considering development issues in emergent systems. The paper begins with a brief review of classical refinement, followed by a description of a model of emergence using a CA. We address issues related to the specification of emergent systems and examine the meanings of refinement for emergent systems. This leads us to explore the reasons for the mismatches between classical refinement and emergent systems development. We then consider how emergent systems development might proceed and where it could potentially incorporate ideas from classical refinement.

When describing a system, the behaviors and interactions of low-level component agents are expressed in language C, while the high-level global behavior is expressed in language A. If there is a fundamental discontinuity between these languages, the system displays emergence. For instance, the individual agents in a flock may be described as moving towards a locally perceived centroid, whereas the global behavior of interest is the velocity and size of the entire flock. This discontinuity in description language poses a challenge to conventional refinement.

We model a CA in separate components, namely a cell (with a state, update rules, and a set of neighbors) and the representation of the collection of cells. This separation of components brings the CA closer to other forms of emergent systems, in which the representation is clearly separable from the active entities.

The non-determinism of the glider specification is reduced by refining the region in a way that facilitates representation of movement, such as by introducing something relative to which motion would be perceived. Finalization techniques are applied to each sub-computation within the continuous emergent system, ensuring that the new state is passed to the representation.

In expressing the components of a CA, each level (system, representation, cell) is seen as a derivative of the next, with the representation introducing a multi-dimensional space, and the system introducing the time dimension.

We acknowledge that classical refinement is often a process of trial and error, despite attempts to portray it as a clean and formal process. Retrenchment recognizes that clean refinement is rarely possible in reality, while forward-and-backward refinement to an invented intermediate state provides a trial-and-error approach in the absence of a direct route from abstract specification to concrete model. The authors have also explored various refinement patterns, template-based refinement, and evolutionary approaches to proof and refinement.
