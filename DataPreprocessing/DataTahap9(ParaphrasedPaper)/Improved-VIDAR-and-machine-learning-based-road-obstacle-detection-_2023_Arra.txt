Before defogging through the refinement network, the vehicle in defogged images can be effectively detected using an end-to-end training spatial attention fusion with a deep learning detection network proposed by Chang et al. The neural network was trained by converting radar points into images. M and Yamamoto proposed a model based on a flat surface to estimate obstacle height while considering unevenness, and Jung et al. extracted feature points using the Harris detector and classified background and foreground using epipolar geometry. These methods are based on changes in pixels to achieve target detection, resulting in more precise detection and more generated feature points.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the principle of the improved Vidar, Section 3 provides a brief overview of the improved Vidar and machine learning-based obstacle detection method, Section 4 presents and analyzes the performance results of the proposed method, and Section 5 draws conclusions and discusses future work.

In emergency situations, unknown obstacle detection is a necessary supplement to machine learning-based obstacle detection. For unknown obstacle detection methods based on motion compensation, the conventional feature extraction and matching method is both time-consuming and space-consuming. Although the MSER-based image region matching method proposed by Papers 37 and 38 can effectively detect unknown types of obstacles, the detection speed can be increased.
