The paper discusses the concept of generalized closure sets within the context of topological systems, where the closed-set system is seen as a special case of this generalized closure system. It also explores applications of the closure system in formal concept analysis, matroid and anti-matroid/learning space, and its significance in category theory and domain theory.

In this work, the authors provide a comprehensive examination of the generalized operators, presenting an axiomatic system for them. They demonstrate how the generalized closure, interior, and exterior operators can be interconnected, and generalize the boundary, derived set, and co-derived set operators from the topological system to the closure system, preserving their relationships with the closure, interior, and exterior operators.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews various axiomatizations of topological set operators and highlights important properties of the boundary and derived set operators. In Section 3, the authors generalize the boundary, derived set, and co-derived set operators from the generalized closure, interior, and exterior operators. The paper concludes with a summary and discussion in Section 4.

The generalization of the complete suite of topological operators allows for extending topological semantics to closure systems beyond the topological context, which is particularly relevant for non-topological closure systems such as matroid/independent system and anti-matroid/accessible system. The results also have significance for axiomatic operators on lattices, as closure systems correspond to complete lattices, shedding new light on the interplay of topology, lattice, and logic.
