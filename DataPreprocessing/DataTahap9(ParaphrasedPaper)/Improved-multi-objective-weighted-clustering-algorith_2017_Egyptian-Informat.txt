In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the network structure and node communication method play a crucial role in determining energy consumption. Hierarchical structures, such as clustering, are commonly favored in flat networks for their reliability and energy efficiency. Clustering, as a prominent hierarchical architecture, has been proposed early on as a method for achieving energy-efficient operation in WSNs.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses related works, while Section 3 first emphasizes the significance of the SGA algorithm in minimizing mission and communication costs simultaneously. It then provides detailed explanations of the different phases of the IMOWCA algorithm. The final part of this section demonstrates the use of our BGA algorithm to optimize the positioning of base stations and balance energy consumption within formed clusters. Section 4 presents numerical results, possible comparisons, various analyses, and performance evaluations of the proposed algorithms, leading to the conclusion and future directions of the work.

In 2014, a notable survey of WSN algorithms highlighted important clustering approaches, including LEACH, HEED, TEEN, APTEEN, and EECS. In addition, recent advances in LEACH and neural network-based clustering algorithms were discussed. Furthermore, a game-theoretic model for transmission load assignment in WSNs, focusing on cluster-based and surveillance-oriented sensor networks, was presented.

Children are transferred to a new population P' and replaced, in whole or in part, by children from previous generations. This transition of individuals continues from one generation to the next until the stopping criterion is met. After conducting numerous simulations, the value e=0.0001 was chosen as the stopping criterion for the evaluation step.

The superior performance of the BGA algorithm compared to SAA can be attributed to the advanced techniques of genetic algorithms, which have transitioned from basic to applied research. Unlike SAA, which is heavily dependent on the initial solution for convergence, BGA can start with any initial population after chromosome encoding and perform a global search to find the best solution. The BGA further evolves the population by selecting the best individuals and introduces possible mutations through crossover operations.

The effectiveness of the IMOWCA algorithm is supported by the introduction of different metrics (e.g., ddi, dci, and dmi for each sensor) in the optimization function. The use of multi-objective optimization allows IMOWCA to consider critical parameters such as mission cost, communication cost, and sensor-to-BS distance. Furthermore, by leveraging clustering, IMOWCA selects only the best-performing sensors in terms of power to communicate with the base station, contributing to energy efficiency in WSNs.
