The paper demonstrates that there is a correspondence between the set of c-ideals and certain structures, and this has implications in two main areas. First, when a frame is represented by generators and relations (in other words, it is the lindenbaum algebra for a propositional geometric theory), the presentation can be transformed into site form, enabling the definition of sup-lattice homomorphisms from the frame. This is especially valuable in the context of quantales and their modules, as these are sup-lattices but not frames in general. Second, the paper generalizes the coverage theorem to provide presentations for structures other than frames, specifically quantales and their modules.

The paper also discusses the relationship between different structures using forgetful functors, all of which have a left adjoint known as a free algebra functor. It is worth noting that some of the relationships are between finitary theories, for which non-trivial coverage theorems already exist. However, the main theorem (Theorem 4.4) of the paper focuses on dcpos and the coverage theorems for the central square.
