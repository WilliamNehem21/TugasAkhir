This paper delves into the provability logic and proof-theory of the paraconsistent arithmetic system known as PRACI, which is based on the paraconsistent predicate calculus CI. This system extends the propositional C-system CI, introduced by Carnielli et al. As highlighted in the presentation of the theory PCA, we suggest paraconsistent arithmetic systems that are essentially novel in comparison to most existing paraconsistent arithmetical theories in the previous relevant literature. In our view, paraconsistent reasoning, intuitionistic reasoning, and classical reasoning can be viewed as distinct approaches for examining the same fundamental mathematical entities. Specifically, we introduce paraconsistent reasoning about standard natural numbers, denoting each natural number m as the term s...s(0), with m occurrences of s on the left. These terms of the form m are referred to as numerals, and we will denote them briefly as 1, 2, and so on, as long as it does not lead to confusion.
