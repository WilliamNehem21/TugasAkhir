The use of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been crucial for the autonomy of various robots, including robot cars and autonomous underwater vehicles. Recently, there has been a growing interest in applying SLAM to smaller and medium-sized devices such as mobile manipulators, flying robots, and hand-held devices, due to their flexibility, lower cost, and promising applications. These devices also require SLAM to enable long-term operation. However, there are challenges in managing the map at each session without discarding all historical experience. To address these challenges, the authors proposed a framework that includes a multi-session SLAM component to build maps over time, as well as a map management component to maintain a compact map that tracks changes in the environment.

Previous studies have focused mainly on single-session environment mapping using vision or planar laser sensor methods. However, there has been less attention given to the challenges posed by low dynamics in multi-session scenarios. The authors noted that existing methods using vision or planar laser sensors had limitations when applied to RGBD sensors, which provide depth information and capture geometric changes more effectively. As a result, the authors proposed a method combining multi-session SLAM and graph management. The multi-session SLAM component utilizes a graph model to fuse information from previous and current sessions, while the graph management component keeps the graph model up to date and complexity under control.

The authors also introduced a map management component to address changes in the environment during a session. This component uses a camera projection model and connected component detection to identify differences between maps generated by scans from previous and current sessions. Additionally, the authors proposed a method to reduce the number of poses if the number of in-dated scans exceeds a certain threshold, thus maintaining computational complexity despite the presence of redundant scans.

The paper then discussed how the proposed framework was applied to real-world datasets and outlined the evaluation process. The results showed the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying redundant and out-of-date scans, as well as its efficiency in reducing the number of poses while maintaining map coverage. The paper also highlighted areas for potential future improvements, such as addressing failures in out-of-date scan identification and increasing the efficiency of map optimization in dynamic environments.

Overall, the paper presented a framework for multi-session SLAM in low dynamic environments, addressing challenges related to map management, graph pruning, and environment changes. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework through evaluation using real-world datasets and suggested potential areas for future research and improvements.
