The academic paper details the development of models for semi-active suspension systems using a variable damping coefficient limit. The models were created in Simulink, with the fuzzy logic controller integrated using the Fuzzy Toolbox. Section 2 covers the modeling of systems and road disturbance profile, while Section 3 outlines the design approach for the fuzzy logic controller. Section 4 discusses the simulation and results, including a parametric analysis based on statistics. The paper concludes with Section 5, which provides a detailed summary of the findings.
