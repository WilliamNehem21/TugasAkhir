The use of Lagrangean relaxation (LR), as described in prior research [14,15], was initially applied in an exact algorithm for the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and later found success in solving various other problems, as noted in sources [7,12,9]. Further details about the LR technique and additional references are available in sources [13,23,28], providing comprehensive information on its application.

In essence, LR utilizes principles from duality theory [18,27] to address a set of complex constraints in a given problem. By converting these constraints into the objective function, evaluated with Lagrangean multipliers, the original problem is transformed into a relaxed problem. This relaxed problem often generates sub-problems that can be solved more easily than the original one.

The feasible region of the problem is defined by constraints (2), (3), and others, including integrality and non-negativity constraints, represented by the set x. It is assumed that the problem would be easily solved without constraints (2).

The scope and scale of the problem are determined by the planning and discretization horizons, which directly impact the data volume and problem dimension. In the context of a parallel environment, the authors proposed a parallelization approach for the LR method discussed in this paper, which features a master-slave model implemented on a cluster of networked workstations to solve the sub-problem CG. This approach differs from the one presented in a previous proposal.
