In recent times, amid the rise of various e-life domains such as e-commerce, e-democracy, and e-government, e-voting has become a key focus of ongoing research. Traditional voting methods reliant on paper ballots and identification are gradually being phased out, as they present vulnerabilities that can compromise the integrity of election outcomes, as exemplified by the 2000 United States presidential election. Consequently, there is a growing demand for electronic voting systems, with several prototypes currently undergoing testing in different countries.

An analysis of electronic election systems offered by various vendors in the United States is presented in the paper. Many of these commercial systems rely on security through obscurity, a widely discredited approach to protection. While these systems make use of cryptography, they often do so in an incorrect manner, leaving open avenues for unauthorized access.

The paper details important solutions for electronic election schemes in Section 2, followed by an introduction to the cryptographic primitives employed in the proposed protocol, namely zero-knowledge and secure secret sharing schemes. Section 4 provides a brief overview of the authentication scheme that offers revocable anonymity, serving as an inspiration for the new solution. Section 5 provides a detailed description of the developed protocol, with the subsequent section offering an in-depth analysis of the protocol's computational and communication complexity, as well as its security aspects. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential enhancements to the proposed solution.

The concept of mixnets, analogous to anonymous channels for the anonymous distribution of voting credentials to users, is explored. A mix serves as a trusted party that randomly distributes messages to users, preventing eavesdroppers from tracing message senders or recipients. Another concept, DC-nets (Dining Cryptographers networks), is presented as an alternative to anonymous broadcast channels.

Further practical approaches to electronic voting systems are being developed or tested in Switzerland, such as internet voting systems from Geneva and Neuchatel, as well as a mobile voting system from Zurich. Additionally, a prototype developed in Portugal, known as REVs, utilizing blind signatures and based on the EVOX system, is described in the paper.

The paper also introduces a protocol designed to provide an efficient method of anonymous authentication for users and service providers, with provisions for the revocation of user anonymity by service providers in collaboration with the organization. The protocol involves at least five key parties: a trusted third party (TTP), an organization (O), a trusted authority within the organization (TA), a service provider (SP), and a user (U).

Assumptions regarding the trustworthiness of various parties involved are discussed, with specifications on their roles and responsibilities in ensuring the integrity and security of the voting process. The paper also tackles the efficiency, soundness, robustness, and scalability of the proposed scheme, outlining its practicality and potential for further cryptographic enhancements.
