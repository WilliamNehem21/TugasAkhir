Extensive research has been focused on the multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP). However, little attention has been given to the issues where preemption is allowed. This paper addresses the preemptive multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (P-MRCPSP) with the aim of minimizing the project makespan while allowing mode changeability after preemption. This problem extends the conventional MRCPSP and is a more realistic model. A binary integer programming formulation is proposed for the problem, which is proven to be NP-hard, necessitating the use of the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to obtain an optimal or satisfactory solution. The proposed algorithm's performance is evaluated on 480 test problems, comparing objective function and computational times. The results indicate that the algorithm is efficient and effective, and demonstrate that mode change significantly improves the optimal makespan of the project.

In traditional MRCPSP and P-MRCPSP, it is assumed that activities assigned to modes cannot change during project execution. This assumption has limitations, which makes it important to consider problems with permitted mode change. This paper contributes to the field in four ways: firstly, it develops a binary integer programming formulation for the preemptive multi-mode project scheduling problem (P-MRCPSP-MC) to minimize project makespan while accounting for resource constraints and precedence relations, allowing for mode changeability after preemption. This model has not been previously addressed in the literature. Secondly, it presents an efficient meta-heuristic solution based on SA due to the NP-hardness of the problem. Thirdly, it analyzes the effectiveness of the proposed SA for P-MRCPSP-MC. Lastly, it investigates the impact of mode changeability on project makespan.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the problem, Section 3 explains the steps of the algorithm to solve the problem, Section 4 presents the computational results, and Section 5 contains the conclusions. An SA algorithm is proposed to solve P-MRCPSP-MC, where an efficient dynamic heuristic algorithm is implemented to construct a schedule and exact solutions obtained from LINGO 11 are considered for comparison.

SA is a random search method based on a Monte Carlo iterative strategy and has been successfully applied to various difficult combinatorial optimization problems. It starts by generating an initial solution and initializing the temperature parameter, and at each iteration, a solution is randomly created in the neighborhood of the current solution. The algorithm is controlled by a cooling schedule, and the probability of accepting uphill moves is influenced by the temperature and the difference in objective functions. The choice of an appropriate cooling schedule is crucial for the algorithm's performance. The algorithm does not use the history of the search process, which is one of the reasons why it may be outperformed by other meta-heuristics.

In the proposed SA, the mode assignment is done by comparing the realized ratio of work to resources with the work-resource balancing representation. An initial solution is created based on the latest finish time, and the SA algorithm's parameters are tuned using Taguchi experimental design. The algorithm's performance is compared with LINGO 11, and it is shown to efficiently solve the project scheduling problem.

In conclusion, the paper investigates the preemptive multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem with permitted mode change and proposes an SA algorithm to solve it. The results demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency and the positive effect of mode changeability on project makespan. Further research is suggested to explore mode change concepts for other extensions of multi-mode project scheduling problems.
