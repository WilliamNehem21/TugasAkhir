This academic paper discusses the challenges of creating and analyzing transistor-level models for digital circuits. The paper highlights the complexities of error diagnosis and the occurrence of bus contention in such models. It then introduces the path backtrace algorithm for error diagnosis and the complementation algorithm for identifying error locations. The paper concludes by demonstrating the effectiveness of these algorithms in reducing debugging time in current verification methodologies.
