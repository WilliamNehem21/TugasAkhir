This study investigates the complexity of sandpile prediction problems on various classes of directed graphs, with a particular focus on low-dimensional directed lattices. The paper presents upper and lower bounds for these problems, employing an approach centered around the analysis of reachability problems related to sandpiles.

Consider the class of planar sandpile digraphs. By utilizing the same reduction as presented in theorem 3.9, we can demonstrate that the planar restriction of mcv p (abbreviated as mpcv p) is nc1-reducible to spr[]. It is established in the reference that mpcv p is l-hard under quantifier-free reductions, and hence l-hard under nc1-reductions.

To provide a proof, let (g, s, t) be an instance of reach(planar). From g, an undirected planar graph gu is derived by disregarding the orientations of its edges. Subsequently, a center node is added to each face of g, and cgu is employed to identify the faces of gu. The process involves visiting nodes and utilizing edges along a single walk to form a face. By applying this procedure to any pair (v, e), all faces of g can be computed.

For a given face f of g, a new node vf is added, and for a node u lying on the border of f, the edge (u, vf) is introduced. The resultant graph hg is obtained from g by adding a center-sink node to each face and connecting these nodes to the borders of their corresponding faces, with the edges being directed from the border to the center. It is established that (g, s, t) reach(planar) if and only if (hg, s, t) reach(). This construction of hg yields a planar sandpile graph, with each center serving as a sink node, and any node either being a sink or capable of reaching at least one center-sink in one step.

Two types of intervals are identified:
1. Type 1: An interval i2 in the range of n+1 to 2n is such that stt(g1+ei2) takes the value 0 outside i2 and the value 1 within i2, with a length of n+2.
2. Type 2: An interval ij in the range of n+1 to 2n, with x being a member of ij such that gj takes the value 0 outside ij and the value 1 at x, where x is an element of ij and gj(x)=0, with a length of n+j+1.
