Remote sensing offers cost-effective and often openly accessible data for exploration purposes. Various remote sensing platforms, including satellite-based systems, are being utilized for diverse applications. From a data-centric perspective that transcends disciplinary boundaries, modern and high-quality remote sensing data are abundant and machine-readable, with the velocity necessary to classify as big data. These data play a crucial role in data-centric laboratories that depend on the timely availability of geoscientific data. Additionally, remote sensing data provide broad spatial and temporal coverage.

In a study where spatial discrepancy between sentinel data and geochemical data hindered spatial data fusion, landsat data were employed for spatial alignment optimization before leveraging higher-resolution sentinel data for predictive modeling. The decision to use multispectral data over hyperspectral data was driven by their higher spatial resolution, which maximized the volume of training data and avoided exacerbating the curse of dimensionality associated with the increased number of bands present in hyperspectral data.

Certain bands with lower resolutions were excluded, and the remote sensing data were pre-processed using rasterio and geemap Python libraries to perform radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, and noise removal. Radiometric correction was particularly crucial for mineral exploration and lithological classification to minimize pixel error in spectral data and optimize images for radiance, reflectance, or brightness temperatures. The remote sensing data were then processed using the FLAASH method to correct wavelengths in the visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared ranges, converting spectrometer radiance data to reflectance data.

Integration of geochemical data, specifically gold concentrations, with remote sensing data was essential for predictive modeling, necessitating data fusion to create paired features-and-label format data. The fused data were used for tasks such as lithological mapping.

In a case study involving the characterization of a resource model for gold concentrations in selected areas, it was observed that there are non-trivial spatial relationships between band amplitudes and gold grades, with detailed variations being nonlinear and potentially counterintuitive.

The study also highlighted the importance of understanding algorithmic behavior over dissimilar terrains to the training data, particularly in remote settings where manual verification of physical locations is not always feasible. This is crucial for ensuring the representativeness of training data in inaccessible areas, especially when algorithms are expected to extrapolate beyond the numerical ranges covered by the training data.
