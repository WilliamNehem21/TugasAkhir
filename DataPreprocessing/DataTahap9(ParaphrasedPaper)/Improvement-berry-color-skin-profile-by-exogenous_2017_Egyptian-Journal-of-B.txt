The research focused on the impact of various plant growth regulators, such as abscisic acid, auxins, cytokinins, ethylene, and gibberellic acid, on the development and ripening of grape skins. These hormones play different roles at different stages of vine and berry development and are involved in regulating growth and ripening, which can also affect coloration.

The firmness and separation force of berries were measured using specific equipment, and factors such as berry shattering percentage, rachis browning index, water loss percentage, and color were also recorded. Analysis of the results indicated that physical quality attributes of the berries were influenced differently. For example, it is possible that the application of B12 can control water loss during the shelf life of the berries. Additionally, B12 treatment may lead to an increase in the wax layer on the surface of the berries, which acts as a protective barrier against dehydration. Furthermore, the antioxidants present in B12 may play a role in scavenging active oxygen species during shelf life and help maintain the proper function of cell membranes in the berries.

The study also observed that high B12 treatments had an impact on the appearance and physiological state of the stem and pedicel of the berries, possibly by protecting cell membranes from lipid peroxidation and reducing water loss and berry shattering percentages.

Changes in the levels of b-carotene and total anthocyanin content during shelf life were also noted. It was observed that the synthesis of b-carotene and total anthocyanin content increased up to the second day of shelf life and then decreased gradually over time, potentially as a result of the activation of metabolic processes due to high B12 concentration. This increase in total anthocyanin content may be related to the activation of precursors responsible for increasing anthocyanin levels, while the degradation of chlorophyll may be linked to berry senescence and deterioration during shelf life.
