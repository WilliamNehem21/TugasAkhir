For more than 2000 years in China, the medicinal properties of the root bark of tree peonies have been utilized, being included in over 1000 traditional Chinese prescriptions as a principal raw material. The active chemical components have found extensive application in cosmetics and healthy food products, leading to an increasing demand for high-quality tree peony root bark in the market [1-4]. 

In China, specific medicinal cultivars of tree peonies, which have been developed through long-term artificial selection, are cultivated on a large scale in key production regions. The major production areas for tree peony root bark in China include the provinces of Anhui, Hunan, and Shandong, as well as the municipality of Chongqing, each hosting distinct medicinal cultivars of tree peonies.
