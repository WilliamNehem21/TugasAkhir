The traditional educational institutions and newly established online or hybrid educational organizations in the Middle East are in the early stages of encouraging students and parents to accept and adapt to e-learning. Different countries and universities within the region have achieved varying levels of success in this regard. This paper provides an overview of the current situation of e-learning in the Middle East, including the drivers and barriers to e-learning, different types of e-learning initiatives, efforts to overcome challenges, and a case study of ongoing developments in Saudi Arabia.

The adoption of e-learning in the Middle East has been slow, largely due to concerns over internet censorship and low internet penetration rates. However, recent research suggests a high level of approval for e-learning among both faculty and students in the region. Specific country-based research has also highlighted the benefits of e-learning in the Middle East, such as improved performance of students using e-learning materials compared to traditional methods.

Challenges to the adoption of e-learning in the Middle East include limited access to online educational material in Arabic and concerns about the potential negative impact of the internet on society. Additionally, institutions of higher education in the region have adopted three main models of e-learning: virtual e-learning, hybrid e-learning, and traditional university e-learning.

Notable e-learning initiatives in the Middle East include the Mediterranean Virtual University, the Knowledge International University, and the Arab Open University. Efforts are also underway to establish a national center for e-learning and distance learning to support educational processes in tertiary institutes throughout the region.

While the adoption of e-learning has been slow in the Middle East, recent economic growth in the region has led to increased willingness among governments to address the challenges in the educational system. Efforts to integrate technology into early education and to increase awareness and usability of e-learning technology are underway, along with initiatives to improve faculty perception of e-learning and establish regulations for e-learning and distance learning.
