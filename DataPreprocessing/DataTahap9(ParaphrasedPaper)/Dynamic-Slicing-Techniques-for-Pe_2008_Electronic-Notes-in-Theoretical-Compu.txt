A petri net is a type of directed bipartite graph that consists of places (represented by circles) and transitions (represented by bars or rectangles). The edges of the graph form arcs, which are labeled with a positive integer known as weight. These arcs connect places to transitions and vice versa. The state of the system is represented by assigning non-negative integers, known as markings, to places, which are shown graphically by adding tokens to the places. The dynamic behavior of the system is simulated by changes in the markings, which are carried out by the firing of transitions. The process of firing transitions in a petri net represents the dynamic behavior of the system.

When analyzing a marked petri net using a simulation tool, such as in the case of debugging, an initial marking can be useful. For example, if an erroneous state is reached where some places have an incorrect number of tokens, it is important to extract the subset of places and transitions that may contribute erroneously to the places of interest. This allows the user to locate the bug more easily.

Lastly, obtaining a subset of the petri net, denoted as n'=(p',t',f'), involves finding the intersection of places and transitions (p' and t') and the restriction of arcs over p' and t'. This subset, known as the slice, helps in analyzing the behavior of the petri net.
