The approach presented in this paper is akin to the synthesis of discrete controllers using temporal logic and control-d system. However, while the former approach only generates controllers that can disable transitions in the underlying system, leading to the eventual failure of specified CTL formulas, it does not address liveness properties. In contrast, the approach proposed in this paper not only produces controllers that perform disabling, but also enables buffering of events for later use in protocol communication. For instance, in the synconsumer example, the generated converter facilitates communication between a producer and a slave, ensuring that paths leading to data loss are never reached. Furthermore, the last three results involve well-known nusmv examples that have been modified to create a mismatch. It is important to note that the "size" entry in the second column for the final two results refers to the combined size of the system (size of p1 || p2) for these examples.
