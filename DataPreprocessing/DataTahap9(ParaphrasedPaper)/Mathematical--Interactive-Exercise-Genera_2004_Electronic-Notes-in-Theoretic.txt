Creating content for any system is a time-consuming task, typically done in a format that makes it difficult, if not impossible, to reuse. The development of appropriate specifications, such as IMS QTI, aims to facilitate the exchange of questions, tests, and activities among educators and promote interoperability among different learning management systems. However, QTI was not originally designed with mathematics in mind and fails to address several significant issues encountered by authors of mathematical activities, such as the complexity of activities, the use of multiple notations and mathematical expressions, and the handling of accuracy and precision in mathematical entities beyond simple numbers or strings.

Thankfully, representations such as OpenMath, MathML, and OMDoc provide support for publishing mathematics and facilitate the delivery, reuse, and exchange of mathematical expressions. In particular, OMDoc addresses some of the limitations of QTI by not only representing mathematical entities but also providing structures for the meaning of the document itself, thus enabling machine-understandable mathematical documentsâ€”a crucial capability for increasingly adaptive and intelligent systems.

It is important to note that proposing a new standard is not the authors' intention, as that would involve unnecessary replication. Rather, the aim is to stimulate discussions with other stakeholders to establish a common structure that allows for the transformation of content from one format to another without loss of functionality.

The paper also outlines the type of response expected for items, with consideration for exercises where the user is expected to provide more than a simple answer. Furthermore, it introduces the <response> element and its attributes, which are used to match identified parts of the text and replace them with interactive elements like blanks or combo boxes.

The lack of a standard for mathematical expressions means that common programming expression syntax is currently used. However, it is anticipated that MathML or OpenMath will be used more widely in the future to define these expressions.

The paper emphasizes the need for a suitable way to represent variables, and stresses the importance of establishing a standard for representing them in order to facilitate discussions and reach a general format that promotes the exchange of questions.

The authors acknowledge that presenting all the details of the information model in the paper is beyond its scope at this preliminary phase. They showcase examples and initiate discussions with the hope of inspiring further collaboration with interested parties to develop a shared format. For example, they suggest that the exercise description module of OMDoc could benefit from the ideas proposed in the paper.

The paper also highlights the developments in QTI and advocates for the incorporation of the issues raised in the paper to enable the transformation, if not exchange, of exercises between systems. In particular, it stresses the need to support mathematical notation and the use of variables for randomizing questions in order to prevent semantic reduction and make further authoring and maintenance possible.

Additionally, the paper emphasizes the commonalities between the needs of interactive exercises involving the manipulation and evaluation of mathematical input and those of other systems. It briefly demonstrates an example of communication with a computer algebra system but suggests that similar communication could be achieved with other intelligent systems or automated provers to check for student errors and provide adaptive feedback.
