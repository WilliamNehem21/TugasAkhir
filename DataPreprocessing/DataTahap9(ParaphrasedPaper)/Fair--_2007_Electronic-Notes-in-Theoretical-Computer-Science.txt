This academic paper presents a conservative extension of the standard fair testing concept by contrasting existing fair testing methods with those that naturally emerge from the imposition of weak and strong fairness, as defined by Costa and Stirling. The comparison highlights the expressiveness of various fair testing-based semantics and underscores the discriminating power of the method proposed in the literature.

The paper introduces a labeling technique for defining weak and strong fair computations and establishes the weak-fair must semantics and strong-fair must semantics. These two fair testing semantics are compared with an existing fair testing method in the literature, which does not require the labeling of actions. The comparison emphasizes the expressiveness of different fair testing semantics, especially in the context of fair testing. The paper also demonstrates interesting implications when imposing must testing on weak and strong-fair computations. Specifically, it reveals that any strong-fair computation is also weak-fair, while also showing that the weak-fair must semantics is strictly more detailed than the strong-fair must semantics.

The study investigates the limitations of strong and weak fairness notions in characterizing fair testing semantics. It provides an overview of related work in section 8 and concludes with final remarks and suggestions for further research in section 9. The proofs omitted in the main body of the paper are included in the appendices.

The paper defines a strong fair computation as a maximal computation in which no label remains live infinitely often, leading to the imposition that every label does not become live beyond a certain point. It also presents useful results regarding the distinguishability of terms p and q with respect to both sfmust and wfmust, and highlights the inability of a fair testing definition to differentiate between them.
