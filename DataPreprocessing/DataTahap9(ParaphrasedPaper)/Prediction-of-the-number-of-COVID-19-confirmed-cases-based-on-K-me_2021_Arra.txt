The COVID-19 pandemic, which commenced its rapid spread in the US with the first case identified on January 19, 2020 in Washington state, escalated to a total of 25,739 cases by April 20, 2020. While most individuals (81%) with the coronavirus exhibit mild symptoms, a significant portion may require respiratory support or even develop severe respiratory complications. The use of SEIR models for predicting disease outcomes is widespread, but many researchers apply these models without validating the necessary assumptions. This can lead to overfitting and lack of generalizability. In the present study, a combined algorithm using XGBoost, k-means, and LSTM neural networks is presented as a predictive model (referred to as k-means-LSTM) for short-term COVID-19 cases forecasting in Louisiana. The results demonstrate that the k-means-LSTM approach outperforms the SEIR model in terms of accuracy, with an RMSE of 601.20 as opposed to 3615.83.

The COVID-19 virus has shown efficient person-to-person transmission and can spread through respiratory aspirates, droplets, contacts, feces, and potentially through aerosols. The pandemic has rapidly spread worldwide, infecting over 5.2 million people in more than 210 countries. The severity of the virus is particularly pronounced in elderly populations, and demographic factors such as aging and climate variables like temperature, humidity, and wind speed play crucial roles in the survival and transmission of the virus. Furthermore, climatic conditions can serve as predictive indicators for respiratory diseases like COVID-19.

Demographic data specific to Louisiana, including parish population, population density, race, ethnicity, age, temperature, humidity, and median age, were analyzed in this study. The probability of COVID-19 infection was estimated based on age and race for each parish in Louisiana. Subsequently, a clustering algorithm was employed to group the time series data of COVID-19 confirmed cases and parishes. To improve learning performance and feature extraction, data preprocessing and dimensionality reduction techniques were utilized.

The k-means-LSTM model proved effective in fitting COVID-19 case counts by parish using demographic and environmental variables. It performed well when the case counts were above 45 and showed improved fit with richer data. The study suggests that the k-means-LSTM model is a valuable tool for modeling COVID-19 outbreaks, especially considering the complex nature and behavioral variations of the pandemic across different parishes.

In this analysis, LSTM was utilized to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak in Louisiana. The k-means-LSTM model outperformed the commonly used SEIR model, especially with an increasing amount of input data. However, further assessment of these new approaches on different datasets is necessary. Nonetheless, the study findings are promising and may prompt the adoption of these new tools in a timely manner.
