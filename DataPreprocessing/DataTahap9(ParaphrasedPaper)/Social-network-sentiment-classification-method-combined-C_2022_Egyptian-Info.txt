This academic paper discusses the application of machine learning and text analysis algorithms to classify text into positive, negative, and neutral categories based on the emotions conveyed in the sentences. With the widespread use of the internet, people express their opinions and feedback on various platforms, influencing the perceptions and choices of others. Hence, extracting and analyzing user sentiments from online content has significant implications for public opinion analysis, market research, and customer experience analysis.

To address the challenges of analyzing non-Euclidean structural data in texts, the paper introduces a graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture high-level semantic information. The GCN model, termed DTGRU, combines features extracted by bi-directional gated recurrent units (Bi-GRU) with syntactic dependency trees to perform sentiment classification of Chinese text. Experimental results show that the DTGRU model outperforms benchmark models in terms of accuracy and macro_F1 value, validating the effectiveness of integrating grammatical information and long-term word dependence in sentiment classification.

The paper also discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) in emotion classification. The study emphasizes the need to focus on Chinese sentiment analysis, given that most existing research in sentiment analysis focuses on English texts.

Furthermore, the paper proposes the use of dependency arrows to indicate grammatical relationships in sentences, and it details the experimental environment and data collection methodology. The study evaluates the DTGCN model using a large-scale Chinese emotion analysis corpus and achieves favorable accuracy and recall rates compared to other deep learning technologies. Moreover, the study identifies potential future improvements such as fine-grained sentiment analysis and application of the DTGCN model to other emotional tasks.

In essence, the paper introduces a novel approach, DTGCN, that leverages syntactic dependency trees in sentiment classification, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of emotional characteristics in Chinese sentences. Additionally, the study highlights the potential applicability of the DTGCN model to emotional analysis in other languages with proper language corpus and tagging.
