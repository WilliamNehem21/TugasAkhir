Let's analyze the operations of this algorithm in depth. Assume we have two monochromatic images, imageref and imagecurrent, both represented as matrices with dimensions h x w. The objective is to discover a transformation of the imagecurrent matrix into the imageref matrix that minimizes the luminance contrast between the images.
