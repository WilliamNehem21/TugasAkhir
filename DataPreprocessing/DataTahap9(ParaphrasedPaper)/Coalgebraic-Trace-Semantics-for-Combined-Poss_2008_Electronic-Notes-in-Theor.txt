The fusion of non-determinism and probability is a complex area of study that has garnered significant attention. There are numerous potential combinations to explore in this field. We will not attempt to provide a comprehensive overview or historical account of the subject, but refer readers to existing literature for such information in terms of coalgebraic classification.

Moving forward, we can naturally define the notion of a convex subset over a semimodule as a set that is closed under linear combinations with scalars summing up to 1. Our primary goal is to reframe Varacca's framework using free constructions of semimodules, thereby expanding upon his work by incorporating a semiring as a parameter and allowing for non-finitely generated convex subsets, which are necessary as traces are typically not finite or finitely generated sets.

To illustrate the computation of state traces, we will examine a specific state-based system exhibiting combined possibilistic and probabilistic behavior. This serves as a preliminary insight into the paper's accomplishments, with subsequent sections delving into the technical intricacies underlying our approach. Consequently, certain aspects may not be entirely clear at this juncture.
