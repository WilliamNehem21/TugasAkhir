According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 25% of individuals worldwide suffer from mental health disorders, and over 280 million people of varying ages are affected by depression. In Bangladesh, the prevalence of mental illnesses among adults is reported to be between 6.5% and 31.0%, while among children, it ranges from 13.4% to 22.9%. Recent studies indicate that more than 7 million people in Bangladesh, primarily in urban and metropolitan areas, are affected by depression and anxiety.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 addresses related works, Section 3 discusses the methodology used in the study, Section 4 presents the obtained results, Section 5 explores how the outcomes align with the research objectives, Section 6 discusses the limitations of the study, and Section 7 provides a conclusion along with remarks on future work.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in employing artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to detect depression and anxiety-related disorders using both public and private datasets. Several studies have utilized machine learning approaches to predict depression and anxiety across different populations, including college students, American adults, stroke survival patients, and children, among others.

Efforts to predict depression among Bangladeshi individuals have also been reported, with researchers using deep learning and various machine learning algorithms to analyze locally collected datasets. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of depression assessment scales and relevant questionnaires to measure the severity of depression.

The research aims to identify the key factors contributing to depression among university students in Bangladesh. It also aims to assess the accuracy of predicting depression using a newly created depression assessment scale and various machine learning and deep learning models.

The study employed various hyperparameter optimization and feature selection techniques to enhance the performance of prediction models and achieve higher accuracy by eliminating irrelevant features.
