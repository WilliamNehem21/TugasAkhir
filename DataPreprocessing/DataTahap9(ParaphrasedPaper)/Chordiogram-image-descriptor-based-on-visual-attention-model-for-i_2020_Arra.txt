This study introduces a new method for shape-based image retrieval that aims to address the challenge of concealed foreground and background contents influencing each other in images. The proposed approach utilizes the Otsu method to segment foreground from background and subsequently identifies saliency and edge maps for each. Autocorrelation-based chordiogram image descriptors are then computed separately for the foreground and background images and combined in a hierarchical manner to form a new descriptor that captures geometric, texture, structure, and spatial information. This novel shape-based descriptor outperforms conventional ones in content-based image retrieval.

The paper compares global and local approaches for image characterization, with a focus on previous methods that solely rely on shape information. It reviews existing approaches, such as the Chord-based Image Descriptor (CID) and the Autocorrelation-based CID (ACID), and highlights the shortcomings of these methods in terms of noise sensitivity and computational efficiency. The proposed approach, which incorporates saliency edges and hierarchical feature descriptions, aims to improve upon these issues and achieves better retrieval accuracy.

The study evaluates the proposed method against CID, ACID, and SEH using various image databases and demonstrates its superior performance in terms of precision and recall. Specifically, the proposed approach shows better robustness to differences in illumination and occlusion compared to existing methods. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in obtaining accurate retrieval results.

In summary, this paper presents a novel shape-based image retrieval method that effectively addresses the challenge of concealed foreground and background contents, resulting in improved retrieval performance compared to existing techniques. Future research directions could involve incorporating saliency details into the feature matching phase and exploring ways to optimize computational costs.
