This research aims to investigate the potential for simulating biological experiments in a computational environment. It involves developing a formal model of biological processes using a calculus, and then comparing the stochastic simulations of this model with experimental data to assess their qualitative agreement. The findings suggest the potential for integrating laboratory experiments with computational simulations. The study focuses on calcium, a second messenger that transmits external signals to intracellular targets through oscillations of its concentration in the nucleus. Specifically, the experimental data pertains to calcium responses in plant root epidermis to interactions with endosymbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The formal calculus used for this analysis is the calculus of wrapped compartments, which combines the simplicity of notation of rewrite systems with the advantage of compositionality.

Many biological processes exhibit oscillatory behavior, from macroscopic phenomena like heartbeats and lung respiration to microscopic processes such as the cell cycle and glycolytic oscillations. Calcium oscillations are widespread in living organisms, serving as a key second messenger in all eukaryotes. These oscillations are regulated by various mechanisms, including passive fluxes through channels, active transport across membranes, and the buffering capacity of the cytosol. The research also explores the impact of external stimuli, such as interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, on calcium levels in plant cells.

In the experimental analysis of calcium responses to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, the findings reveal that nuclear calcium oscillations exhibit characteristic inter-spike intervals and follow an exponential distribution in terms of waiting time. These observations are further studied in relation to information transfer using entropy as a measure.

The study also aims to develop a computational model using the calculus of wrapped compartments to simulate the dynamics of calcium in plant cell nuclei, thereby extending the statistical data analysis into a computational framework. The model provides insight into information transmission and its energetic costs, highlighting the importance of temporal structure in maximizing information transfer while managing energy consumption.

By leveraging the computational capabilities of the calculus of wrapped compartments, the study presents a formal model of plant nuclear calcium spiking. This model, based on the regulatory activities of calcium channels and transporters in the nuclear envelope, provides a computational framework for understanding the cellular signaling mediated by calcium spiking.

In summary, the research investigates the potential for mimicking biological experiments in a computational environment through the development of a formal model using a calculus. The findings provide insights into the dynamics of calcium signaling in response to external stimuli and offer a computational framework for understanding cellular messages mediated by calcium spiking.
