Indexed and fibred categorical concepts are commonly utilized in the field of computer science for modeling logical systems and type theories. In this paper, we concentrate on hoare logic and demonstrate that a comprehensive categorical analysis of its axiomatic semantics necessitates the use of indexed category and fibred category theory. The structural aspects of the language are depicted within an indexed setting, while the logical aspects of deduction are represented within a fibred setting. Particularly, hoare triples emerge naturally as special arrows in a fibred category over a syntactic category of programs, while deduction in the hoare calculus can be expressed categorically by the heuristic deduction = generation of cartesian arrows + composition of arrows.

While functors are known to naturally preserve structure, they do not necessarily preserve logical properties. To maintain logical properties, a certain notion of universality is typically required, with the concept of cartesian arrows being widely used for this purpose. Although cartesian arrows are inherent in the definition of fibred categories, they are also provided by any indexed category, albeit with additional structural information.

The literature provides diverse presentations of hoare logic, such as defining the weakest liberal precondition semantically using predicate transformers or syntactically. The semantics of programs can also be defined using partial state transition functions or predicate transformers. The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating how these diverse facets of hoare logic can be uniformly described using the languages of indexed categories and fibred categories in a systematic manner. It is shown that employing both categorical tools is crucial for handling axiomatic semantics, particularly in the context of hoare logic, where the structural features of the language are presented in an indexed setting and the deduction features in a fibred setting. This underscores the importance of understanding the interplay between indexed and fibred concepts for effectively presenting, analyzing, and using these logics.

The traditional presentation of the structural features of hoare logic is fundamentally indexed. By elevating this understanding to a more comprehensive and structured level through a categorical presentation based on indexed categories, we highlight that this paves the way for an expansion of hoare logic from a single-program to a multi-program environment.
