The paper proposes an approach to feature selection, advocating for the evaluation of the performance of a model by initially selecting only the top-ranked feature from all available feature selection techniques and then gradually adding the next ranked features until a point of decreased performance is reached. At each stage of feature addition, the performance of the model is to be assessed.

The study conducted at a wavelength of 778.07 nm with 30 wavelengths revealed a classification accuracy of 81.28% when considering 105 wavelengths and 74.14% with only 30 wavelengths. Among various feature selection techniques, Fisher's criterion emerged as the most effective method for selecting wavelengths from NIR for classifying healthy and defective mangoes. Furthermore, the study suggests that efficient wavelength selection using Fisher's criterion is crucial for the design of a model such as an NIR camera for the NIR spectrum.
