Fragmented specifications, typically involving only one modality, are particularly notable for their decidability. The decidability of certain fragments, denoted as b, b, e, e, can be easily demonstrated through reduction to point-based logics. The decidability of a, a, and consequently that of l, l (as definable in terms of a, a) has been established through model-theoretic arguments implying small (non-standard) model property for these logics. Similarly, the decidability of d over dense linear orderings has been proven, and can be adapted to the case of d. However, the decidability of d over general, finite, or discrete linear orderings is still unresolved.

This paper demonstrates that the logic o (and hence o, which is symmetric) is the only exception from the established decidability trend, despite its simplicity and limited expressive power. The primary result of this paper is the undecidability of the logic o (and o), interpreted over discrete linear orderings. This result strengthens previous findings for several extensions of o when the semantics are restricted to discrete linear orderings. The proof is based on a reduction from the undecidable octant tiling problem, which seeks to determine if a given finite set of tile types can tile the second octant of the integer plane, while respecting color constraints between vertically or horizontally adjacent tiles.

The structure of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the syntax and semantics of the fragment o, interpreted over discrete linear orderings. Section 3 provides a brief overview of the undecidability proof, and in Section 4, a detailed account of the proof is presented. Finally, the conclusions assess the work and outline potential future research directions.

An intuitive description of the undecidability proof's structure is provided in this section. The paper has previously utilized a reduction from the tiling problem for the second octant of the integer plane to establish the undecidability of various fragments. However, the presence of the overlap modality in the logic o significantly influences the technical aspects of the reduction.

The paper also highlights the inability to directly apply the given undecidability proof to the logic of overlap relation when interpreted over other classes of linear orderings, such as dense linear orderings. The authors express an interest in solving the decision problem for the considered logic when interpreted over other linear orderings. Additionally, they note a lack of awareness regarding any interval temporal logic that is decidable or undecidable with respect to some classes of linear orderings and the opposite for others.
