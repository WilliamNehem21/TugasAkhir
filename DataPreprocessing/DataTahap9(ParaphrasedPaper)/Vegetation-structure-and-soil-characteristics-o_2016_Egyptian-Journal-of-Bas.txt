Geophytes, which are plants characterized by underground storage organs such as bulbs, corms, tubers, or rhizomes, show promise for various economic purposes. These plants typically have leaves that die off each year and are not evergreen. They are common in Mediterranean-type ecosystems, particularly in seasonal climates, and exhibit high diversity. In regions with high rainfall, geophyte species tend to be annuals that thrive during the wet season, while during longer periods of dryness, woody shrubs and perennial herbs dominate the vegetation. The plant life in the eastern desert is more abundant than in the western desert, and there are specific plant associations in different desert habitats.

For instance, the coastal region of Egypt is home to species such as Cyperus capitatus and Cyperus conglomeratus, which have adapted to survive extreme climatic conditions, including arid and semi-arid coastal areas. These plants contribute to the stabilization of sand dunes in their respective habitats. In the inland deserts, species such as Lasiurus scindicus and Panicum turgidum are associated with geophytes and have distinct relations with specific plant communities.

In terms of flora, the study area comprises 119 species, with the families Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Fabaceae being the most prominent. Furthermore, the species composition differed between the coastal and inland desert regions, with specific perennial species associated with studied geophytes in each area. Soil and environmental factors were found to influence the distribution and relationships between different plant species.

The study also examined the impact of urban and agricultural processes on the desert landscape and highlighted that these activities lead to significant changes in environmental factors, particularly in reclaimed areas. Additionally, the study area was identified as a meeting point for floristic elements from several phytogeographical regions, such as the African Sudanozambesian, Asiatic Irano-Turanian, Afro-Asiatic Sahro-Sindian, and Euro-Afro-Asiatic Mediterranean regions.

Another key finding was the classification of the vegetation into six major groups, with each group associated with specific geophyte plants. The distribution of these groups was found to be linked to specific localities within the study area. Furthermore, the study emphasized the importance of conserving the natural habitats of the desert, as geophytes play a crucial role in the economic, medicinal, and ornamental aspects of the region. The conservation of these natural resources and the sustainable development of these desert ecosystems were identified as vital for ecological management.
