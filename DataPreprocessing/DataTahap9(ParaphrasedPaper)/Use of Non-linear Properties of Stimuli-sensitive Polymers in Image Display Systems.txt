The paper illustrates that the use of non-linear characteristics of stimuli-sensitive polymers can significantly simplify the design of image display systems. The proposed method relies on the combined action of two heating elements placed in each pixel. This report describes the initial experimental findings that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

The paper shows that by leveraging the non-linear properties of stimuli-sensitive, particularly thermo-sensitive polymers, the noted drawbacks can be overcome. Such substances have been extensively studied by researchers such as Dergunov et al., Okano, Barker et al., and Tanaka. A wide range of polymers, whose solutions undergo phase transition due to temperature changes, have been synthesized. Previous research by Dergunov et al., Okano, Barker et al., and Tanaka suggests a strong correlation between solution parameters and stimuli in the phase transition domain, as outlined in Ergozhin et al.

Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were utilized as a source of visible optical emission, while receivers of emission (light-dependent resistors) were positioned at a distance of 15 mm on the opposite side of the cuvette. An electronically designed system capable of recording measurable resistance values of a light-dependent resistor in a text file with a time resolution of 1-100 microseconds was employed.
