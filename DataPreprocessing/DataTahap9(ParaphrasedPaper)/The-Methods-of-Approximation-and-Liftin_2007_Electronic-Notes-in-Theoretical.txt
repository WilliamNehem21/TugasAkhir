In order to formalize the definition of approximation, a precise discussion of functions and their arguments is necessary. If a function f(x1,..., xk) operates on a defined set of variables xk and yields values in x, it is considered to be...

Now, let us aim to establish a form of variable substitution operation. For instance, if f(x, y) = xy, we can replace a with x and b with y to derive f(a, b) = ab. Alternatively, substituting z for both x and y yields f(z) = z2. Thus, this operation can be used to alter variable names or effect a genuine change in the function...

Definition 3.2 (Function Algebras) states that if b is a set of functions (referred to as basic functions) and o is a set of operations, then fa[b; o] is termed a function algebra, denoting the smallest set of functions containing b and closed under the operations in o. For clarity, the elements of b or o are often listed as a comma-separated list...

It is worth noting that all sets of functions, including those defined via function algebras, are implicitly functions with variables, closed under substitution. Noticeably, in a function algebra, there may be two distinct ways to construct the same function, emphasizing the syntactic aspect of a function algebra...

The previous lemma illustrates the usefulness of approximating an operation. To demonstrate that a particular function algebra includes or approximates another, one can work inductively on the specific function algebra in question. This concept of approximating an operation allows for the demonstration of the resources required to approximate an operation, which can be utilized across various contexts...

Definition 4.1 (From) defines the discrete part of a class of functions on r, denoted dp(f), as a class of functions over the universe n. This section introduces a function algebra with universe q, which naturally approximates l. This function algebra can be interpreted on q into fan, leading to the theorem by the transitivity of the approximation relation. The section concludes by discussing several advantages of this approach...

It is important to note that the work in this section is crucial for the theorem of the next section. Specifically, the efforts in this section are essential for the corollary of the next section, and the corollaries are subsequently used to obtain a desired result. Therefore, the only additional work in this section involves the relatively straightforward interpretation...

The next crucial technical lemma pertains to the syntactic structure of the function algebra and is sensitive to the exact definition of the function algebra, as different function algebras that yield the same functions in the end may have the wrong syntactic property...
