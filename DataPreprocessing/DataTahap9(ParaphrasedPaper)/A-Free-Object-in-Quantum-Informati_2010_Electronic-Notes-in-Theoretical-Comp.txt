We examine three instances of affine monoids. The first example, rooted in information theory, serves as a natural model for image distortion, and represents a multi-dimensional version of a binary symmetric channel. The second example, from the field of physics, characterizes the process of transferring quantum information with a specified entangled state. The third example is a purely mathematical construction, referred to as the free affine monoid over the klein four group. We establish that all three of these entities are equivalent.

When environmental noise causes a pixel's bits to flip, an image becomes distorted, thereby changing the pixel's original intensity. For instance, if all the bits in a white pixel are flipped, the pixel becomes black, resulting in a dark appearance in a previously light area of the image. To represent image distortion, we utilize a channel with an input pixel and an output pixel, typically degraded in some way.

Furthermore, because the operations that flip two bits form a copy of the klein four group, proposition 4.2 asserts that the first example is isomorphic to the third. The proof of theorem 4.3 demonstrates that the convex closure also shares this property. Notably, the convex closure represents the set of diagonal qubit channels, and proposition 4.2 together with theorem 3.4 indicate that the second example is also isomorphic to the third. Since both the first and second examples are free affine monoids over the klein four group, their isomorphism is guaranteed by the uniqueness of free objects.

Interestingly, the set of single qubit channels encompasses numerous copies of the finite group a4, the alternating group on four letters. However, none of these copies has a convex closure leading to the free object over a4, due to the existence of a copy of a4 in so(3) whose convex closure is not free, and the fact that all copies of a4 in so(3) are conjugate. Consequently, the free affine monoid over a4 has no quantum representation using single qubit channels. The question of whether the free affine monoid over a finite group always possesses a quantum representation in a higher dimension remains open.
