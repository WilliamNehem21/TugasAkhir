This paper explores the effects of a monad t within the category set of sets and total functions, leading to the emergence of three notable constructs. The first construct, known as the kleisli category sett, can be viewed as the category in which expressions are assessed when the monad t is activated. The second construct, the category sett of algebras over the monad, serves to ascertain if the monad aligns with a collection type. The third construct pertains to a class of topological spaces that are determined by specific endomorphisms of the kleisli category, in which the box and diamond operators correspond to the interior and closure operators.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the use of rel as the standard model of multi-valued semantics and examines the option to select submonads to enforce additional properties such as non-empty subsets or finite subsets. These submonads are deemed as such due to the qualities of singletons being non-empty and finite, and the property that a non-empty union of non-empty sets remains non-empty, as well as a finite union of finite sets remaining finite.
