The paper discusses how behavior protocols capture the behavior of a component using traces, and it proposes the use of port state machines (POSMs) to model and verify the behavior of interconnected components. The authors define the compliance relation and consent operator for reasoning on the consistency of component composition, and they introduce the concept of POSMs with the goals of capturing interleaving events and nested calls and establishing a verifiable compliance relation.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces POSMs, Section 3 discusses how composition verification can be achieved with POSMs, and a case study is presented in Section 4. Sections 5 and 6 evaluate the contribution, discuss related work, and outline future research, and the paper concludes in Section 7.

The POSM is defined as a subclass of protocol state machines, and it contains regions, vertexes, and transitions. The paper also discusses the transformation of a POSM into a finite automaton in order to generate a regular language. Moreover, the behavior compliance relation and consent operator are used to verify the composition of components based on their behavior specifications.

The paper also addresses issues related to behavior compliance, such as detecting errors and ensuring that composed behavior is correct. It discusses the transformation of behavior protocols into POSMs and the possibility of constructing a behavior protocol for a port state machine. The authors also outline future goals for further research, including investigating operations for assembling behavior from multiple POSMs into a single POSM and broadening the definition of behavior compliance to include state events.

In summary, the paper introduces the concept of POSMs as a way to model and verify the behavior of interconnected software components, and it discusses various aspects related to behavior compliance and composition verification.
