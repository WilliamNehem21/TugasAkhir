Ramaiah utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNN) to achieve illumination invariant face recognition, while Abass et al. address shift and rotation issues using complex wavelet transform (CWT) and Fisherface. Kishor et al. propose robust pose invariant face recognition using dual cross pattern (DCP), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to tackle pose-related issues. Kohonen's early work on face recognition employed a neural network of eigenfaces, but practical implementation was hindered by the high demand for normalization and positioning in real-life environments.

Subsequently, Kirby and Sirovich developed a method to directly calculate eigenfaces using algebraic manipulation, while Turk and Pentland refined this approach by determining exact face locations and scales and utilizing coding residual error from eigenfaces. To mitigate illumination variations in facial recognition, a solution was proposed that combined robust illumination normalization, local texture-based face representations, distance transform-based matching, and kernel-based feature extraction, although it only addressed illumination issues.

In the area of noise in facial recognition, a local binary pattern histogram (LBPH)-based enhanced real-time face recognition method was used, along with an approach to improve recognition using LBP and SVM optimized by particle swarm optimization. These methods extract features from images using principal component analysis (PCA) and LBP techniques and utilize SVM for classification.

It is important to highlight that the research does not address the issue of occlusion and masked faces in facial recognition, leaving this as a potential area for future work.
