This academic paper discusses the challenges of dealing with combinatorial explosion in molecular biological models, particularly in the context of rule-based models describing protein complexes and their interactions. The paper proposes a formal framework to address these challenges by reducing the complexity of the models' differential semantics through two abstractions: tracking information flow between different regions of chemical species and detecting pairs of sites with the same interaction capabilities. These abstractions are combined to create a reduced model, which is formally related to the initial model through abstract interpretation.

The paper provides a detailed description of the proposed framework and its instantiation with a specific language called kappa. It also presents examples and case studies to illustrate the application of the framework. Additionally, the paper outlines future directions for implementing the framework and addresses the theoretical aspects concerning the semantics definition of information flow.

Overall, the paper introduces a formal framework for reducing the complexity of rule-based molecular biological models and suggests potential avenues for further exploration and implementation.
