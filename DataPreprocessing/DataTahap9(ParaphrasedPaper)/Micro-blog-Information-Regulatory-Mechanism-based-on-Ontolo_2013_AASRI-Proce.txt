Since its inception, microblogging has rapidly gained popularity among users due to its real-time nature and convenience. With a large user base and relative freedom of speech, microblogging has proven to be a powerful tool for understanding community sentiment. By 2011, the number of microblog users exceeded 195 million, showing a staggering growth rate of 208.9%. Furthermore, the application range of microblogging has expanded, with events like the Fukushima earthquake being extensively discussed, reflecting its profound social influence. However, the rapid spread of information on microblogs can lead to significant effects, both positive and negative, and raises ethical concerns regarding moral behavior and disorder. The academic community has started to focus on studying effective methods of supervising microblogging, resulting in the development of self-disciplinary measures and guidelines for content management and user behavior.

To ensure ease of use, the control means for language classification has been eliminated, although this has resulted in challenges regarding browsing and searching due to the lack of semantic relationships. The author suggests that technical means can be adopted to optimize free classification, improving browsing and searching while enhancing the user experience. Foreign researchers have been actively exploring the use of data labels and ontology-based free classification, although constructing ontology remains complex and challenging due to issues such as concept updates in a network environment. The author proposes the integration of ontology and folksonomy as a new approach to overcome these challenges and construct a similar structure based on folksonomy's advantages and disadvantages.

In the specific implementation, users are encouraged to tag microblog information through folksonomy, which represents a kind of user-generated metadata with various functions such as resource description and positioning. The tag number and constantly changing nature make it impossible to construct ontology for each tag, leading the author to suggest optimizing popular tags for ontology construction. To meet the needs of building ontology through folksonomy, the author proposes a simplified ontology structure called "micro-ontology," focusing on concept, attribute, examples, and related semantic information. This approach simplifies the process of ontology construction, making it achievable through RSS push and ontology structure. RSS technology facilitates the gathering and sharing of content from different sites on a single platform, enabling real-time information delivery and audience aggregation.

Microblog information is characterized by its fragmented nature, rapid communication, real-time nature, and delivery through both user searches and RSS technology.
