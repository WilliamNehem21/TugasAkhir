The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is an extensively used library rooted in the generic programming paradigm. However, reliance on this library does not guarantee bug-free programs, and incorrect use of the generic programming paradigm can lead to the emergence of new errors, such as the misuse of iterators or misunderstandings when using remove-like algorithms.

The development of the C++ STL was influenced by the generic programming approach, incorporating class templates for defining containers and function templates for implementing various algorithms. These algorithms are designed to be independent of specific containers, allowing for their use with different types of containers. Due to its convenience and the inclusion of beneficial containers (such as list, vector, map, etc.) and a wide range of algorithms (including sort, find, count, etc.), the C++ STL has become widely adopted as a standard library in C++ programming.

The extensibility of the STL allows for the addition of new containers that can interact with existing algorithms, as well as the incorporation of new algorithms that can work with existing containers. Notably, the use of different function templates for standard behavior and arbitrary behavior is a common practice in the STL. However, a limitation arises when dealing with iterator arguments in certain template functions, such as lower bound.

In transitioning legacy STL-based code to utilize the vector container with additional checks, minor adjustments involving the passing of an extra parameter to the vector type are required. While straightforward, the process of copying and assigning between untested and tested vector containers is not trivial, necessitating the addition of special template copy constructors and assignment operators to facilitate this transformation.

Another approach involves maintaining the list when iterators are destructed. This enables the deletion of the iterator from the list in the destructor of vector::iterator, leading to the prevention of existing iterators being removed. This method is denoted as the 2nd variant in comparisons.

Looking ahead, consideration can be given to passing invalidation as a trait in a future version of the STL. The ability to parameterize the strategy of invalidation and apply it to containers could prove beneficial. Additionally, applying maintenance of contained iterators as a more sophisticated trait could enhance the functionality of containers. Another potential avenue involves leveraging the type system of C++ to support checks, cache results, and avoid unnecessary runtime checks, embodying a more elegant solution.
