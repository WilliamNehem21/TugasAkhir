The focus of this research is on the development of a protocol for multi-constrained quality of service (QoS) routing, which seeks to identify routes that satisfy multiple independent QoS constraints concurrently. The proposed protocol, called fuzzy cost-based multi-constrained quality of service routing (FCMQR), aims to select an optimal path by taking into account several independent QoS metrics, including bandwidth, end-to-end delay, and the number of intermediate hops. The approach is grounded in a multi-criterion objective fuzzy measure, which involves converting all available resources of a path into a single metric known as fuzzy cost. Additionally, the protocol incorporates mobility prediction to ascertain the path's lifetime, with the optimal path being determined as the one with the maximum lifetime and minimum fuzzy cost for transmission. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the FCMQR in estimating and evaluating the stability and cost of QoS routing in dynamic mobile networks.

Creating and maintaining an optimal multicast tree and managing group membership function pose challenges in wireless mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Ensuring QoS guarantee is essential for the advancement of multicast services, as it can enhance performance and facilitate the transmission of critical information even under challenging conditions. QoS routing in MANETs is complicated due to the network topology's constant changes caused by node mobility and the dynamic nature of available state information for routing. It is observed from a survey of QoS-aware routing protocols for MANETs that most protocols consider only one or two metrics, which is inadequate given that the MANET's topology is influenced by multiple factors such as link stability, node mobility, and battery power of mobile devices, all of which are interrelated. Therefore, the consideration of only one or two factors is insufficient for selecting an optimal path.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of related works. Section 3 outlines the design of multiple selection parameters, while Section 4 elucidates the fuzzy logic inference engine. Mobility prediction mechanisms are discussed in Section 5, and Section 6 details the cost-effective lifetime prediction of a path. The route discovery process of the proposed protocol is described in Section 7, followed by a discussion of simulation results in Section 8. Finally, Section 9 presents the conclusion.
