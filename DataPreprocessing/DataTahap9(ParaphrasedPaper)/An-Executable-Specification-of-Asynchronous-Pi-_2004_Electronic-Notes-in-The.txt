The paper proposes a method to define transitions of a process relative to its execution environment. The environment is conceptualized as a set of free (global) names that can be used while interacting with the process, and transitions are represented as rewrite rules over a pair consisting of a set of environment names and a process.

The transitions are specific to individual inputs, making the number of input transitions finite through simplifications. In the context of the open rule, instances of the rule that differ only in the chosen name are not differentiated, as the identifier used to denote the private name emitted is irrelevant.

The paper also discusses the rewrite rule for the close operation, where a process emits a bound name that is received by another process. The rewrite involving the receiving process is carried out within the scope of the emitted bound name. This is achieved by adding the channel associated with the bound name to the set of environment names and adjusting the channel indices in the rewrite.

To prevent infinite loops during the evaluation of rule conditions, the operator [] is used. This prevents useless rewrites within the operator. In addition, the paper introduces the use of the search command of Maude 2.0 to find all possible traces of a process.

The paper also addresses specific cases related to delay rules, such as shifting channel indices when a free input action is delayed across a bound action, as well as when a bound input action is delayed across a free input/output action.

Overall, the paper proposes a framework for defining process transitions in relation to an environment and presents specific rules and considerations for handling different scenarios within this framework.
