We do not anticipate that formal methods will be able to entirely solve all the issues we face, as problems stemming from human error and malicious intent can arise from simple design flaws. Our primary focus is on verifying the design steps. 

The single transferable vote (STV) model, which serves as the basis for our case study, is considered a sound democratic election process. However, it involves a complex, non-deterministic tabulation procedure. In 2003, Farrell and McAllister highlighted how a subtle alteration in the implementation of the STV rules can significantly impact the results.

We emphasize that the calculation of the quota relies on correctly implementing the concept of validity, which is not straightforward due to the STV allowing voters to express support for multiple candidates. Thus, a vote may or may not have an associated preference, and its validity is contingent upon exhibiting a distinct first preference.

Typically, with simple designs such as a basic voting interface, developers may not see the need to proceed to a more rigorous third layer. However, in the forthcoming designs, we adopt a rapid-prototyping approach that does not advance to the third layer of rigor. Yet we demonstrate in Section 5 how the B method and tools can be utilized to fully support the third layer in the verification process.

The "presscandbutton" method relies on two other methods: "buttonenabled" to check the button's status and "lastpref" to determine the last preference chosen. While "buttonenabled" is straightforward to implement, "lastpref," as described below, scans all preferences to identify the highest current preference value as the last preference. This implementation is correct yet inefficient.

In the more concrete "eachvoteatonce" model, the state consists of "voting" to signify the open voting system and "finish" to indicate when voting concludes. The variable "st" denotes one of these values, "elector" records the electorate who have voted, "vt" holds the votes, and "cvt" is the count of votes. All votes in "vt" are valid, and the event "one vote" represents a single elector's vote.

The "one voting" set encompasses "no elec" when no electors are voting, "start" when a new elector begins voting, and "valid" when the elector confirms their vote. The variable "sto" holds one of these values, "e" denotes the current elector, "vt" represents their ongoing vote, and "n" signifies the preference number of the chosen candidate.

We have showcased how the formal method B can guarantee a straightforward safety property of an e-voting machine interface. Ensuring the validity of recorded votes not only aids in formally verifying the voting process but also plays a crucial role in enhancing the machine's security. Our aim is to develop a generic framework for the design of secure interfaces that can be proven to meet various safety-related properties, akin to the formal design patterns suggested by Abrial when using B to verify control systems. Additionally, we are currently employing B to verify the correctness of an actual storage mechanism offering tamper-evident, history-independent, and subliminal-free data structures. Subsequently, we plan to use B to ensure safety properties related to vote tabulation and verify all layers in a standard voting architecture. This forms part of our future work.
