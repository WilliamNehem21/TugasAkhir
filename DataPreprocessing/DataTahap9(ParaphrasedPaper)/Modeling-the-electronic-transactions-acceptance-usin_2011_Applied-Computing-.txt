The success of e-commerce and e-government depends not just on people's acceptance of internet-based transactions, but also on their trust in the internet as a reliable platform. To better understand the factors driving individuals to accept online transactions, a comprehensive model was developed and tested. This model integrates the well-established Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with three important constructs: trust, credibility, and risk. These constructs are crucial in predicting individual acceptance of online transactions.

To prepare a nation or society to embrace the information highway for higher economic and social development, two main strategies can be employed: leveraging other experiences and focusing on education and curriculum development. By tailoring research models and adapting them to cultural values and the local environment, societies can leverage existing experiences. 

A promising future for internet usage in Saudi Arabia is predicted, as internet usage is expected to continue growing rapidly. Factors contributing to this growth include the increasing number of teenagers and young adults in the Saudi population who are adept at adopting new technologies. Furthermore, as internet usage rises across Arab countries, the amount of Arabic content on the internet is also expected to increase.

In 2004, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia issued a decree to the Saudi Computer Society to develop a National IT Plan (NITP) for the country. The NITP, approved by the Saudi government in 2007, aims to use information and other technologies to promote knowledge and support economic development throughout the kingdom. The plan emphasizes the importance of science and technology development for economic progress and highlights the need to raise awareness of IT within Saudi society.

Credibility is an influential factor in e-transactions that is likely to impact consumer behavior. This study considers credibility as a separate concept, emphasizing its role in influencing individuals' voluntary acceptance of e-transactions. Perceived risk is also a crucial element in business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce, which can affect consumer behavior. The study integrates trust, perceived credibility, and perceived risk to develop a model for e-transaction acceptance.

E-commerce and e-government transactions differ from traditional consumer behavior due to the extensive use of technology, impersonal nature of the online environment, and uncertainty of using open technological infrastructures. These unique differences reduce consumer perceptions of control over online transactions, heightening their concerns about accepting e-transactions. Trust and risk theories in B2C e-commerce are utilized, while the Technology Acceptance Model is employed to describe and predict system use for online transactions.

It is widely recognized that traditional and online retailers have embraced the low-cost internet infrastructure to expand their consumer base. However, consumers have not fully embraced B2C e-commerce due to concerns about risk and trust-related issues. Uncertainty regarding consumer transaction intentions is fundamental in predicting the acceptance of B2C e-commerce.

Overall, the study aims to provide a better understanding of individual online behavior in the emerging e-commerce and e-government environments in Saudi Arabia. The findings can be used by Saudi policymakers to address challenges in transitioning to a digital economy and information society. Media campaigns can help communicate the benefits of e-transactions and promote public understanding of the roles and benefits of e-transactions in daily life. Additionally, proactive policies, such as IT caravan voyages, can facilitate the promotion of e-transactions through practical applications of e-commerce and e-government.
