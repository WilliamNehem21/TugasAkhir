The director agent possesses complete knowledge about the actual spatial arrangement of the protein and is responsible for coordinating search agents to enhance spatial exploration efficiency. It does not have a presence in Cartesian space but rather operates externally within the three-dimensional space. The director agent executes global movements on the searching agents and is essential for the simulation to include at least one director agent.
