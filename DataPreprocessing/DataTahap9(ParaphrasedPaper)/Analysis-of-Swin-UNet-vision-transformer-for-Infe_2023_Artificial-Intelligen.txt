Materials and Methods:
In this retrospective experimental study, 84 CT scans comprising a total of 54,618 slices were analyzed to develop and evaluate a segmentation algorithm for identifying the presence of IVC (inferior vena cava) filters in abdominal CT scans. A variety of patch-based 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) variants as well as the Swin U-Net transformer (Swin-Unetr) were employed for this purpose. The performance of the segmentation models was assessed using the Dice score as a metric.

Conclusion:
The utilization of the Swin-Unetr, a vision-based transformer, resulted in the generation of segmentation outputs with minimal bias and variance, effectively addressing a real-world issue in healthcare related to advanced artificial intelligence (AI) image processing and recognition. Adoption of Swin-Unetr is expected to streamline the process of manually tracking IVC filters by centralizing these tasks within the electronic health record.

The UNet is a type of CNN designed specifically for image segmentation, and has been widely utilized in healthcare for creating diagnostic and prognostic models. The architecture consists of a contracting path (encoder) comprising convolution and pooling layers, and an expansion path (decoder) comprising transposed convolution layers and concatenations with feature maps from the encoder. The 3D UNet is an extension of the basic UNet, enabling volumetric processing by implementing convolution and pooling operations on a 3D data cube. This modification allows the model to effectively utilize spatially dependent features across all three dimensions.

The Swin Unetr is a novel architecture that integrates the Swin transformer into the traditional UNet convolution architecture. This integration involves replacing the convolutional encoder of the original UNet design with the hierarchical design of the Swin transformer. The outputs of the Swin transformer are then connected to the standard UNet decoder through residual block skip connections. The Swin Unetr was initially developed for accurate and reproducible segmentation of brain tumors in MRI images, and demonstrated superior performance when compared to the winning methodologies of the 2021 Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BRATS). Additionally, it has been successfully applied to head and neck primary tumors and lymph node segmentation using FDG-PET/CT images. The model was pre-trained on the datasets provided by the BRATS and HECKTOR challenges, and has shown promising results in various segmentation tasks.

This research established that a transformer-based model with parameters similar to a CNN can yield improved training and validation outcomes when integrated with existing medical information technology. Data augmentation strategies, including random crop, random resize, random flip, and random rotation, were employed to ensure significant variation in the training dataset, comprising 155 IVC and 155 non-IVC patches per sub-epoch. These strategies reduce the likelihood of model overfitting by introducing randomness and variation.

Future work in IVC filter detection involves algorithm validation and classification pipeline on an estimated 1,500 clinical CT scans, along with the development of an IVC filter prediction pipeline for reporting the presence and location of IVC filters. Following the generation of a predicted 3D mask by the Swin Unetr model, the program will utilize the scikit-image image processing library in Python to analyze the region properties of the segmented image, aiming to remove any spurious segmentations. The entire algorithm will be evaluated on clinical CT scans to assess its performance, and the results and statistics obtained will be used for retraining the Swin Unetr model if necessary.
