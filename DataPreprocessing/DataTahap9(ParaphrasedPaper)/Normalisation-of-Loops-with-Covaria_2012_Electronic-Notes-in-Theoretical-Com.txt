Various approaches have been investigated in flow analysis with regard to loop bounds. Most of these approaches utilize abstract interpretation to construct a mapping that assigns abstract representations of variable values. This facilitates the provision of secure, albeit potentially overestimated, sets of states at different program points.

If q1 = 0, and if the assignment of x is the one that leads to exiting the loop, then the default increment is x = q2x + k20. When the first branch of the "if" statement is executed, either the constant value of x indicates that the loop condition is false in the next iteration, thus achieving the maximum number of iterations of the loop when the second branch is always executed, or the loop condition is true, such that the loop may never terminate (alternatively, if q2 = 0 is the last iteration case, then x = q1x + k10), otherwise, it is undefined.
