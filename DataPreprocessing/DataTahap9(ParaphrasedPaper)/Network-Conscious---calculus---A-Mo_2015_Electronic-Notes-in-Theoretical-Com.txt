The paper discusses two kinds of designations in a network: "sites," which are the network's nodes, and "links," which are named connections between pairs of sites. Sites are essentially atomic entities, for example, "a," while links take the form "lab," indicating that there is a link named "l" from site "a" to site "b."

Section 2 of the paper provides a summary of the syntax and semantics of the ncpi. The primary focus of the paper is in section 3, where the authors present an ncpi model of the peer-to-peer architecture known as pastry to demonstrate the language's expressive capabilities. This model was developed within the context of the FP7 Autonomic Service-Component Ensembles (ASCENS) project, where the routing functions of pastry were utilized in a cloud computing case study. Further details can be found in [18, chapter 6].
