We define a digraph d as an arc-spine digraph if it can be partitioned into sets {x, y} such that d[x] is traceable and d[y] contains at most one arc. A partition {x, y} of an arc-spine digraph is considered maximal if x is maximal. We denote an arc-spine digraph with a maximal partition {x, y} as d[x, y]. The unique arc of d[y] is denoted by a, and its tail and head are denoted by u and v, respectively. Let p=(x1, x2,..., xl) be a Hamilton path of d[x].


In Lemma 2.4, we demonstrate an analogue of Lemma 1 in [9] for k-loose arc-spine digraphs. It is important to note that the concept of k-loose for arc-spine digraphs in this context differs from the concept of k-loose for spine digraphs presented elsewhere. The alternative definition of k-loose was required to ensure that there are perfect analogues of Lemmas 1 and 3 from [9] for arc-spine digraphs. The analogue of Lemma 3 in [9] is presented as Lemma 2.8.


The proof presented by Sambinelli, Nunes da Silva, and Lee for Lemma 3 in [9] is particularly clever. Subsequently, we present the proof of its analogue for arc-spine digraphs, Lemma 2.8. Once again, it is essential to note that the concept of k-tight for spine digraphs differs from the definition of k-tight arc-spine digraphs presented here. Additionally, we highlight that the base case of Lemma 2.8 is significantly more intricate than the base case of Lemma 3 in [9].
