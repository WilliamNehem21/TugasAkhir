Meta-programming involves creating programs that can generate or manipulate other programs. Template Haskell is a recent extension of the Haskell programming language, which is currently integrated into the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, providing support for meta-programming at compile time. The objective of this study is to utilize Template Haskell to statically analyze programs and modify them during the compilation process. In this paper, we use Template Haskell to implement an abstract interpretation-based strictness analysis and a let-to-case transformation that utilizes the results of the analysis. By doing so, we demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of employing this tool in order to integrate new analyses and transformations into the compiler without the need for direct modification.

Template Haskell is an extension of Haskell designed for compile-time meta-programming, allowing a programmer to inspect the code structure of a program, transform the code, create new code, or analyze its properties. The extension is built on top of a monadic library, where the quotation monad encapsulates meta-programming capabilities, such as fresh name generation, and is an extension of the IO monad. The library package language.haskell.th offers syntax construction functions using the quotation monad, enabling the creation and manipulation of program structures. In this study, we employ quasi-quotation mechanisms to analyze and transform Haskell programs, as well as splicing notation to perform these actions at compile time. Furthermore, we utilize a pretty-printing library provided by language.haskell.th for visualizing the results of our examples.

To achieve the transformation function and the strictness analysis, we implement the module "strict," where the Haskell expression is quoted to inspect the abstract syntax tree, and then the tree is modified using the transfm function. Additionally, we use the runq function to extract the transformed expression from the monad, and the ppr function from language.haskell.th.pprlib to print the result. The transformation is carried out at compile time, utilizing the quotation monad to execute computations and ensure type correctness.

The analysis presented in this study is static, resulting in a loss of precision due to the nature of static analysis. We analyze function applications and distinguish between function and constructor applications, as well as handle signature applications and their resulting abstract values. The study explores cases where the abstract value depends on the function's arguments and addresses the implications of these dependencies.

In conclusion, we discuss the potential improvements that could enhance the usefulness of Template Haskell, such as integrating a typing algorithm to retain type information in the syntax tree, which would facilitate type-based analyses.
