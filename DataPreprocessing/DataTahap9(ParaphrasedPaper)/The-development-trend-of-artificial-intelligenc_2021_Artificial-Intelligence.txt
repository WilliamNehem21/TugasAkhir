Collaborations play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of research output and promoting scientific productivity. Previous studies have extensively investigated co-author networks, co-citation networks, word networks, international collaborations, and cross-institution collaborations in academic publications. However, there is a lack of bibliometric and collaboration network analyses based on patents in this interdisciplinary research field.

In this study, data from patent authorities are analyzed, including information such as patent numbers, priority applications, titles, designated states, application details, inventors, assignees, patent details, IPC classification numbers, cited patents, and cited articles. After removing duplicates, a total of 3610 single patent records are obtained, and the data on assignees and patent quantities are organized in an Excel spreadsheet.

The analysis of the quantities of partners and co-owned patent applications reveals that the French public health agent of Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP) holds the highest number of patents, with 31 co-ownership patents and 10 co-assignees. These patents relate to biomarkers for the prognosis of hepatic fibrosis or hepatitis C virus treatment. The extensive international collaboration of AP-HP may be linked to its strategic focus on developing large-scale cooperation projects with other institutions to promote global health.

The findings also indicate specific trends in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the medical field, with a focus on areas such as medical image recognition, computer-aided diagnosis, disease monitoring, disease prediction, bioinformatics, and drug development. This analysis sheds light on the evolving landscape of AI technologies in the medical sector.
