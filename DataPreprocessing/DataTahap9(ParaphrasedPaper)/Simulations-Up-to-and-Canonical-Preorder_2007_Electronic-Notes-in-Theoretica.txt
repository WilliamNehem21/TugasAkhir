All the preorders that establish the meaning within the LTBT spectrum and are less detailed than the ready simulation satisfy the requirements of this lemma, as they are all action factorized. We have also examined an alternative condition in order to obtain a more comprehensive outcome. It is worth noting that the converse of the previous finding does not hold in general, and an additional condition must be imposed to establish it.
Moreover, the results for bisimulations up-to have emerged as a natural consequence for many semantic structures, including those within the LTBT spectrum that are coarser than the ready simulation, in parallel with the corresponding results for simulations up-to (see corollaries 3.7 and 3.15).
