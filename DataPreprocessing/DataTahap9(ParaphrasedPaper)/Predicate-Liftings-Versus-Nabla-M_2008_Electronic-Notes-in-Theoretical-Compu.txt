Additionally, it is feasible to provide inductive representations similar to the preceding one for the scenarios involving products and coproducts, especially in the context of functor products. Singleton liftings hold even greater significance as they serve as the basis for all other predicate liftings, as demonstrated in the subsequent result.

Logical translators are particularly valuable as they can be combined to produce translations for more complex functors. In other words, logical translators can be expanded through products, coproducts, and composition with the covariant power set functor, as summarized in the following result.

The proofs for the presented theorems have already been handled in the text and can be found in the examples. Specific examples, such as 3.13 and 3.14, as well as 3.12 and 2.27, illustrate the cases of coproducts, products, and the power set functor, respectively.

The proof proceeds via induction based on the complexity of t. As evidenced in examples 3.10 and 3.11 from the preceding section, the existence of a logical translator for each singleton lifting of the base cases, namely the identity and constant functors, has been confirmed. The previous theorem suggests that these logical translators can be inductively extended to any singleton lifting for a given kpf t, thus concluding the proof.

We have introduced a novel approach for comparing coalgebraic modal languages, which relies on the use of logical translators for defining translations. The pivotal characteristic of logical translators is their natural transformation, which was essential for the proofs of Theorems 4.2, 4.6, and 5.6.
