The effective representation of target images is crucial for methods of image classification based on representation. The differing pixel intensities between training and test samples pose a challenge in accurately classifying objects. This paper presents a novel method aimed at mitigating this issue for image classification. The method involves generating a new representation, referred to as a virtual image, of the original image, which boosts the importance of moderate pixel intensities while diminishing the impact of larger or smaller pixel intensities. Subsequently, the virtual images and their corresponding original images are separately utilized to represent a test sample and derive two sets of representation results. These results are then merged to classify the test sample. The integration of the original image and its virtual image serves to enhance the accuracy of image classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy compared to conventional classification methods.

Representation-based image classification methods have garnered significant attention within the domain of computer vision. An effective representation of target images is crucial for advancing the performance of image classification. The combination of multiple image representations is deemed an effective approach to enhance the efficacy of representation-based methods. Therefore, identifying appropriate representations for representation-based image classification methods is a pertinent and meaningful area of research.

Several challenges persist in image classification, including variations in poses and expressions, diverse illumination intensities, and inadequate training samples, all of which significantly impact recognition outcomes. To address these challenges, various efforts have been made, such as enhancing pixel intensities to obtain complementary images for improving classification accuracy in the presence of varying illuminations. Additionally, generating mirrored face images and integrating them with original images has proven beneficial for improving recognition accuracy in representation-based face recognition. Methods involving virtual or synthesized face images have also been widely explored, with studies demonstrating the efficacy of integrating original and virtual face images to improve recognition accuracy. Furthermore, exploiting adjacent rows of original images to generate virtual or synthesized face images has shown promise in enhancing image classification accuracy.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the proposed novel representation method for images, while Section 3 outlines the underlying rationale of the proposed method. Section 4 showcases the experimental results, and Section 5 provides the conclusions of this paper.

Our method primarily consists of two procedures. In the first procedure, we obtain the novel representation of original images. By converting an original image into a gray image, we then manipulate pixel intensities based on the idea that different pixel intensities play different roles in representing the object. This manipulation aims to emphasize the moderate intensities of pixels, as important image features are predominantly concentrated in this range. We conduct image classification and face recognition experiments to evaluate our method, demonstrating satisfactory recognition accuracy across multiple databases.

In the experiments involving the ORL database, our method outperformed the original collaborative representation classification (CRC) by improving classification accuracy by 4.28%. Similarly, in experiments with the AR database, our method demonstrated favorable recognition accuracy.
