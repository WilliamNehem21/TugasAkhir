Several studies (et al., 2020; graham et al., 2020; park et al., 2020; wang et al., 2020a) have developed deep learning models that automatically identify distinctive waveform characteristics of the p phase, s phase, and noise in seismic waveforms to make determinations about p and s arrivals. These models, trained with extensive seismic data, demonstrate strong generalization capabilities when presented with new input data. In a separate study, Linville et al. (2019) investigated the use of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to differentiate between explosive and tectonic sources at local distances, achieving a high accuracy of over 99% in classifying the source type of events.

Autoencoders, a type of machine learning model, are employed to learn efficient representations (encoding) from a dataset and subsequently reconstruct the original data from these encoded representations. Deep autoencoders find applications across various domains, including compression, denoising, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction. Notably, autoencoders hold significant promise in extracting features for diverse tasks. In the field of seismology, researchers utilize autoencoders to obtain compressed feature representations that effectively reduce the data to approximately one-third of the input dimensions. This specific type of autoencoder, known as an undercomplete autoencoder, features a bottleneck layer that is smaller than the input dimension. By compressing dimensions in this manner, the autoencoder is compelled to capture the most valuable features of the training data. Conversely, overcomplete autoencoders entail extending the bottleneck layer of the encoder to possess more dimensions than the input, resulting in 1620 input dimensions in our specific case.
