The concept of rule struc is introduced to account for structural congruence and simplify transition system rules. By defining commutativity laws for summation and parallel composition within the structural congruence, it becomes unnecessary to define the dual rules of sum and par. This approach leads to the identification of semantically inactive names for agents, which are unable to change the agent from an external context perspective. Bound names, in particular, can affect internal actions of agents and may be involved in actions that are never performed due to name restrictions. Inactive names are those exclusively involved in either internal actions or actions that are never engaged.

Compound agents are able to engage in internal communications and interact with the external environment using the same actions, as there are no restrictions on the top of expression. This lack of restriction also allows for the calculation of active names directly from expressions for agents without restricted names. The rules [r1] to [r5] are derived from the definitions of structural congruence. Rule [r1] simplifies an agent composed with the stop agent to itself, while rule [r2] eliminates the restriction combinator when the restricted names do not appear as free in the agent. On the other hand, rule [r3] deals with scope extension, keeping the expression size constant by pulling up all restrictions as much as possible.

Furthermore, rules [r4] and [r5] concern replicated agents, removing an agent when it is composed with a replicated copy of itself, and removing a replicated agent when it is composed with itself, respectively. The system cannot remove all inactive actions from expressions even with the new rule, [r6], as bisimilar agents have the same set of active actions. Inactive names can be categorized into free and bound names, with inactive free names exclusively appearing in inactive actions and inactive bound names participating in engageable and unengageable actions. A prototype has been developed to implement the rewriting system by Hirschkoff and the new rules, with rules [r1] to [r7] already implemented and [r8] in progress. While the system has been successfully applied to toy examples, accurate performance data has not yet been recorded.
