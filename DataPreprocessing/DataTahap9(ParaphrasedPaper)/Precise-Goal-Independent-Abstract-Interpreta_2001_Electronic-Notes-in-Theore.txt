This paper is focused exclusively on the independent analysis of pure constraint logic programs, allowing for the development of a semantics and analysis that are not contingent on implementation technology. The paper discusses the need for the semantics to identify two solutions for p/1, one indicating that 1 is a solution and the other indicating that any term can be a solution. Including "xv" would only allow the more general solution, which would hinder analyses requiring the knowledge that 1 is also a solution. The paper does not delve into the analysis for definite freeness or determinacy, but stipulates that the framework should allow for such analyses. The abstract semantics of a program can be defined, contingent on the choice of a specific abstraction as delineated in definition 3.4, with the constructs of the abstraction notionally being parameters to the abstract semantic functions but not specified as such to maintain a manageable definition.

To approximate infinite andor trees, graphs, closely related to rational trees, are utilized. Nilsson replaces the use of and-or trees with context vectors, which associate a set of potential substitutions with each point in the program, effectively sidestepping issues with infinite and-or trees.

Gallagher et al. introduce a goal-independent analysis framework founded on a declarative semantics, which is based on a pre-interpretation of the program. This pre-interpretation constitutes a mapping from the function symbols of the program to a potentially different domain. The domain to which the function symbols of the program are mapped fulfills the role of the abstract domain, and the pre-interpretation mapping serves as a representation function.
