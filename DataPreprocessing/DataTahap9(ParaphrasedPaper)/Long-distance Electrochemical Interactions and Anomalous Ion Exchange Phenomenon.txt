Electrochemical processes typically occur under conditions of overall electric neutrality within a system and its macroscopic components. While the set of electrochemical reactions can be complex, deviations from neutrality usually have a scale determined solely by the Debye length, meaning that known chemical processes do not lead to the emergence of macroscopic electric charge and electric currents.

It is important to note that hydrogels (polymer networks) have been extensively researched in recent decades. These polymer materials are of particular interest due to their marked response to slight variations in external conditions. Initially swelling significantly in water, these hydrogels can undergo drastic volume changes in response to factors such as temperature, ionic strengths of surrounding media, and the influence of electric current.

The interactions between different types of hydrogels have been much less studied compared to the hydrogels themselves, with only isolated reports on this topic in the existing literature. Furthermore, the cited articles are primarily focused on contact interactions of hydrogels. However, we present new findings demonstrating the possibility of electrochemical interactions between specimens placed at considerable distances from each other.

It is evident that the obtained curve is non-monotonic, with the additional swelling of the PAA gel being significantly influenced by the distance l. It is noteworthy that the swelling ratio typically reaches its maximum in pure water compared to other solvents, and the introduction of salt or organic compounds results in the contraction of the specimen with the release of water into the surrounding solution. This higher swelling ratio is indeed surprising.

Similar to the classic swelling of polyelectrolyte hydrogels, the applied electric field plays a dual role, influencing both the charged particles concentrated near the specimen's surface and the decomposition of =NH+2 groups, potentially releasing hydrogen ions. This field also limits the electric charge of both specimens, consequently restricting the total amount of ions involved in the reaction (2).

In this reaction (3), low-molecular ions are partitioned between the hydrogel pair, and low-molecular salt is transferred from the solution into the gel pair volume, indicating an anomalous ion exchange. While typically this reaction cannot occur, it becomes comprehensible in the case of long-distance interactions between hydrogels. Reaction (3) encompasses two distinct processes taking place in different specimens.

The most evident applications of the observed phenomenon are closely related to ion exchange, such as in water purification and enrichment technologies. However, anomalous ion exchange offers distinct advantages. Firstly, the ionic exchange system based on long-distance interactions between hydrogels is easily renewable, requiring only mechanical stress to release concentrated salt solution. Secondly, anomalous ion exchange presents the capability to remove arbitrary salts from solution, among other benefits.

Therefore, interactions between acid and protonized polymer hydrogels serve as an example of a chemical process leading to the appearance of macroscopic electric charge. This charge can be regarded as a chemical signal that can propagate over considerable distances and be utilized for the development of artificial neuron networks in the future. Other potential applications of the observed phenomena are associated with anomalous ion exchange, for instance, for the deep purification of water solutions from low-molecular salts.
