This paper presents a survey of measures used to approximate stochastic processes. The focus is on Markovian processes in discrete time that evolve on state spaces with infinite cardinality and proper measurability and metric structures. The paper discusses approximation metrics between two such processes, with a particular emphasis on the notion of probabilistic bisimulation. It proposes two distinct ways to introduce metrics between processes: one approach utilizes probabilistic conditional kernels and concepts from algebra, logic, or category theory, while the other focuses on distances between trajectories of the processes and is based on their dynamical properties.

The paper concentrates on probabilistic processes with general (continuous) state spaces and aims to survey and discuss approximation metrics between pairs of such processes. It gives an overview of results from the literature based on the notion of approximate bisimulation, specifically focusing on the strong version of bisimulation. The paper also touches upon the concept of probabilistic simulations and their relevance in applications, building on earlier work on approximation techniques such as lumpability for Markov chains.

In addition to discussing bisimulation, the paper explores the use of categorical arguments and coalgebraic notions to introduce probabilistic bisimulation relations for continuous-space processes. It also presents an approach based on randomization techniques to characterize approximation distances between processes over finite time horizons, without assumptions on their dynamics.

The paper introduces exact and approximate notions of bisimulations for certain processes and discusses their relations, logics, and categories. It also explores discounted metrics over probability measures and their relation to bisimulation as a fixed point, as well as provides conditions to construct an sbf for certain classes of continuous-time stochastic processes.

Furthermore, the paper presents an approach that examines sample trajectories of processes over finite horizons, focusing on the autonomous case. It also discusses the use of metrics on probability distributions and leverages Wasserstein pseudometrics between processes. The paper highlights the differences in approaches to the problem between the dependability and formal verification community and the systems and control field, as well as outlines the use of metrics in quantifying distances between processes.

Finally, the paper puts forward a procedure for constructing a discrete approximation of a diffusion process, based on the discretization of space and time, and discusses its probabilistic bisimilarity to the original process within a certain approximation precision.
