The paper discusses the classification of the complexity of satisfiability problems arising from an infinite number of finite sets of boolean functions. It introduces algebraic tools to classify the complexity of these satisfiability problems and defines a set of boolean functions as a clone if it is closed under superposition, containing all projections, and closed under arbitrary composition. The paper also introduces the concept of a base for a set of boolean functions and the notation [b] for the smallest clone containing b.

The paper also discusses the membership and hardness of these problems in the EXPTIME complexity class, citing specific theorems to support the claims. It additionally addresses the complexity of checking the syntactical correctness of the given formula and proposes a promise problem, ctl-satp(t, b), for deciding the satisfiability of a given syntactically correct ctl(t, b)-formula. Furthermore, the paper refines a theorem for subclasses of TC0 to classify the complexity of ctl-sat(t, b) beyond its syntactical correctness.
