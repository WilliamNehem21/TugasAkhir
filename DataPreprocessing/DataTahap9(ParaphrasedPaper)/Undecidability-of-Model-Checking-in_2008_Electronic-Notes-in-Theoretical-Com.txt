The brane calculus is designed to model the structure and dynamics of biological membranes. Prior work introduced a logic called brane logic for expressing properties of systems in this calculus. The paper addresses the important question of whether model checking for this logic is decidable. The authors previously demonstrated the decidability of model checking for replication-free systems and guarantee-free formulas. However, in this paper, they prove that model checking becomes undecidable when replication is allowed in systems or when guarantee constructors are present in formulas, including quantifiers. Additionally, the paper establishes a correspondence between membranes and systems, showing that any system can be represented by a canonical one with all information contained within a membrane enclosing an empty compartment.

The paper also discusses the interaction of two spatial logics—membrane logic for reasoning about membranes and system logic for reasoning about systems—due to the actions taking place on membranes. It is shown that unbounded replication in processes within membranes or systems leads to undecidability of model checking for the brane calculus against brane logic, even with a limited fragment of the logic containing only propositional connectives, temporal and spatial modalities, and the compartment connective.

The concept of "mateop" is introduced as a mechanism for encoding the ability to attach actions on strings in the brane calculus. The encoding approach frames the composition of the brane calculus as a (multi-)set constructor, and it straightforwardly encodes finite domains and structures using action names for domain elements and relational symbols.

In summary, the paper presents results demonstrating the undecidability of model checking for the fragment of brane logic with quantifiers and adjoints in the absence of replication, builds a correspondence between membranes and systems, and proposes potential extensions of the findings to other variants of the brane calculus with sufficient expressive power, such as the projective branes.
