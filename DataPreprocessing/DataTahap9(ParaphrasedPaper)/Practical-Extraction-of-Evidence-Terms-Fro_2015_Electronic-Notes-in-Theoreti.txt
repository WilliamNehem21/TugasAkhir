The exploration of epistemic reasoning, which involves reasoning about knowledge and belief, is a fundamental area in computer science and artificial intelligence. Traditional formal epistemology systems rely on modal logics and have been the focus of extensive research in recent decades. There are various computer-aided systems for modal and epistemic reasoning available.

A significant advancement in this field has been the incorporation of the concept of justification into modal epistemic logic, expanding its applicability. This enhancement allows for not only reasoning about agents' knowledge and beliefs, but also tracking their justifications and determining which justifications are relevant to specific facts and sufficient for reaching epistemic conclusions. Consequently, the notion of evidence has become a subject of thorough investigation.

This development was implemented using OCaml. Evaluating box families, which might seem straightforward in theory, posed a significant challenge. Each box was assigned a unique family identifier, and the algorithm recursively traversed the proof tree, assigning these identifiers and gathering information about their related families. The maintenance of disjoint sets of box identifiers belonging to the same family was crucial. Additionally, the algorithm had to track the transformation of formulas at each step when applying a rule.

A direct formalization of epistemic logic can lead to inconsistent sets of hypotheses for certain puzzles. For example, in a specific puzzle scenario, it was necessary to represent some modalities as proof terms and modify the conclusion to account for everyone knowing about themselves at a specific moment. However, due to the increased complexity, the transformation was not performed for the longer version of the puzzle.

Although the theorem could be proven by unfolding all disjunctions, it caused difficulties for the automated proving system, which failed to find the proof within a reasonable time frame. This theorem posed a greater challenge than the muddy children puzzle for four children, which could be solved relatively quickly. The reason for the difficulty in the automated mode lies in the need for twice the usage of certain assumptions in the reasoning process, resulting in an expanded search space that delayed finding a solution. The muddy children puzzle also required an expanded search space, but in that case, the automated system was able to find a solution more efficiently, although the exact reason for this difference is not fully understood.
