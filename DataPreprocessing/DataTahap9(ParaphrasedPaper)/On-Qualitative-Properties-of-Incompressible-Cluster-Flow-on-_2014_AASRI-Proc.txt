The study discusses the qualitative characteristics of incompressible cluster flow on a ring network and presents simulation results using a newly developed node model software. The software enables the creation of a cluster movement simulation in a closed necklace comprising 2n rings, allowing users to specify cluster length and density as well as the number of rings in the necklace. Additionally, the software marks adjacent nodes with vertical lines that cross proper contours. The article presents main properties and simulation results of the incompressible cluster flow on the ring network, and provides propositions and proofs of these results and properties through simulation. Moreover, the study demonstrates that if cluster k2 approaches common node b, cluster k1 must pass through this node at a specific time period, as node a is occupied by k2. It is also concluded that when k2 stops at node b, k1 cannot pass through a.
