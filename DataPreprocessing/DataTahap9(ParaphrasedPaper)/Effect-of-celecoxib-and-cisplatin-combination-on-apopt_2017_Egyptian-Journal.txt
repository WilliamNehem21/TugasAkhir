Morphologically, abnormal crypts may appear as a singular modified crypt or as a cluster of modified crypts forming a focus termed aberrant crypt foci (ACF). Histologically, ACF represent a heterogeneous group of intraepithelial lesions demonstrating variable features, ranging from nearly normal or mild atypia to severe dysplasia. ACF are indicative of preneoplastic lesions suggesting the early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis in both rodents and humans. They are characterized by larger size, increased pericryptic zone, and a thicker epithelial lining. Therefore, the examination of ACF development is valuable in rodent chemoprevention studies.

Additionally, COX-2 is known to be overexpressed in various solid tumors such as prostate, colon, lung, and liver cancer. Consequently, drugs that inhibit the COX-2 enzyme hold promise as chemopreventive agents.

This study aimed to investigate the chemopreventive impact of a combination of cisplatin and celecoxib in 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon ACF in mice. The expression of intratumoral caspase-3, bcl2, and bax was evaluated to explore the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining was also used to assess the influence of the combination therapy on cell proliferation.

The mice were housed in groups and efforts were made to minimize their suffering. The experimental procedures were approved by the institutional research ethics committee. Following the experiment, the mice were anesthetized and sacrificed, and the colon sections were examined to assess the impact of the treatments.

In conclusion, the study indicated that celecoxib inhibits tumor growth and enhances the antitumor effect of cisplatin in DMH-induced ACF in mice. This effect appears to be mediated at least in part by the induction of apoptosis and the suppression of cell proliferation. Therefore, celecoxib shows promise as an additional drug for colon cancer treatment.
