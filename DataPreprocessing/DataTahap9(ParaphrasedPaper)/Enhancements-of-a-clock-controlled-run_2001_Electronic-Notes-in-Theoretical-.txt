Our contribution involves introducing improvements to the generator examined in previously studied work. The newly designed generators incorporate additional LFSRs, employ diverse clocking schemes, and utilize different output functions. We explore their cryptographic characteristics and their resilience against specific established attacks on stream ciphers.
