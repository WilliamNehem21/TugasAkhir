Contemporary interactive theorem proving allows for the validation of intricate theorems and complex algorithms, but the procedure is still arduous and time-consuming. We assert that the utilization of other tools, such as computer algebra systems (CAS), can hasten this process in numerous cases. While there have been notable advancements in integrating provers with external tools, as detailed in prior research, the growing complexity of present proof developments presents novel requirements and difficulties for tool integrations.
