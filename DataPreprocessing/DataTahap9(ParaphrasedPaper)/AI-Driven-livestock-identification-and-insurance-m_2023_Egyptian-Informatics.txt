Precise identification is crucial when it comes to cattle. Cattle identification can be broadly divided into two categories: contact and non-contact methods. Contact methods involve techniques like branding, ear tags, implants, and tattoos, which, although effective to some extent, can be easily circumvented and cause stress or pain to the animals. On the other hand, non-contact methods leverage AI-based technologies for biometric identification and machine learning models.

In recent years, advancements in AI and biometrics have made it easier to accurately identify not just humans but also animals. Biometric identification of cattle can be vital for numerous applications, such as managing fraudulent livestock insurance claims. To address this issue, an automated intelligent cattle identification and insurance claim management system is proposed, utilizing unique biometric features like cattle muzzle prints to track accurate identity by matching relevant information with preserved datasets.

This system not only aids in detecting false insurance claims but also contributes to monitoring cattle for their health, safety, and management. Traditional cattle recognition approaches, such as ear tagging and implanting microchips, have drawbacks in terms of efficiency and cost, which the proposed system aims to overcome.

The proposed system offers a wide range of potential applications, including accurate and efficient tracking of individual cattle for breeding or medical purposes, monitoring their behavior and movement within feedlots, and identifying lost or stolen animals. By leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, the system provides a rapid and precise method for identifying specific cattle based on their unique biometric characteristics, offering significant advantages over traditional identification methods.

The paper comprises a literature review, research methodology, performance evaluation of the proposed model, and recommendations for future research. It also discusses the historical and recent techniques used for cattle identification, including face recognition, RFID chips, and texture fusion techniques.

The paper also presents the technical details of the proposed model, including the use of the YOLOv7 object detection model and its deployment on the cloud. It explains the scale-space representation used for key-point localization and descriptor calculation, as well as the feature matching algorithm FLANN for muzzle pattern recognition. The proposed system demonstrates impressive results, achieving high detection and identification accuracy rates.

In conclusion, the paper introduces a novel approach based on YOLOv7 techniques of object detection and presents experimental results showing the effectiveness of the proposed model for cattle identification and management. The use of advanced computer vision and deep learning technologies offers promising potential for revolutionizing cattle management and tracking within the agricultural sector.
