From the viewpoint of physical sciences, the concept of voltage is associated with various physical quantities such as radiation pressures, water levels, pressures, temperature differences, and concentration differences in chemistry. Likewise, the concept of current corresponds to radiation flows, water, gas and heat flows, as well as chemical reaction product flows. Therefore, the definition of resistance (or conductivity) parameters can be extended to physical and chemical systems, as well as linked to the properties and shape of composite materials.

Drawing examples from species and populations, exogenous pressures stemming from food, security, habitat, and natural conditions can be equated to input voltage, while the balancing of exogenous pressures requires the presentation of system status and behavioral responses as inputs of certain things, energies, or information, akin to input current. Similarly, endogenous pressures from input effects or the environment can be reduced to output pressures, necessitating the presentation of system status and behavioral adjustments as outputs of certain things, energies, or information, like output current.

Cognitive and psychological system objects fall within the monitoring subsystem of the human individual, where input information originates from external (physical, biological, and social) environments, as well as from adjustments of the internal state caused by the environment. Output information, partly dependent on memory and evaluation units, forms the feedback quantity that directly impacts human decision-making and controls internal and external behavior. Despite the multi-dimensional and staggered nature of input and output, parameter expansion holds significance for using external information, adjusting internal state, and generating information output.

In order to limit the scope of assimilation structure to self-organizing systems and differentiate them from man-made systems, the exploration of historical evolution can be pursued through the consideration of micro-structural changes as distinct technical topics. Any intervention's influence on the system may be confined to functional parameters within a short period or small scope, but it still alters the relationship between system structure and function. Long-term or large-scale changes in external conditions may lead to a substantial shift in this relationship.

The determination of the general applicability of the assimilation rule holds significant theoretical value and is economically justified. Structural changes can be categorized as regularity/stability, contingency, or assimilation, with the latter attributed to specific object evolutionary changes when excluding the first two factors.

Feedback is a common feature of abstract biological systems, whereby internal functions adjust to environmental changes, including changes in external structure and forms. The assimilation rule aids in seeking scientific explanations for these adjustments. At the level of single cells and genetic processes, input and output environments not only encompass internal biological conditions but also external natural (physical or chemical) conditions. Thus, the assimilation rule can provide meaningful insights at this level, aiding in resolving the controversy between Darwinism and Lamarckism.

The proposition of the assimilation rule introduces a new scientific orientation for understanding the formation and development of species based on various theoretical foundations. By identifying changes in external environmental factors through assimilation methods, a more comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary process can be achieved.

The brain and the parameters governing nerve organs and tissues undergo internal assimilation changes in response to changes in external environmental conditions, leading to adaptive advantages and indirect impacts on the environment. This indirect influence creates external conditions for the recurrence of the internalization process, resulting in tendentious changes in the organizational structure of cognitive organs and supporting the enhancement of specific functions.

For various social organization systems, the range of objects subject to the assimilation rule is broad and intersecting, forming the components of the environment. The logical relationship of the assimilation process is expected to complement existing theoretical foundations.

When the changes in external parameters exceed the adjustment scope of the original system functions, the assimilation of the altered system structure begins. At this point, shocks from changes in members' sharing demands or the general environment can exert pressure on the system structure. If these pressures accumulate without release, they can potentially destabilize the system structure, leading to spontaneous changes in communication rules and the development of vicious competition.

From a systematology perspective, health reflects the strength and stability of human regulatory functions, partly influenced by external environmental factors according to the assimilation rule. Therefore, moderate exercise and exposure to small amounts of harmful factors, including immune therapy, can serve as means to maintain or enhance human health.
