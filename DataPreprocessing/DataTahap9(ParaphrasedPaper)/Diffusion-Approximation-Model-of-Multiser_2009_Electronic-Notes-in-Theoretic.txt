We utilize the diffusion approximation to investigate a classical queueing model of type g/g/n/n, which has been known in its Markovian and steady-state versions since the era of Erlang. By employing the diffusion approximation, we are able to accommodate general interarrival times and general service times, and to address transient states within the model. We then apply this approach to simulate a sliding window mechanism and to assess the performance of a call center.

Furthermore, we extend this method to incorporate piecewise-constant diffusion parameters that depend on the value of the diffusion process. The key idea is to introduce artificial barriers between subintervals, each of which has constant parameters for the diffusion process. We have previously utilized such barriers to manipulate probability flows representing jumps of the diffusion process in a model of an electronic-optical node and to represent space-heterogeneous failures in hop-by-hop transmission in sensor networks. In the context of the g/g/n/n model, the subintervals separated by barriers have unitary length and correspond to a fixed number of busy service channels: the interval (0, 1] corresponds to one busy channel, the interval (1, 2] corresponds to two busy channels, and so on. For the g/g/n/n+m model, the last interval has a length of m+1 units.
