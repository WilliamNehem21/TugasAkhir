The academic paper focuses on applying social network analysis techniques to quantify the belongingness and individual performances of cricket players within a team. It emphasizes the importance of team formation in team sports and proposes using nodes as players and interactions between them as edges. The paper discusses the small world characteristics of the T-20 cricket network and explores centrality measures and clustering coefficient techniques from the viewpoint of cricket network.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: 

- Section 2 discusses related works. 
- Section 3 presents the proposed approach for team formation and highlights the small world characteristics of the T-20 cricket network. 
- Section 4 evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and compares it with IPL T-20 session 2016. 
- Section 5 provides a brief discussion comparing other best team formation approaches with the proposed approach. 
- Finally, the paper concludes in Section 6.

The authors emphasize the importance of the cricket network being a small world network in order to use centrality measures and clustering coefficients to detect key players. They note that even though most nodes are not directly connected in a small world, the distance between two nodes is significantly less, and the nodes connecting other nodes play a significant role in the network.

The paper elaborates on the significance of the clustering coefficient of a node in the cricket network, which signifies the characteristics of the node forming a local cluster that influences other nodes. It explains that dense local clusters signify a node's great influence on other nodes, and discusses the variation in clustering coefficients between 0 (no clustering) and 1 (maximum clustering).

The paper also discusses centrality measures, particularly degree distribution, as the simplest one. It explains the degree of a node in a network as determined by the total number of outgoing and ingoing edges from that node, and elaborates on degree distribution in directed and undirected graphs and in weighted networks.

Finally, the paper provides analysis and comparison of team compositions in the IPL season 2016, highlighting the performance of team Royal Challengers Bangalore and other teams with a maximum number of players from the proposed best teams.
