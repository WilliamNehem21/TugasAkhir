This paper presents fundamental concepts necessary for formalizing intentional systems in a computational framework. It begins by providing a brief overview of the concept of intentionality and then proceeds to outline different types of intentional acts, defining intentional processes and intentional systems. The paper then establishes the foundation for a formal model of intentional systems. Additionally, it presents a formal model for a constative intentional system through a case study and highlights the remaining features required for a comprehensive formal model of intentional systems. Finally, it discusses the relationship between the formal model of intentional systems introduced in the paper and the typical semantic models for formal languages.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the concepts of intentional act and intentional process. In Section 3, the formal concept of intentional system is introduced, serving as the basis for formal modeling of intentional processes. Section 4 contains a simple case study, offering a practical example of the ideas presented. The conclusion in Section 5 discusses related works and general issues.

For simplicity, the paper considers intentional processes that comprise nonempty sets with a single intentional act, denoted as an element of iacts, and assumes time to be discrete and linearly ordered (t= 0, 1, 2,â€¦).

The paper does not specify when a predication is true of an object or when an object (or predication) fulfills the condition of being of a given type. This issue is left open for discussion in Section 5.

The paper also compares the scope of semantical issues addressed by the new perspective with those addressed by conventional semantic perspectives adopted in formal language systems (both logical and computational). It notes that logical semantics, while reducing the range compared to Husserlian semantics, still considers eidetic elements related to language. Furthermore, it discusses intensional semantics and empiricist semantics, highlighting their approaches to language and objects.
