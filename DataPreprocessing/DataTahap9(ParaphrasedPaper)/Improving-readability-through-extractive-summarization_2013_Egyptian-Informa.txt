The development and assessment of summary systems should take into account three categories of contextual factors: input factors, purpose factors, and output factors. While most existing summarization systems are designed for general use, there are specialized versions tailored to assist individuals with disabilities, such as those who are blind or deaf. The design and evaluation of these systems are primarily influenced by the intended audience and purpose. In this paper, we focus on learners with reading difficulties, such as those who can decode text but struggle to comprehend its content. Many of these students have trouble identifying key ideas and important supporting details, often due to difficulties in employing effective learning strategies, which are common in learning disabilities.

The objective of our assistive summarization approach is to improve the readability of text for individuals with reading difficulties, thereby enhancing their understanding of the content. We address the challenge of limited working memory span experienced by the target audience by considering features such as unfamiliar vocabulary, trigger words, polysyllabic words, and noun occurrences, which can contribute to working memory difficulties. Our approach involves extracting sentences that are both important and easily readable to the target audience. We aim to generate summaries that contain key, comprehensible sentences.

To achieve this, we have proposed a set of readability-related features tailored to learners, which work in combination with existing features for sentence extraction. We use a naive Bayes classifier to classify sentences as either being part of a summary or not, and then extract sentences based on the weighted score of individual features. We conduct both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations to assess the performance of the summary, with a particular emphasis on the task of comprehension for individuals with reading difficulties.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we review related work in text summarization; Section 3 outlines our proposed methodology for summary extraction; and in Section 4, we analyze the results of our approach using both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods.

Numerous research efforts have proposed and evaluated methods for text summarization, with two main approaches being extraction and abstraction. Extraction involves concatenating excerpts from the source material into a summary, while abstraction involves generating new sentences based on information extracted from the source.

Our approach involves using a trainable summarizer to extract existing features (such as sentence position, keywords, title similarity, and centrality) along with proposed features (such as sentence length, trigger words, polysyllabic words, and noun occurrences). We calculate a score for each sentence using a weighted combination of these features, with the weights determined using a genetic algorithm. The primary objective of our work is to generate a summary of the given text.

Additionally, we analyze the individual contribution and independence of each feature in predicting summary sentences, as well as the correlation between these features. For instance, we highlight the significance of factors such as sentence position and noun occurrences in determining the importance and readability of sentences for individuals with reading difficulties.

Our proposed method for generating summaries is preferred by both individuals with reading difficulties and those without. However, a few opt for other options due to their cohesive nature or confusion in selecting the preferred summary. Another form of extrinsic evaluation for summarization is the reading comprehension task, wherein users are presented with either the full source text or the full text supplemented with a summary, followed by multiple-choice questions related to the source information. This evaluation framework is based on the idea that effective summaries should be able to assist users in comprehending the full source, rather than replacing it.

We also assess comprehension of the information from the text using objective comprehension questions, such as factual and inferential questions. We analyze learner responses to ascertain the impact of our proposed summary on reading difficulties as compared to existing methods. Our findings indicate that the proposed summary has a significant effect on individuals with reading difficulties due to the consideration of readability-related features. This supports the notion that improving text comprehension for individuals with reading difficulties necessitates various simplification strategies.
