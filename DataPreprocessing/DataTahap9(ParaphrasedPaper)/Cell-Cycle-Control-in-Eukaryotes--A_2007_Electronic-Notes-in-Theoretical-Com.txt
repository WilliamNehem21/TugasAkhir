This paper introduces a stochastic model for the regulation of the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells, utilizing a framework based on stochastic process algebras for mobile systems. The simulations are performed using the biospi automatic tool, and the proposed approach is compared to classical ordinary differential equation (ODE) specifications.

The activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) can be regulated through three mechanisms: availability of cyclin subunits, stoichiometric binding to cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), and phosphorylation of CDK subunits. While most CDKs are present in constant abundance throughout the cell cycle, the abundance of cyclin depends on the rates of cyclin synthesis and degradation, both of which are regulated during the cell cycle. The synthesis and degradation rates of the stoichiometric inhibitor CKI of cyclin/CDK dimers are also regulated during the cell cycle. Additionally, the activity of CDKs can be inhibited by phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue, which varies during the cell cycle due to fluctuations in the activity of the tyrosine kinase Wee1 and tyrosine phosphatase Cdc25.

The operational semantics of the calculus define the dynamic behavior of the modeled system based on a race condition, resulting in a probabilistic model of computation. In this model, all enabled activities in a state compete with each other, with the fastest activity prevailing. The continuity of exponential distributions ensures that the probability of two activities ending simultaneously is zero.

The state of the cyclin process (cyclin bound) is represented by three reactions that the cyclin/CDK dimer can undergo: cyclin subunit degradation (degcyc), binding with a CKI (cyc cdk cki) to form the trimer cyclin/CDK/CKI (trim), or degradation of the CKI subunit (degcki). The active form of the CDH1 protein (cdh1) can degrade cyclin (degrcyc), be inactivated (inact) by joining with a phosphate group, or be activated by CDC14 (actcdc14), which removes the phosphate. The trimer cyc cdk cki can either resolve into the dimer cyclin/CDK (dim) or remain unchanged (nothing).
