The occurrence of repeated observations by an agent, without any intermediate actions by that same agent, signals the involvement of another agent's action. In order to align the definition with the assumption of asynchrony and remove timing-based reasoning, the function cond is applied to this definition. The concept of labelled transition systems is discussed by McCullough, who indicates that the definition based on labelled transition systems is more robust. This aligns closely with the concept of unwinding relation, which aids in proving traditional noninterference on deterministic systems.

The primary focus of this paper is on verification methods and complexity outcomes for the security properties mentioned in the preceding section. These properties cannot be directly expressed within the traditional safety-liveness framework, as they do not impose a constraint on individual system executions, but rather on the collection of all potential executions. Therefore, new techniques need to be developed for their verification.
