The concept of crowdsourcing has gained widespread acceptance in various application domains, but it is accompanied by risks related to the quality of human computation due to the open nature of web-based platforms. This paper proposes a combined approach using trust-based access control (TBAC) and fuzzy expert systems to address these risks and enhance the quality of human computation in crowdsourcing environments. The TBAC-fuzzy algorithm developed in this study computes trust values and priority values, and uses these to make access decisions for crowd workers. The findings demonstrate that the use of TBAC can indeed improve the quality of human computation in crowdsourcing environments.

In the context of online transactions, quality factors such as response time, predictability, scalability, and usability are aggregated from quality attribute (QA) models. This paper focuses specifically on trust-based access control (TBAC) as a means to address confidentiality and transaction integrity. Trust models and access control mechanisms based on trust calculations using fuzzy approaches are explored as a way to handle security issues in online environments, with a particular emphasis on crowdsourcing settings.

The paper elaborates on an example of an internet encyclopedia as a crowdsourcing environment, where trust values and priority levels are utilized to determine access rights for crowd workers, thereby improving the quality of computation. A postprocessing module is employed to define access rights based on the outputs of the fuzzy expert system, and the trust values of the crowd workers are determined using predefined initial values and fuzzy rules simulated in MATLAB.

The study also investigates the issue of trust in crowdsourcing and its impact on response quality, particularly in relation to addressing problems with answer ranking and potential worker dishonesty. The proposed approach of integrating trust-based access control and fuzzy expert systems demonstrates promising results in enhancing the quality of response and service from crowd workers. Experimental results conducted using systematically generated values in MATLAB highlight the potential for obtaining high-quality responses from crowd workers through the implementation of the trust-based access control fuzzy algorithm.
