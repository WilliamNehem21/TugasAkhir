Weighted finite automata (WFA) are used to define real functions, such as grayness functions for graytone images. The paper presents an inference algorithm that can convert an arbitrary function, represented as a graytone image, into a WFA that is capable of regenerating it. Additionally, the theoretical concept of cooperating distributed weighted finite automata with n-components (n-WFA) is introduced and its power in various acceptance modes is studied. The paper also provides an inference algorithm and a de-inference algorithm for the n-WFA.

Section 2 of the paper presents the initial definitions of weighted finite automata and their applications in the context of digital images. In Section 3, the construct of cooperating distributed weighted finite automata is introduced, along with an exploration of its acceptance power in different modes. This section also discusses the representation of gray-scale images using n-WFA, and provides an inference algorithm and de-inference algorithm for the n-WFA. Finally, Section 4 outlines the conclusions drawn from the research presented in the paper.
