The progress in molecular machine learning relies on the collaboration between academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Although both sectors share common research questions and long-term objectives, their approaches and focuses differ. This article highlights the potential for machine learning models to enhance the selection of chemical compounds, discussing various stages of the model life cycle, such as data preparation, model building, validation, and deployment. It also delves into the challenges of molecular machine learning, the disparities between academia and industry, and the application of models in the design-make-test-analyze cycle. The article concludes by proposing strategies to improve collaboration between academic and industrial institutions to advance the field further.

The outlook on machine learning models in small-molecule drug discovery covers aspects of model construction, challenges, and opportunities for researchers in both academia and industry, as well as potential synergies between the two. Emphasizing experimental data over calculated data, the article addresses the need for homogenizing diverse data sources and integrating models into drug design platforms accessible to medicinal chemists. Furthermore, the article discusses the importance of continuous model promotion and education and the challenge of knowledge transfer, especially with limited training and financial support in academic settings.

The article also touches upon the impact of using models in experimental selection and how it influences data generation and model re-training. It explores the potential challenges posed by feedback loops and suggests the development of interpretation methods to improve future models. Additionally, it discusses the concept of federated learning as an alternative approach for industry-industry collaborations, related to training ml models using proprietary data and its adaptability to academia-industry collaborations.

The article also highlights the convergence of open-source tools used for machine learning in academia and industry, leading to opportunities for collaboration. It cites examples of collaborations, such as the MLPDS initiative, where academia-industry partnerships drive research toward real-world applications. Lastly, the article discusses the gap between exploratory and applied research work, suggesting that increased collaboration efforts and data/code sharing could bridge this divide.

In conclusion, the article anticipates the decreasing divide between academia and industry in the field of machine learning due to the translation of new developments into industrial applications. It identifies ongoing research areas, such as uncertainty estimation and machine learning explainability, as critical for the future impact of machine learning in molecule discovery.
