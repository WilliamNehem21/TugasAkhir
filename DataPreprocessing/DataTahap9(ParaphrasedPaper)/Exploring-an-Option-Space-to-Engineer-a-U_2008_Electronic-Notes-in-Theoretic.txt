As technology advances, the implementation of smart built environments through the use of public displays, location sensors, and mobile devices has become more viable in various settings. These smart environments have the potential to influence the behavior and experiences of their occupants by providing information and services to support their different roles and activities. The development of these systems presents interesting challenges in human and system engineering.

There are several approaches to examining usability in ubiquitous computing systems. Analysis can involve scenarios that capture typical or extreme situations or the use of personas to challenge designer assumptions about system users. The interaction between users and the system, both personally with their own devices and publicly with shared displays in the built environment, should be transparent and intuitive, without the system exerting controlling influence over the user. Informal analysis techniques, such as cognitive walkthroughs, cooperative evaluations, and heuristic evaluations, can offer valuable early feedback on certain aspects of the design. However, new and complex characteristics need to be considered in these systems.

Formal models can be developed to capture different aspects of ubiquitous systems, which can be explored through simulation or property checking. This allows for the exploration of alternative design options at a relatively low cost prior to system implementation. Two primary concerns in the modeling process are identifying relevant properties and capturing aspects related to information deployment, activity scheduling, and location-related issues.

The interaction between users and the system in environments utilizing public displays, mobile devices, and sensors may be unexpectedly influenced by factors such as location, task status, and external effects created by the ubiquitous environment. Timing issues, specifically the timeliness and relevance of message delivery to individuals and locations, can also impact user-system interaction. Additionally, it may be essential to consider the way in which environmental information provides resources for users as they engage in their activities. For example, a dynamic signage system installed at a university is used as an example to explore alternative designs and system properties, incorporating simple user assumptions.

The Gaudi system, designed to assist people in navigating complex built environments like large office buildings, replaces static signage and directories with dynamic situated displays. The user interface consists of two parts: a large touchscreen displaying labeled photographs of office owners and meeting rooms, and situated displays throughout the building that show arrows guiding visitors to their desired destinations. The system aims to provide calm technology by guiding visitors to their destinations without overwhelming them with information.

The model also makes assumptions about how visitors respond to potential collisions, considering hypothetical behaviors in the smart environment. These assumptions could be further explored using a stochastic model like Prism to investigate likely error behavior.

The model serves as a basis for exploring properties, which could be identified through a process similar to eliciting snapshot experiences and then automatically checked against the model. This property checking process may generate traces that form the basis for further scenarios.

The model also allows for the exploration of counterexamples to properties, providing a basis for alternative models to examine scenarios where visitors might deviate from expected behaviors. These counterexamples help in evaluating usability considerations within the system design.
