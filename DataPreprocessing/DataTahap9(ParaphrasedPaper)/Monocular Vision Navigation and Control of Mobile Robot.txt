This academic paper presents the development of an autonomous vision navigation system for a small mobile robot, specifically the Adept Mobile Robots PT 3-AT. The system is designed for traveling along known outdoor routes, including both unstructured and structured roads. It utilizes multiple modules, such as the recognition module, stop line recognition module, zebra crossing recognition module, obstacle sensing module, control module, and communication module. The system employs multi-threading technology to integrate these modules within the same control cycle and utilizes an automatic state machine to switch between different control modes. Experimental results demonstrate that the robot can autonomously navigate predetermined routes and operate stably under good lighting conditions.

Compared to intelligent vehicles, small intelligent mobile robotics face distinct challenges such as low image stability, low control precision, different turning mechanisms, and narrow shooting angles due to low camera height. Consequently, they require higher environmental awareness, collaboration of multi-sensor technology, and self-control capabilities. In the context of environmental exploration and cruise tasks, small intelligent mobile robots can offer distinct advantages.

The system encompasses various states within a finite state machine, including straight traveling, turning, and road finding, each of which is governed by designed strategies and rules. When the system enters the stop state, it automatically transitions into a manual control mode, allowing users to send commands to control the robot through an upper machine client.

Specifically designed algorithms for road-edge detection are implemented for both structured and unstructured roads, including color-based threshold segmentation and grayscale-based extension algorithms. Additionally, a high-contrast sign composed of yellow and black is used to mark accurate turning points. Despite the challenges posed by using only a monocular camera, the vision algorithms provide distance and angle deviations, which are used as input fuzzy parameters for control strategy design.

Furthermore, the paper details the robot's global coordinate system, the definition of distance and angle deviations, the use of fuzzy controllers based on the deviation data, and the implementation of path-finding strategies after turning. The addition of a fuzzy controller is shown to enhance the stability and accuracy of the robot's navigation, reducing oscillations and overshooting.

In summary, the research demonstrates the successful integration of computer vision, pattern recognition, and fuzzy control technologies to enable intelligent visual navigation on a small robot platform. Through well-designed vision navigation, the small mobile robot can effectively accomplish autonomous cruising tasks under favorable lighting conditions on both structured and unstructured outdoor roads.
