This paper reconsiders the study of connected square network graphs (CSNG) as investigated by Selcuk (2022) and Selcuk and Tankul (2022). Despite being a 2-dimensional mesh structure, CSNG is distinguished by being a hypercube variant. Consequently, this study concentrates on developing algorithms that solve a variety of problems for CSNG utilizing the hypercube concept. The paper presents an efficient algorithm for finding the Hamiltonian path, as well as two distinct algorithms for label mapping and unicast routing. Furthermore, it discusses the parallel process for mapping and unicast routing, and offers guidelines for broadcasting algorithms.

Motivated by previous work (15,16), this paper introduces new algorithms for CSNG. Section 2 provides an overview of CSNG, the divide and conquer method, dynamic programming, the traveling salesman problem, the routing problem, and the broadcasting problem. Section 3 introduces a new Hamiltonian path algorithm employing dynamic programming techniques. Additionally, algorithms are provided for mapping and routing, along with a discussion on the parallel process for these algorithms in section 4. Finally, broadcasting algorithms are described for CSNG using broadcasting algorithms for hypercubes.

The divide and conquer algorithm is applied to various graph structures. The paper presents a divide and conquer method for solving tridiagonal systems on hypercube interconnection graph and offers a generic implementation of algorithms on hypercube structures such as routing. Furthermore, it proposes divide and conquer mapping for efficient execution of parallel computers with a hypercube structure. In addition, the paper embeds a binomial tree onto 3D mesh and torus interconnection networks and introduces a divide and conquer routing algorithm. It also presents mapping algorithms for 2D meshes and hybrid GPU-CPU networks.

The paper discusses the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which involves finding the shortest tour a seller takes visiting each city only once. It explains the concept of Hamiltonian paths and cycles, and their relation to the TSP. The paper also explores the application of TSP in interconnection topologies and its solutions using various algorithms such as ant colony optimization, chemical reaction optimization, and grey wolf algorithm.

Routing, the process of finding the shortest paths between nodes in a network topology, is also discussed. The paper outlines different types of routing problems, including shortest path problems and tour construction problems. It explains the implementation of a variety of shortest path and tour construction algorithms on different interconnection networks.

The paper concludes by presenting specific algorithms and their complexities for solving various problems for CSNG. It discusses the time complexity of these algorithms and the potential performance enhancements achieved through parallel and distributed architecture. The study underscores the resemblance of the algorithms obtained for CSNG to hypercube algorithms rather than classical mesh algorithms.
