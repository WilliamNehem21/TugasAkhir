Completely positive maps are widely recognized as a model of initial quantum computation. To establish a categorical characterization of completely positive maps, we explore natural families of positive maps. By examining different structures, including affine maps between cones of positive elements, morphisms of algebras of effects, and affine maps of convex sets of states, we investigate the categorical characterization. We also develop a quantum domain theory focused on convex dcpos, demonstrating its support for important constructions such as tensor products by quantum data and lifting.

Although there are numerous representation results allowing for the understanding and analysis of quantum computations in terms of various structures, including convex sets, domains, partial monoids, and effect algebras, many of these results only apply to positive maps and thus do not fully capture quantum computation. Our contribution lies in a general method for extending these results to completely positive maps. Essentially, this method enables the conversion of a full and faithful functor.

Drawing upon classical domain theory for analogy, we consider the two essential categories: predom, consisting of dcpos and Scott-continuous functions, and dom!, comprising pointed dcpos (dcpos with a bottom element) and strict Scott-continuous functions (functions preserving the bottom element). The process of lifting (freely adding a bottom element) forms the left adjoint to the self-evident forgetful functor.
