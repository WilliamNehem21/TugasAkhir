This study presents the development and application of a tool designed to assist students in learning jazz improvisation. The tool incorporates elements of database, artificial intelligence for automatic melody generation, and human interface design. The philosophy behind the tool involves the use of coordinated mini-languages to enable user input for various aspects of the tool, such as melody and chord representation, musical styles, melody generation, and other musical knowledge.

Learning improvisation is a skill that is not inherently innate, and there are various recommendations on how it can be acquired. One suggested approach is for the student to transcribe improvised solos of renowned musicians to internalize their mindset and learn to improvise. Alternatively, another strategy involves having the student create original solos. According to the researchers, the second strategy offers additional benefits.

A challenge for inexperienced performers is identifying which notes create harmonious combinations. These combinations are ultimately based on the physical properties of sound, which can be conceptualized through psychoacoustics. However, jazz musicians think in terms of higher-level abstractions, which have been acquired through empirical investigations over decades, and cannot be derived automatically from physical principles.

A semi-tone is approximately one-twelfth of an octave and forms the basis for scales in most Western music. For instance, the harmonic minor scale is composed of pitches separated by 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1 semitones.

To facilitate specifying musical abstractions, the researchers chose to use s-expressions for their simplicity, favoring them over approaches such as XML, which are considered less user-friendly. The implementation is based on the Polya library, which provides Lisp-like data structure abstractions in Java.

Each scale type associated with a chord has a corresponding specification of the notes in that scale, which can be transposed to other key centers. Additionally, substitutions and extensions are other chords that can be utilized in place of a given chord, creating a hierarchy in the space of all chords.

If the duration of a note is not specified, it defaults to an eighth-note. Other note durations are denoted using symbols familiar to musicians: 4 for a quarter-note, 8 for an eighth-note, 16 for a sixteenth-note, 2 for a half-note, and 1 for a whole note. Additional durations can be formed by adding a dot to lengthen the note by 0.5 of its value and by using a "+" to represent other durations.

To create a notation that is user-friendly for musicians, chord symbols always begin with uppercase letters, while notes start with lowercase letters. For instance, "C2" denotes a C major chord with an added second, while "c2" represents the note middle C held for a half-note duration. Chords and notes can be freely intermixed, and the software is responsible for separating them into two tracks. Additionally, a different notation is used to specify the duration of chords, with vertical bars used to separate measures and divide the space evenly depending on the number of items between two bars.

This research provides innovative approaches to assist students in learning the art of jazz improvisation through the integration of technology and musical knowledge.
