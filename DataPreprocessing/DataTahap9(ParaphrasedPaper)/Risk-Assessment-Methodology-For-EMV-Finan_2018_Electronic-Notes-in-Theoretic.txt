Financial institutions have implemented various electronic payment systems to facilitate money transfers between accounts, both domestically and internationally. One of the most widely utilized systems is EMV, which was introduced by Europay, Mastercard, and Visa to combat fraudulent activities. However, despite its intended purpose, the EMV system has exhibited vulnerabilities and has been targeted by attacks. This paper aims to develop a risk assessment methodology specifically tailored for EMV transaction systems, with the goal of enhancing decision-making processes by analyzing, modeling, and evaluating potential risks associated with EMV payment transactions.

The banking industry employs a variety of online and offline systems to manage, monitor, and settle payments and fund transfers, including networks of ATMs, credit card processing, and accounting systems. These systems play a vital role in facilitating financial transactions in both domestic and international settings within market economies.

This paper is part of an ongoing research project focused on enhancing the risk management of financial transaction systems by establishing an effective methodology for modeling and evaluating risks, thus providing valuable insights to aid managerial decision-making. The proposed methodology will be applied to three case studies, beginning with the EMV system. The methodology will involve studying the EMV transaction process, identifying the stakeholders involved, conducting a risk identification process to pinpoint potential risks during payment transactions, and subsequently modeling the EMV transaction systems.

The paper will be structured into three subsections. The first section will provide an overview of risk assessment and risk management processes, while the second section will offer a background review of EMV systems. The third section will delve into a background investigation of risk assessments for financial transaction systems and related work.

Risk management encompasses a series of processes, beginning with the identification of risks and culminating in the development of a treatment plan or action. Risk assessment, a fundamental component of the risk management process, seeks to identify, model, and evaluate potential risks. According to Haimes, risk assessment involves a set of logical, systemic, and well-defined activities aimed at providing decision-makers with a comprehensive understanding of the risks associated with natural phenomena or human activities.

The EMV system leverages chip-based authentication, which enhances security by utilizing cryptography for transaction validation. The verification of the cardholder is done through a signature or PIN, with the PIN being locally verified by the chip. This method is commonly known as "chip and PIN" in countries like the UK and Canada, where PIN verification is prevalent in point-of-sale transactions, and as "chip and signature" in countries like Singapore, where signature verification is still utilized for customer authentication.

Furthermore, several studies have proposed risk assessment or modeling for other financial transaction systems. To address these studies, a high-level systematic mapping approach will be adopted to explore the existing processes and methodologies in use.

The search for relevant documents was conducted for publications dating from 2000 to 2017, encompassing various document types such as articles and books. Following the retrieval of results, all papers were meticulously screened to select those that specifically addressed risk assessment, modeling, or analysis, while excluding irrelevant materials. The selected papers either introduced a methodology or conducted risk assessment, modeling, or analysis. The aforementioned criteria, including keywords, time range, and screening process, were employed to focus the research efforts.

From a methodological standpoint, various approaches have been employed to assess, model, or analyze the risk associated with different financial transaction systems. Most studies commence with an analysis of the business processes pertinent to the discussed financial transaction systems. As an illustration, one study undertook a risk assessment approach for mobile payments, beginning with an understanding and analysis of mobile payment systems, role identification, and linking these roles to the mobile payment flow. Additionally, some studies utilize business process diagrams, such as UML diagrams, to provide a clearer depiction of the business processes.

BPMN, or Business Process Model and Notation, is a standardized notation for modeling business processes. It offers a robust modeling language for representing and executing business processes, with the advantage of utilizing swim-lanes to indicate the parties responsible for each process.

The research will focus on EMV contact-based transactions, utilizing a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) as the initial modeling approach. The EMV processes, including card authentication, cardholder verification, and transaction authorization, will be modeled using PEPA, with the transaction flow derived from BPMN. The subsequent step involves incorporating attacks into the model at the stages where they could potentially occur, as outlined in BPMN. The results derived from the modeling will be utilized in the subsequent steps. At this stage, the process of modeling EMV transaction processes has commenced, as indicated by the code provided.

The identification of risk expressions will be based on specific stakeholders, with events and associated costs listed for each stakeholder. This step aims to link risk expressions with the findings from the risk assessment processes, shedding light on potential issues, responsible parties, and associated costs. However, it is important to note that this step is part of future work at this stage.
