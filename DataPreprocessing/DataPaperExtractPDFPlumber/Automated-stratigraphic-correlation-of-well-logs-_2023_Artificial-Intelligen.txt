Keywords: The stratigraphic correlation of well logs plays an essential role in characterizing subsurface reservoirs.
Automatedstratigraphiccorrelation However, it suffers from a small amount of training data and expensive computing time. In this work,
AttentionBasedDenseNetwork we propose the Attention Based Dense Network (ASDNet) for the stratigraphic correlation of well logs. To
Denselyconnectedconvolutionalnetwork implement the suggested model, we first employ the attention mechanism to the input well logs, which

can effectively generate the weighted well logs to serve for further feature extraction. Subsequently, the
DenseNet is utilized to achieve good feature reuse and avoid gradient vanishing. After model training, we
employ the ASDNet to the testing data set and evaluate its performance based on the well log data set
