Abstract
An n-channel MOS transistor (nMOST) no matter what low or high voltage processes are often used in I/O pads as ESD
protection components. However, the contact spiking is a common caused leakage problems which deeply affect the ESD
reliability capability of protection devices. Therefore, in this work, we proposed systematic experiments on the drain side:
by adding an n-type Well (nWell) structure in the drain area for 0.25-μm low voltage (LV)/ high voltage (HV) processes.
After measurement and analysis, it is found that for this LV process adding the nWell in drain side is bad for the I
t2
robustness of ESD capability, such as the lowest ESD capability condition (S= 9-(cid:80)m) as compared with the reference
group (none with the nWell) is decreased up to 42%, so in the ESD protection application should be avoided to add this
structure; in the same token adding the nWell structure in the drain side of an HV nLDMOS, it was found that can expand
an ESD current conduction cross-sectional area, which will not dissipate a lot of heat on the surface of the device led to
burn, and then enhancing the ESD capability. Meanwhile, the ESD capability of a DUT with S= 9-(cid:80)m as compared with
the reference group (none with the nWell) is increased up to 8%, so adding an nWell structure in the drain side is good for
ESD capability (I value) of HV MOS devices.

1.Introduction
In recent years, with advances and scaling in microelectronic technologies, a large number of silicon
technology has been widely used in the daily use of personal computers, laptops, mobile phones, internet,
digital cameras, and others applications. Moreover, electrostatic discharge (ESD) events affect the reliability
of ICs appeared to be increasingly serious, the reason lies in the integrated circuits are scaled, resulting in a
thinner gate oxide layer, the source/drain regions were shallow junction depths and contacts window size got
smaller. Therefore, the weighting of integrated circuits suffered by ESD damages is rapidly increased.
Therefore, ESD reliability has become increasingly important for ultra deep submicron or nano-scale
processes electronic products [1-4].
In the microelectronics failure analysis, especially a contact spiking happened to drain region caused
leakage or short circuit, and which does deeply affect the reliability of ESD capability [5-8]. In the design rules
of T-Fab 0.6-(cid:80)m process [9], which records the designer should add an nWell structure below the drain side to
enhance the ESD capability of components, but how is it in a 0.25-(cid:80)m process? This paper will also aim at
and evaluate this process as for the low- and high-voltage devices to explore.
2.Contact spiking and layouts of DUTs
2.1 Contact spiking phenomenon
The damage of ESD for integrated circuits was mostly caused by ESD large current with residual heat. The
rising time was set to be in the nano second scale, and the voltage can be up to kV during the transient ESD
noise of human body model (HBM). The transient power on a small area of drain depleted high-resistance
region of an MOSFET is high. The generated heat usually results in aluminum or via-plug material of a
contact window spiking, and the fusing part would form alloy with silicon substrate. Then, the p/n junction of
semiconductor device disappears, and the electrical junction performance will seem to be short and abnormal.
The spiking phenomenon is prone to take place in p/n junction of drain or source side, especially occurs in the
drain reverse bias situation. This is due to the resistance of this area be highest and to form high temperature
and cause spiking phenomena.
2.2 nWell adding of an LV 5V nMOST in the drain side
All of these test DUTs were fabricated by a T-Fab 0.25-(cid:541)m low-voltage 5-V process. The multi-finger
structure of nMOSTs used in this work, the channel length (L) is kept to be 0.8-(cid:80)m, channel width of each
finger (W) is 50-(cid:80)m, finger numbers M= 4, and the total channel width (W ) is kept a constancy, 200-(cid:80)m.
f tot
As shown in Figs 1(a)~ 1(b), this structure exists an n-type well process below drain contact window to cover
whole drain contact-hole region. These DUTs works out to modulate n-well width (S) in the drain side.
Starting from the minimum design rule, it gradually increases the value of S until fitted in the design rule for
the n-well to drain diffusion region. Therefore, the nWell width (S) changes from 0-(cid:541)m (Ref. DUT), 3-(cid:541)m, 5-
(cid:541)m, 7-(cid:541)m, 9-(cid:541)m and to 11-(cid:541)m, respectively. That’s the method we used to modulate nWell to observe and
testify the proposed structural impacting on nMOST devices.Shen-Li Chen and Min-Hua Lee / AASRI Procedia 7 ( 2014 ) 51 – 56 53

2.3 nWell adding of an HV nMOST in the drain side
Here, the entire test DUTs for this experiment was fabricated by a T-Fab 0.25-μm 60-V high voltage
process. The channel length is kept to be 2-μm, channel width of a unit finger (W) is set to be 100-μm, finger
f
numbers M= 6, and the total channel width (W ) is kept a constancy, 600-(cid:80)m. As shown in Figs 2(a)~ 2(b),
tot
the 60-V lateral-diffused MOS (LDMOS) with adding an nWell structure beneath the drain-side contacts, so
that it can cover the drain contact area. Changing the width (S) of an nWell, the S parameter started from a
value of the minimum design rule to the contact hole, and slowly increased the value of S until conform to a
minimum design rule of nWell to the drain-side diffusion region will be investigated in this paper. So, the
widths (S) of this nWell are 0-μm (Ref. DUT), 3-μm, 4-μm, 5-μm, 6-μm, 7-μm, 8-μm and 9-μm, respectively.
Therefore, the width of an nWell grew up slowly to check and verify the influence of this structure on
nLDMOS devices.

3.Testing Equipment System
A transmission-line-pulse (TLP) system for experimental testing is controlled by the LabVIEW software. It
managed the subsystem electrical machine such as the ESD pulse generator, the high-frequency digital
oscilloscope and the digital power electric meter instruments to achieve the automatic measurement. This
machine can provide a continuous step-high square wave to device, and short raise time of the continuous
square wave can also simulate transient noise of ESD. This HBM-like system has used the short square wave
with 100-ns pulse widths and 10-ns rising/falling times to evaluate the voltage and current response of device.
4.Measurement Results and Discussion
4.1 nWell adding of an LV 5V nMOST in the drain side
Fig. 1 samples had been tested, the TLP data can be obtained and shown in Fig. 3(a) and Table 1. With the
increasing of the nWell width (S), the I value is slowly decreased, and an nMOS device with S=0 (Ref. DUT)
t2
has a maximum I value. Nevertheless, from Fig. 4, the influence of an nWell structure on V of DUTs is not
t2 h
evident. The V value slightly increased only when the width of nWell equals 3~7-μm. Unfortunately, the I
h t2
values from experiment data, the lowest ESD capability condition (S= 9-(cid:80)m) as compared with the Ref. DUT
(none with the nWell) is decreased up to 42% in this LV 5-V 0.25-μm process. Therefore, it should be
avoided using an nWell structure in the drain side for an LV process, in which it can’t effectively increase the
ESD capability by adding an nWell structure in the drain-side. Thus, it is not same as the T-Fab 0.6-(cid:80)m
process described.
4.2 nWell adding of an HV nMOST in the drain side
Similarly, Fig. 2 samples had been zapped; the TLP data can be obtained and shown in Fig. 3(b) and Table
1. Excitedly, with the increasing of the nWell width, the I value is slowly increased, while an nMOS device
t2
whose nWell width is 5-μm or 9-μm has a maximum I value. And, the I value of an nLDMOS DUT whose
t2 t2
width of nWell was set to be 9-μm has 8% higher than that of a Ref. DUT in 0.25-μm HV 60-V process.
From Fig. 4, the V and V values show a nearly constant relationship with nWell width in the HV-nLDMOS
h t1
device. Meanwhile, the V value of nLDMOS DUT whose width of nWell was set to be 9-μm has 2% lower
h
than that of a Ref. DUT.
In Fig. 4, the n-well width increases gradually from a minimum design rule. It can conclude that the ESD
ability (I values) is improved in nLDMOS DUTs with an additional n-well structure in the drain side. As the
t2
S equals to the maximum value of 9-μm, this nLDMOS DUT possess a largest I value, improved about 8%
t2
as compared with (I ) . So, for the HV nLDMOS devices, adding an nWell structure in the drain side is
t2 Reference
good for ESD capability (I value).

5.Conclusion
After the actual samples testing, it can be found that the drain-side with adding an nWell structure can not
efficiently promote the ESD robustness in a 0.25-(cid:80)m 5-V low voltage process. It will make I values have a
t2
declined trend, accordingly, the ESD capability of a DUT with S= 11-(cid:80)m as compared with the reference
group (none with the nWell) is decreased up to 39%. Then, it should avoid using this structure on applications;
On the contrary, furthermore, the drain-side with adding an nWell structure have positive influence on the
ESD robustness in a 0.25-(cid:80)m 60-V high voltage process, for instance, while the nWell width is equal to 9-(cid:541)m,
it has a higher I and V values. The ESD capability of a DUT with S= 9-(cid:80)m as compared with the reference
t2 h
group (none with the nWell) is increased up to 8%, therefore, adding an nWell structure in the drain side is a
right strategy for ESD robustness in HV MOS devices.
