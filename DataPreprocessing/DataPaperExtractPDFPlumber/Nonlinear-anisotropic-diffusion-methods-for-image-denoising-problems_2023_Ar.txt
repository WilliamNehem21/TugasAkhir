5. Resultsanddiscussions
The current work demonstrates the capabilities of methods based
on nonlinear anisotropic diffusion in restoring degraded images with-
out destroying important features. Despite their notable advantages,
potentialweaknessesofthesemethodshavebeendiscussedtoinspire
early career researchers in developing more advanced and effective
nonlinearanisotropicdiffusionmethods.Wehaveindicatedinteresting
researchavenuesinthispromisingfield,thegoalbeingtoexpandthe
application domain of such methods in denoising corrupted images.
Supported by our experimental results, researchers may raise critical
questions leading to improvement of the proposed method or other
classicalmethodsintheliterature.
Results justify the capability of our approach to generate images
withhigherperceptualandobjectivequalities(Fig.4).Comparedwith

visually appealing and attractive features. Specifically, the proposed
approach suppresses noise and reconstructs visual semantic features.
Evenforthecompleximages,suchasBaboon(Fig.4,secondrow),our
approachgeneratesacceptableresultsbypreservingplausiblefeatures
(e.g., fur, edges, and textures). Intuitively, we can observe from the
results (Fig. 4, far-right column) that the current method properly Fig.4. NoiseremovalfromnoisyimagesofPout,Mandril,andWalkbridge,scaledand
