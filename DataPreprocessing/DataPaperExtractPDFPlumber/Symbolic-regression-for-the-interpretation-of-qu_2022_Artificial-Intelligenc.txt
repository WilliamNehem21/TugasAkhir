paper proposes a method for generating simpler expressions by incorporating three filters into GP-based SR.
The filters are further combined with nonlinear least-squares optimization to give filter-introduced GP (FIGP),
which improves the predictive ability of SR models while retaining simple expressions. As a proof-of-concept, the
quantitative estimate of drug-likeness and the synthetic accessibility score are predicted based on the chemical
structures of compounds. Overall, FIGP generates less-complicated expressions than previous SR methods. In
terms of predictive ability, FIGP is better than GP, but is outperformed by a support vector machine with a radial
basis function kernel. Furthermore, quantitative structure–activity relationship models are constructed for three
matching molecular series with biological targets. In the case of one target, the activity prediction models given
by FIGP exhibit better predictive ability than multivariate linear regression and support vector regression with
the radial basis function kernel, whereas for the remaining cases, FIGP is slightly less accurate than multivariate
linear regression.
