paper describes how digital models can be classified, reused and authored on such DT Platforms. Through
experimental analyses of three industrial cases, the paper exemplifies how DTs are employed in relation to
product assembly of agricultural robots, polymer injection molding, as well as laser-cutting and sheet-metal
