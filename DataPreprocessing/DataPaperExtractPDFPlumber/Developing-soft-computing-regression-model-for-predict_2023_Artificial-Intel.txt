dimensionless parameters which are taken into account in this study, namely the anisotropic strength ratio, the
dimensionless eccentricity, the load inclination angle, and the adhesion factor to the bearing capacity factor.
Furthermore, a new model has been proposed to predict the bearing capacity factor for the calculation of the
undrained bearing capacity for footings resting on an anisotropic clay using an advanced data-driven method
(MOGA-EPR). The new model takes into account the anisotropy, eccentricity, and inclination of the applied load
and could be used with confidence in routine designs of shallow foundations in undrained conditions with the
consideration of the anisotropic strengths of clays.

the horizontal force on the footing is disregarded, leading to a reduced
influence of the adhesion factor on the bearing capacity. In other words,
the adhesion factor has a less significant role when the horizontal force
becomes negligible compared to the vertical force. Moreover, the
increasing anisotropic strength ratio also resulting in a higher bearing
capacity factor due to the isotropic clay properties while the increasing
in eccentric length leads to a lower value of bearing capacity factor, this
happens due to the facts that a high eccentric length often reduces the
effectiveness of the force imparted to the footing. Importantly, a new
novel model has been developed in this study to estimate the strip
footing’s bearing capacity factor in anisotropic clay under eccentric and
inclined loads. The new model has been developed using advanced data

layered soils, or other footing shapes (i.e. triangular or rectangular
footings). However, in future studies, it would be beneficial to include
the seismic loading to account for strip footing and investigate the
behavior in such configurations. These potential avenues for future
research would help expand the applicability of the findings and provide
insights into the behavior of footing in different types of geometries and
