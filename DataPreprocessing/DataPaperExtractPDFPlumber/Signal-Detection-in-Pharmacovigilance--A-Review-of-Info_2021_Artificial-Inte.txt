electronic health records. This review is substantiated based on the fact that DDIs are contributing to a public
health problem represented in 6-30% adverse drug event occurrences. In this article, we review informatics-
driven approaches applied by authors focusing on DDI signal detection using different data sources. The aim
of this article is not to laboriously survey all PV literature. As an alternative, we discussed informatics-driven
methods used to discover DDI signals and various data sources reinforced with instances of studies from PV
literature. The adoption of informatics-driven approaches can complement and optimize the practice of safety
signal detection. However, further researches should be carried out to evaluate the efficiency of those approaches
and to address the limitations of external validation, implementation and adoption in real clinical environments
and by the regulatory bodies.
