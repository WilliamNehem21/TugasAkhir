surplus just before ruin and deficit at ruin when initial surplus is 0 and the recursive formula of the joint distribution when initial surplus is u . In addition, when initial surplus is 0 the ruin probability of the risk model is given. At last, we provide the method to compute the ruin probability when initial surplus is u .

and the deficit at ruin, but still only one kind by-claim. Unlike their models above, we studied a new risk model with practical significance. Consider the claims in a car accident, the vehicle damage may induce bodily injury or property damage at the same time or afterwards, so in this risk model each main claim causes two kinds of by-claims, and both kinds have the probability being delayed to the next time period.
