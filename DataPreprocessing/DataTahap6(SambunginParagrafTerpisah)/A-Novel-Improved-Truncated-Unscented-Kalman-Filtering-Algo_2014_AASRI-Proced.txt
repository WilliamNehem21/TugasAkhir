The outline of this paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, the nonlinear model of Kalman filtering is presented. In Section 3, a novel improved truncated unscented Kalman filtering is present, including the principle and concrete steps of the algorithm. The experiment and analysis are provided in Section 4.

The proposed algorithm linearizes the measurement function using SLR based on TUKF for the nonlinear filtering. It can deal with the situation when the measurement is not bijective. On this condition the algorithm extends the range of application of the filter. Simulations show that in general, the improved TUKF performs better than UKF and QKF.
