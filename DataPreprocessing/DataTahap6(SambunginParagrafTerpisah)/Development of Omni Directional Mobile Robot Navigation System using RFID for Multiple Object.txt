destinations. Both Omni robot and RFID system must be integrated to each other in the way of controlling the whole system. Omni robot is concerned due to its capability of mechanical manipulator and is capable of tethered and autonomous operation. It also focuses on RFID system which relies on navigation module using customized features of RFID technology. RFID system consists of tags, reader with antenna, and software. When an RFID reader scans the tag, a pulse of radio energy is sent out and the tag sends back the inventory control number.

The mobile robot is then updating its headed by turn right and left and checked whether the angle between calculated and compass is reached. If not, it will turn until it found the correct angle. If yes, mobile robot is moving forward and detected more points. Mobile robot is then identifying current tag whether it is goal or not. If goal, it will stop. If not it will calculate current to goal angle and compare through continuous loop until it find the goal.
