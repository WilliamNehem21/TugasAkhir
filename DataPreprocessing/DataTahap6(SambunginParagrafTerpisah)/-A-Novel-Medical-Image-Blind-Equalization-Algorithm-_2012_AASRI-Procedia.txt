Medical CT image reflects the degree that the organs and tissues absorb X-ray. It benefits discovering small lesions of microstructure in vivo. And it is a most important assistant means in the field of medical image diagnosis. However, in the process of imaging and transfer, due to the image affected the two- dimensional channel, namely point spread function, and the image blurring will carry out. The degraded CT images will have an influence on affecting normal display and diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, in nature, the process of the CT image degradation is often unknown. Blind image restoration is that, in the case of unknown degradation information, interference and noise are removed, the lost image will be recovered, and the restored image approaches the original image as much as possible.
