Juglans sect. Rhysocaryon with 16 black walnut species is unusual in the angiosperms for its intercontinental and insular distribution endemic to and spanning the Americas [6]. This indicates a great potential in association with crop improvement of the Persian walnut (J. regia of sect. Juglans, commonly used for nut-producing) and high quality wood for cabinetry as well as agroforestry potential for rehabilitating degraded areas such as cloud forest areas [6]. Therefore, an in-depth study on the Paradox would be valuable for walnut breeding and the commercial industry.
