In general there are three or four schools of learning, in the design of educational material; these schools are: Behaviorism, Cognitivist, Socio-Constructivist and Humanist. Behaviorism strategies allow teach the facts and are used in the implementation of the course to show the formulations, algorithms or mathematical expressions of the method discussed, in this case the natural spline method. Cognitivist strategies will be used to teach the processes or procedures to be followed in the development and application of numerical method Included in this work. Constructivist strategies aim to develop a high level of thinking.

A variety of pre-learning activities can be used to prepare the student for the lesson details, as well as to inform the student of the importance of taking their lessons online and show you how you can benefit from it. There is also a variety of learning activities that can be offered to the student to achieve the expected learning outcomes. Students need to interact with the interface to access the materials available online. The student interacts with the content to acquire the information needed to form the knowledge base. Students interact with each other and with the teacher. It should provide opportunities for students to transfer what they learn to real life applications.

The task of the designer and teacher of online courses is to select, adapt and improve (through reflection, feedback  and  evaluation)  educational  activities  that  maximize  the  potential  of  the  Web. The creation of a model is usually the first step toward developing a theory. The model illustrates most of the key variables that interact to create contexts and educational experiences online.
