The widespread availability of affordable head-mounted displays and easy access to virtual reality (VR) appli- cations and games has significantly increased the use of such technology by the general public. Thus there is increasing interest in determining any risks of using such technology and any aftereffect from exposure. Head- mounted display manufacturers provide general usage guidance but this is ad hoc and there is limited recent evidence comparing early virtual environment studies with experiences from modern head-mounted displays. The primary objective of this study was to explore response activation and inhibition after participants experienced a typical virtual environment in a head-mounted display. Reaction times were collected with a robust cued go/nogo response activation or inhibition. However, evidence of participant fatigue in the reaction time tests was found. This work confirms safe use of virtual reality experiences in modern head-mounted displays for short duration exposures and identifies issues with reaction time testing that are in need of further investigation.

Most cybersickness research measures the effect by use of question- naires, e.g. the simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) [21], postural instability [22], or more recently biometric and physiological states [23, 24]. Recent work has also explored impacts on cognitive performance [4, 24,25].

In the work reported here, we have explored a more real-world, or ecological valid [27], use of VR HMD through the use of COTS hardware and software. This is representative of the more widespread use of VR HMD technology as might be found at a trade show, gaming convention, shop demonstration or causal home use. Our interest is in short duration (15 minutes) HMD use and exploring any inhibition impact or delayed response activation in this context. Thus the aim is to pair a real-world VR HMD interactive experience, across travel, selection and manipulation interactions, with a robust reaction time test.

Minecraft VR version 1.1.5 (Mojang, www.minecraft.net) was used as the base environment for the VR task. The aim was to provide a virtual environment that (i) had a low entry level for the participants, so they could spend more time doing the task rather than learning the environ- ment; (ii) was an environment with active interaction [28], rather than

Each session took approximately 90 minutes and were held individ- ually. Firstly, the research team collected signed consent forms. Secondly, the participant was given a short tutorial on the use of the Xbox gamepad which was to be used to interact with the Minecraft environment. Par- ticipants used the gamepad controller to briefly move around the laptop (non-VR) version of Minecraft. All participants showed aptitude in navigating and using the gamepad in less than 5 minutes.

Participants were then seated at the laptop and performed a practice test on the cued go/no-go task of 15 sample trials. Participants were instructed to press the space key as fast as possible when the green target appeared and not to respond to the blue target. Participants were given no information on the relation between the rectangle orientation and the target colours. After the 15 trials, participants verbally confirmed that they understood the task and then competed a full 250 trial test.

After playing Minecraft VR, the participants removed the HMD and repeated the full 250 trial cued go/no-go task with the Inquisit 5 Lab script. Finally, they completed a demographic survey and a questionnaire to determine their susceptibility to motion sickness, i.e use of the revised motion sickness susceptibility questionnaire (MSSQ) [29]. At the end of the session, each participant waited while their pre and post VR experi- ence reaction times were compared. If the raw reaction times between tests were significantly different, i.e. a percentage change of greater than 5% from baseline reaction time [7], the participants were advised not to

Failure of response inhibition: This was measured as the proportion of no-go targets in which a participant failed to inhibit a response during a reaction time trial, i.e. the participant reacted to a no-go target as if it was a go-target. Also no-go cues should support response inhibition of no-go targets. The p-inhibition failure scores were calculated for each cue condition (go and no-go) on each test.

raw data as the former indicates pre-emptive activation and the latter indicates loss of concentration/boredom and neither are indicative of accurate reaction times. Only 5 trials < 100 (0.09%) and 9 trials > 900 (0.16%) were removed across the 5500 go trials analysed. Data was

cleaned and graphs produced in Excel (Office Professional Plus 2016) and all statistical analysis performed in SPSS (version 24.0.0.1). As reaction times are not normally distributed, non-parametric Wilcoxon signed- ranks test was used to analyse the pre- and post-test data pairs.

general population. However, this could be due to selection bias as par- ticipants self-selected their participation based on the study description that mentioned virtual reality and computer games. Also an exclusion criterion was for conditions that may be aggravated by use of a HMD, including vertigo, claustrophobia or epilepsy. The mean MSSQ scores of

The full group results (pre-test to post-test) showed no significant differences in response activation or response inhibition of the partici- pants after brief exposure to the Minecraft VR environment using an Oculus Rift CV1 HMD. From one perspective this validates the health and safety advice from VR hardware companies that there should be no ill effects after short duration use of VR technology (see Section 2.1). Our results are evidence that this is valid for response activation and inhibi- tion in a participant population that is not generally susceptible to motion sickness. However, this conclusion does need to be contextualised with

Also it should be noted that 3 participants (all male) did not complete the HMD component of the study. Although we were not explicitly measuring cybersickness, all three participants verbally indicated increased head temperature, which is indicative of cybersickness [24], and were unwilling to continue with the Minecraft VR task. Their removal was part of the study protocol but this did bias the reaction time results to only participants that could complete the 15 minute VR task. However, self-exclusion like this is what typically happens with HMD usage. Users who encounter obvious negative effects stop using, and typically avoid future use of, the technology. It is interesting to note that these participants did self-select to participate and did not have indica- tive MSSQ scores. Nevertheless, our interest here was in exploring potentially hidden negative HMD impacts, i.e. on activation mechanisms for information processing, that might come from brief VR use. Measuring the reaction time impact on participants that had experienced explicit cybersickness symptoms was out of the scope of the current research but would be a useful avenue for further work.

In contrast to previous research [4,24,25], the results here showed an improvement in reaction times (although not statistically significant, see Section 4). There were a number of differences in our study where the aim was to provide a more ecologically valid VR usage experience. Other studies with reaction time impact had more provocative cybersickness invoking environments [24,25], more limited interaction and used a much shorter duration reaction time task [4,24,25]. However, our results did show that the longer cued go/no-go test had evidence of participant fatigue during the test. This was evident in both the pre- and post-tests. As this was present in the pre-test, this indicates that the longer dura- tion of the reaction test could be the cause.

other traits can impact cognitively fatiguing conditions. Cognitive fatigue is commonly measured through changes in test performance and sub- jective reports via questionnaires [35] or course/test evaluations [32]. Duration of testing and any physical conditions of the test environment are also relevant, for example movement time [33]. In our reaction time trials the participants were seated for the test duration and any physical duress was limited to concentrating on the reaction time trials. Also the go/no-go trials are very repetitive and it is possible that boredom and/or reduced attention is what we have detected as fatigue. Adding a post-session question to capture subjective experiences of the reaction time task, in the context of reported fatigue, would be useful for future work in this area. However, to mitigate potential cognitive fatigue, repeated short tests with rest times between may be better than single short (as in previous work [4,24,25]) or single long (as reported here) reaction time tests.

Given the use of reaction time measures in VR experience and cybersickness research and the results from the work described here, there may be considerable benefit in factoring in cognitive fatigue and the measures that contribute to this, i.e. personality or other traits [35], in order to increase the relevance of the reaction time data for aftereffect analysis. This is a focus for future work.

The widespread availability of COTS HMD and easy access to VR applications and games has significantly increased the use of such tech- nology by the general public. With more users, risk exposure from this technology is increasing. VR technology manufacturers provide guide- lines for usage but this guidance can be overly general and there is a limited evidence base for these recommendations.
