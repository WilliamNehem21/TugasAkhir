In this paper, the dynamics of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with mixed delays is investigated. Novel multiple Lyapunov-Krasovkii functionals are designed to get new sufficient conditions guaranteeing the uniformly ultimate boundedness, the existence of an attractor and the globally exponential stability. The derived conditions are expressed in terms of LMIs, which are more relax than algebraic formulation and can be easily checked by the effective LMI toolbox in Matlab in practice.
