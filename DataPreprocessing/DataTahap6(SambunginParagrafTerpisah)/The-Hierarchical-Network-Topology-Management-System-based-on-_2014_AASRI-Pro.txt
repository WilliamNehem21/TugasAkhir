With the expansion and complexity of network scale, management and maintenance of the network has become critical. And network management systems(NMS) have become an important part of network construction and maintenance[1]. Meanwhile, network topology management(NTM) is the basic part of NMS, and most of the functions will be through topological graph to reflect.

Here we adopt the hierarchical display strategy, the following IP network as an example. The first layer shows the main topology, namely the relationship between router and subnet. The second layer displays interconnection in the subnet; if the subnet also includes router or switch, It can also go deep into the port level for the third layer of topology structure.

Ordinary loading model is generally used, because of the small amount of data. Multilevel loading model is the premise of the hierarchical network. When the system is initialized, it only presents the uppermost data. The multilevel loading model can not only save space, but also improve the speed of loading system.
