The remaining sections are outlined as follows: After an overview on CSFB solution, advantages and disadvantages, actual implementation and Call scenarios having the most noticeable impact on the user quality experience in section 2. Section 3, introduces the smart way of deploying CSFB procedure and the modified call flow to overcome the call setup time delay on the most impacted cases. Section 4 presents our experiment results. Finally, a summary is provided in Section 5.

Based on the above points, operators willing to add voice functionality to their voiceless LTE networks are hesitating between two options. The first option is to wait for handset supporting SRVCC and to give the precession in the media war to their competitors, as many operators already declared the voice services support on their LTE network using alternative solution like CSFB for UMTS operators or active dual-mode operation for CDMA2000 operators [2]. The second option is to go for other alternatives not really elegant like CSFB [2], which will affect badly the quality of user experience and add more cost charges to the voice over LTE project deployment, even soon; all operators have to go for SRVCC solution as it is the next logical step in the 4G LTE voice roadmap [1]. The actual CSFB implementation needs also time to complete the upgrades on all MSC servers, which will make the selection more difficult, as the handset makers are expecting to have the needed phone in a couple of months.

To make choice easier for operators, we have to simplify the CSFB implementation, so the cost charges and the time consumption will be minimal. Also we have to improve the call setup time delay which is the biggest CSFB drawback. For that, we have to study the actual CSFB implementation and check if the call setup time delay is visible in all the cases or only specific call scenarios have to be improved.
