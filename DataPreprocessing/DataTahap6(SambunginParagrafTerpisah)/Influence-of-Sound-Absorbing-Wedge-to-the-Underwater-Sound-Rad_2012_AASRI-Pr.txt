The self-noise level of sonar platform area is highly related to the performance of sonar. Reducing the self- noise level can not only improve the detection signal capacity of sonar, but increase working distance as well. The prediction of self-noise can estimate its level quantitatively, in addition, the prediction of different noise resources effects on self-noise can help to determine the measures to control self-noise and its quantitative technical indicators.
