The Ghost module focuses on generating more feature maps by using fewer parameters. In this study, the Ghost was adopted to process hen's feature maps(Han et al., 2020). The original hen's feature map is blurry after YOLOv5 neck network. However, with the Ghost module,

Where a1, b1, and c1 are the output feature map's height, width, and channels after the convolution operation. C represents the number of channels in the feature map input. N represents the size of the convolutional kernel employed during the convolution operation.

A laying hens' dataset was constructed to evaluate the performance of the improved YOLOv5 on the detection of birds. The dataset contains whole growth period of bird from 1 week to 36 weeks (baby chicks to hens) and consisting of 3000 pics that were extracted randomly from recorded videos. All the pics were labeled by LabelImg Windos_v1.6.1 version. Birds under 2 weeks of age were labeled as baby chicks, and birds 2 weeks or older were labeled as pullets/hens. 2400 pics and 600 pics were used during training section and testing section separately. The training was run under in Python Qt5 application framework for 300 epochs with a learning rate 0.01 and a batch size of 16. The collusion problems(Yang et al., 2022). Other flaws in our method are original from the horizonal vison factor (when baby chicks are too small under horizontal scale, the miss detection happens) and designed perch zone (when the perch zone is designed narrower than the real sit- uation, there will be less perch chicks included into the perch zone, so the chicks were missed). The false detection rates were 0.004 and
