This paper presents a novel Gaussian mixture approximation smoother (GMA) for estimation the nonlinear system state. The smoothing implementation is transformed into computing some Gaussian weighted integrals, which triggers the development of the new GMA-URTSS algorithm by applying unscented transformation (UT). Simulation application demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed method.

Here, motivated by the fact that the GMA is more accurate than the GA, we present the GMA smoother for the ballistic reentry tracking problem. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II formulates the investigated problem and recalls the standard GA filter and smoother. Section III derives the GMA smoother on the basis of the standard GA estimators. Section IV gives the simulation application for the reentry track- ing problem. Some conclusions are drawn in section V.

Note that as shown in (3), the GA smoother starts from the initial density pGA ( xN | YN ) . Similarly, the GA smoother is the foundation of developing the GMA smoother, hence, according to (7), the GMA smoother is initialized as follows, i.e.

Motivated by the fact that the GMA is more accurate than the GA, based on the existing standard GA filter and smoother, we propose a general GMA smoother for estimating the nonlinear state from racking a ballistic target on reentry. Furthermore, the new GMA-URTSS algorithm is developed by using UT for numerically computing the Gaussian weighted integrals in GMA smoother. The simulations show that the proposed GMA- URTSS outperforms the corresponding GA-URSS by its superior estimation accuracy.
