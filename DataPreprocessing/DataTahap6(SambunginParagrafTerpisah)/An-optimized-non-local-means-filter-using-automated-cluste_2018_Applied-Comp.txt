The lower processing time is an important criterion for medical image denoising. So we have concentrated methods, which reduce computational time. Yan et al. [32] used clustering based preclas- sification [32] to achieve faster processing without the elimination of any pixels in weight calculation. The k-means algorithm is used for clustering, where the value of k (number of clusters) has been set manually though visual perception as well as through peak sig- nal to noise ratio (PSNR) values. In k-means algorithm, the patches are divided into distinct clusters and each element of a patch belongs to exactly one cluster. This restricts the candidates to be present in more than one cluster. Such a restriction is not present in fuzzy clustering where the elements of a patch can spread over

In this article, we have presented a novel NLM framework for removing speckle noise in breast ultrasound images. The proposed method has improved the NLM performance in two ways: an auto- mated clustering based preclassification scheme through gap statistics and a new similarity measure using rotationally invariant moment distance measure. The results have shown that the pre- sented method gives better quantitative results compared to other state-of-the-art NLM based methods. Thus, the robustness against noise and low processing time make the filter appropriate for ultrasound computer aided breast cancer diagnosis systems.
