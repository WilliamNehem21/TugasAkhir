The large coal-fired power generation system characterizes as complex structure, highly coupling and nonlinear correlation between energy consumption and external environment, resources and load demand. The attribute reduction method based on fuzzy rough set (FRS) was introduced to extract the dominant features related to energy consumption and eliminate the redundant features as well. Taking the reduced attributes as input variables, which provide the important base for analyze the energy consumption of the coal-fired power unit.

The large coal-fired power generation system was composed of many complex subsystems, and there were high-dimensional nonlinear associative relationships among various operating parameters. To determine the relationships among parameters under different operating conditions, and reconstruct the system operating state, thus the optimum controllable parameters of the boundary condition can be obtained, and then the operation optimization strategies can be formulated. All of this can be summarized as the analysis of complex systems modeling.

Therefore, the 10 attributes based on fuzzy rough set attribute reduction algorithm were extracted as input variables. The conclusions were consistent with the theoretical analysis; the key parameters affecting the unit energy consumption were the unit boundary condition parameters for the operation. This method provides an important basis for further study on optimization of unit consumption characteristics and operating parameters.
