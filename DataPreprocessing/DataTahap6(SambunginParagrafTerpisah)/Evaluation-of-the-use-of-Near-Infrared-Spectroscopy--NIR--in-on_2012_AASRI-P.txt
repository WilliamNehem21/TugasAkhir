To maximize the lifetime expectance of power transformers, it is important to develop tools to monitor and to give diagnose information, allowing for real-time detection of incoming failures. Information from analysis of gases dissolved or free in insulating oil is one of the most valuable tools in evaluating the health of a transformer and has become an important part of preventive maintenance programs. The condition of the oil greatly affects the performance and the service life of transformers, and on-line monitoring has become a reliable method to ensure the safe operation of transformers. An on-line monitoring of dissolved gases generated by electrical transformers in operation was developed, which can be used as an important parameter for the detection of faults and monitoring the chemical degradation of mineral insulation oil. This paper proposes a method to analyze the generated gases, based on Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) through a developed prototype that can be adapt on the Buchholz transformer relay. The combination used of NIR spectroscopy and chemometric tools has allowed for obtaining information over the samples. Recent developments of chemometrics software and computer technology have made NIR analysis the practical choice for process analysis applications.

The importance of transformer fault gas analysis and interpretation is well recognized and documented. The deterioration of transformer oil and paper insulation results in the formation of by-products in the form characteristics gases. In the presence of an active fault, the rate of deterioration is considerably increased, and the type of these gases generated will vary with the nature of severity of the fault [5].

Because the importance to detect failures a very early stage and be able to provide near time data on the conditions, determining exhaust gases from on-line monitoring has become a reliable method to ensure safe operation [7]. The use of on-line and off-line monitoring methods of power transformer is increasing steadily and can provide powerful tool to reducing risk of several failure. The on-line monitoring of gas dissolved in oil or free gas collected from Buchholz relay can be a valuable tool to diagnostic and identify incipient faults on transformers in service. The gases produced beyond the saturation limit of the oil, come out and can be collected in Buchholz relay. When this occurs, the insulation strength of the transformer oil is reduced, which can lead to further failures [1].

This paper evaluates the use of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) and chemometric methods to analyze light gaseous hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, ethylene and acetylene) associated with faults in the insulation system. For this study was developed a spectrophotometer prototype with a measure cell for further application in monitoring gases in the Buchholz relay. The calibration procedures, measurement limitations and an error analysis are presented.

preparation. The combination of these characteristics with the instrument control, low maintenance and data treatment made this possible for this kind of application [8]. This analytical technique has been used with fiber-optic to identify and quantify water and oil in transformer insulating paper [9].

Synthetic gas mixtures were prepared directly into the cell using flow meters (Aalborg) and pure gases (methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene) diluted with nitrogen gas. The calibration set was formed by 29 gaseous mixtures and the prediction set by 10 gaseous mixtures. The ranges of concentration of gaseous hydrocarbon mixtures were 0, 5 to 2, 0 % (v/v). The chemometrics models were built using the software package The Unscrambler 9.2 (CAMO) [6]. The concentration of the gases within the cell was determined using gas chromatograph as a reference method.

The results of the presented study indicate that Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) with chemometrics techniques appears as a tool to be used for monitoring gas species produced in the decomposition of insulating oils. In this was found that the calibration model built by multivariate regression using the partial least squares (PLS), the results obtained with RMSEP such as 0.19% (v / v) to methane, 0.15% (v / v) to acetylene, about 0.11% (v / v) for ethylene and 0.14% (v / v) to the ethane, prove the chemometric model developed represents a good model to be applied to the hydrocarbons present in real samples. Furthermore it should be considered that found in on-line monitoring of power transformers. There is a new work has been developing a new type of cell measurement system based on multiple reflection which will lower the detection limits of the hydrocarbon gas to the range of a few ppm (parts per million).
