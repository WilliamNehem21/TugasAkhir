Goal of the contribution is to present results of the economical analysis of the photovoltaic systems that fulfill present limits, stated by the legislative of the Slovak Republic. Comparative method is realized on one of the buildings from the state sector in the city from eastern Slovakia with goal to find out optimal using of installed photovoltaic system with performance 100kWp. Comparison is realized and searched from the view of the client and its main task is to determine solution with biggest contribution for the client. Comparison of the systems ON GRID with supplement of leftovers and ON GRID with total supplement to the distribution net is made from the view of state support by the way of repurchase prices for the correspondent installed power plants.

Comparison is made and searched from the view of client and its main task is to determine solution with biggest contribution for client. Comparison of ON GRID system with leftovers supplement and ON GRID with total supplement to DN is made from the view of state support by the way of repurchase prices for correspondent installed power plants, according which there area developed economical indexes, as for example cost, revenue, payback period, cash flow and discounted cash flow. Due to the analysis there is necessary to determine constant and variable indexes for compared connections. As constant indexes there are considered following: building of public sector, consumption of electric power of the searched object, installed performance, luminance, price of photovoltaic system, project and engineering activity, depreciation time, and insurance. Variable indexes are type of system connection and state support by the way of different repurchases prices of electric power.
