The popularity of municipal sewage sewers system leads to producing a massive quantity of domestic wastewater sludge; how to treat and dispose of the sludge is becoming an environmental problem. The sludge is rich in nutrients, and it is often applied to soil as fertilizer or soil conditioner in many developing and developed nations. However, the influence of heavy metals contained in sludge on the crop growth and quality is a major concern when the sludge is reused on farmland for growing edible crops. The objectives of this research are to analyze the municipal sewage sludge for heavy metal contents and their bond fractions, and to conduct crop growth experiments to evaluate the influence on crop growth and quality by applying the sludge as soil additives for growing crop. The experimental sludge samples were collected from Taichung Fu-Tien wastewater treatment plants. The sludge contains Cu, Zn, Ni and Cd with concentrations exceeding the maximum levels legally allowed in Taiwan farmland soil. Most Cu exists in organic bond fraction; Zn is in Fe-Mn oxides bond fraction, Ni is in organic bond fraction, and Cd is in Fe-Mn oxides bond fraction. Three batches of plant growing and harvesting were carried. The crop growth results reveal that the growth of plants grown in the second batch of planting is obviously suppressed, and the extent of influence increases with higher ratios of sludge applied to the soil.

The municipal wastewater treatment system is an important infrastructure to treat domestic wastewater for protecting the receiving body and the environment; the system generates a large quantity of biological wastewater sludge that must be properly treated and disposed of in order to prevent secondary pollution problems [1]. Many developed and developing nations tend to dispose of sludge by reusing it as fertilizer or soil conditioner [1], e.g. about 60 % in UK and USA, and 53 % in Europe [2] Wong and Selvam (2006) [2] asserted that sludge reuse by applying the composted sludge to land is the most economic method for treating domestic wastewater sludge because resources recovery from the sludge is also achieved. However, domestic wastewaters contain as high as 0.5~2 % [2] or even 4% [3,4] of heavy metals on a dry weight basis. The metals contained in Hong Kong Tai Po municipal wastewater sludge include 112 mg/kg Cu, 110 mg/kg Mn, 2.22~3.68 mg/kg Cd, 455~533 mg/kg Ni, 929~1090 mg/kg Cu, 4.85~10.80 mg/kg As, 289~357 mg/kg Cr and 0.277~0.681 mg/kg Hg [5]. These concentrations are higher than the stipulated maximum concentrations for use on farmland to grow edible crops. Hence, there are serious risks for applying the sludge as soil conditioner because the metals may potentially contaminate the environment and/or food chain [6].

adverse impact of applying the sludge on the soil environment. Among the six metals, Cd has the lowest concentration; however, it is the most easily absorbable metal by plant. Hence, Cd is more strictly controlled in the soil of farmland for growing edible crops; its maximum allowable concentration is limited to only 5 mg/kg in Taiwan. Zn has the highest concentration among the six metals in sludge; its concentration is higher than twice the allowable maximum concentration (600 mg/kg) for soil used to grow crops. The exchangeable and carbonate bonding fractions of Zn account for 12 % of the total Zn contained in the sludge; the Fe-Mn oxides and organic bonding fractions account for 72 %. Although plants have weak absorption toward Zn in Fe-Mn oxides and organic bonding forms, the accumulated long-term influence caused by the soil complicate chemical and biochemical reactions cannot be ignored [3,4,9]. Similar observation is also seen for copper; the soil contains copper with 74 % in organic bond form; the risk associated with copper on the soil environmental and plant growth cannot be ignored either.
