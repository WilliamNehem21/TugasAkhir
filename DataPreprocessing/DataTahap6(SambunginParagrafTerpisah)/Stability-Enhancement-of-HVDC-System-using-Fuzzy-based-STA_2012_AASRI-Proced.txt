The development of FACTS-devices has started with the growing capabilities of power electronic components. Devices for high power levels have been made available in converters for high and even highest voltage levels. The overall starting points are network elements influencing the reactive power or the impedance of a part of the power system. The series devices are compensating reactive power. With their influence on the effective impedance on the line they have an influence on stability and power flow [7, 8].

According to the results, the STATCOM improves the system performance under the transient and the normal conditions. However, it can control the power flow in the transmission line, effectively. With the addition of STATCOM, the magnitude of fault current reduces and oscillations of excitation voltage also reduce. The "current margin" is essential to prevent misfire of the thyristor valves. DC filters and AC filters can not only eliminate the harmonic effects but also reduce the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) as well. The current waveform in the case of a conventional controller has a lot of crests and dents and suffers from prolonged oscillations, whereas by using Fuzzy controller, DC current fast returns to its nominal value. The overshoot in case of the Fuzzy controller is slightly less than conventional controllers. It is more economical for the HVDC transmission system to transfer more power as the power factor is almost near to unity and the energy loss is low. STATCOM, however, has shown its flexibility in easing line congestion and promoting a more controllable flow in the lines. STATCOM will be very useful for deregulated energy market as an alternative choice for more power generation to the load area.
