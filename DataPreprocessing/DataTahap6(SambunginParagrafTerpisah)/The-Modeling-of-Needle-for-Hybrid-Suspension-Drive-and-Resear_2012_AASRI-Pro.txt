To the theory of jacquard knitting machine, this paper has proposed a new needle drive model of magnetic suspended needles. This model, based on hybrid suspension of electromagnets and permanent magnets theory, discussed needle model in the specific motion trail,through theoretical analysis and simulation of motion trail, revealed that realize the specific motion trail by maglev drive needle is available, and provide a new researching method of drive needle model for displace traditional knitting principle of mechanical multi-stage transmission. In theory, the model discussed the knitting principle of maglev drive needle in detail, and through the simulation and theory model of the trail, proved that the jacquard efficient is higher, and the structure is simpler and programmable. The electromagnetic and permanent model that the paper involved provide the basic theory for further discussing experimental program of drive needle, set relevant parameters.

Magnetic suspension technique is a new technology in the twentieth century. It is characteristic of non-contact, without friction and wear between objects, so as to increase the life of device in the process and improve the running condition of device. It thus has been widely used in the area of traffic, mechanical, air craft and so on.
