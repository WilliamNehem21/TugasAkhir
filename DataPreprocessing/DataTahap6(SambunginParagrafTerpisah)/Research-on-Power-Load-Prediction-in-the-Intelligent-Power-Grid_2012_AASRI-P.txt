Along with China's construction of high voltage grid and the deepening of the reform in the power system, intelligent power grid will become a strategic direction for China's power grid development. In the intelligent power grid system, the power load has new change features due to the energy using change and the impact of the difference in price. This paper comparing the gray model, the trend fitting model and MV method, MV method is more accurate in forecasting than other methods, and can help to improve the power load forecasting management level in intelligent power grid construction.
