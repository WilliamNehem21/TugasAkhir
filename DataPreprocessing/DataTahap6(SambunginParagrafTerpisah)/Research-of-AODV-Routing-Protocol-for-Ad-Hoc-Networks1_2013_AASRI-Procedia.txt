Moreover different scenes had a big impact to the routing protocol. Same routing protocols in different simulated scenarios, its routing performance also had a great deal of difference. The main factors of the ad hoc network scenes: the number of network nodes, the changing speed and the movement speed of the network. Therefore, when comparing and analyzing different routing protocols, the network scene must be taken into account.

Some of the features in the Ad Hoc network increase the difficulty of routing technology, such as ad-hoc, multi-hop as well as the variability of the network structure, so the key to designing Ad Hoc routing protocol is to solve the problem that fast node movement makes complex changes in network structure. On the basis of the comparing and analyzing AODV routing protocol, this article introduced an improved B-AODV protocol, which ameliorated the routing finding and local repair for rebuilding new routing. The new protocol improves the routing repair capacity and packet successfully-posted ratio, reduces the delay from node to node, and decreases the routing overload. Nonetheless, the nodes in the network do not only have a two-way link, the single link protocol optimization is the goal of future research.
