selection techniques. Selection of only top-1 ranked features at the be- ginning from all the feature selection techniques and evaluation to be carried out to verify the performance of the model. Then add the next ranked features to the top-1 ranked feature and continue to add further ranked features cumulatively until the performance drops at some point. Performance can be evaluated at each stage of feature addition.

778.07 nm having 30 wavelengths. 81.28% classification accuracy was obtained for considering 105 wavelengths and 74.14% for 30 wave- lengths. Out of the entire feature selection techniques, Fisher's criterion seems to be the best method of choosing the wavelength from the NIR for the classification of healthy and defective mango. Further, to design any model like NIR camera from the NIR spectrum, an appropriate range of wavelength is needed; hence, efficient wavelength selection can be done using Fisher's criterion.
