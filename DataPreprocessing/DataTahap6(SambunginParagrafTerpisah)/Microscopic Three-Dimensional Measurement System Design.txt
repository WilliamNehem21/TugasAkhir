Micro stereo vision system is widely used in the field of microscopic research due to its high-precision 3D measurement and positioning by visual feedback. High-precision measurement data can provide advanced observation and analysis for scientific research and industrial applications. The study reconstructed three-dimensional information of objects accurately in microscopic viewing by combining phase shift technology with optical microscopy technique. This paper focused on the technology of phase shift, a system prototype has been developed, and we have done application tests in many fields to test the accuracy of this system, the feasibility and stability of the system has been verified.
