The remaining portion of this paper is structured as follows: the next section is related work which consists of a synopsis of the Bluetooth routing protocols. The proposed Bluetooth Scatternet Route Optimization Protocol is presented in detail in Section 3 and Section 4 discusses the simulation results. Finally, this paper is concluded in Section 5.

Many routing protocols for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) have been implemented but these protocols cannot be used directly in Bluetooth networks because of their bandwidth and MAC layer features. Ad hoc routing protocols are supposed to be joined with the functions of the scatternet formation. When ad hoc network protocols are applied for scatternets, ad hoc routing algorithms should be consider for the establishment of a new scatternet [7]. To find the routing paths, the scatternet needs to utilize the routing schemes.

Conventional ad hoc routing protocols can be used for Bluetooth networks. The first attempt for routing in a Bluetooth network was introduced by Bhagwat who proposed the Routing Vector Method [8]. The enhanced AODV routing protocol for a Bluetooth network [7] is a core protocol for scatternet communication; this protocol enhanced the main route discovery process of AODV [9]. The protocol uses two types of

Throughout the simulation: fifty Bluetooth devices were scattered in an area of 70m x 70m. Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic was used for the application representation. A total of fifty devices were used, varying from fifteen to fifty. There were eighteen pairs of source and destination used and the Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm was employed. The data packet types used were DH3 and DH5. The whole simulation execution time was 200 seconds.
