congestion management etc. arises due to this transformation. As transmission sector is the backbone of power sector, the question of transmission pricing is great importance. The main aim of any transmission pricing methodology is to introduce a fair competition in the electricity sector and provide efficient economic signals.

Similarly many different loss allocation schemes have been proposed for transmission loss allocation. The existing transmission loss allocation methods may be classified into prorata method, marginal methods, power flow tracing-based methods, and circuit theory based methods [1]. A usage based transmission loss allocation method is proposed in [7]. In [8] method based on circuit theory and the concept of orthogonal projection for pool based electricity market is proposed.

This paper presents a model of usage, loss and transmission reliability margin allocation based on the concept of the matrices methodology. In the proposed method modified Kirchhoff matrix is developed for usage allocation. After that loss allocation matrix is formed for transmission loss allocation to loads and generators. Further by incorporation (n-1) reliability criteria, maximum flow of transmission lines is calculated. After that the TRM of every transmission line is allocated to generators by using modified Kirchhoff matrix.
