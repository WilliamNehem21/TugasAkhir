Due to the continuous change in the topology of ad hoc networks and the lack of a central directory for publishing web services, makes the process of finding web services a very difficult challenge, several approaches have been proposed, all these solutions are based on either a keyword or ID representing the service to be searched, or using a specific scenario of discovery, all this with trying to respect the constraints of ad-hoc networks such as energy, bandwidth ... etc. In this work we proposed a model for measuring the cost of the overall energy consumption in ad hoc networks depending on the mechanisms proposed by the approaches and protocols for discovering web services.

We noticed that each of the approaches discussed violated one or more constraints posed in ad hoc networks such as bandwidth and storage resources ... etc. This will result in a significant consumption of energy. We also noted that the proposed discovery approaches are based on the IDs of the services, their names and types with a client intervention for the selection of service that satisfied their needs.

In this paper we have presented our proposed formula to calculate the cost of the energy consumed in an ad hoc environment depending on the approaches or protocols of Web services discovery. This formula is based on Ci parameters that we have taken in our comparative studies between different existing discovery approaches. This formula will allow us to evaluate any web services discovery protocol depending on the total of energy consumed.
