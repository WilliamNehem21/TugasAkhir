The feasibility of crop signaling techniques has been investigated by scientists during past few years. Up to now, no review on crop signaling technology has been published for plant identification. This paper first provides an introduction of the new concept on crop planting signaling. Challenges of existing noncontact methods including spectroscopy and imaging techniques (such as hyperspectral imaging and multispectral imaging) for discriminations of crops and weeds have been presented in Section 2. In Section 3, an emphasis has been given to the studies of recent years in advanced crop plant signaling using physical, biological and chemical markers to simplify and ensure the success of the crop and weed detection. The discussions are given on the advantages, chal- lenges and future prospects of crop planting signaling for real time applications.

canola and tomato from different weeds grown under various sunlight intensities with high accuracies (88% to 94%) (Eddy et al., 2014; Slaughter et al., 2008; Staab et al., 2009). However, it takes a lot of time and effort to effectively remove the large amount of redundant in- formation contained in the full wavelength range to simplify the model (Su et al., 2020) and improve the speed of on-line detection (Su, 2020; Su et al., 2019, 2020).
