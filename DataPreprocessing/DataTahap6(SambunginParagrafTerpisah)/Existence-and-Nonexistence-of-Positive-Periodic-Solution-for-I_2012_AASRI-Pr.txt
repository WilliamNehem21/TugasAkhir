In this paper, impulsive Nicholson's blowflies model is studied. By using Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem , we obtain some sufficient conditions for the existence of positive periodic solution. In addition, the nonexistence of positive periodic solution is also investigated. Our results extend and improve the previous literatures.

In [7][8],the oscillation and global attractivity of Nicholson's blowflies model were studied. The purpose of this paper is to obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of positive periodic solutions of system (1.1) by using Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem. Furthermore, we also investigate the nonexistence of positive periodic solutions of system (1.1).
