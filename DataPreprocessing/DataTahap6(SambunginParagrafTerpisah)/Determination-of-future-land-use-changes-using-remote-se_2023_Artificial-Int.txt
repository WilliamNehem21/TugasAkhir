Modeling and simulating LULC changes provide valuable baseline information for forecasting future development scenarios. These models can assist in land use planning by identifying land use problems such as degradation and deforestation (Ren et al., 2019; Xia et al., 2016). Land use changes have long been crucial to urban planning. As a result, a vast amount of research is focused on understanding these changes by identifying the primary key drivers that influence the changes A study by Verburg et al. (2004) proposes the need for innovative techniques to accurately measure the effects of neighboring areas, considering the complexity of the land use systems. Furthermore, this study underscores the significance of integrating temporal dynamics to achieve a higher level of integration across models examining land use changes. These models include transportation, demographic, erosion, and groundwater, all impacting land use cover.

tive effects on the LULC modeling easier. However, the subjectivity of the input for the weights is a limitation in the model (Chang et al., 2018). The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach may be employed to address the weakness of multicriteria analysis. In the work of Saputra and Lee (2019), an ANN model was used to simulate multiple land-use changes and complex land-use systems. It was utilized to predict LULC changes while considering the influencing factors.

LULC changes are occurring rapidly in Southeast Asian (SEA) coun- tries, generally associated with population growth, economic develop- ment, and competing demands for land (Lambin et al., 2003). The most common changes include urban expansion, loss of agricultural land, re/deforestation, logging, and many more (Vadrevu et al., 2019). This is evident in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, where large-scale deforestation for palm oil plantation expansions has been happening continuously to address the demands of palm oil in the international market (Koh and Wilcove, 2008). On the other hand, most developing countries, aside from small-scale deforestation caused by indigenous agriculture due to poverty, also suffer from rapid urbanization (Seto et al., 2022). These drivers of LULC changes vary widely in the SEA region. Understanding the variation of LULC is achieved by continually monitoring the geographic distribution of the land use pattern. Remote Sensing (RS) with GIS application, urban pattern detection using GIS, and ANN algorithm to generate LULC, were applied to understand the land changes.

The study of Handayani et al. (2018) applied geospatial analysis using multi-spatial resolution data to determine the urban expansion of Surabaya, Indonesia. This study used several RS images to generate LULC change. The accuracy assessment was tested to the 500 ground truth points using post-classification to produce overall accuracy (OA) and K. Likewise, in the study of Sharma et al. (2018), a GIS-based in- tegrated modeling approach was demonstrated to analyze the spatial pattern of LULC.

This study investigates the multilayer perception artificial neural network (MLP-ANN), which has gained recognition as a highly reliable neural network model. MLP-ANNs have demonstrated their effective- ness in pattern recognition and classification tasks (Amgoth et al., 2023; Dinda et al., 2022; Silva et al., 2020). The neural network model en- compasses an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer (Bocco et al., 2014; Isabona et al., 2022; Megahed et al., 2015). MLP-ANNs are ciate these input features with specific LULC classes through training. This enables accurate classification and analysis of LULC patterns. The MLP-ANN model was used in the study to manage and analyze large datasets and make land use change projections. The study aimed to

The LULC transition matrix displays the alterations in the LULC classifications from 2017 to 2021. The rows represent the LULC information for 2017, while the columns represent the corresponding information for 2021. The matrix presents a visual representation of the changes in LULC for each classification.

for 2030 and 2050 were estimated by assuming the continuation of the current land use change patterns. The weights utilized in simulating the 2021 LULC map were applied to the neural network in simulating future LULC changes. This can give current and future insights into the po- tential land use pattern and provide an understanding of land use planning and management decisions.

The transition matrix values show the changes from each classifica- tion to another classification. The transition modeling from 2017 to 2021 depicts that water, trees, built area, and rangeland increase over time. In contrast, the changes in the land have a detrimental impact on the flood vegetation, crops, bare ground, and clouds. The built area classification has the highest positive increase of the land with approximately 2.56% or 240.669 km2, while the crop classification decreases around 0.79% or 101.265 km2.

This information helps us understand the patterns and trends of LULC changes over time. By analyzing the LULC transition matrix, decision-makers can plan and implement effective, sustainable land use management and conservation strategies. Moreover, the insights generated from the neural network model can be leveraged for various purposes, such as urban planning, environmental management, and natural resource management.

In 2050, the built area will continue to increase to 6.89% or approximately 337.02 km2. In contrast, the trees will decrease from 2.31% in 2030 to 0.62% in 2050. This demonstrates how land changes are affected by human activities. This result also reflects that Davao City is driving toward heavy industrialization and urbanization in the future. The agricultural related classification like crops, flood vegetation, bare ground, and rangeland will be heavily affected in the future; around

The LULC is essential as a basis for resource monitoring and planning activities. The LULC can assist in developing plans to balance develop- ment and conservation. This study applies the MLP-ANN model to pre- dict changes in LULC in Davao City, Philippines.

The elevation and distance to the road network are derived from DEM and used as exploratory maps to train the MLP-ANN model. The exploratory maps for 2017 and 2021 show significant impacts on land changes in the simulation. The accuracy rate and Kappa index show that the predicted and actual maps for 2021 are in very high agreement. The MLP-ANN model was also employed to forecast how land will be used in 2030 and 2050.

The prediction models for 2030 and 2050 show a high increase in the built area, up to 6.89%, based on the 2017 baseline map. The trees classification will increase by approximately 2.31% in 2030, but it will slightly increase in the year 2050. Meanwhile, the crop area will decrease to around 464.203 km2 (3.25%) and 738.83 km2 (3.32%) in 2030 and 2050, respectively. This indicates that human activities in- fluence the LULC change from agricultural land classifications to the built area.

The use of the MLP-ANN model in this study provides a valuable tool for predicting future changes in the landscape. However, the results can be improved by including the impact of climate change and other meteorological and hydrological parameters. Addressing these limita- tions will broaden the understanding of how land use patterns evolve in Davao City and help inform future sustainable development strategies.
