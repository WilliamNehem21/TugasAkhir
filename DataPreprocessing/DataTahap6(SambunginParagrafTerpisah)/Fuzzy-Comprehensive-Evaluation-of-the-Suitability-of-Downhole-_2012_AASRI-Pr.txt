wells can effectively slow down the water cone and gas cone, increase the sweep area of gas drive or water drive, promote single well productivity and then enhance oil recovery. The choke flow of ICD can control the flow in the downhole production layer and adjust the production profile to get the balancing development and optimized production of oil and gas. But many elements would affect the horizontal well productivity with ICD and to describe, analyze and evaluate them is hard because of their vagueness and uncertainty. Therefore this work introduces the fuzzy mathematical method, an evaluating method with theory of fuzzy set which integrates evaluating matrix and the objective fuzzy matrix. It could tell the quality of many factors objectively and make quantitative evaluation correctly. The key point in establishing optimized evaluation model with fuzzy mathematics is in determining the evaluating index factor, index weight, and subordinate function matrix affecting the suitability of ICD and then establishing the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model.

The relative fitness rij varies from 0 to 1 when comprehensively evaluating ICD suitability with different cases. The larger value of rij means the higher suitability of ICD completion. The matrix of all rij values is the fuzzy comprehensive suitability matrix of ICD completion R(x).
