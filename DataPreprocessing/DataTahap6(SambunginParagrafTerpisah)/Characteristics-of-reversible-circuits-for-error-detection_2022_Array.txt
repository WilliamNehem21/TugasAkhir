The multiple-error case is much more intricate, because error lo- cations and circuit structure start to matter. This leads to drastically different behaviors of best case (independent errors) and worst case (severe masking) behavior. To better understand the typical behavior of multiple errors, we resort to numerical simulations. These indicate a (close-to) best-case behavior: the probability of failing to detect a

Note that a similar line of thought has recently been presented for the domain of quantum computing (which bears many similarities to reversible circuits). More precisely, a verification scheme heavily based on simulation has been proposed in [17] and refined in [18]. A similar theoretical result has been presented in [19].
