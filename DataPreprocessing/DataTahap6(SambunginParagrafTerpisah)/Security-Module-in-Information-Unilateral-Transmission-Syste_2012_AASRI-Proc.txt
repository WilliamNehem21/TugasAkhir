Physical isolation among different confidential levels Networks are always being used to keep data unrevealed, information unilateral transmission system transmits data across networks. Information security module is essential in system and being used to make sure data untouched in low confidential level network. MD5 algorithm is used in digital signature and RSA arithmetic is used encoding and decoding process. Experiments approve its efficiency and security.

Assign primitive A, B, C, D to variable a, b, c, d. Divide 512 bits data block to 16 strings of 32 bits. Compute Each 32 bit string 4 rounds. There are many processes in a round, the first process in 4 rounds are different, the rest process are the same. These are 4 nonlinear functions used in process.

After these 4 rounds compute process, add A, B, C, D to a, b, c, d separately. Then compute next group of data, the output are the cascades of A, B, C and D. When all the groups of data are computed, cascade the outcome, we get the MD5 results. [2]

Format clear data. Use PKCS format: EB=00||BT||PS||00||D, BT means type of block, PS is filling cluster, D is clear text. The beginning is 0 to insure the length of EB is more than k. public key encryption BT=02, private key decryption BT=01. When BT=02, PS is non-null random number; when BT=01, the value of PS is FF.

Divide original clear text from clear text in PKCS format. The process is also check integrality of data. If problems below happen then decryption failed: cannot divide clearly; filling cluster is less than 64 bit or mismatch with type labeled by BT; BT is not accord with practical type.
