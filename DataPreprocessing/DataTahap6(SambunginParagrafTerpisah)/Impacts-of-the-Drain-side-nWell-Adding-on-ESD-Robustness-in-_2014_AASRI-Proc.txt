In recent years, with advances and scaling in microelectronic technologies, a large number of silicon technology has been widely used in the daily use of personal computers, laptops, mobile phones, internet, digital cameras, and others applications. Moreover, electrostatic discharge (ESD) events affect the reliability of ICs appeared to be increasingly serious, the reason lies in the integrated circuits are scaled, resulting in a thinner gate oxide layer, the source/drain regions were shallow junction depths and contacts window size got smaller. Therefore, the weighting of integrated circuits suffered by ESD damages is rapidly increased. Therefore, ESD reliability has become increasingly important for ultra deep submicron or nano-scale processes electronic products [1-4].

The damage of ESD for integrated circuits was mostly caused by ESD large current with residual heat. The rising time was set to be in the nano second scale, and the voltage can be up to kV during the transient ESD noise of human body model (HBM). The transient power on a small area of drain depleted high-resistance region of an MOSFET is high. The generated heat usually results in aluminum or via-plug material of a contact window spiking, and the fusing part would form alloy with silicon substrate. Then, the p/n junction of semiconductor device disappears, and the electrical junction performance will seem to be short and abnormal. The spiking phenomenon is prone to take place in p/n junction of drain or source side, especially occurs in the drain reverse bias situation. This is due to the resistance of this area be highest and to form high temperature and cause spiking phenomena.
