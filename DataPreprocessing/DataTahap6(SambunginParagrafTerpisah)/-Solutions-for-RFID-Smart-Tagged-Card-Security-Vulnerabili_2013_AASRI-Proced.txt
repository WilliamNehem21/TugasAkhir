RFID tag goes in the communication zone of the reader, the reader tells the tag to send the data that is stored on it. After the reader collects the data from the tag, it sends the data to the RFID controller by a network connection (Ethernet, Mobile IP, etc.). The controller will take the information and use it depending on the type of data it has received. The data can be stored in a database or moved as an object in inventory.
