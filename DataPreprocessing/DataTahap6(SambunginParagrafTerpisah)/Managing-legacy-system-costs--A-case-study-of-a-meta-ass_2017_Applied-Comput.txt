That said, there are several important observations to make on the meta-model by way of concluding this paper. The first is to note that despite the disparate knowledge of the FinCo respondents all but one of the individual outcomes plot into the HBV-LTV quadrant when mapped onto the decisional matrix. This is also true for the mapping of the consolidated response and the consolidated response excluding all answers from the maintainability section. Thus we conclude that although the technical knowledge of the assessment partici- pants varied considerably the results show a high degree of consistency in the output of the meta-model.
