RES market is given by demand and supply. Supply consists from supplement and costs of RES and it is defined in investment and production phase of given project, orientated to RES using. On the other hand demand on RES is stimulated by tools, orientated to consumption.

System of support of electricity production from RES connects very closely with RES trading in area of energetic. Prevailing and mostly used support tool is system of purchase prices, many times in combination with surcharges to market price that is used in majority of EU countries. Similarly effective seems to be also support by the way of investment donations and tax measurements that are used in large measure as well. System of obligatory quota in combination with trading green certificates is used as main system of support in Belgium, Romania, Poland, Italy and Great Britain. System of tender is less used tool for RES support and in present time it is realized in Ireland, Latvia, Italy or Great Britain. In connection with dominated purchase prices we can discuss about convenience of this system, since according some opinions this system of support deforms market and it is not sufficiently effective. System of obligatory quota is trying to be forefront as well as system of green certificates, which could bring more of market environment and at the same time more intensive development of electricity production from RES. But new member states are against that, since they apply system of purchase prices and creation of market system with green certificates would be in short time very demanding, till unrealizable. Due to the mentioned new member states are orientated rather to the increasing of quality of present supporting systems.
