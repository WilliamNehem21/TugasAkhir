To prepare samples in the first stage it is necessary to disperse the zinc oxide into the polymer matrix. For this, 12 grams of zinc oxide (II) moistened with water was put into 100 ml of the 10% PVA water solution (which was homogenate on the bain-marie before it). After one hour of settling time, the 60 grams of the resulting mixture was coated on the glass plate with an area of 234 sq.cm. Then the composition was dried in a horizontal orientation at room temperature for 24 hours.

To achieve these aims, samples of the photosensitive compositions were exposed to the integrated spectrum light of a DRT-125 mercury-vapor lamp during various exposure times. The illumination on the sample surface was E=0.105 W/sq.cm., and the optical blackening determination was carried out by the approved method using the author's hardware-software complex [3].

Thus, in all likelihood, the presence of the acetate groups in the PVA structure initiate the PVA deacylation reactions (removal of the acetic acid residue) in the early stage of the irradiation. It is well known that deacylation reaction occurs more easily in the presence of an electrophilic agent due to its high polarity of the  bond. Such an agent in the PVA-ZnO-BiCl3 composition may be a hydrogen ion H+, formed in the composition during the photoinitiated processes [1].
