The neutral point balance can be achieved by using an algorithm to switch the inverter with proper switching states such that the DC-link balancing is achieved. Josep Pou et .al have used stationary feed forward SVPWM for D.C-link balancing, in which the duty cycle calculations involved are more complex. A new modulation approach for complete control of DC-link balancing in 3-level 3-phase NPC VSI has been proposed based on the virtual vector concept, which guarantees the balancing of DC-link voltage for any load over the full modulation range (Jian-Yong ZHENG et.al, 2010). However this method has only been implemented using carrier based PWM which involves the calculation of angles and trigonometric ratios. A complete control has been obtained in the 3-level 3-phase NPC inverter (Amit Kumar Gupta et.al, 2007). This scheme fully dependants on modulation index and reference vector angle.

DC-link imbalance is mainly due to medium vectors, because the phase currents are not zero in those vectors. Due to the existing phase currents, capacitor balance cannot be achieved. The capacitor can be balanced by proper utilization of the short, zero and large vectors without medium vectors (du Toit Mouton.H et .al, 2002).
