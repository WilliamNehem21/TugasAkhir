by the transmission network and the airlight network prior to defogging by the refinement network, and a key points-based network will effec- tively detect the vehicle in the defogged images [18]. Chang S., Zhang Y., et al. proposed an end-to-end training spatial attention fusion with a deep learning detection network and constructed a generation that trained the neural network by converting radar points into images [19]. With the rapid development of computer vision and machine

M and Yamamoto K proposed a model based on a flat surface to estimate the height of an obstacle while taking unevenness into account [32,33]. Jung S., Cho Y., et al. extracted feature points using the Harris detector before classifying background and foreground using epipolar geometry [34]. These methods are based on the change of pixel to achieve the detection of the target. While the detection result will be more precise, more feature points will be generated.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the principal of the improved VIDAR is presented. In Section 3, a brief overview of the improved VIDAR and machine learning-based obstacle detection method is given. In Section 4, the performance results of the proposed method are presented and analyzed. In Section 5, the conclusion and future work are drawn.

In emergency situations, unknown obstacle detection is a necessary supplement to machine learning-based obstacle detection. For an un- known type of obstacle detection method based on motion compensa- tion, the conventional feature extraction, and matching method is both time-consuming and space-consuming. Although the VIDAR using the MSER-based image region matching method proposed in papers [37,38] can effectively detect unknown types of obstacles, the detection speed can be increased.
