we can strengthen the above argumentation by observing that in physical systems the temporal evolution plays a central role. this is highlighted by the fact that the violation of a constraint may bring the system to bad effects, which reflect to the environment where the system acts. this is the reason why the study of real-time systems, i.e. systems whose behavior depends on real-time constraints, has been strongly developed. in these systems it is necessary to describe the qualitative and the quantitative temporal constraints.
