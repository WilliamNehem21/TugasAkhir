also, the class diagram can be further re ned by object constraints attached to the classes. these constraints include invariants for the classes and their attributes, and preand postconditions for their operations. it is also possible to represent the multiplicity adornments at the association ends as constraints. the constraints can be given in formal textual notation using the object constraint language(ocl) for expressions. an example for a postcondition of the server's operation getfreeip() is: constraints can be evaluated to true there exists no inconsistency, otherwise the model is inconsistent or incomplete. the result may depend on the values of variables, e.g., the values of attributes. if for each possible assignment of the variables the logical expression is evaluated to false, it is contradictory and de nitely points out a critical point.
