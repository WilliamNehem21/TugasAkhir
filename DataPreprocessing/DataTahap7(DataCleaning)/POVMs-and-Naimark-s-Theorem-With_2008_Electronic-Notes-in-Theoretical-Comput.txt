remark 2.1 it is worth noting that this purely multiplicative definition of completely positive maps(i.e. it relies on tensor structure alone) incarnates the kraus representation, where the usual summation is now implicitly captured by the internal traceand/or cotrace-structure on cpm(c), i.e. the half-circles in the pictures representing completely positive maps.



remark 4.9 while povms are not concerned with the state after the measurement, our analysis does produce an obvious candidate for non-destructive generalised measurements, sometimes referred to as pmvms in the literature. we postpone a discussion to forthcoming writings.



remark 4.10 notice the delicate role which x-completeness and normalisation of the povms plays in all this, on which, due to lack of space, we cannot get into. we postpone this discussion to an extended version of the present paper, which is also forthcoming.
