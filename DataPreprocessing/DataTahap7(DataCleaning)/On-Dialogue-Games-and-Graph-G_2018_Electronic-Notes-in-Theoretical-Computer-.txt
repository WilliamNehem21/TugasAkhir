we will be particularly interested in the category dgbal of rooted dialogue games and balanced conflict-free strategies. in order to perform our comparison with graph games, we adapt the definition of the positional graph(def. 1.6) associated to a dialogue game, by considering only its balanced positions:



definition 6.2 the balanced graph g(a) of a rooted dialogue game a is the restriction of grapha to the balanced positions and to the edges between them. note that the paths of g(a) are exactly the balanced trajectories of a.
