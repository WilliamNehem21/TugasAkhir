abstract interpretation and denotational semantics share foundations and applications, and the interaction between the two areas is intricate. the inverse-limit construction and its associated scott-topology show how to derive abstract domains as structural approximations of inverse-limit-defined scott-domains. the inductive format of denotational semantics definitions ensures the soundness of the resulting abstract interpretation, where abstract domain replaces scott-domain. in this manner, abstract interpretation can be explained from the perspective of denotational semantics.
