this section considers the situation arising from a monoidal v-category with finite biproducts. by the previous two sections, we know that such a category can be seen both as a cmon(v)-category and as an act(v)-category. using the correct distributivity we will show that it can in fact be seen as a category enriched over semimodules.



the following argument is due to hilton and eckmann(, but see also[15, exercise ii.5.5]), who proved it for c= set. it states that when an object carries two monoid structures and the multiplication map of one is a monoid homomorphism with respect to the other, then the two monoid structures coincide and are in fact commutative.
