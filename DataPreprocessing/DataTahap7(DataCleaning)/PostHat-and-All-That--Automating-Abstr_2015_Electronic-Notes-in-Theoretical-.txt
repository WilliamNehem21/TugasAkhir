maintains both an under-approximation and an over-approximation of the desired answer. the advantage of a bilateral algorithm is that in case of a timeout, it is safe to return the over-approximation. at various stages of the algorithm, effort is expended on improving the over-approximation, and if the algorithm were given additional time, it might return a better answer.(such an algorithm is called an



from such a reinterpretation of the tsl meta-language, which is extended automatically to tsl expressions and functions, tsl creates sound over-approximating transformers. standard analysis algorithms can then use the transformers to obtain inductive a-invariants. however, there is generally some loss of precision with the reinterpretation approach, so the resulting analyses generally do not find best inductive a-invariants.
