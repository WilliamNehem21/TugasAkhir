deep neural networks are suffering from over parameterized high storage and high consumption problems. pruning can effectively reduce storage and computation costs of deep neural networks by eliminating their redundant parameters. in existing pruning methods, filter pruning achieves more efficient inference, while element-wise pruning maintains better accuracy. to make a trade-off between the two endpoints, a variety of pruning patterns has been proposed. this study analyzes the performance characteristics of sparse dnns pruned by different patterns, including element-wise, vector-wise, block-wise, and group-wise. based on the analysis, we propose an efficient implementation of group-wise sparse dnn inference, which can make better use of gpus. experimental results on vgg, resnet, bert and vit show that our optimized group-wise pruning pattern achieves much lower inference latency on gpu than other sparse patterns and the existing group-wise pattern implementation.



in order to achieve high accuracy, dnns usually have the property of over-parameterized. in other words, they contain redundant parameters that cost large storage and are difficult to be deployed to resource-constrained devices. the inference latency of dnns is also affected due to the large amount of computational operations. to address this issue, researchers have proposed various methods to compress dnn models. pruning is a representative and effective model compression method. it identifies and removes redundant parameters in a dnn according to specific criteria. ideally, after conducting pruning method, the amount of both model parameters and computational operations is reduced, and the inference time cost should also be reduced.



in this study, we analyze the performance characteristics of different sparse dnns, including element-wise, vector-wise, block-wise, and group-wise patterns. we find that these pruning patterns with off-the-shelf sparse computing libraries(e.g., cusparse) are difficult to make full use of gpu ability. we then propose an efficient implementation of structured sparse dnn inference based on group-wise pattern. more specifically, for convolutional neural networks(cnns), group-wise pattern removes the parameters with the same indixes in all channels. for recurrent neural networks(rnns) and transformerbased models, group-wise pattern removes rows of each weight matrix. based on this pruning pattern, we convert the dominant computation kernels of pruned cnns, rnns, and transformers to general matrix multiplication(gemm) operations. current deep learning programming frameworks(e.g., pytorch, tensorflow) and hardware platforms support well-developed gemm operations. therefore, our implementation can make better use of gpus. besides, group-wise pruning pattern only constrains the layout of non-zero elements. it is easy to combine the pattern with existing sophisticated pruning schedules and importance criteria, like dynamic sparse training, lottery ticket hypothesis[4,13], magnitude[14,15], taylor, hessian, etc. the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:



we propose an efficient implementation of group-wise pruning pattern. the implementation converts group-wise sparse matrixmatrix multiplication into gemm operations and optimizes the memory accesses according to gpu hardware characteristics. it makes full use of existing runtime libraries and gpu hardware support.



generally, neural networks have over-parameterized property and contain redundant parameters. by analyzing and removing these redundant parameters during or after training, a neural network can be optimized to obtain a lower execution time and consume less memory resources when it is deployed to a target device. this process is the pruning of neural networks.



lecun et al. in pioneered the optimal brain damage(obd) method that treats the individual weights as a unit. hassibi et al.[19, 20] proposed an optimal brain surgeon(obs) method based on the optimal brain damage method with the addition of an update step based on the surgical recovery weights, based on the diagonal assumption, the extreme value assumption and the quadratic assumption. later, han et al. proposed that learning only the important connections in the network can reduce the number of model parameters and computation without affecting the final accuracy of the network, and proposed the classical pruning-retraining framework. li et al. proposed a compression technique based on convolutional kernel pruning. hu et al. proposed to use both the base model output and the pruned classification loss function to supervise the channel selection at each filter pruning, is also dense model, so it can be calculated by gemm. due to the strong constraint of the structured pruning pattern, the accuracy is usually worse than fine-grained pruning. related studies focus on maintain higher accuracy. flexpruner, a filter pruning method with flexible rate. it is based on a greedy strategy to select the filters to be pruned. li et al. extend the optimization space for pruning, so their method is able to compress the model more effectively. the maskacc pruning method dynamically reorganizes tensors and mask information used in convolutions to avoid unnecessary computations, so that the computational efficiency of the pruning process is improved.



into several larger tile blocks according to the parallelism property during hardware computation, and prunes the ranks and columns within the blocks. lebedev et al. proposed a group-wise pruning pattern in the convolutional layer in. however, the pattern was combined with the brain damage criterion to propose a whole set of pruning method. we instead propose an efficient implementation of the groupwise pattern that focuses more on the inference time. moreover, this work extends group-wise in the linear layer to achieve optimization of the whole neural network in terms of inference time.



in addition to innovations and research on pruning patterns, researchers also focus on efficient implementation and execution of pruned models. for instance, sparta is an end-to-end model sparsity framework that uses tensor-with-sparsity attribute(tesa) to build sparse models. providing speedup for unstructured pruning and block-wise granularity pruning, it is compatible with a variety of sparse models and optimization techniques, facilitating sparse algorithms to explore better sparse models.



compared with the existing works, the work proposed in this paper make better use of off-the-shelf dense computing libraries provided by vendors, e.g., cublas. it has simpler implementation and higher portability. it avoids to use low-level apis and hyper-parameters(e.g., tile width, block size) that are related to hardware architectures, so it can run on all nvidia gpus, and achieve acceleration without specific tuning.



the group-wise pattern divides the weights of different channels at the same position into a group. when the kernel tensor is expanded into a weight expansion matrix, each group forms exactly one row. at this point the unimportant rows are removed by calculating the importance score of each row according to the pruning criterion.



as the index value increases, the score becomes smaller and smaller. after sorting each layer, the scores of all tensors are calculated and the global pruning is performed. according to the algorithm, it can be seen that this method pruning operation after the model training. the vector-wise pattern uses the implementation method in. this method prunes the weights with smaller absolute values in each weight vector. the pruning schedule for this pruning method is during training. the block-wise pattern uses the method proposed in. the method



according to the results, vector-wise and block-wise perform better than element-wise on convolutional and transformer-based networks. however, all the pruned models have much worse performance than the corresponding dense models. sparse computation can outperform dense computation only when the sparsity is extremely high, which will lead to significant accuracy drop and is impractical for applications. therefore, we need a pruning pattern that can leverage an off-theshelf dense computation library and does not need impractically high sparsity.



layers of convolutional neural networks. it can also be applied to nlp models. the most heavy computation in nlp models, like rnns and transformer-based models, is direct multiplication of two weight matrices. we can simply follow the same idea of group-wise pruning pattern for cnns. each row of the weight matrix is removed or reserved simultaneously. then the reserved rows are concatenated into a dense matrix. by this way group-wise is extended to linear layers.



existing pruning methods usually adopt two ways to keep the location of pruned weights: using masks, or directly setting the pruned weights to zeros. if using masks, binary mask matrices are used to indicate whether the weights at corresponding locations are pruned. our implementation covers both two ways. algorithm 1 and algorithm 2 show the implementations of inference with group-wise sparse convolutional layers and linear layers, respectively. in algorithm



in our experiments, the sparse cnn models and the vit model are trained from scratch, and these models are pruned with element-wise, vector-wise, block-wise and group-wise sparse model with 100 epochs at different target sparsity levels, depending on the dataset size. the nlp models are evaluated with pre-trained models and fine-tuned by 10 epochs at each target sparsity level. they are also pruned by applying the patterns of element-wise, vector-wise, block-wise and group-wise, respectively.



baseline. the models obtained by element-wise, vector-wise and blockwise pruning patterns are sparse models, so they are computed using the cusparse library. group-wise can be computed using the cublas library through a series of processes. all experiments are performed on an nvidia geforce rtx 2080 ti gpu using fp32. the convolutional operations in the cnn models are converted to gemm by the im2col method.



the experimental results show that the group-wise pattern has shorter latency than all the other sparse patterns at the same sparsity. group-wise effectively takes advantage of the dense gemm acceleration, which makes fast inference possible even after pruning to obtain a sparse model. when compared with the dense model, effective latency reduction will be achieved on resnet-18, bert-base and vit models. poor performance is achieved on vgg-16 when using small datasets, but effective latency reduction is achieved on larger datasets. because small datasets have less data to be calculated, the reduced calculation time after pruning is insufficient to counteract the overhead introduced by extra steps for pruning. even so, when the remaining parameter ratio



in this paper, we conduct an empirical comparison on existing mainstream pruning patterns, including element-wise, vector-wise, blockwise and group-wise pattern. after analyzing their inefficiency, we propose a more efficient implementation of the group-wise pattern on gpu using off-the-shelf gemm library. experimental results show that its inference latency on gpu is much lower than that of other sparse patterns. the proposed optimization implementation can further improve the inference speed of dnn models compared to existing group-wise approach. in addition, when the reserved parameters of the model are less than 75%, our group-wise inference performance can exceed that of dense models.
