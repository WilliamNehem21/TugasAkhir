it is demonstrated that using non-linear properties of stimuli-sensitive polymers enables dramatic simplification of design of image display systems. proposed scheme is based on joint action of two heating elements placed in each pixel. preliminary experimental results showing feasibility of proposed approach are described in this report.



this paper demonstrates that mentioned disadvantages can be eliminated as a result of utilizing non-linear qualities of stimuli-sensitive, particularly thermo-sensitive polymers. substances of this kind have been subject of extended research dergunov et al., okano, barker et al. and tanaka; large number of polymers, whose solutions sustain phase transition as a result of change in temperature, have been synthesized. previous research dergunov et al., okano, barker et al. and tanaka indicates that there is a strong relation of the parameters of a solution to stimuli in the area of phase transition, as summarized in ergozhin et al.



leds were used as a source of visible optical emission. receivers of emissions(light-dependent resistors) were located at the opposite side of the cuvette at 15 mm distance. a specially designed electronic scheme capable of recording measurable values of resistance of a light-dependent resistor in a text file at time resolution of 1-100 microseconds was employed.
