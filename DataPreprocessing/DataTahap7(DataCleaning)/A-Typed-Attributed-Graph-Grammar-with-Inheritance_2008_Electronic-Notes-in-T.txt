proving the correctness of ggcsd relating the original specification of uml is not possible, because most of the constraints of the original definition of sequence diagrams are only informal. in contrast the formal definition eliminates some problems in the original definition(see 3.4). the explicit model transformation in subsection 3.2 demonstrates the close correspondence to uml defined with mof. restrictions by multiplicities and constraints are already followed and argued at the corresponding rules.



the two rules and allows multiple inheritance without cycles. the acyclic structure is demanded by the following constraint for classifiers in the uml specification. it is mentioned exemplary to show how we argue that our graph grammar generates well-formed instances only.



mentioned in subsection 2.2. all detected problems are solved in the graph grammar. besides changing the text of ocl constraints also some connections and nodes in the meta-model had to be rearranged or inserted to cover the information of a diagram correctly.



in a next step the grammar shall be extended to deliver enough editing rules to automatically generate a syntax directed editor. the tiger project develops an eclipse plug-in, which allows defining a graph grammar, connecting the abstract syntax with concrete layout information and generating a syntax directed editor for the language as new eclipse plug-in. this editor can be used for modeling in the common concrete syntax but generating automatically the precise structured abstract syntax.
