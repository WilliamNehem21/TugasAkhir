length-two string rewriting systems are length-preserving string rewriting systems that consist of lengthtwo rules. this paper shows that confluence, termination, left-most termination and right-most termination are undecidable properties for length-two string rewriting systems. these results mean that these properties are undecidable for the class of linear term rewriting systems in which depth-two variables are allowed in both sides of rules.



confluence and termination are both generally undecidable for term rewriting systems(trss) and for string rewriting systems(srss). hence several decidable classes have been studied. confluence is a decidable property for terminating trss, and ground trss. the latter result was extended to linear shallow trss and shallow right-linear trss. classes for which termination is a decidable property are investigated and extended: ground trss, right-ground trss, trss that consist of right-ground rules, collapsing rules and shallow right-linear rules, and the related class of shallow left-linear trss.



srss are said to be length preserving if the left-hand side and the right-hand side of each rule have the same length. since there is a finite number of rules, the number of different symbols appearing in the rules is finite, and fixed for srss, and the number of strings with a given length is also finite. thus the decidability of the following problems for length-preserving srss trivially follows.



in this paper, we showed that confluence, termination, left-most termination, and right-most termination are undecidable properties for length-two srss which are length-preserving srss consisting of length-two rules. thus all these properties are also undecidable properties for linear trss in which depth-two variables are allowed in both sides of the rules. we still have remaining questions concerning(un)decidability results for classes of srss obtained by limiting the number of rules.
