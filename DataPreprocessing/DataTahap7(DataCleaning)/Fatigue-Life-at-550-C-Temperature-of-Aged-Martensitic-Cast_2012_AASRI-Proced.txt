cyclic softening of the investigated cast steel proceeded until the end of the test. for this reason, in accordance with, the occurrence of deformation of hysteresis loop in the compression half cycle was assumed to be the criterion for the end of the test at each of five strain levels. cyclic softening observed within the entire fatigue test proves the fatigue life exhaustion in the examined cast steel. analysis of literature data[6, 7] allows to state that similar strong cyclic softening was also observed in the case of highchromium martensitic steels used in the power industry. in those cases, however, the occurrence of stabilization period of hysteresis loop parameters was noticed.



similar dependence was also observed for high-temperature creep resisting martensitic steels of the p91 and p92 type(for the as-received condition), however, the abscissa nt amounted to ca. 1000 cycles in this case. in addition, it can be stated that shifting of the transition point nt to a smaller number of cycles for the cast steel after ageing, compared to the as-received condition, proves deterioration in the plastic properties of gp91 cast steel.
