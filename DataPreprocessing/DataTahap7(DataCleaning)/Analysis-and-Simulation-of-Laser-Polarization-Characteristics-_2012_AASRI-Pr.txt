, remote sensing, medical imaging and other fields. domestic research on laser polarization is also mainly focused on these fields and pays little attention to short-range detection, especially detection model, of ground objects. this paper mainly models and analyzes the laser polarization characteristic on the surface of metal target, and the simulation of polarization characteristics on the surface of several typical metal targets is also implemented.



according to the above analysis of reflection characteristics on metal surface, both the reflectivity and the phase of s and p components change in different degrees. in general, incident linear polarized laser beam becomes elliptically polarized on reflection from metal. according to the definition of stokes parameters, the changes of polarization on reflection from metal can be described by muller matrix which can represent the process of reflection. assuming that the stokes vector of the incident light is[s i; s i; s i; s i], and the stokes vector of reflected light is[s r; s r; s r; s r]. the muller matrix for reflection on metal surface can be derived by coordinating formulas(1) and(5).
