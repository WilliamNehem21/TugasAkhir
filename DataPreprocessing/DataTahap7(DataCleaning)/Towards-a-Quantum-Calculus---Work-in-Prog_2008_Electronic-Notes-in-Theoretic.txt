in the quantum gate array model, the computational part of a quantum information processing task is performed by unitary transformations. in the one-way quantum computer, computations rely upon one-qubit projective measurements followed by unitary pauli corrections. the measurement calculus has been introduced as a formal model for one-way quantum computation. the aim of this paper is to introduce a unified and generalized model of quantum computation, the quantum calculus: unified because both unitary transformations and one-qubit measurements(i.e. the main ingredients of one-way quantum computations) are allowed, and generalized in terms of quantum operations and in terms of classical control. the quantum calculus allows any admissible transformation or general measurement(including



the denotational semantics[.] defined in this section is a pure denotational semantics because the semantic domain is based on valuations over pure quantum states, as opposed to the semantics defined in section 3.2 which is based on density matrices.
