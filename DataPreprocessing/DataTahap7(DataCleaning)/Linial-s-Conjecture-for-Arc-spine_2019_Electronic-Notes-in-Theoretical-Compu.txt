we say that a digraph d is an arc-spine digraph if there exists a partition{x, y} in v(d) where d[x] is traceable and d[y] contains at most one arc. one such partition{x, y} of an arc-spine digraph is maximal if x is maximal. we use d[x, y] to denote that d has one such partition{x, y} and that it is maximal. we denote by a the unique arc of d[y] that may exist and by u and v the tail and head of a, respectively. let p=(x1, x2,..., xl) be a hamilton path of d[x].



in lemma 2.4 we show that there is an analogue of[9, lemma 1] for k-loose arcspine digraphs. note, however, that the concept of k-loose for arc-spine digraphs presented here is different from the concept of k-loose for spine digraphs presented in. the different definition of k-loose was needed as a means to guarantee that there would be perfect analogues of lemmas 1 and 3 from for arc-spine digraphs. the analogue of[9, lemma 3] is lemma 2.8.



the most ingenious part of the proof presented by sambinelli, nunes da silva and lee is the proof of[9, lemma 3]. next, we show the proof of its analogue for arc-spine digraphs, lemma 2.8. again, note that the concept of k-tight for spine digraphs is different from the presented definition of k-tight arc-spine digraphs. furthermore, we point out that the proof of the base case of lemma 2.8 is considerably more intricate than the base case of[9, lemma 3].
