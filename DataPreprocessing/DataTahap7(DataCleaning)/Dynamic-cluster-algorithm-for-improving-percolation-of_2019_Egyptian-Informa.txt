the solution with dynamic clustering sensors tries to form different clusters at different times according to the movement of the target, so a node can be a member of different clusters at different time. unless static clustering, dynamically it forms the cluster with sensors. only one cluster is active at each time in accordance to target moving manner. thus it reduces the energy consumption of sensors in the cluster. it is more reliable than static clustering method. also the sensor nodes sensing and forwarding redundant information has been reduced. in, the authors have mentioned that dynamic cluster-based approaches provide better bandwidth utilization and higher scalability than other approaches in target tracking.



hybrid solutions combine several approaches. as an example, a predictive mechanism(markov chain) implemented on a clustered network is proposed in[3*]. by analyzing the intrinsic relationship between tracking performance and energy consumption, the contribution cast the scheduling problem of wsn as the optimal policy problem of partially observable markov decision process, and proposes a dynamic cluster members scheduling(dcms) algorithm to solve the tradeoff between tracking performance and energy consumption. the authors of[13,14] propose a dynamic clustering algorithm coupled with the kalman filter to predict the position of the single moving target. it is described using a state evolution



virtual force algorithms(vfa) are popular approaches for solving the problem of coverage and deployment of nodes. in this type of algorithm, the nodes are considered points subjected to a force of repulsion and attraction exerted between them and which can move as a function of the calculated force. in, the authors proposed a virtual force-directed co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization(vfcpso) algorithm to maximize sensing coverage while minimizing the energy consumption in a hybrid wireless sensor network that consists of static and mobile sensors.



the authors in present a genetic algorithm that seeks a solution to the problem of coverage holes in the network. the proposed algorithm determines the minimum number and the best locations of the mobile nodes that must be added after the initial deployment of the fixed nodes. the performance of the proposed genetic algorithm was evaluated by using several indicators; the simulation results show that this algorithm optimizes network coverage in terms of the overall coverage ratio and the number of additional mobile nodes.



the percolation theory was developed to mathematically deal with the disordered media, in which the disorder is defined by a random variation in the degree of connectivity. the main concept of percolation theory is the existence of a percolation threshold, defined in the following way. suppose p is a parameter that defines the average degree of connectivity between various subunits of some arbitrary system. when p= 0, all sub-units are totally isolated from every other sub-unit. when p= 1, all sub-units are connected to some maximum number of neighboring subunits. at this point, the system is connected from one side to the other, since there are paths that go completely across the system, linking one sub-unit to the next along the spanning cluster. in the follow-



the main difference between the rate of the percolation of the target and the tracking accuracy is that percolation expresses probability value in relation to time, whereas the tracking accuracy is related to the tracking space. most of the tracking algorithms try to best express this metric, whereas the percolation metric is implemented for the first time in our algorithm. we are comparing our algorithm dc-aipt with two dynamic clustering schemes for the target tracking cited in section 2: chew is using, as the prediction method, the overhearing messages from the active clusters, the second solution dkf dc is using kalman filters to prevent the trajectory of the target.



we vary the density of the network at the same time as the speed of the target. we change the number of nodes from 100 to 1000 in steps of 100. for each network size, we change the target speed from 10 m/s to 900 m/s in steps of 100. we obtain the curve set to 200 s. the results presented in this section are corresponding to the mean value of the results obtained by simulation of several scenarios selected in a random manner. the proposed clustering algorithm has been designed with the aim of providing a solution which makes it possible to obtain a better rate of percolation independently of the distribution of the sensor nodes while having a better energy efficiency.



in this article, we have proposed a clustering algorithm for target tracking. our algorithm has built dynamic clusters on demand and for the first time it has included the concept of target percolation as a major criterion of performance. the main objective of our solution is to handle the trade-off between the percolation of the target, tracking precision and energy consumption.



as future work is concerned, we are planning to design a variant of the athvc algorithm to adapt to an environment with multiple targets. this type of monitoring is complex and involves additional steps, including identification to help differentiate and count targets. in addition, our new evaluation metric for target tracking algorithms called percolation should be, through further study, evaluate the recently proposed monitoring algorithms in consultation with the authors of these articles.
