which calcium influx facilitates muscle contraction. after this phase, a faster final repolarization brings the potential back to the resting state. due to the universal nature of these ap phases among species and regions, as shown in, it is possible to use them as a guide in the construction of ha models.



recently, modified ca models have been used to study cardiac excitability and for comparison with experimental data[8,9]. a body of literature provides clear links between the classical continuous pde representation and the more ad hoc ca-based approach as an alternative description of reaction-diffusion systems. the purely discrete nature of ca presents some difficulties in capturing subtle nonstepwise features of excitation.



in this section we provide a model, using snhioa, of a cardiac tissue behavior assuming for ease an isotropic arrangements of the cells: this means that the diffusion of electrical signal is uniform in all directions. in this model each single hybrid automaton represents the behavior of the ap of a single cell. a triangular lattice has been chosen to mimic the isotropic arrangements. input/output variables permit the exchange of values between automata. a distance-based weight function mediates this interaction.



furthermore models based on ha are amenable to formal analysis. symbolic reachability analysis is a well-established technique in the model checking of linear hybrid systems and are now supported by several tools such as d/dt and hytech. we are interested to extend these technique from linear to cycle linear hybrid automata. the study of spatial properties of hybrid automata networks is relative new. following this direction the work in performed automatic reachability analysis on a ha model for the delta-notch signaling network.
