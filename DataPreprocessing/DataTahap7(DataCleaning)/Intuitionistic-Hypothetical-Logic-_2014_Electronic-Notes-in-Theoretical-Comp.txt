remark 2.2 one may wonder whether, for the implicative fragment, the plus may be dispensed with while still maintaining realization of all s4 theorems. this is the case if, in the terminology of lp, so called non-injective specification sets and nonnormal realizations are allowed(see and also[5, sec.11.2]).



in the so called basic intuitionistic logic of proofs is developed. a modality of the form[u]]a is introduced, for u a proof variable, and a number of axioms over this modality, together with the axioms of ipc and mp, are shown to capture hatautologies. towards the end of op.cit. operations on proof terms are added and the resulting system is proved to be arithmetically complete in. developing a proof theory for the latter could be an interesting line of work.



further avenues are those related to the use of natural deduction presentations of fragments of first-order lp. although first-order lp is not finitely axiomatizable[23,8](although see), at the cost of losing the connection with peano arithmetic, the resulting type theory system could serve as the foundation for a logical framework with decidable forms of reflection. additionally, we are currently extending our results to full lp, based on classical logic.
