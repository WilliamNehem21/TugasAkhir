tms320vc5509a provides three high-speed, full duplex, multi-channel buffer serial portmcbsp, each serial interface can support 128 channels, at speeds of up to 100 mb/s. multi-channel buffer serial port(mcbsp) can provides a direct serial port in tms320vc5509a dsp or between dsp and other devices of system. it is feasible that dsp can directly connect with other c55xx dsp, codec of industrial standard port, and other serial(adc/dac) devices of system. different mcbsp of dsp number and the pin number is also different.



this paper designed a half-duplex and low power consuming underwater acoustic speech communication system based on ofdm technology. the theory and key technology of ofdm were analyzed. a low power consuming operational amplifier and converter of a/d and d/a were used in the design of the hardware. furthermore ambe-2000 was used to compress the origin speech coding and tms320vc5509a dsp was used to modulate and demodulate the speech signal. finally, the feasibility of the underwater acoustic speech communication system based of ofdm technology is proved through the test in the pool.
