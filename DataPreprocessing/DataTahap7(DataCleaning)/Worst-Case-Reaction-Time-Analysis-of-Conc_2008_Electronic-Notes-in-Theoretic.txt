reactive programs have to react continuously to their inputs. here the time needed to react with the according output is important. while the synchrony hypothesis takes the view that the program is infinitely fast, real computations take time. similar to the traditional worst case execution time(wcet), the worst case reaction time(wcrt) of a program determines the maximal time for one reaction.



in this paper, we present an algorithm to determine the wcrt of a program written in the synchronous language esterel. this value gives an upper bound for the execution time when the program is executed on a reactive processor. specifically, we consider the execution of the esterel program on the kiel esterel processor(kep), a reactive processor that can execute esterel-like instructions. here the wcrt directly determines an upper bound on the instruction cycles per logical tick. the wcrt also gives a guideline for the execution time when the esterel program is compiled to software by a simulation-based approach.



rectly support reactive control flow, such as preemption and concurrency. in this paper we will use the kep, a reactive processor based on the synchronous language esterel, to show that timing analysis is practical for reactive processors, hence making the reactive processing approach particularly well suited for hard real-time systems. there are two main factors that contribute to this, on the one hand the synchronous execution model of esterel, and on the other hand the direct implementation of this execution model on a reactive processor. furthermore, reactive processors are not designed to optimize(average) performance for general purpose computations, and hence do not have a hierarchy of caches, pipelines, branch predictors, etc. this leads to a simpler design and execution behavior and further facilitates wcet analysis.



cluding concurrency and preemption. the analysis computes the wcrt in terms of kep instruction cycles, which roughly match the number of executed esterel statements. as part of the wcrt analysis, we also present an approach to calculate potential instantaneous paths, which may be used in compiler analysis and optimizations that go beyond wcrt analysis.



representation of an esterel program, which we use for our analysis. section 4 explains our algorithm in detail, while section 5 gives experimental results, comparing the computed number of reactions with values obtained from exhaustive simulation. the paper concludes in section 6.



as mentioned in the introduction, there exist numerous approaches to classical wcet analysis. for a survey see, e. g., puschner and burns. these approaches usually consider(subsets) of general purpose languages, such as c, and take informations on the processor designs and caches into account.



is also important for schizophrenic esterel programs. this was addressed in detail by tardieu and de simone. they also point out that an exact analysis of instantaneous reachability has np complexity. we, however, are not only interested whether a statement can be instantaneous, but also whether it can be non-instantaneous.



code. however, they did not address concurrency, and their source-level approach could not consider compiler optimizations. we perform the analysis on an intermediate level after the compilation, as a last step before the generation of assembler code. this also allows a finer analysis and decreases the time needed for the analysis.



executed in the current logical tick. to minimize jitter, a maximum number of instructions for each logical tick can be specified. if the current tick needs less instructions, the start of the next tick is delayed. if the tick needs more instructions, an error-output is set. hence a tight, but conservative upper bound of the maximal instructions for one tick



next we give a short overview of esterel and the kep. while our analysis is implemented in the compiler from esterel to the kep assembler, it is also of interest for other execution forms of esterel. the analysis itself is performed on a graph representation of esterelprograms, the ckag.



esterel offers two types of preemption constructs. an abortion kills its body when an abortion trigger occurs. we distinguish strong abortion, which kills its body immediately(at the beginning of a tick), and weak abortion, which lets its body receive control for a last time(abortion at the end of the tick). a suspension freezes the state of a body in the instant when the trigger event occurs.



esterel also offers an exception handling mechanism via the trap/exit statements. an exception is declared with a trap scope, and is thrown(raised) with an exit statement. an exit t statement causes control flow to move to the end of the scope of the corresponding trap t declaration. this is similar to a goto statement, however, there are further rules when traps are nested or when the trap scope includes concurrent threads. if one thread raises an exception and the corresponding trap scope includes concurrent threads, then the concurrent threads are weakly aborted; if concurrent threads execute multiple exit instructions in the same tick, the outermost trap takes priority.



to implement concurrency, the kep employs a multi-threaded architecture, where each thread has an independent program counter(pc) and threads are scheduled according to their statuses and dynamically changing priorities. to begin of each instructioncycle, the enabled thread with the highest priority is selected and executed. the scheduler is very light-weight. in the kep, scheduling and context switching do not cost extra instruction cycles, only changing the priority of a thread costs an instruction. for each thread, a par instruction is executed, to initialize the program counter and the priority and to define the thread id. thereafter one pare instruction is executed, which denotes the end of the parallel scope. during each instant in which one parallel thread is active, also the join must be executed, in order to determine whether the threads have terminated.



the wcrt analysis is not directly performed on the esterel level, but on an intermediate data structure, the ckag. the ckag is a directed graph composed of various types of nodes and edges to match kep program behavior. it is used during compilation from esterel to kep assembler, for, e. g., dead code elimination, priority assigning, optimizations and the wcrt analysis.



the ckag is built from esterel source by traversing recursively over its abstract syntax tree(ast) generated by the columbia esterel compiler(cec). visiting an esterel statement results in creating the according ckag node. a node typically contains exactly one statement, except label nodes containing just address labels and fork nodes containing one par statement for each child thread initialization and a pare statement. when a delay node is created, additional preemption edges are added according to the abortion/exception context.



not executed at all when the abortion takes place. on the kep, when a strong abort takes place, the delay nodes where the control of the(still active) threads in the abortion body resides are executed once, and then control moves to the abortion handler. in other words, control cannot move from a delay node d to a(strong) abortion handler when control reaches d, but only when it starts in d. therefore, the wcrt of the handler of a strong abortion is added to d.next, and not to d.inst.



the predecessor of the join node must not be an exit, because exit nodes are no real control flow predecessors. at the esterel level, an exception(exit) causes control to jump directly to the corresponding exception handler(at the end of the corresponding trap scope); this jump may also cross thread boundaries, in which case the threads that are jumped out of and their sibling threads terminate. to emulate this at the kep level, an exit instruction does not jump directly to the exception handler, but first executes the join instructions on the way, to give them the opportunity to terminate threads correctly. if a join is executed this way, the statements that are instantaneously reachable from it are not executed, but control instead moves on to the exception handler, or to another intermediate join. to express this, we use the third property besides instantaneous and non-instantaneous: exit-instantaneous.



the whole algorithm computes first the next wcrt for all delay and join nodes; it computes recursively all needed inst values. thereafter the instantaneous wcrt for all remaining nodes is computed. the result is simply the maximum over all computed values. to take into account that execution might start simultaneously in different concurrent threads, we also have to consider the next value of join nodes, not only delay nodes.



a known difficulty when compiling esterel-programs is that due to nesting of exceptions and concurrency, statements might be executed multiple times in one instant. this problem, also known as reincarnation, is handled correctly by our algorithm. since we compute nested joins from inside to outside, the same statement may effect both the instantaneous and non-instantaneous wcrt, which are added up in the next join. this exactly matches the possible control-flow in case of reincarnation. even when a statement is executed multiple times in an instant, we compute a correct upper bound for the wcrt.



cases. however, there is still significant room for improvement. so far, we are not taking any signal status into account, therefore our analysis includes some unreachable paths. considering all signals would lead to an exponential growth of the complexity, but some local knowledge should be enough to rule out most unreachable paths of this kind. also a finer grained analysis of which parts of parallel threads can be executed in the same instant could lead to better results. however, it is not obvious how to do this efficiently.



our analysis is influenced by the kep in two ways: the exact number of instructions for each statement and the way parallelism is handled. at least for non-parallel programs our approach should be of value for other compilation methods for esterel as well, e. g., simulation-based code generation. a virtual machine with similar support for concurrency could also benefit from our approach. we would also like to generalize our approach to handle different ways to implement concurrency. a wcrt analysis directly on the esterel level gives information on the longest possible execution path. together with a known translation to c, this wcrt information could be combined with a traditional wcet analysis, which takes caches and other hardware details into account.
