besides these two general forms, we must consider two cases. for the base case let us consider each basic form. for form 1, take n= m= 0, and for form 2 take n= 0 and m= 1. hence, ntl collapses with tfl, in which case we just obtain closed complete trees in tfl. for the inductive case, take n= k and m= j. such a replacement yields a valid inference in ntl, since all the conditions of a valid inference in ntl are preserved. now, suppose that each form is also valid in ntl for n= k+ 1 and m= j+ 1 for k, j> 0, then the trees would look as follows:
