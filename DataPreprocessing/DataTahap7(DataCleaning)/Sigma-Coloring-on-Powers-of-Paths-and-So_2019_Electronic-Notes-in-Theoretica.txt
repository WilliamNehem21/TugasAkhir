when k is not large enough to fit the description of theorem 3.2, then an upper bound can be found, as proved on theorem 3.3. notice that the upper bound, if not tight, is at most one greater then the sigma chromatic number.



by the remark 2.5, vertices with different degrees have different color sum. thus, each vertex from the first and last k vertices of the graph(in the canonical order) have different color sum from their neighbors, since vertices with the same degree are not adjacent if the degree is less then 2k. it remains to prove that vertices with same degree have different color sums.
