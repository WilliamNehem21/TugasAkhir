in order to systematically master the typical shaped iced conductor's aerodynamic parameters characteristic, an in-depth theoretical analysis is carried out. making use of test in wind tunnel, the dynamics characteristics of iced conductor is researched with different iced thickness and wind speed. for the different conditions of iced conductor's aerodynamics research, the systematic analysis result of parameters characteristic is given.



the test is carrying out in the lower wind tunnel of 1.4x1.4m, it is open-type closed test section wind tunnel, and the test wind speed is 10m/s-65m/s. the force measuring device is three-component balance of fgc03a/fgc3b, the data acquisition system is pxi, and the data of attack angle, speed pressure is controlled by industrial control computer.
