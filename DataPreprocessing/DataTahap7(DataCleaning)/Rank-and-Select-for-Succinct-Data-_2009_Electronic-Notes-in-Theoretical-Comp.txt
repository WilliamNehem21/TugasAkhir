if with skip loop. we can replace the if sentence with a skip loop condition. experimental results show that this optimization improves the performance of the loop, when the number of occurrences of the selected byte c is not very high.



as expected, the more memory available to keep blocks the more efficient base(b) and base(sb) become. in practice, we used for base(b) and base(sb) as much additional memory as wt(sb) needs. however, results showing the effects of the amount of memory available to hold blocks on the efficiency of base(b) and base(sb) approaches are given at the end of section 6.



focusing on selectc(y) operation, wt(sb) put up again a good show(see table 6), obtaining practically the same results as in selectc(1). however, the base(sb) improves also its performance in all cases. it is also noticeable that base* becomes a much faster choice than wt* when selectc(y) is to be performed. in this scenario wt* works too inefficiently to be chosen as a useful alternative. as expected, the 256-bm technique is again the faster choice to obtain selectc(1) and selectc(y).



since each block contains 256 counters(4 bytes each), so each block wastes 1024 bytes. it is possible to easily modify the number of blocks used for base(b) technique. as expected, the more blocks are used the more efficient base(b) becomes.
