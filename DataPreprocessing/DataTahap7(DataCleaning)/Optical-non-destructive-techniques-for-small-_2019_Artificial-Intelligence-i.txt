small berries including strawberry and blueberry are extensively consumed fruits with great economic values due to their characteristic flavor and appearance as well as potential health benefits. this review elaborated the optical non-destructive techniques viz. vis-nir spectroscopy, computer vision system, hyperspectral imaging, multispectral imaging, laser-induced method and thermal imaging, and their applications for quality and safety control of small berry fruits. the discussion regarding the photoacoustic technique, x-ray technique, terahertz spectroscopy, odor imaging, micro-destructive testing and smart mobile terminal-based analyzer was also presented. furthermore, we proposed our personal understanding of the technical challenges and further trends for these optical non-destructive techniques:



small berry fruits including strawberry, blueberry, bayberry, mulberry, raspberry and gooseberry are widely consumed due to their characteristic flavor and appearance, and were proved to potentially inhibit the growth of cancer cells. applying non-destructive testing techniques to the quality and safety control of small berry fruits can provide the consistent and safe as well as nutritious products for consumers, thereby greatly increasing their economic values(opara and pathare, 2014). optical non-destructive approaches are based on the brief principle of analyzing the signals which have been interacted with the testing materials. over the last two decades, the optical non-destructive measurements for controlling quality and safety of food and agricultural products have attracted much scientific attention and industrial concerns.



the main disadvantage of the spectroscopic techniques is a lack of the spatial information(manley, 2014). although some investigators attempted to add spatial data by the use of spatially-resolved spectroscopy, it would not meet the increasing experimental demand for the nonhomogenous biological materials. unlike spectroscopic techniques, the computer vision can operate in the spatial dimension, hence allowing the detection of material external quality, especially for heterogeneous samples.



nique was significantly influenced by the inconsistent ambient illumination and complex background. in order to solve these problems, li et al.(2014) proposed a novel method based on the stepwise algorithm to identify the blueberry mature stages under natural outdoor lightings in the branch. the alternative solution for varying lighting was to use the flash light for the exposure compensation.



with respect to the other small berries, lu et al.(2011) successfully sorted the bayberries as the healthy and bruised categorizations using computer vision system. patel et al.(2013) evaluated the appearance quality such as color, shape and size of gooseberry for the purpose of promoting the export industry.



future research opportunities have been and are still being focused on multi-dimensional vision techniques. for example, uyar and erdogdu(2009) used 3-dimensional scanners to estimate the surface area and volume of irregular shaped fruits such as strawberry.



agudelo-laverde et al.(2013) exploited the computer vision technique to monitor the variations of color attributes. with the aid of ultraviolet light, yoshioka et al.(2013) captured the fluorescence images of strawberries to estimate fluorescent phenolic compound levels. this indicated that the addition of light source operating outside the visible spectral range might extend the application scope of computer vision system.



in terms of other laser-excited techniques, wulf et al.(2008) tested the potential usage of the laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy for quantifying the blueberry p-coumaroyl-glucose and cinnamoylglucose contents. li et al.(2011) estimated the blueberry firmness using a laser air-puff instrument with the correlation coefficient of



recently, in food and agricultural research, the photoacoustic approach has been used for determining nitrogen in rapeseed and quantifying pesticide residue in apple cuticle. in terms of small berries, popa et al.(2014) validated the hypothesis that the nonorganic raspberry and strawberry fruits released more ethylene gas than organic ones via the photoacoustic spectroscopy. since most of biological materials are turbid or opaque in nature, the photoacoustic spectroscopy or the imaging technique deserves a lot of attention in the further study.



x-ray technique is commonly applied to security inspection in airports and customs, and recently it has been extensively used in food and agricultural domain, including detecting fruit pest infestation, determining food density, inspecting the foreign bodies, charactering fruit internal structure(magwaza and



for small berry fruits, nielsen et al.(2014) differentiated frozen and defrosted blueberry and blackberry fruits from the x-ray images. in the further research, large data volumes in x-ray ct posed a challenge in image acquisition and processing. developments in the multimodal machine vision system containing computer vision, hyperspectral imaging and x-ray technique(wang and li, 2015) bring not only more useful information, but also the increasing redundant information.



according to our unpublished data, the thz reflectance spectroscopy was validated to be not applicable for blueberry quality evaluation because of the curved surface(data not shown). further researches are required to overcome some technical hurdles such as the attenuation by water and scattering by inhomogeneous media.
