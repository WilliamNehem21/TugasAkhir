one can gain valuable insights in concurrency theory by exploring the geometry of concurrent systems. this point of view has been promoted for some time, and it appears that it is gaining territory. in this paper, we are introducing a notion of directed homology for semicubical sets, which should hopefully have various applications as a strong invariant of higher-dimensional automata, systems of weakly synchronizing pv processes, and other related formalisms for concurrent systems.
