let i be the category whose objects are finite sets of atoms, and whose morphisms are injections. in what follows, we write i for the category of presheaves seti. let a be the presheaf in i given by a(a)= a.



we survey some rudiments of algebraic theories and lawvere theories in the enriched setting. the reader will find more detail and discussion, and more generality, in[14,22,26]; a reference for enriched categories is. in section 3.4, we consider the relevance of the theory to the categories f and a, considered above.



example 5.2 cartesian structure. for a simple first example, let c be any category with an initial object, and let m be the class of all isomorphisms in c. there is a compatibility structure in which all morphisms with common codomain are related. the induced structure on setc is the cartesian closed structure.
