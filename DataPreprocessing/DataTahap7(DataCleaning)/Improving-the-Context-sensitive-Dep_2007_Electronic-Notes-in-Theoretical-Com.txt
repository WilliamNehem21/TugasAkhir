the dependency pairs method is one of the most powerful technique for proving termination of rewriting and it is currently central in most automatic termination provers. recently, it has been adapted to be used in proofs of termination of context-sensitive rewriting. the use of collapsing dependency pairs i.e., having a single variable in the right-hand side is a novel and essential feature to obtain a correct framework in this setting. unfortunately, dependency pairs behave as a kind of glue in the context-sensitive dependency graph which makes the cycles bigger, thus making some proofs of termination harder. in this paper we show that this effect can be safely mitigated by removing some arcs from the graph, thus leading to faster and easier proofs. narrowing dependency pairs is also introduced and used here to eventually simplify the treatment of the context-sensitive dependency graph. we show the practicality of the new techniques with some benchmarks.



in this way. then, for a given trs, we obtain a restriction of rewriting which we call context-sensitive rewriting. proving termination of csr is an interesting problem with several applications in the fields of term rewriting and programming languages(see[5,6,8,11,13] for further motivation).



narrowing dependency pairs was also introduced by arts and giesl to improve the efficiency of the dependency pairs technique in proofs of termination. roughly speaking, under some conditions, a dependency pair can be replaced by a set of pairs which could simplify or restructure the dependency graph and eventually simplify the proof of termination. we also investigate this technique for dealing with the context-sensitive dependency graph.



after some preliminary definitions in section 2, section 3 introduces the notion of hidden symbol and investigates its properties in proofs of termination of csr. section 4 shows how to use it to improve the context-sensitive dependency graph. section 5 adapts narrowing of dependency pairs to context-sensitive dependency pairs. section 6 provides an experimental evaluation of our techniques. section 7 concludes.



we have introduced a simplification of the context-sensitive dependency graph by restricting the outcoming links of collapsing dependency pairs to dependency pairs headed by the so-called hidden symbols. hidden symbols are defined symbols that occur in non-replacing positions in the right-hand sides of some rule in the trs. this greatly improves the performance of termination proofs based on the dependency graph proposed in. narrowing context-sensitive dependency pairs has also been investigated. it can also be helpful to simplify or restructure the dependency graph and eventually simplify the proof of termination. regarding the practical use of the(refinements on the) new cs-dependency graph in proofs of termination of csr, we have implemented these ideas as part of the termination tool mu-term and we have obtained quite good results in terms of new examples which could be proved, and also regarding the time for achieving the proofs.
