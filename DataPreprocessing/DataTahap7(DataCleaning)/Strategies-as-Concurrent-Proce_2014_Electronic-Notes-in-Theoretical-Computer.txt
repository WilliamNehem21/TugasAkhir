as we shall see, we can derive the laws expected of a recursion operator provided the recursion involves a homorphism w.r.t. the duplication comonad, and this fact too we could hope to derive. some of the reasoning can be made diagrammatic, using the techniques of string diagrams.



it may seem odd that partial strategies are total maps. why have we not taken a partial strategy to be undefined on events which are sent to n? because such partial maps do not behave well under pullback, and this would complicate the definition of composition and spoil later results such as that the pullback of a partial strategy is a partial strategy. with our choice of definition we are able to localise neutral events to the games over which they occur; with the alternative definition, different forms of undefined would become conflated.
