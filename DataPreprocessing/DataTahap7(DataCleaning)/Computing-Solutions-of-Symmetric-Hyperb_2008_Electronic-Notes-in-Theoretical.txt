the rest of the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we recall some notation, notions and facts. in section 3 we prove the computability of the canonical form and of the set h. in section 4 we describe the difference scheme for(1) and some of its properties. in section 5 we prove the computability of the solution operator for(1). we conclude in section 6 with a short discussion of possible future work.



the difference scheme may be chosen in various ways. our scheme taken from is a little more complicated than the scheme used in but it has some useful feature mentioned in the introduction. we describe it in few stages.
