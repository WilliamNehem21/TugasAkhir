we consider degx(m) the degree of x in m as the number of free occurrences of x in m, for any term m in any of the calculi we introduce. we might represent distinct occurrences of x by x1,..., xk, especially when dealing with resource reductions.



from a resource point of view, which is ours, the first observation is that the terms above correspond to call-by-value ones. indeed, if we omit the terms with marked lambdas lxt, the syntax is the same, and the distinction is all contained in operational semantics. in particular, if we define taylor expansion of call-by-need following that presentation, we shall proceed exactly as we did for call-by-value. corollary 2.8 would apply immediately when the convenient notion of parallel reduction is defined. it is not hard to examine the dynamics and to conclude that bounds about size and depth can be established for this calculus.



the coherence relation we introduced allows to compare terms having the same shape. in particular, if two terms are coherent and are redexes, there is a way to have a pair of reductions leading to reducts also pairwise coherent, even if coherence is not preserved by reduction in general. this point is made explicit in the following lemma.



pursuing the investigation of the relations between taylor expansion and reduction strategies, ehrhard and guerrieri introduced a fine grain calculus that permits the embedding of call-by-name and call-by-value in it. guerrieri and manzonetto studied more recently the correspondence between these embeddings and the respective operational semantics of call-by-name and call-by-value. we briefly explain how our finiteness result applies in this particular setting.



we introduced the necessary definitions to study taylor expansion in various settings which demand respectively distinct proof methods. a possible extension of this work is to generalize these results in a common setting thanks to our work with vaux-auclair on linear logic-proof nets. indeed, there exist already wellknown embeddings of call-by-name and call-by-value into proof nets, and the results about taylor expansion become then a syntactic work, of presenting these translations and proving that they commute with taylor expansion(e.g. that taylor expansion of the proof net coming from a call-by-value translation corresponds to the translation of call-by-value taylor expansion of section 2.1). but a construction of proof nets corresponding to call-by-need, bang calculus and to pcf would be of great interest in that perspective.



c= c1[lxc2]u. by definition, c= c1[lxc2]u with ci ci and u u. by induction hypothesis, we have c2[t] c2[t]. we extend(by definition of) to lxc2[t] lxc2[t]. by induction hypothesis on c1, and because u u, we deduce c1[lxc2[t]]u c1[lxc2[t]]u.



if c= c1[lxc2]t j, then by definition of, if t t, t= stj with s c1[lxc2[u]] and tj t j. by induction hypothesis on c1, s= c1[lxw] with c1 c1 and w c2[u]. similarly, by induction hypothesis on c2, w= c2[u] with c2 c2 and u u.
