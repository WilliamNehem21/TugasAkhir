from x+ to y+ indicates that there is an execution from the positive x-axis through quad1 to the positive y-axis. every edge is labelled with a weight which indicates the maximum scaling. for instance, in the first quadrant, any execution starting on the positive x-axis at distance d from the origin will reach the positive y-axis at distance at most 2d from the origin. hence, the weight on the corresponding edge is 2.



state-space partition is the first step in the quantitative predicate abstraction. it takes a finite set of linear expressions and creates a finite partition of the state-space into regions. the nodes of the abstract graph will correspond to the facets of these regions.



averist has been implemented in python and uses several software packages. it uses parma polyhedra library(ppl) to represent the invariants and guards of the polyhedral switched system and to perform the polyhedral operations in the state-space partition. the gnu linear programming kit glpk solver is used for solving the optimization problems involved in the weight computation. the networkx python package is used to manage graphs and perform graph analysis in the model-checking phase. all these utilities are included in the free open-source mathematics software system sage.
