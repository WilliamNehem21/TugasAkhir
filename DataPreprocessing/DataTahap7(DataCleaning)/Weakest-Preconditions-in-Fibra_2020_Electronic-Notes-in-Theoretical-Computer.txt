of t; this is exhibited through the monoidal isomorphism between the category of algebras(of varying endofunctors) over the slicing object and the category of fibered functors between domain fibrations. this result simplifies the task of exploring cartesian liftings of monads along such fibrations. we also relate strongest postcondition predicate transformers as left adjoints to wppts, and discuss when they are available in domain fibrations.



computational effects are often modeled by composite monads via distributive laws. we extend the correspondence given in(ii) to cartesian liftings of composite monads and pairs of eilenberg-moore monotone algebras satisfying an extra coherence law given in[4,27]. this correspondence provides a modular method to compute cartesian liftings of composite monads.



these studies allow us to define liftings of monads(and therefore, wppts) from their algebras, as well as defining transformers for composite monads by composing individual algebras. we illustrate this by defining predicate transformers for monads in the literature: the maybe monad, the non-empty powerset monad, the counting monad, the distribution monad and the indexed distribution monad. then we show how to combine these to recover predicate transformers in the literature, such as the expected runtime transformer by kaminski et al. and the higher-order moment transformer by kura et al..
