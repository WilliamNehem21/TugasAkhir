in the manufacturing of biotechnology drug products, the viral safety control strategy is a critical pharmaceutical quality management framework that contains three key elements: prevention, testing, and clearance. the prevention strategy involves rigorous screening for any adventitious virus contamination in the raw materials, reagents, and endogenous/adventitious virus contamination in the cell banks. the main objects of the testing strategy are critical process intermediate, such as the end of production cell(eopc), limit of in vitro cell age(livca), and unprocessed bulk(upb). the clearance strategy often involves demonstrations of the effectiveness and robustness of a manufacturing process to inactivate or remove any endogenous/adventitious viruses through viral clearance(vc) validations.



ensuring the representativeness of the samples by careful selection, control, and comprehensive analysis is essential to the accuracy and reliability of validation experiment results yet easily neglected. two key factors greatly affect the representativeness of the sample, namely, the physicochemical characteristics of the active drug substance, such as the isoelectric point, glycosylation profile, and major impurity composition; and the process intermediate characteristics, such as the concentration of target protein, the buffer matrix, and the total titers of retrovirus-like particles(rvlps). process intermediate characterization studies may suffice to ensure representativeness only for processes with high robustness, including low-ph incubation and nanofiltration, but for processes that exhibit high inherent variability, such as chromatography, comprehensive comparability analyses of both factors should be carried out.



d the items that may need to be analyzed include the protein concentration, ph, and conductivity of the sample. for example, for anion exchange chromatography, higher ph, and conductivity are the worst-case conditions. however, for strong anion complex chromatography, ph has less influence, and conductivity has a wider operating range.



e the items that may need to be analyzed include the loading sample(protein concentration, ph, conductivity) and elution buffer(wash volume, wash buffer ph, conductivity, and temperature). for example, for hydrophobic chromatography, the worst-case condition is a higher protein concentration. for cation exchange(cex) chromatography, higher conductivity, and ph in the elution buffer are the worst-case conditions.



for example, in a nanofiltration process, the pressure that leads to virus leakage can be the upper pressure limit for virus filters of some suppliers or the lower pressure limit for filters of other suppliers; in addition, the possible impact of process interruption or pause should also be accounted for in a scientific experimental design. the ecs associated with viral safety for chromatography can be more intricate; for instance, for anion exchange(aex) chromatography, under flow-through mode, a higher conductivity tends to result in a lower log reduction value(lrv), whereas under binding-elution mode, the opposite is true. in addition, it is important to evaluate the relative residence time under different working modes, which is mainly dependent on the column height and sample flow rate.



ich q5a(r1) has provided sufficient guidance for the selection of model viruses based on both process characteristics and virus property considerations. recently, we have observed a change in the host cell substrate of an increasing number of sponsors for commercial reasons. given these situations, it is necessary to consider the potential risk of endogenous and exogenous viruses in host cells; for example, for sf-9 cells, it is recommended to use baculovirus as a model virus, while for cho cells, murine leukemia virus should be added.
