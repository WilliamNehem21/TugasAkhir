to improve the accuracy, the author thinks that the following aspects can be lucubrated: 1.take the average number of latitude as the projection latitude to reduce the errors in the conversion formulas. 2. take the average height as the set height, do not fix on a certain height value.3.use more sophisticated gps reciever.4.use the optimal algorithm, so as to improve the accuracy of conversion value and area value, which, however, is difficult to achieve for it is not so easy to come up with.



methods based on the gps land area measurement have developed for irregular measurement instruments. the experimental results show that the instrument is able to quickly and efficiently achieve the function of the land area of irregular measurement. and for some projects related to area, the instrument, whose prospect is inestimable, has special application value.
