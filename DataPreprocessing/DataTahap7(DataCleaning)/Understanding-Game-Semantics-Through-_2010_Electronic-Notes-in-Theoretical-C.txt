though this functor is faithful, it is far from being full, and it does not preserve a lot of the structure of the category of games, for instance the monoidal structure. in this work we seek to improve on this situation by successively refining the codomain category. this is related to work by hyland and schalk as discussed in further detail below.



we then refine coh by imposing an order relation, intended to mimic the prefix ordering on plays. we call this refined category p coh and show that it posesses a monoidal structure akin to that of the category of games. our main result is that the hyland-schalk functor lifts to a fully faithful strong monoidal embedding into a certain subcategory of p coh.
