in this paper we present some new results which go some way towards explaining this phenomenon. our results show that a large class of realizability-style constructions always give rise to c, rc or heo(as appropriate). the proofs make essential use of a technique due to dag normann. in this extended abstract, we content ourselves with giving precise statements of our theorems, and a brief outline of the method of proof.



we will also need the notion of a realization of a type structure over a pca. this is an obvious adaptation of definition 4.1; indeed, in the more general framework of applicative morphisms, we can make do with a single notion of realization.
