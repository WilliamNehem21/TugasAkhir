circular-arc graphs form a superclass of interval graphs. an important difference between these two classes is that interval graphs have a linear number of maximal cliques(in the number of vertices), while circular-arc graphs may have an exponential number of maximal cliques. this may suggest why some problems are more difficult for circular-arc graphs than for interval graphs. for instance, vertex-coloring is polynomial for interval graphs, but np-hard for circular-arc graphs.



observe the necessity of including(ii) in definition 2.2, otherwise the pullbacks f1,..., ft could define non-compatible edge-colorings(that is, color conflicts could be created when assembling all edge-colorings in order to construct the edge-coloring of g). also in the definition, observe that disjointness is assumed only among the sets of the partition{e1,..., et}, but not among the domains of the functions in f, which are sets of vertices, not edges. this means that a single vertex u can be proves(ii)). if only one set i from{yab, yac, ybc} has vertices of maximum degree in g, then surely i/=ybc, because of the assumption on the cardinality of xa. if i= yab, then the semi-core of g is an indifference graph, because the order yb, ybc, yab, yac, ya is an indifference order 7. the case i= yac follows
