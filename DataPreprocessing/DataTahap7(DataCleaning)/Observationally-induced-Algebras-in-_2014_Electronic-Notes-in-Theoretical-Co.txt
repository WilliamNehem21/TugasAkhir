we investigate the observationally-induced free algebra approach for constructing computational monads in the categories of classical domain theory. our investigation yields that the free algebra construction exists for all finitary algebraic signatures and computational prototypes. we furthermore investigate the classical powerdomain constructions in the observationally-induced approach. for the hoare, smyth and probabilistic powerdomain constructions we build on established results, showing that they can be recovered observationally-induced. however, the plotkin powerdomain turns out to be more problematic. here we show that with the obvious prototype algebra, heckmanns algebra a, one does not get the classical plotkin powerdomain.



we now examine in how far the classical powerdomain constructions can be recovered by the observationally-induced approach. we start with the hoare, smyth and(extended) probabilistic powerdomains. the results for the hoare and smyth powerdomains have been worked out in a topological setting in[3,4]. the proof strategy is the same in the cases at hand, so we omit the proofs, as the reader should have no problems filling in the details by consulting loc. cit.. in the case of the extended probabilistic powerdomain, the needed technicalities follow essentially from the work of tix, so we give brief hints for the proofs in this case.
