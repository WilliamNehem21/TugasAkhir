the remainder of the text is organized as follows. section 2 contains some preliminary definitions. section 3 sketches the basics of rewriting with non-symmetric transitive relations and quasiorderings. section 4 specifies a ground knuth-bendix completion procedure for transitive relations and proves its correctness. section 5 further discusses the procedure. section 6 extends the procedure to quasiorderings. section 7 discusses its lifting to the nonground case. section 8 sketches a simple application. section 9 contains a conclusion.



refinements of rewrite rules do not decrease the proof measure, they can also destroy termination of the completion process. however they preserve correctness, since this property only depends on the elimination of critical pairs. in a completion process consisting only of critical pair computations there are more critical pairs without than with refinements.



when< is a quasiordering, the procedure of non-symmetric ground completion must be adapted, since in presence of reflexivity, the diagonal need not explicitly be considered. also the theory of rewriting is slightly different, as section 3 shows. here, we only point out some differences to completion with a non-symmetric transitive relation. see for a more formal treatment.



section 3 shows that the lifting of the ground completion procedures to the non-ground case has a severe obstacle. second-order context variables have been introduced to represent the variable critical pairs that arise for non-linear variables. there are three cases of interest. first the non-compatible case(no function is monotonic), second the linear case and third the general case.
