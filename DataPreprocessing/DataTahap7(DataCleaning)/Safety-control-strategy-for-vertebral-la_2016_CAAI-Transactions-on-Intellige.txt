advances in science and technology have led to the use of various robots in the field of medical application. in recent years, surgical robots have been widely applied in different types of orthopedic surgery, such as laminectomy, total knee arthroplasty, artificial disc replacement[1e3], etc. spinal surgery is believed to be high-risk since any damage to the spinal cord may cause paralysis or even death to the patients. traditionally, the spinal surgery is performed manually, and the long duration time will cause surgeons' fatigue, reducing the surgery quality.



laminectomy has been widely used to treat patients with lumbar spinal stenosis[7,8], to release the oppressed spinal nerve and recover the function of spinal cord. the key to the success of laminectomy is to ensure the proper amount of lamina remained. too small amount of residual volume may cause harm to the spinal canal and spinal nerve, and too large amount cannot achieve the effect of spinal nerve decompression.



has developed a spinal surgical robot and successfully recognized the different states during the pedicle screw insertion process with a real-time force sensing algorithm. for the vertebral lamina milling task, some safety control strategies have been studied. wang et al.[14,15] milled the vertebral layer by layer from the outer cortical bone to the inner cortical bone at a constant depth. based on the analysis of typical characteristic parameters of the force profiles, the crosscorrelation to the standard profiles are adopted to judge the milling status. because this method was unable to adapt to the complex surfaces of the vertebrae, the profile pattern is in close relation to the three-layer structure, which is to the disadvantage of milling status distinguishment. zhang et al.



in this paper, we firstly describe the anatomical structure of the vertebral lamina and the milling procedure. then, the fuzzy force control theory is introduced. the milling force in the horizontal direction is controlled constant, and the milling force in the vertical direction is used to distinguish the structure of the bone layer. the principle of milling state distinguishment is established through six groups of vertebral



in order to show the advantages of fuzzy force control strategy, two groups of experiments have been conducted on the same bone sample, which is a vertebra bone of pig with thickness of 57 mm. the rotating speed of the bone drill is set to be 15000 r/ min. in the first experiment, the milling depth remains constant; the bone drill mills down 0.5 mm layer by layer, until the inner cortical bone. in the second experiment, the milling depth is adjusted with the tangential milling force based on fuzzy control strategy, keeping the tangential force a constant value.



to ensure the safety of milling operation, the bone drill needs to stop when it gets to the inner cortical bone. to obtain the relationship between the axial force and the state recognition, the experiment below has been conducted. three kinds of bone samples including vertebra of pig, vertebra of sheep and vertebra of cattle are used in the experiment, with bone drill rotating speed of 15000 r/min and 20000 r/min separately. the initial milling depth is set to be 0.5 mm, and the tangential force during the milling operation is controlled to be constant with the fuzzy logic. the mean value of the axial force is



when the average milling force of the i-th layer is less than fo/2, s= 2. bone drill is located in the cancellous bone, the milling operation continues. when the milling force is larger than 0.9*fo, s= 3. the bone drill is located in the inner cortical bone, the milling operation stops immediately.
