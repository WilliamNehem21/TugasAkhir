section 2 of this paper is devoted to a recapitulation of ncpi syntax and semantics. the main contribution is section 3 where, in order to demonstrate the expressive power of our language, we present a ncpi model of the p2p architecture pastry. this model has been devised in the context of the fp7 autonomic service-component ensembles(ascens) project, where the routing functionalities of pastry are employed in a cloud-computing case study. details can be found in[18, chapter 6].
