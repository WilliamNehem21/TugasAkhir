a few scientific investigations have been carried out on it. adesegun et al. in their in vitro study credited substantial antioxidant properties to the stem bark extract of the plant. cytotoxicity screening of selected nigerian plants used in traditional cancer treatment on ht29(colon cancer) and mcf-7(breast cancer) cell lines(hela cervix adenocarcinoma cells) indicated that s. ellipticum leaf extract expressed the highest cytotoxic activity among other plants with anticancer potential which was comparable to the reference drug, cisplatin. the phythochemical constituents, in vitro antioxidant capacities and antiplasmodial activities of s. ellipticum stem bark extracts were documented by nana et al.. this present study sought to investigate the effects of the. 2 mg of se sample was mixed with 100 mg potassium bromide(kbr)|(ft-ir grade) and then compressed to prepare a translucent sample disc(3 mm diameter). the disc was immediately kept in the sample holder. the sample was scanned and the ft-ir spectra were recorded in the absorption range between 1000 and 3500 nm. ft-ir analysis was performed using perkin elmer spectrophotometer system, which was used to detect the characteristic peaks, types of chemical bonds and probable functional groups present in se sample. the peak values of the ft-ir were recorded and the analysis was repeated twice for the spectrum confirmation.
