there are methods which try to solve the problem by using extra detection hardware for each switching element as described in and. these are cheap compared to fast current measurement devices and fast a/d converters, but can detect the momentary current direction when a switch-over is initiated. this detection might be problematic for current waveforms having multiple zero crossings within one switching period.



the maximal current ripple can be calculated from closed formulae, as described in. an attempt was made to use a new algorithm capable of calculating the actual current ripple for dead time compensation, in. this way continuous currents could be handled, even if only slow current measurement is available.
