them experience the feeling of being immersed. vr has applications in several disciplines, including the arts and humanities(hutson& olsen, 2021), marketing(anderson& laverie, 2022), science, technology, engineering, and mathematics(stem)(barbara et al.,



cation and research into its benefits are fast becoming popular. in addition, vr is being used to explore novel approaches to delivering instructional content in conjunction with conventional teaching approaches. according to zhang(2017), vr is effective for training learners in areas where access to real-world scenarios is expensive, difficult or impossible to reach. for instance, it might be challenging to schedule learners to go underwater to see how submarines work(raja& lakshmi, 2022), just as it will be expensive and time-consuming to schedule routine visits of biology students to surgical rooms to view live human internal organs and how they



certain features of vr can provide experiential elements in the learning process, and such features include its capacity to create interactive learning environments, hands-on learning, visual learning, head mounted display(hmd) devices, and the ease and flexibility of using vr make learning using the technology a memorable one. vr, therefore, becomes relevant in learning environments that can potentially cause injuries or harm to learners and also helps reduce training costs. given these, vr in education is a tool for providing real-world education prototypes(mandal, 2013).



probable way of determining this, according to fishbein and ajzen(1975), is to find out if an individual intends to perform a particular task because the intention to perform a task is assumed to be the immediate precursor to performing such a task(bagozzi, 1983). this study conceptualizes bi as a measure of the likelihood of trainee teachers to use vr in education. nursiah(2018) reported that the intention to perform a behaviour is a good predictor for determining the actual use(actual technology usage), and therefore, the bi to use technology is a behavioural tendency of individuals to continue to use the technology.



nigeria. this is especially important in an era in which smart technologies continue to penetrate every sphere of human living, creating a world in which it seems that humans can no longer do without technologies in their daily lives. hence, pre-service teachers needed to align with emerging technologies to prepare for their in-service profession. it is therefore believed that our findings may be useful to stakeholders and policymakers in education for designing and implementing modern curricula for teacher education programmes, as well as providing vr-supporting teaching and learning environments in sore eyes), according to shibata et al.(2011). the cave(cave automatic virtual environment), which is a projection-based vr system, isolates users from their immediate surroundings and centres their entire audio-visual awareness in the virtual environment(sherman& craig, 2002). in the cave, vre that may be shared by multiple users at once is created via this projection or holographic display, which projects holograms onto surfaces.



[problem-solvers] who can provide solutions to the foreseen challenges of the emerging future. in addition, vr-based education provides learners with the opportunity to experience virtual problems during their use of the technology for learning(kim& im, 2022). it is possible to develop instructions for students of varying ages and levels which they can use for private study during the temporary absence of the teacher.



theoretical models, various researchers have undertaken systematic literature reviews on them and suggested comprehensive analysis and evaluation of their applications, effectiveness and limitations. in this paper, the technology acceptance model(tam) underpins our study. the tam



real-world prototype of a learning environment in areas that can potentially cause injuries or harm to learners, and also reduce costs of training, make the use of vr in education vital due to these capabilities(alhalabi, 2019; mandal, 2013). while more studies are needed on vr for social good and factors that influence its adoption among teachers(alfalah, 2018), previous studies have reported factors such as behavioural beliefs, normative beliefs and control beliefs as likely to have either positive or negative influence on intention to either adopt or use vr in education(mazman, 2019; kennedy-clark, 2011). according to fishbein and ajzen(2011), chances are high that people will use technology if the use of technology promotes social good. concerning this, we proposed that:



(2020), individuals have diverse behavioural beliefs which invariably contribute to linking behaviour with the expected outcome. these beliefs, according to zhang et al.(2013), have a direct influence on the process of technology adoption within individuals. islam et al.(2013) confirmed and supported the existence of this positive relationship. also, there is a growing body of studies suggesting that there is a strong



the study participants comprised 231 undergraduate pre-service teachers who major in educational technology at a public university of education in nigeria. this sample is made up of trainee teachers in their second, third and fourth years of the teacher education programme, and have received not less than two years of several training in technology integration in education. the pre-service teachers comprised 124(53.7%) 400-level undergraduates(year 4), 54(23.4%) 300-level for other constructs in the second sectionperceived usefulness(pu), technology anxiety(ta), technology for social good(tsg), technology readiness(tr), attitude towards technology(att), and behavioural intention(bi) were adapted from ayanwale et al.(2022). the items were conscientiously adapted to suit the context of this study. perceived usefulness(pu)(r= 0.85), technology anxiety(ta)(r= 0.70), technology for social good(tsg)(r= 0.75), and attitude towards technology(att)(r= 0.89) have 4 items each, while technology readiness(tr)(r

summarily, from the responses of the participants, and from the critical analysis conducted on the responses that we collected to examine the perception of vr, we infer that a majority of the respondents have some level of understanding of vr. their responses were different from each other in terms of the way it was stated, however, they are related and share similar semantic features. therefore, it can be concluded that many of the participants have a good grasp of what vr is. we concluded responses generated led to the conclusion that the participants have a good grasp of vr. however, these responses are most likely to be based on an abstract but not a practical experience of vr. the responses generated concerning how vr could be accessed were few, most of which were speculative in nature and not really from a concrete idea of how vr can be assessed.



tional tool that can enhance their competence and instructional delivery as they become certified teachers, they are very likely to be interested in its use. this line of thought is deeply rooted in and can be justified using the theory of reasoned action(tra)(fishbein& ajzen, 1975) and the technology acceptance model(tam) which underpins this study. previous studies on

the importance of technology perception in determining behavioural intention. several factors might have contributed to this result. one possible explanation is the novelty and unfamiliarity of vr technology. the participants in this study may not have had sufficient exposure or training in vr, leading to difficulties in accurately perceiving the tech-

useful, easy to use, and compatible with teaching practices, may have both practical and methodological implications leading to more positive attitudes among future teachers towards employing vr in the classroom. similar to the findings of other studies, we found that there is a strong predictive
