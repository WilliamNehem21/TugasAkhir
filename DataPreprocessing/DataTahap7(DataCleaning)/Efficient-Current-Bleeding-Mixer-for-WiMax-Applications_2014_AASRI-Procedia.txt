the ever-increasing demand for secured high-speed high-data rates communication links, preferably accessible through laptops and smartphones via wireless connections, is making the worldwide interoperability for microwave access, or wimax, one of the most promising technologies to explore. furthermore, wimax systems can cover long distance areas with fewer base stations compared to other wireless technologies, thus involving lower costs in maintenance, operation, and management(j. malleket al.,



therefore, a current bleeding block(r1 and r2) was added to m1 and m2 to enhance the conversion gain by increasing the current in the rf stage. this current should be enough to operate m1 and m2 in the saturation region while reducing the current in the lo stage; therefore, the voltage is dropped in the load resistors r6 and r7..
