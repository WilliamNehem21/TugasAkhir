a new scattering-transmission method on measuring soot concentration based on the scattering integration method and the extinction theory of soot concentration is presented in this paper. compared with extinction method, it need not know the soot average diameter in the dust flow in advance. the soot concentration measurement instrument is developed and the experiment is carried out.



the laser 1 is located on the focus of the collimator lenses 2 and the laser beam is changed into the parallel light. the parallel light beam is divided into two beams through the splitter prism 5. the reflection light is focusing on the photodiode 3 opt101 through the focus lens 4. the optical signal is converted into the current signal i0 as the original light intensity. the transmission beam is across the soot space 6. the the photodiode. the measurement signal i2 of the photodiode is included the transmission light and the small angle scattering light. the difference of the photocell light signal i1 and the photodiode signal i2 is a certain angles of scattering light intensity signal.
