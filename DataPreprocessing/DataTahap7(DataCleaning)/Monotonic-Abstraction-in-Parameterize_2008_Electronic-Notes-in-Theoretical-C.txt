since its first application to lossy channel systems, the method has been used for the design of verification algorithms for a wide range of models such as petri nets, timed petri nets, broadcast protocols, cache coherence protocols, etc.(see, e.g.,[8,10,11,12]).



which manipulate upward closed sets can be translated into operations which manipulate words. in this manner we avoid using heavy machinery, such as regular languages, when performing reachability analysis. this makes our approach much more efficient in practice compared to automata-based methods such as regular model checking[14,7,9].



in this section, we define an abstraction that generates an over-approximation of the transition system. the abstract transition system is monotonic, thus allowing to work with upward closed sets. in fact, we first show that local and existential transitions are monotonic, and hence need not be approximated. therefore, we only provide an over-approximation for universal transitions.



in a broadcast transition, an arbitrary number of processes change states simultaneously. the broadcast is initiated by a process, called the initiator. together with the initiator, an arbitrary number of processes change state simultaneously. in binary communication two processes perform a rendez-vous changing states simultaneously.
