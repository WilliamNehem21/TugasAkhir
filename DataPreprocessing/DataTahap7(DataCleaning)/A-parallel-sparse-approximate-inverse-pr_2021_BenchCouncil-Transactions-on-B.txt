in this study, we present an efficient parallel sparse approximate inverse(spai) preconditioning algorithm based on mpi and cuda, called hybridspai. for hybridspai, it optimizes a latest static spai preconditioning algorithm, and is extended from one gpu to multiple gpus in order to process large-scale matrices. we make the following significant contributions:(1) a general parallel framework for optimizing the static spai preconditioner based on mpi and cuda is presented, and(2) for each component of the preconditioner, a decision tree is established to choose the optimal kernel of computing it. experimental results show that hybridspai is effective, and outperforms the popular preconditioning algorithms in two public libraries, and a latest parallel spai preconditioning algorithm.



is assigned to find one subset of j and i, which making many subsets of j and i can be simultaneously obtained. furthermore, parallelism is also exploited inside each thread group. for the kernel that finds j, the threads inside each warp(thread group) read one column of m in parallel, and store them to shared memory using atomic operation. for the kernel that finds i, a decision tree is established and for any



we present an efficient parallel sparse approximate inverse preconditioning algorithm on multi-gpus in this paper, which is based mpi and cuda, called hybridspai. in our proposed hybridspai, a general parallel framework is embraced for optimizing the static spai on multigpus, and a decision tree is established to choose the optimal kernel for computing it. the experimental results demonstrate a noticeable performance and high effectiveness of our proposed hybridspai.
