the decidability of the reachability problem in petri nets without inhibitor arcs is proved in and later in and. on the other hand, the reachability problem is undecidable for petri nets with two inhibitor arcs which follows from. an open problem in was the reachability problem for petri nets with one inhibitor arc.



the idea of the algorithm is to reduce t if one of the conditions is not fulfilled. for condition 2, presburger arithmetics is used to transfer the implicit quantitative restriction by the witness places to the explicit restriction of the transitions. condition 3 ensures that all quantitative controls are unlimited. condition 4 ensures that all places are unlimited. a covering graph construction deciding condition 4 uses the algorithm recursively(like for condition 1) for every step. here, the current marking of a node is being included as a restriction to the semilinear set. limited places are deleted at the cost of a larger structure. this larger structure, however, contains parts which are generated by restricting parts. this restriction might cause them to loose the property 7 reached by a previous recursive step. however, as we will see because of their smaller size, the property 7 can be established again and the whole algorithm will still terminate.
