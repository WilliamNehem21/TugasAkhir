in contrast to measurement in classical mechanics, which gives the value of a given observable with an associated error, measurements in quantum mechanics have an intrinsically probabilistic character. that is, a quantum measurement can give, a priori, a certain number of results, each one with some finite probability. moreover, the state of the system after the measurement is changed in an irreversible manner by the act of measurement. this unintuitive behaviour is of acute importance in quantum information processing.



secondly, understanding measurement is essential to avoid misinterpreting quantum computation as a whole(e.g. why quantum computation does not lead straightforwardly to an exponential jump in complexity). this work takes the view that in order to understand the possibilities and limitations of quantum computation, measurement needs be formalised in an elegant manner. note that the projective measurement discussed in this paper is not the only possibility for a quantum measurement, but it is one of the simplest. in addition, any quantum measurement can be reproduced by the action of a unitary mapping and a projective measurement.
