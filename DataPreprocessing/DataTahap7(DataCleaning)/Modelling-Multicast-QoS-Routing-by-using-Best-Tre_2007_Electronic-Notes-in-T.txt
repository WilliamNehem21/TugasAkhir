we suggest a formal model to represent and solve the multicast routing problem in multicast networks. to attain this, we model the network adapting it to a weighted and-or graph, where the weight on a connector corresponds to the cost of sending a packet on the network link modelled by that connector. then, we use the soft constraint logic programming(sclp) framework as a convenient declarative programming environment in which to specify related problems. in particular, we show how the semantics of an sclp program computes the best tree in the corresponding and-or graph: this result can be adopted to find, from a given source node, the multicast distribution tree having minimum cost and reaching all the destination nodes of the multicast communication. the costs on the connectors can be described also as vectors(multidimensional costs), each component representing a different quality of service metric value. therefore, the construction of the best tree may involve a set of criteria, all of which are to be optimized(multi-criteria problem), e.g. maximum global bandwidth and minimum delay that can be experienced on a single link.



the work presented and suggested in this paper extends some results on shortest path problems presented in and. in these two works, the main idea concerned the use of non-linear clauses in sclp, that is, clauses which have more than one atom in their body. in this paper, we use instead clauses closer to logic programming, and we represent trees instead of paths. related formal approaches dealing with qos, e.g. and, adopt a hypergraph model in joint with semirings too, but the minimal path between two nodes(thus, not over an entire tree) is computed via a graphical calculous instead of sclp.



in this paper we concentrate on the third paradigm, since our intention is to provide a solution to the problem of transmitting a data packet from one source to k receivers. in its simplest implementation, multicast can be provided using multiple unicast transmissions, but with this solution, the same packet can traverse the same link multiple times. for this reason, the network must provide this service natively.



multicast problem has been studied with several algorithms and variants, such as shortest-path tree(spt), minimum spanning tree(mst), steiner tree(st), constrained steiner tree(cst), and other miscellaneous trees. algorithms based on spt(e.g. dijkstra or bellman-ford) aim to minimize the sum of the weights on the links from the source to each receiver, and if all the link cost one unit, the resulting tree is the least-hop one. the mst(e.g. prim algorithm) spans all the receivers in the multicast group, minimizing the total weight of the tree at the same time; at each step, the tree is augmented with an edge that contributes the minimum amount possible to the total cost of the tree, so the algorithm is greedy. a st is a tree which spans a given subset of vertices in the graph with the minimal total distance on its edges. if the subset matches the entire multicast group, st problem reduces to the mst problem. st has been extended to cst, including side constraints concerning qos metrics. st and cst are np-complete problems, and many heuristics have been proposed to efficiently deal with them[22,23].



multicast qos routing is generally more complex than unicast qos routing, and for this reason less proposals have been elaborated in this area. with respect to unicast, the additional complexity stems from the need to support shared and heterogeneous reservation styles(towards distinct group members) and global admission control of the distribution flow. some of the approaches use a steiner tree formulation or extend existing algorithm to optimize the delay(mospf is the multicast version of the classical ospf), while the delay variation multicast algorithm(dvma) computes a multicast tree with both bounded delay and bounded jitter. also, delay-bounded and cost-optimized multicast routing can be formulated as a steiner tree: an example approach is qos-aware multicast routing protocol(qmrp). other multicast qos routing algorithms and related problems(entailing stability, robustness and scalability) are presented in, and we did not include them here for lack of space.



an and-tree is a special case of an and-or graph, where every node appears exactly twice in the set of connectors c, once as an input node of some connector, and once as an output node of some other connector. the only exception is a node called root which appears only once, as an input node of some connector. the leaves of an and-tree are those nodes which are input nodes of a 0-connector. an example



clearly, the problem of finding best distribution tree is multi-criteria, since both bandwidth and delay must be optimized. we consider the criteria as independent among them, otherwise they can be rephrased to a single criteria. thus, the multidimensional costs of the connectors are not elements of a totally ordered set, and it may be possible to obtain several trees, all of which are not dominated by others, but which have different incomparable costs.
