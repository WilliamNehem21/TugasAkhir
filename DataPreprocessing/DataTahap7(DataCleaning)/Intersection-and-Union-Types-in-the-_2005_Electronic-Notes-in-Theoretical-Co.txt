barbanera et al. added union types to intersection type systems. this work was motivated by the observation that union types arise naturally in denotational semantics and that they can generate more informative types for some terms. however one cannot type with union types more terms than with intersection types only. that is, the system with intersection and union types exactly characterize all strongly normalizing terms as well.



a key point is that, since introducing an intersection on the left or the right is not a logical inference, these type inferences are completely orthogonal to the notion of the stoup, i.e. of the active formula. this means that to write down



this is a perfectly sensible typing system. but as barbanera et al. have noted, union types are technically difficult, for example subject reduction tends to fail. and indeed the system above leads to difficulties in subject reduction(more specifically, it seems difficult to prove the substitution lemma).
