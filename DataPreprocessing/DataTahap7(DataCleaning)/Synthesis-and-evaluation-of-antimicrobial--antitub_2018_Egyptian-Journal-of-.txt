1.82 mg/kg to 3.23 mg/kg body weight of the mice. a dose of 1.34 mg/kg was found to be safe for each of the compounds. all compounds inhibited the mycobacterial enzymes but to a lesser extent than streptomycin sulphate used as positive control. compound 19, exhibiting inhibition of 67.56%, 53.45%, and 47.56% against isocitrate lyase, pantothenate synthetase and chorismate mutase, respectively is the most potent antitubercular compound among the synthesized benzimidazole derivatives. further, compound



in 1 ml volumes. 39 ml ps diluted in buffer was added to initiate the reaction. the final concentrations in the reaction contained 0.4 mm nadh, 5 mm pantoic acid, 10 mm mgcl2, 5 mm b-alanine, 10 mm atp, 1 mm potassium phosphoenolpyruvate, and 18 units/ml each



buffer(ph 7.8), 1% dmso, and 5 mg/ml ps in a final volume of 100 ml. the test plate was immediately transferred to a microplate reader and absorbance was measured at 340 nm after every 12 s for 120 s. each plate had 16 control wells in the two outside columns, of which 12 contained the complete reaction mixture with a dmso carrier control(full reaction) and four without ps. the following formula was used to calculate percent inhibition% inhibi



aminoxanthene dye, sulforhodamine-b, in acetic acid for 15 min. the cultures were washed with 1% acetic acid to get rid of excess stain and attached stain was recovered with tris base solution. the colour intensity was measured using spectrophotometer. the asay was done in atleast triplicates.
