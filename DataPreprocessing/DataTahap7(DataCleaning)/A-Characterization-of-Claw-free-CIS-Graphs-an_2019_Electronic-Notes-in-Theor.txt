theorem 2.3 let h be a graph without isolated vertices and let g= l(h). then g is cis if and only if h has no subgraph isomorphic to a bull and every maximal matching in h is absorbing.



in this section we develop a structural characterization of claw-free cis graphs. we start with several lemmas giving necessary conditions for a claw-free graph to be a cis graph. the gem is the graph obtained from the 4-vertex path p4 by adding to it a universal vertex.



kloks et al. showed in that the class of{claw, gem, w4}-free graphs is exactly the class of dominoes, that is, graphs in which each vertex is contained in at most two maximal cliques. furthermore, the dominoes are precisely the line graphs of triangle-free multigraphs; see also. this result together with lemmas 4.1 and 4.2 implies the following.



in order to show that question 1 has a positive answer for claw-free cis graphs, we first show a property of weighted randomly internally matchable graphs, which follows easily from the characterization of randomly internally matchable graphs given by theorem 3.3. for this we need some definitions.
