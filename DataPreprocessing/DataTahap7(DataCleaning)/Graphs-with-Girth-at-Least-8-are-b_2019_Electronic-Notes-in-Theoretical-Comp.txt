one by cleaning color c. in a coloring such that we cannot apply this procedure, all color classes have at least one b-vertex. such a coloring is called a b-coloring of g. observe that an optimal coloring cannot have the number of colors decreased by the described algorithm; therefore every optimal coloring is also a b-coloring. in, the authors define the b-chromatic number of g, denoted by b(g), as the largest natural k for which g has a b-coloring with k colors. in the same article, the authors demonstrated that the problem of finding b(g) is np-complete in general.



because of these results, it makes sense to investigate the b-continuity of graphs with large girth. indeed, in the authors prove that regular graphs with girth at least 6 and without cycles of length 7 are b-continuous, and in, they prove that every graph with girth at least 10 are b-continuous. here, we improve their result to graphs with girth at least 8.



theorem 1.2 is expected to have a non-constructive part. in the next section, we present the basic definitions and results, in section 3 we present our proofs, and in section 4, we make some further comments on the proof and state some open questions.
