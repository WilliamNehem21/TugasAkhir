we extend the notion of substitution with exceptions to solution pairs that consist of a freshness context and a substitution, with exceptions(definition 3.5). in addition, a version of the consistency test algorithm(algorithm 1) to deal with pairs with exceptions is proposed.



as a generalized notion of instantiation and proves some results on the consistency of pairs with exceptions. section 4 shows how to solve nominal constraint problems by reusing the nominal unification algorithm. section 5 describes related work and section 6 concludes the paper.



we will work on this type of issues in the remaining of this paper. first, we define precisely what we mean by a solution of nominal constraint problems. keep in mind that our goal is the development of a nominal generalization for the already established notion of instantiation of solutions(definition 2.8), but this needs to be done in such a way that instantiation closure still holds.
