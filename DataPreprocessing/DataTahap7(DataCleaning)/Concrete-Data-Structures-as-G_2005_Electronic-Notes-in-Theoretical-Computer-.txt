remark. there is a one-to-one correspondence between plays of fr and runs of r, whereas in the filiform case for tr it is between plays and restricted runs. clearly in general, there are more strategies on fr than there are states on r.



we calculate its restriction to all three components to obtain three plays r, r' and r'' of fr, where r is an interleaving of r' and r'', plus or minus one extra move at the end. if there is an extra move in r we copy it as our answer to t, else there is an extra move to one of r' or r'', and we copy that. note that this is only possible because we know that the appropriate move is available in fr, so we are making considerable use of the special nature of games of this form.
