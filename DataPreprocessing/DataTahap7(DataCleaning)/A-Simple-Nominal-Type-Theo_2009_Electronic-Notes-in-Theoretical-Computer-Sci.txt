although proof systems for classical nominal logic have been studied extensively, constructive techniques have received less attention. this paper develops a simple type theory for nominal terms, called sntt, that combines ordinary unit, pair, and function types with the names and name-abstractions of nominal logic. sntt is sound and strongly normalizing, can be interpreted using nominal sets, and can easily be extended with recursion combinators for languages with binding that are simpler, albeit less expressive, than in previous systems. extensions to richer type theories or larger fragments of nominal logic remain to be investigated.
