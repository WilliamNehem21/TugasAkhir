several state-of-the-art interactive theorem provers are based on procedural proof languages; the user interacts with the system mainly via a textual script that records the executed commands. the commands that allow progress during a proof are called tactics and are executed atomically. nuprl, isabelle, coq, and matita 4(the proof assistant under development by our team at the university of bologna) are a few examples of those systems.



scripts can be understood only by step by step execution, getting feedback on the proof status from the system. since feedback is given only between atomic steps(at the so called execution points), it is important to have atomic steps as small as possible for the sake of understanding but, also of debugging and proof maintenance. this is in contrast with tacticals, higher order constructs which can be used to combine tactics together.



in this paper we propose a replacement for tacticals in order to obtain smaller atomic execution steps. our work is not relevant in the context of declarative proof languages. however, those few systems where it is possible to embed procedural scripts inside declarative proof steps may already provide the functionality we suggest.



having to fix it. the error message returned by the system may concern an inner status unknown to the user, since the whole tactical is evaluated at once. moreover, the error message will probably concern terms that do not appear verbatim in the script. finding the statement that need to be fixed is usually done replacing tactics with identity tactic proceeding outside-in, until the single failing tactic is found. this technique is not only error prone, but is even not reliable in presence of sideeffects(tactics closing conjectures other than that on which they are applied), since the identity tactic has no side-effects and branches of the proof may be affected by their absence.



the paper is organized as follows. section 2 describes the abstract syntax of tinycals together with their small-step operational semantics. other advantages of tinycals with respect to lcf tacticals are discussed there as well. section 3 presents the tinycals implementation in matita. section 4 deals with tacticals not covered by tinycals. section 5 discusses related work and section 6 concludes the paper.



a proof status is the logical status of the current proof. it can be seen as the current proof tree, but there is no need for it to actually be a tree. matita for instance just keeps the set of conjectures to prove, together with a proof term where meta-variables occur in place of missing components. from a semantic point of view the proof status is an abstract data type. intuitively, it must describe at least the set of conjectures yet to be proved. a goal is another abstract data type used to index conjectures.



a tactic, a proof status, and a goal(the conjecture the tactic should act on), and returns as output a proof status and two lists of goals: the set of newly opened goals and the set of goals which have been closed. this choice enables our semantics to account for side-effects, that is: tactics can close goals other than that on which they have been applied, a feature implemented in several proof assistants via existential or meta-variables[4,9]. the proof status was not directly manipulated by tactics in lcf because of the lack of meta-variables and side effects.



in this paper we propose the replacement of tacticals with tinycals. tacticals operate on proof status, while tinycals operate on evaluation status. this is welcome when tinycals are used in scripts, since the additional information kept in the evaluation status is the rich intermediate state we want to present to the user. on the contrary, this datatype change does not allow the replacement of tacticals with tinycals in the implementation of derived tactics. thus we are immediately led to consider if it is possible to express tacticals in terms of tinycals, in order to avoid an independent re-implementation of related operations.



in this paper we presented the syntax and semantics of tinycals, a tactical language able to mimic some of the lcf tacticals so widespread in state-of-the-art proof assistants. tinycals advantages over lcf tacticals is that their syntax is un-structured and their evaluation proceeds step by step, enabling the user to start execution of a structured script before its completion. intermediate proof status can be inspected and tactics with side effects are supported as well. the neat result is better integration with user interfaces based on the ctcoq/proof general paradigm. some implementative issues have also been discussed, and the extension of the approach to other tacticals has been considered with negative results.
