as test hypothesis we assume that the behavior of the imp can be modelled by a tiots i, which has the same sets of input actions actin and output actions actout as the specification tioga s. let the initial state of i be i0, and the initial semantic state of s be s0. if i0 tioco s0, we say that i is a correct implementation of the specification, denoted i tioco tiots(s). furthermore, i is assumed to be deterministic and controllable.



we aim to conduct targeted rather than comprehensive testing of whether an imp conforms to a spec, thus we use a test purpose. in this paper, we use annotated timed ctl formulas to specify test purposes, e.g., control: a<> bright means that whatever uncontrollable outputs the plant may produce according to the spec model, the controller can always choose to trigger input transition or to delay such that the system is guaranteed to reach the goal location bright. in the weakened case we write e<> control: a<> bright, which means that we can always be guided to reach bright as long as the plant is willing to cooperate with the controller by producing outputs in some desired manner.
