coalgebra is an abstract theory that provides a uniform framework for various kinds of transition systems, arising as a rather recent theory within, or closely connected to category theory. many researches on coalgebras for the classical transition systems and probabilistic transition systems have been done(see for example,[5,6,13,14,15]). however, as far as we know, there are no researches on coalgebras for fuzzy transition systems.



this paper uses the approach of coalgebra to investigate fuzzy transition systems, some important properties are obtained. indeed these conclusions also appeared some literature about probabilistic transition systems. from the research point of view, it seems necessary to point out these conclusions. of course, more attentions should focus on the differences between fuzzy transition systems and probabilistic transition systems. hence, further work is necessary.



further work includes:(1) consider whether main conclusions of this paper can be generalized into more general lattice-valued transition systems and whether there is a general result based on max-plus semirings that brings theses results under a common denominator?(2) consider fuzzy coalgebraic logic following the work of doberkat on stochastic coalgebraic logic. we know that main conclusions of are based on the anl the category of analytic spaces with surjective borel maps as morphisms. probably, these conclusions in the fuzzy case can hold under the general set category.
