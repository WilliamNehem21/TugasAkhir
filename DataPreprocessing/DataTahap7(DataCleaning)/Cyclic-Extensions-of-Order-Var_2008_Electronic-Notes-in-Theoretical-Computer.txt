we study complexity problems involving three sorts of combinational structures: cyclic orders, order varieties and cycles. it is known that the problem of telling whether a cyclic order is included in some cycle is np-complete. we show that the same question for order varieties, a special class of cyclic orders, is in l. for this, we relate the entropy relation between partial orders to the forcing relation of graph theory.



we are interested in complexity problems on three sorts of combinational structures: cyclic orders, order varieties and cycles. cyclic orders[13,15] are ternary relations with the property that when a point in the support is fixed(focussed on), the induced binary relation is a partial(binary) order. order varieties are cyclic orders in which focussing is reversible: no information is lost by fixing any point. order varieties have been introduced in[2,18] and further studied in[12,4] in the context of proof theory, with motivations coming from concurrency theory and linguistics[10,1]. cycles are order varieties such that the induced binary relations are actually linear orders. section 2 recalls the necessary background.



given a set x, a cyclic order on x is a ternary relation on x which is cyclic, anti-reflexive and transitive. an order variety on x is a spreading cyclic order on x. a cycle on x is a total cyclic order on x. it is immediate that a cycle is spreading,



besides, cyc is more general than co-cyc, so co-cyc is in np. on the other hand, cyc reduces to co-cyc: turn the given set of triples into a cyclic transitive relation, check whether it is a cyclic order and, if yes, apply the algorithm for co-cyc. hence, co-cyc is np-complete.
