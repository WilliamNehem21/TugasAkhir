x t. conversely, t cannot necessarily occur at any marking x+ pre(t) but its enabledness might be restricted. such restrictions of the occurrence rule will be encoded by a restriction of concurrent composition, i.e. if x+ pre(t) does not enable t, then x and t are not allowed to be composed by. to describe a restriction of, we use an abstract set i of information elements, together with a symmetric independence relation dom+ on i. every marking x as well as every transition t has attached an information element. a marking x and a transition t can be composed concurrently if and only if their respective information elements are independent. for independent information elements



clearly, one can combine restrictions given by inhibitor arcs and capacities and extend them further, or combine them with other approaches such as positive context to get a more complicated enabling rule. in such cases one could use more complicated algebras, see e.g.[11,3].



there are several approaches to unifying petri nets(see e.g.[22,20,21,16]). they enable to unify different classes of petri nets which use different underlying algebras and different treatment of data-type part, defining them as formal parameters which can be actualized by choosing an appropriate structure. however, in these approaches enabling condition of the occurrence rule is not a parameter, but it is fixed. both definitions in[20,16] capture elementary nets but they let open more complicated restrictions of enabling condition in occurrence rule, such as inhibitor arcs or even capacities.
