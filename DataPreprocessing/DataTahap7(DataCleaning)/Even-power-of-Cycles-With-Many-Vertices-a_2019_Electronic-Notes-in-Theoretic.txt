and o represents the graphs where both problems are unknown. the row k= 2 is fully solved, due to. the rows k= 3 and k= 4 are fully solved, due to. the column 2k+ 1 consists of complete graphs, since 2k+ 1 is odd, the graphs are type 1. the column 2k+ 2 is fully solved, due to. the tcc was proved for the columns 2k+3 to 2k+ 5, due to. the tcc was proved for even n, due to. the tcc was proved for ck, with n= r(2k+ 1)+ k and r> 0, due to. note that this result also proves the tcc for some specific values of odd n. the graphs ck, with n= r(2k+ 1) and r> 0, are type 1, due to.



graphs is fully classified with respect to total coloring by using the conformable condition: the type 1 complete graphs kn are precisely the conformable ones, i.e., the graphs kn with n mod 2= 1. however, the conformable condition does not characterize the type 1 cycle graphs, as there are conformable cycle graphs that are type 2, for example, graph c7.



the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we define operations and operators that are used in section 3 to present a threshold for a even-power of cycle graph to be type 1. in section 4 we present a framework to decompose a power of cycle graph into a set of smaller power of cycle graphs. in section 5 we present our conclusions and possible further directions and applications of the developed tools.



highlighted cells represent the color of the vertices that starts the procedure. the different shades of the cells represent the colors that have to be swapped.(d) the matrix m after swapping colors.(e) the matrix m after adding the colors of the cells that are in m but not in l.
