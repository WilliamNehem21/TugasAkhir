for the general theory of lambda calculus the reader may consult barendregt and krivine. for the general theory of universal algebras the reader may consult burris and sankappanavar gratzer and mckenzie, mcnulty and taylor. the main references for topological algebras are taylor, gumm, bentz and coleman.



+ t. t is a lambda theory if t+= t(see[3, def. 4.1.1]). as a matter of notation, t` m= n stands for+ t` m= n; this is also written as



for any t0-space a the partial order is called the specialization order of. notice that any continuous map between t0-spaces is necessarily monotone and that the order is discrete(i.e. satis es a b i a= b) i a is a t1-space.



the previous axioms of separation can be relativized to pairs of elements. for example, a and b are t2-separable, if there exist open sets u and v with a 2 u, b 2 v and u\ v=;. t1-, t0-separability are similarly de ned.



each partition p of any set x into disjoint subsets, together with;, is a basis for a topology on x, known as a partition topology. a subset of x is then open if and only if it is the union of sets belonging to p and thus its complement is also open; thus a set is open i it is closed. the trivial partitions yield the discrete or indiscrete topologies. in any other cases x with a partition topology is not t0.



let(a;) be a partially ordered set(poset). b a is an upper(lower) set if b 2 b and b a(a b) imply a 2 b. we utilize the notations b"(b#, bl respectively) for the least upper(lower, upper and lower) set containing a subset b of a. we write a"(a#, al respectively) for fag"(fag#, fagl).



given a poset(a;) we can nd many t0-topologies on a for which is the specialization ordering of(see johnstone[25, section ii.1.8]). the alexandro topology and the weak topology de ned below are the maximal one and the minimal one with this property.



it is an easy matter to verify that the a-clopen sets of an alexandro space constitute a topology, denoted by. it is the partition topology(see section 2.3) generated by the partition of the space in connected components.



since a map is monotone i the inverse image of an upper set is an upper set i the inverse image of a lower set is a lower set, then every monotone map is continuous w.r.t. the partition topology.



let u and s be two a-clopen sets such that u is a neighbourhood of c1, s is a neighbourhood of 0, and u\ s=;. because s(a; b)= c1 2 u and s is continuous w.r.t., then there exist two a-clopen sets v and w such that for every m and n such that` m= n. the re exive closure of! satis es the diamond property, and the relations and commute. then the reduction rule!=![! is church-rosser by the hindley-rosen lemma(see barendregt[3, prop. 3.3.5]).



if` tu= then tu=, so that there is a reduction tu. this is possible only if tu is a-redex i.e. if` t= u. 2 tu= i` t= u, so that our hypothesis 6` t= u implies 6` c1=. the remaining part follows from the induction hypothesis and from lemma 4.1 applied to cn+1(cn). 2



-term t is the element jtjc of c(see section 2.2). for the sake of simplicity, we write directly t for jtjc when there is no danger of confusion. de ne 0 and s(x; y) xy. since` xx=, then we have that c j= x: xx= x:. this last identity implies cc=( x: xx)c=( x:)c= for all c 2 c.
