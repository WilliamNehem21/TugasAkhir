microscopic molecules. kastelic recognized the collagen fascicle and deemed the fascicle as the fundamental structural unit of tendons. the passive tensile tissues, ligament, are also composed largely of water(60-80%) and collagen, elastin, but contain very little of the ground substance(arranged in parallel with a maxwell element which accounts for the viscoelasticity of the proteoglycans) that give ligament its unique mechanical properties. to keep with the functional role of these tissues, the collagen fibrils are organized primarily in long strands parallel with the axis of loading. as the ligament is loaded, the bending angle of the crimp structure of the collagen fibers can be seen to reversibly decrease, which indicates that deformation of this structure is one source of elasticity. individual collagen fibrils also display some inherent elasticity, and these two features are believed to determine the bulk properties of passive tensile tissues.
