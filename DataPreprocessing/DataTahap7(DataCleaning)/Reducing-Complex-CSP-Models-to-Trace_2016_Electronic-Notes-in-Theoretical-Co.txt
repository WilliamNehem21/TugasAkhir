we first briefly describe the language of csp. we next give an informal description of our construction for the failures model. to prove the result in full generality, we first give a formal definition of a finite observational model, and of the notion of rationality. we then describe our general construction. finally we discuss performance and optimisation issues.



step 3: we now ensure that an acceptance set inferred from a trace is a complete set accepted by the process under examination. this is most straightforwardly done by employing a regulator process, which can either accept an unprimed event or accept the alphabetically first refusal or acceptance event, followed by a refusal or acceptance for each event in turn. in the latter case it then communicates a done event, and returns to its original state.



for the sake of efficiency we work directly rather than using the general construction of theorem 5.4. the context c1 introduces refusal events and a stab event, which can occur only when the corresponding normal events can be refused. this implements the refusal testing model, and the context cf which allows only normal events optionally followed by some refusals(and stab) implements the failures model.
