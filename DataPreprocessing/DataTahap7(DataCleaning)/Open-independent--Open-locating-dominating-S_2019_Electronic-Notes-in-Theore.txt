set of g, such that every vertex in g has at least one neighbor in s, and no two vertices in g have the same set of neighbors in s. when a device may be prevented from detecting an intruder at its own location, it is necessary to install another device in its neighborhood. a natural way to analyze such situations is to make use of open neighborhood sets which may have useful additional properties, such as being open-independent, dominating, open-dominating or open-locating-dominating.



tary prisms, such as independence, distance and domination. for further study on domination parameters in complementary prisms, see[1,3,4,7,8,9,11]. cappelle et al. described a polynomial time recognition algorithm for complementary prisms and duarte et al. studied algorithmic/complexity properties of complementary prisms with respect to cliques, independent sets, domination, and convexity. here we study open-independent, open-locating-dominating sets in the complementary prisms of graphs. various properties of and bounds on oldoind-sets in complementary prisms were presented and the cases of cliques, paths and cycles have been completely solved. our main result is that if the girth of g is at least five, then the
