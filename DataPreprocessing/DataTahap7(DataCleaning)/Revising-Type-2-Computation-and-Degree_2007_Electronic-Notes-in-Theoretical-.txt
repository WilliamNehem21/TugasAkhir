an important(though somewhat hidden) point in the definition of a type-2 machine is that its output tape be one-way; compare e.g.[21, top of p.15]. this condition allows to abort a real number computation as soon as the desired precision is reached, knowing that this preliminary approximation will not be reverted. it also is crucial for the main theorem to hold.
