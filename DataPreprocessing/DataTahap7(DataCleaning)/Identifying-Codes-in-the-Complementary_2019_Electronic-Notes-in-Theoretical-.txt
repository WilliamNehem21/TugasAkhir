it is algorithmically hard[1,5] to determine identifying codes of minimum order even for planar graphs of arbitrarily large girth. exact values, density results, as well as good upper and lower bounds have been studied in detail for many special graphs; in particular for graphs that arise by product operations using simple factors such as grids[2,3,4,7,8,11,10,12,13,17,20]. in the present paper we study identifying codes in the complementary prism of cycles. the related notion of locating-domination was studied for such graphs in.
