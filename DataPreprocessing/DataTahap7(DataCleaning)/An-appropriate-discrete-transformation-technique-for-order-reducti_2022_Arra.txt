validation of the obtained results through step responses of the higherorder and obtained reduced-order systems is in section 6 along with the computed errors. the limitation found during the findings of the outcome from this article is discussed in section 7. finally, the key difference between the two methods is offered in section 8 as conclusions with a possible future scope.



with time span and easy access of digital signals and systems, discrete-time systems gained their consideration over analogue systems for control and analysis. since, the study and analysis of such systems of higher order in their raw form is uneasy; they also demand their order reduction for easy access. order reduction techniques available in literature showcase the advancement of fewer order reduction techniques in continuous-time domain directly to the discrete-time domain, both for non-interval and interval systems. such type of algorithms includes pade approximation, balanced truncation, direct truncation, aggregation. apart from these, an algorithm like routh approximation in the continuous-time domain is not applicable to discrete-time domain directly. a vast range of algorithms based on routh approximation is consisted in ref.. this call for an appropriate discretization technique of the discrete-time systems to continuous-time and vice-versa with an ease of computation. precisely, the transformation modifies the discrete-time system to continuous-time system; order reduction methodology applied, and finally, an appropriate inverse transformation results in the desired reduced model in discrete-time domain.
