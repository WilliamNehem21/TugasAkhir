in this section, we illustrate how to model optimization problems using graph transformation systems with time. for a motivating example, we discuss(a slightly modified version of) a job-shop scheduling problem, the personalization machine example discussed in. the example is a simplified version of a case study carried out within the ametist project.



matching a specific pattern with another graph. in graph transformation with time, a time attribute is a logical clock(typically) with non-negative integer values that can be attached to nodes. the time attribute has a distinguished role to define how the time progresses in discrete steps in a consistent way.



in the guard, we check the existence of nodes and edges of corresponding types(such as, e.g., convcell[cc1] and mycell[p1][cc1]), and attribute conditions(such as personalized[c1]== true). the state variable updates remove the pers hold edge and create a new conv hold edge, moreover, they update the time variable according to the conditions of gtss with time.
