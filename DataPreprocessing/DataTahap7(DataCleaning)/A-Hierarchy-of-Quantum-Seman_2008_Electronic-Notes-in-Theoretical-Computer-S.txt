several domains[1,4,12,16] can be used to define the semantics of quantum programs. among them abramsky has introduced a semantics based on probabilistic power domains, whereas the one by selinger associates with every program a completely positive map. in this paper, we mainly introduce a semantical domain based on admissible transformations, i.e. multisets of linear operators. in order to establish a com-



which formalism is adapted to the representation of quantum states and quantum evolutions? it turns out that at least two formalisms can be used for representing quantum states: pure states(i.e vectors in a hilbert space) and mixed states(i.e. density matrices). for the representation of quantum evolutions, at least three candidates exist: superoperators 2 acting on density matrices, probabilistic functions acting on pure states, and admissible transformations 3.



proof.(sketch) the proof is by induction on the command c. the proof is immediate for the commands skip, the composition and the unitary transformations h, t, and cnot. for the if case, the main two ingredients of the proof are: 3.11 since[ex2]]a=[[ex3]]a. in order to illustrate the concreteness of the admissible semantics, one can notice in the definition of the semantics that the existence of while loop in a command c implies that the admissible semantics of c is an infinite multiset: each linear operator of the admissible transformation represents a computational path.
