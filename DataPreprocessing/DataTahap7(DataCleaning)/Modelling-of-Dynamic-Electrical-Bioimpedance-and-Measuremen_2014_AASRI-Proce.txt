checking the patient leakage current is divided into two checks of which the first examines the current flowing through the applied parts and from the device, while the second examines the current that will flow through the parts when a potential difference appears in the patient because of the existence of an external power supply. for the first check, all electrodes are connected together and the measuring device is placed between the protective earth conductor and the connection of the electrodes. in the second check an external voltage is applied to the electrodes through the checking device and a power supply is inserted between the terminals of the measuring device and the protective earth conductor. for internally powered devices with accessible metal parts in particular, the patient leakage current is measured between the electrodes and a point on the housing and the terminals of the measuring device are placed accordingly.
