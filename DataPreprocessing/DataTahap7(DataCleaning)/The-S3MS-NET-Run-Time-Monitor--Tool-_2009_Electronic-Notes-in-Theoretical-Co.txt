in todays networked world, code mobility is ubiquitous. even mobile phones and personal digital assistants increasingly support the installation of third party applications from a variety of sources. this support for applications from potentially untrustworthy sources comes with a serious risk: malicious or buggy applications can lead to denial of service, financial damage, leaking of confidential information and so forth. the research community has developed a variety of countermeasures for addressing the threat of untrusted mobile code. one important class of countermeasures addresses this risk by monitoring the application at run time, and aborting it if it violates a predefined security policy.



this paper reports on a tool developed within the security of software and services for mobile systems(s3ms) project. it implements a monitor for the.net platform through bytecode inlining. several of the key algorithms implemented in the tool have been proven formally correct, and the implementation is sufficiently mature to handle real-world applications for both the.net compact framework(for mobile devices) and the full.net framework(for desktops and servers).



the inliner loops over the bytecode of an untrusted application looking for calls to security-relevant methods(srm). identifying such calls statically in the presence of dynamic binding and delegates(a form of type safe function pointers supported by the.net virtual machine) is non-trivial. the tool implements the algorithm by vanoverberghe and piessens.



the simplified code shown above does not deal with inheritance and dynamic binding. support for this was implemented by extending the logic in the pdp to consider the type of the object at runtime, instead of only looking at the static type that is available during the inlining process. when a security-relevant virtual method is called, calls are inlined to so-called dynamic dispatcher methods that inspect the runtime type of the object and forward to the correct handler. the details, and a formal proof of correctness of this inlining algorithm is presented in.



our tool implements strong synchronization, which might be problematic when srms take a long time to execute, or are blocking(e.g. a method that waits for an incoming network connection). to alleviate this problem, the tool partitions the handler methods according to which security state variables they access. two partitions that access a distinct set of state variables can be locked independently from each other.



the s3ms.net run time monitor was developed in the european fp6 project, security of software and services for mobile systems(s3ms). the tool is a component of a comprehensive security architecture for mobile devices that supports a novel paradigm for developing trustworthy applications, the security-by-contract paradigm.





ture) is its improved expressiveness. the main difference between cas and the approach outlined here, is that cas is stateless. this means that in a cas policy, a method call is either allowed for an application or disallowed. with the s3ms approach, a more dynamic policy can be written, where a method can for instance be invoked only a particular number of times. this is essential for enforcing policies that specify quota on resource accesses.



a second limitation of the approach implemented in the tool is that it is hard and sometimes even impossible to express certain useful policies as security automata over api method calls. for instance, a policy that limits the number of bytes transmitted over a network needs to monitor all api method calls that could lead to network traffic, and should be able to predict how much bytes of traffic the method will consume. in the presence of dns lookups, redirects and so forth, this can be very hard.
