then we detected some uncertainty areas along the point edges where the profile in the eight directions marked a rough variation or, in any case, a skip over a precise threshold level, localized by three constants[ti, to, ts]. such constants are automatically determined by the algorithm in relation to the maximum, minimum and mean deviation values of the two profiles. in these areas, for each iterative step t the pixel values fill in the matrixes{si} and{gi}, well distinct from the matrixes{s} and{g} which instead are almost certainly background and rail. therefore, at the iterative step t we have:
