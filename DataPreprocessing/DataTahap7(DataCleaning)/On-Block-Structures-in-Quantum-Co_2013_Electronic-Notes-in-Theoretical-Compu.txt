in the final section we use these logical block structures to give a diagrammatic description of two familiar quantum protocols, namely superdense coding and teleportation. the ultimate goal is to develop an appropriate logic for such protocols and to formalise the representation in a computer algebra tool, for simulation and verification. thus, the paper follows earlier work on semantics of quantum programming languages, like, for instance[1,19,20,21] and.



example 3.5 in the context of hilbert spaces, several of the ingredients encountered above are present, but we do not find a logical block structure, for the standard logic of effects. we briefly describe the situation, building on example 2.5.
