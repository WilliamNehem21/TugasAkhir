in other words, contexts are just terms with holes in them. we usually write a context c as c[.,...,.] not to get confused with ordinary terms. these holes can be filled with terms of appropriate type to give a term. we denote a portant one. in practice other issues arise such as efficiency regarding time and/or space. though in part 1.1.3 we tried to summarize the theoretical issues and demonstrate the success in that regard, we never cared about the efficiency of computations. whenever we felt a deficiency, we did not hesitate to remedy by any means.



pcf-programs are meant to output constants of the ground types bool or nat. of course it is obvious that there are many more collection of objects over which we like to do computation. one such important case is the set of real numbers.



traditionally we are used to computation on real numbers via floating point approximations which is satisfactory for everyday business but can prove to be extremely unreliable in special circumstances. floating point computation carries the problem of round-off errors with it, which we try to ignore in everyday life applications for a variety of reasons. in this subject is explored together with two interesting examples demonstrating the unreliability of floating point approach. accordingly the idea of exact real number computation has been put forward which is, as opposed to floating point computation, reliable, i.e. the output produced is guaranteed to be correct. moreover the results can be computed effectively(e.g. as opposed to bss approach) to within any desired degree of accuracy.
