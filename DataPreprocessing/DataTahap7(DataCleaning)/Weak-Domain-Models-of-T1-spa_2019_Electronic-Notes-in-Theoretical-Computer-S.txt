a poset model of a topological space x is a poset p such that max(p), the set of maximal elements of p, with the relative scott topology, is homeomorphic to x. every space having a poset model must be t1. in, martin proved that if a space is homeomorphic to the maximal point space of a continuous dcpo, then the space is choquet complete. thus not every t1 space has a domain model.



in, it was proved that every t1 space x has a local quasicontinuous domain model, denoted by zh(x). an important property is that x is sober iff zh(x) is sober. so if x is not sober, then zh(x) cannot be quasicontinuous. hence, there exists a local quasicontinuous domain which is not quasicontinuous.
