considering these capabilities, many optimization problems can be solved using such distributed facility. however, like many other heuristic methods, the rate of convergence of finding ground states is low when the problem dimension grows. more specifically, this is reported to be a challenging aspect of the more conventional approaches such as the sa as reported earlier in[5,6].
