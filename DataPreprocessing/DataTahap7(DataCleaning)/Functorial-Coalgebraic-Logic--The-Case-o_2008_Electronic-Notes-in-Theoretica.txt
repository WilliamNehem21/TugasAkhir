the purpose of this section is an algebraic investigation of logics for coalgebras. the general idea is as follows. just as coalgebras are given wrt a functor t on, say, set, so are logics for coalgebras given by a functor l on, say, boolean algebras. the following example shows how logics for coalgebras given in a more conventional style give rise to a functor on the category ba of boolean algebras.



different coproduct structures. but this implies working with a different functor than l. instead, we can use another approach, namely to consider the free lalgebra over different presheaves of variables. for example, if w is the presheaf of variables defined explicitly by
