negativity in items such as profit and loss, cash flow and share price change(adjusted, annual) was avoided by adding a fixed amount in all of these in order to have them be on scale from zero onwards(like in other dea studies, see pastor& ruiz, 2007). in profit and loss, it was added 3789,001 eur(thousands) to each real number, in cash flow the amount was 1454,001 eur(thousands), while in share price changes it was added one(1). also inventory turns needed to be modified for the purposes of dea research as in general it is so that higher input amounts should lead to higher outputs(having the same and consistent direction between inputs and outputs). therefore, inventory turns was calculated as an inverse number(lower the inventory turns, the higher the input number).



this study to larger economies, and possibly to main european exchange listed companies or north american ones. the retail sector in these markets has globally leading companies present, which would make examination of this sector fruitful. as manufacturing is increasingly asian based, this would be another interesting direction to follow. in both of these possible further studies inventory and asset role should be examined further to shed more light on issues found in this research. another possibility for further research would be to take earlier years in data from times before the global financial crisis. using older data would enable to examine the era, when there were higher interest rates. this ought to stress the importance of inventory and assets.
