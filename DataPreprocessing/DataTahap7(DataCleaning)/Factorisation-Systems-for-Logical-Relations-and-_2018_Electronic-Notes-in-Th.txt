the main feature of our factorisation construction is its modularity. first, factorisation takes place on a purely structural level, and we do not need any semantic properties such as the monad laws. second, factorisation takes place on a pay-asyou-go basis, factorising any additional data the morphism of interest preserves. to describe it explicitly, we first describe precisely the structures we will factorise.



so far, we have worked with an arbitrary factorisation system(e, m). when it is an epi-mono factorisation system, i.e., a pair(e, m) in which m consists of monos, then theorem 2.5 holds under the weaker assumption that t is a monad, while s need only be a monad structure. to prove it, instead of appealing to the diagonal fill-in property, use the cancellation property of monos.
