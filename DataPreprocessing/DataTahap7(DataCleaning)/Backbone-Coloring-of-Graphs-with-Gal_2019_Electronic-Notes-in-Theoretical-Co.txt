with our result, we deduce that a q-backbone coloring with 2q+ 2 colors can be obtained in linear time. we do not know whether our bound is tight when g is triangle-free. it is trivially tight when g is not triangle-free as it suffices to take a k4 with k1,3 as backbone. therefore, we pose the question:



coloring of g. now, we prove that it is a circular backbone coloring. for this, we prove that, given a central vertex v, all of its neighbors in the backbone are colored with an appropriate color. first observe that v receives color 1, q+3 or q+ 2. in the first case, the colors allowed for its neighbors in f are q+1 or q+ 2. in the second case, all the its neighbors in f are colored with colors 1 or 2. finally, in the last case, all the its neighbors in f are colored with colors 1 or 2q+ 2. hence cj is a circular q-backbone coloring of(g, f).
