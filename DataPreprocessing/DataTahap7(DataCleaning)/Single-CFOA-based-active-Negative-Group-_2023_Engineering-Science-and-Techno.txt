in this article, we presented nine new second-order single current feedback operation amplifier(cfoa)-based ngd circuits, obtained by computer-aided design method, which may be useful for communication or control applications. section 2 introduces the ngd circuit theory, describes the cfoa, a literature review of active ngd topologies, and presents the new circuits. section 3 describes the circuit design method, while a non-ideal study of a selected ngd circuit is given in section 4. section 5 is focused on the simulation and experimental validations. performance comparison with selected stateof-the-art solutions is shown in section 6. finally, section 7 concludes the study.
