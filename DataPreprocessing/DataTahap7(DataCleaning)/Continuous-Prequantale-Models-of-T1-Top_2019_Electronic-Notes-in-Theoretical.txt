dana scott introduced the domain theory in order to provide the mathematical foundation for denotational semantics of programming languages. after that, the domain theory has been a major impetus in the development of topological spaces. thanks to the topological tools, the domain theory has developed very quickly. indeed there are deep ties and interactions between the topological theory of topological spaces and the order theory of partially ordered sets. one aspect that many scholars are interested in is that the classical topological spaces are embedded into the set of the maximal points of the appropriate posets so as to use the domain theory to solve the problems about the topology.



space x is a poset p such that the maximal point space max(p) is homeomorphic to x. there have been many results which give necessary or sufficient conditions for topological spaces to have a poset model. please refer to([8,9,10,11]) if the reader wants to know more about poset models.
