we introduce and examine a tool for analysing logics. this algebraic tool, coming from some ideas introduced by j. piaget, provides condensed information about a logic(with emphasis on the behavior of a unary symbol), as such, it can be employed for analysing and, to some extent, comparing logics.



we introduce and examine an algebraic tool for analysing and comparing logics. this tool stems from some ideas introduced by jean piaget to analyse the behavior of classical propositional negation. we will extend them to a unary symbol(e. g. negation or a modality).



we have introduced and examined an algebraic tool for analysing and comparing logics. this tool originates from some ideas introduced by jean piaget, which we have extended to a unary symbol(e. g. negation or a modality) and formulated in a more general context.
