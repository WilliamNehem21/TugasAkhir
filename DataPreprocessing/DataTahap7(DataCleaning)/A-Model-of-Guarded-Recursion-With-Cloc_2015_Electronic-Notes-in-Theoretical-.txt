in previous versions of this calculus, different clocks represented separate time streams and clock synchronisation was prohibited. in this paper we show that allowing clock synchronisation is safe by constructing a new model of guarded recursion and clocks. this result will greatly simplify the type theory by removing freshness restrictions from typing rules, and is a necessary step towards defining rewrite semantics, and ultimately implementing the calculus.



remark 3.18 this interpretation is standard, see e.g. jacobs, but note that it is crucial that we have general clock substitution gr(f), for arbitrary f, and this is precisely the ingredient that was missing in previous models, hence the restrictions on clock instantiation rules.
