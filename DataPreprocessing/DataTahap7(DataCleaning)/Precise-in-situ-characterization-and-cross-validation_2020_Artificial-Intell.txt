due to simple and rugged motor construction, potentially low production cost, excellent torque/speed characteristics, high operating efficiency, and inherent fault tolerance, switched reluctance motors(srms) are emerging as an attractive drive unit ranging from modern electrical vehicles to high speed aircraft applications. in recent years, substantial research efforts have been devoted to various aspects of srm such as speed regulation performance analysis, controller design and instrumentation, drive application, where the accurate knowledge of the srm's electromagnetic characteristics is a defining property for all these cases.



to date it remains challenging when precisely characterizing the parameters for control purpose since an srm presents highly nonlinear characteristics due to the motor's doubly salient structure and its intentional operation in deep magnetic saturation for higher power density. moreover, a prominent subproblem associated is that the current accurate in-lab measurement results are rarely applicable in engineering, especially when the precise parameter evaluation is desired. the considerable errors between the in-lab characterization and field application stem from manufacturing and material variations from the prototype, neglect of phase mutual couplings, diverse winding copper and iron losses, and the chopping loss of power electronics devices. therefore, although precisely characterizing the srms is extensively investigated and gives perfect insight into the physics, there still exists a necessity to develop a rapid approach on characterizing the motors individually. in this sense the core issue is how to comprehensively replicate the operating scenario during the characterization process, where an in-situ characterization lends itself to serve this goal.



the organization of this paper is as follows. section 2 proposes a precise srm characterization model for an srm, with an emphasis on discriminating the definition of phase and incremental inductance. section 3 describes a cots circuitry based in-situ characterizing approach for the motor, and the merits of this measuring method are also highlighted. parameter measurement results and parameter characteristics are illustrated in section 4, followed by a reliable in-situ cross-validation method. some conclusions are given in section 5.

in the srm control board the instantaneous maximum phase current is limited to 13.0a during test, and the maximum current during motor operation is 9.0a. the current sensor is lem hms 05-p with the accuracy of 1%. the encoder is omron e6c2-c with the resolution of 2000 pulse/ round. the general controller is a 32-bit 150mips tms320lf2812 dsp which includes a 16-channel 12-bit on-chip 3d converter with the 12.5 m sampling bandwidth. an altera fpga ep2c8q208c8(8 speed grade) is selected to expand the i/o and execute online cmac nn computation, which has 8256 logic cells and 165,888 memory bits. meanwhile the fpga has a 16 m byte sdram for temporarily reserving the sensor-acquired data.



here using the decaying current profile is more appropriate for higher currents since the voltage fluctuation during a falling current is negligible and fairly constant. this is because the measurement during a decaying current is carried out by eliminating the applied voltage to the winding, and an alternative path to the winding current is provided through a freewheeling diode connected across the machine phase, hence no current drains from the filter capacity. the voltage across the winding during the decaying current is only the forward voltage drop of the diode. in contrast, the applied source voltage varies while the current is increasing, giving rise to errors due to quantization and its use in the evaluation of flux linkages(krishnan, 2001).



in order to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the characterization, two aspects are considered in this paper. first, decaying current is used to characterize the incremental inductance and at the same position the rising current is used to validate its result. this approach is name after cross-validation because both the currents are shapes by the identical inductance regarding to the fixed position. the second aspect is that a numerical model is built according to the decaying current model and then a full process is simulated and experimentally recorded to show their agreement.



the precisely measured electromagnetics data and established model enable detailed and precise examination of srm behavior over a wide variety of simulated operating conditions without the limitations associated with drive circuits, transducers or instrumentation, as the case we used for validating the characterization precision in section 4.2. and it worth noting that all the electromagnetic parameters are able to be manipulated under a unified computational framework.
