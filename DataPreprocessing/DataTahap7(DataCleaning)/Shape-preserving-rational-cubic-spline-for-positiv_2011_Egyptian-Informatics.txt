abstract in this paper, the problem of shape preserving c2 rational cubic spline has been proposed. the shapes of the positive and convex data are under discussion of the proposed spline solutions. a c2 rational cubic function with two families of free parameters has been introduced to attain the c2 positive curves from positive data and c2 convex curves from convex data. simple data dependent constraints are derived on free parameters in the description of rational cubic function to obtain the desired shape of the data. the rational cubic schemes have unique representations.



hussain et al. discussed the problem of visualization of scientific data; a rational cubic function was used to achieve the goal for shaped data. they derived the conditions on free parameters in the description of rational cubic function to obtain desired shapes of the data and the degree of smoothness attained was c1. sarfraz et al. constructed a c1 interpolant to visualize the shape of 2d positive data. they derived the conditions on free parameters in the description of rational cubic function to visualize the shape of 2d positive data. further they also extended their scheme to visualize the shape of 3d positive data.
