this paper presents a graphical user interface(gui) for the maude-npa, a crypto protocol analysis tool that takes into account algebraic properties of cryptosystems not supported by other tools, such as cancellation of encryption and decryption, abelian groups(including exclusive or), and modular exponentiation. maude-npa has a theoretical basis in rewriting logic, unification and narrowing, and performs backwards search from a final attack state to determine whether or not it is reachable from an initial state. the gui animates the maude-npa verification process, displaying the complete search tree and allowing users to display graphical representations of final and intermediate nodes of the search tree. one of the most interesting points of this work is that our gui has been developed using the framework for declarative graphical interaction associated to maude that includes iop, imaude and jlambda. this framework facilitates the interaction and the interoperation between formal reasoning tools(maude-npa in our case) and allows maude to communicate easily with other tools.



the desirable features mentioned above for the maude-npa gui are not obtained by following a standard approach to gui development. indeed, we seriously doubt that a standard approach using a conventional programming language could have given us the simplicity, levels of abstraction, and flexibility for the gui features and ease of evolution that we need in a tool like the maude-npa whose design is still evolving. instead, our approach to gui design is based on a philosophical viewpoint that regards gui interactions as another form of rewriting; specifically, it is based on a declarative, rewritingbased approach to gui design.



to corresponding graphical objects that appear like built-in external objects supported by the maude infrastructure. the implementation of the graphical objects and message passing communication with these external objects is achieved using the interoperability platform(iop), that supports the actor model, and its associated imaude library(see section 3). the infrastructure used to build the maude-npa gui is quite general, extending maude to provide a framework on top of which many interesting applications and graphical interfaces can be built.



a number of approaches have been taken to the formal verification of cryptographic protocols. one of the most popular is model checking, in which the interaction of the protocol with the attacker is symbolically executed. indeed, model-checking of secrecy(and later, authentication) in protocols in the bounded-session model(where a session is a single execution of a process representing an honest principal) has been shown to be decidable, and a number of bounded-session model checkers exist. moreover, a number of unbounded model checkers, of which maude-npa is one, either make use of abstraction to enforce decidability, or allow for the possibility of non-termination.



a more recent example of a graphical output interface is the scyther tool. it searches from instances of roles, generating all trace patterns that are consistent with it. the scyther tool outputs graphical representations of these trace patterns. unlike the interrogator, however, it does not output partial or unsuccessful patterns.



regarding guis that assist protocol specifications, one prominent example is span, a companion tool for avispa. span is a graphical protocol animator that allows a user to check the validity of specifications written in the avispa input language, hlpsl. span allows the user to step through executions of a protocol in the absence of an intruder, determining whether or not it is behaving according to the intended way. span can also be used with the intruder present to construct attacks on protocols, although it does not find them automatically; the user must choose each step to execute out of a set presented to him by the tool.



the rest of this article is organized as follows. in section 2, we introduce the maude-npa tool and its use. section 3 presents some background about the iop, imaude and jlambda frameworks. in section 4, we give some details on how the maude-npa gui has been actually implemented using the iop-imaude framework. section 5 describes in detail the features of the maude-npa gui, including some pictures. in section 6, we finish with some conclusions and plans for future work.



from a given final attack state, maude-npa executes the protocol backwards to an initial state, if possible. the first step before actually starting the backwards search is to prove lemmas about unreachable states by generating the grammars of the protocol. these grammars help to reduce the search space(see) and are automatically generated by the tool. for each intermediate state found in the backwards execution, the tool checks whether it is



an iop actor is one or more unix style processes registered within the system. each one has three fifos(i.e., unix style pipes). its stdin, stdout and stderr file descriptors are redirected to one of these fifos. an actor can be created at the startup(these are the initials actors), in response to some event, or by the user or another process asking the system actor to do so.



iop comes with a basic set of actors. the most important for our purposes are:(i) the system actor,(ii) the gui.editor,(iii) the maude actor, and(iv) the graphics2d actor. the maude actor is a maude process encapsulated in a wrapper that enables interaction with other actors.



communication between actors is performed via asynchronous message passing through the iop registry, which acts as a post office, routing the messages from each sender actor to the desired target actor. there exist several forms of communication:(i) inter-actor, i.e., from one actor to another;(ii) meta-actor, i.e., from an actor to the registry; and(iii) interface, i.e., between the gui.editor and an actor(the registry or any other actor).
