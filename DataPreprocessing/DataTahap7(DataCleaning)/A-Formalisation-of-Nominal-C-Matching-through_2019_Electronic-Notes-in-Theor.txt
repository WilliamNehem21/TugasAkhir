nominal unification is a decidable problem and efficient nominal unification algorithms are available[18,12,11], that compute solutions consisting of freshness contexts(containing freshness constraints of the form a#x) and substitutions. nominal unification modulo commutativity(c), consists of nominal unification problems in which the signature of terms contains commutative function symbols. this algebraic property has to be taken into account during the unification process.



section 2 presents basic concepts and notations. section 3 presents the extension of simplification rules for nominal c-unification with protected variables, and discusses how the formalisations of termination, soundness and completeness were adapted. section 4 introduces the nominal c-matching algorithm, and discusses the formalisation of its termination, soundness and completeness properties. section 5 concludes the paper.



remark 4.4 in the specification, the set of protected variables of a c-matching problem is given as a parameter of the deductive system that remains unchanged during derivations. for simplicity, in the following results the protected set is denoted as x.
