. next, it is difficult to reason by induction and to use recursion over contexts, because they are rendered as functional terms. finally, the major virtue of hoas bites back, in the sense that one looses the possibility of proving properties over the mechanisms delegated to the metalanguage.



calculus. finally, in section 5 we report an interesting result, namely, the derivation of higher-order induction from first-order one together with the axioms of the theory of contexts. this should help to understand the interaction between all the axioms and their expressivity.



the soundness of the theory of contexts is proved in. however, as far the completeness is concerned, we do not have yet a result stating the expressive power of the axioms w.r.t. some known logic system. in this section we prove an important result in this direction, namely, the derivability of the higherobject systems. however, all these works seem to adopt an ad-hoc variant of the axioms without following a common methodology. this paper tries to disclaim this wrong impression, and aims to give a brief roadmap to follow systematically in order to instanciate the axiom schemata and to work with a weak hoas-based encoding.
