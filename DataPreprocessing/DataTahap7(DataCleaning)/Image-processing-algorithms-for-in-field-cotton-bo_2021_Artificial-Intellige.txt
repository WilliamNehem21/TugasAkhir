hence, this study aimed to develop cotton segmentation algorithms for natural illumination conditions such that with single threshold value in an algorithm, cotton boll can be detected in morning, afternoon or evening time with minimum errors and evaluate them based on image processing time and segmentation accuracy. for this, four new methods of cotton segmentation were introduced in addition to other existing methods which can be used for cotton harvesting robots to recognize cotton bolls. after analyzing four color spaces, rgb and ycbcr color spaces were used for cotton segmentation in natural light conditions, optimum thresholds were selected and morphological opening and closing operations were performed to remove noises and holes in the segmented binary image. the performance of proposed algorithms was evaluated in terms of hits rate, false positive, false negative, processing time, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.



the cotton bolls can be detected easily based on their color features. the commonly popular color space models for feature segmentation from color images includes the rgb, the hsv, the l*a*b, and the ycbcr color models. the selection of a proper color space model is very crucial for the successful detection of the particular object from the given color images. in past, various researchers have implemented different color



in this study, two-color space models, i.e., rgb and ycbcr were selected and further utilized for developing in-field cotton detection algorithms. in past, many researchers used rgb and ycbcr color space models to extract the region of interest using color thresholding segmentation in different agricultural applications. a total of four image processing algorithms were developed, out of which, three algorithms



where, t is the threshold value of chromatic aberration, and f(x, y) is the value of the pixel(x, y) in the final binary image obtained after implementation of the color thresholding technique. in the binary image, the white color portion(the pixel value is 1) represents the cotton bolls, and the black color portion(the pixel value is 0) represents the background, i.e., stem and leaves.



the selection of appropriate threshold values is very crucial for proper segmentation of input images and successful recognition of the cotton bolls using the proposed algorithms. in past, many researchers used various threshold methods for the segmentation of region of interest from an image. in this study, the color thresholding method was applied to segment images and recognize cotton bolls.



ground truth images are the ones in which regions of interest(roi) are segmented using a more accurate method as compare to propose method. hu et al.(2015) compared their proposed automatic segmentation algorithm for bananas with the manually segmented bananas region, which acts as ground truth in their study. tsai and tseng(2012) compared the accuracy of their proposed color detection method with the traditional color detection method based on hsl color space. bachche and oka(2013) obtained ground truth distance data by manually measuring the distance for the accuracy testing of depth coordinate in their study.



in this study, two approaches were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. in the first approach, true detected cotton(tdc), false detected cotton(fdc), and missed cotton(mc) were counted. true detected cotton(tdc) indicates an object in the segmented image which is recognized as cotton boll when it is a cotton boll.



where tp is the cotton's pixels predicted by the algorithm correctly. tn is the background's pixels predicated by the algorithm correctly. fp is the background's pixels predicted by the algorithm incorrectly as cotton's pixels. and, fn is the cotton's pixels predicted by algorithm incorrectly as background's pixels.
