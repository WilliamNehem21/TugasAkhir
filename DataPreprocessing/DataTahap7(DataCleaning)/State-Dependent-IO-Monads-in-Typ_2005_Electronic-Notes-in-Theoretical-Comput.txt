the second editor has an additional state parameter, namely the number of characters read. it reads a character. if it is a normal character, it proceeds as before. if it is the backspace character, then it deletes the last character, if there is one character left. if there is no character left, it signals a beep.



until now the only way to terminate for our programs is that r(s, c) is empty for some s, c. if a program reaches this situation, there is never any response, and the program is locked up. we want our programs to terminate and to give back some value, which we can see as value for the function calculated by the program. therefore, we give our programs the ability to terminate in a state s with a certain value a from a set a(s).
