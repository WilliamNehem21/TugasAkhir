process algebras offer an elegant framework to describe a wide range of systems, from computer networks to biological systems. when additional information regarding(stochastic) speed of actions is added, we end up in the realm of stochastic process algebras(spa), a widespread modeling technique in performance analysis and in systems biology. spa are usually given a semantics in terms of continuous-time markov chains(ctmc)in fact, they can be seen as an high-level description language for ctmc. therefore, all the analysis techniques for ctmc can be applied also to spa, like steady-state or transient analysis. moreover, many features of ctmc(like block decomposability) can be lifted to the level of spa, greatly simplifying the analysis. however, analyzing a stochastic system is a computationally expensive activity, and all previously mentioned techniques suffer severely from state space explosion. this phenomenon gets even worse when components are present in many copies, like molecules involved in chemical reactions.
