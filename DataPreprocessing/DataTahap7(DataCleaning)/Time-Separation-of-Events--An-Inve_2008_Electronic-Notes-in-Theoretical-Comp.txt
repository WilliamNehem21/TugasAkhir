given events i and j is np-complete(). we focus here on the inverse problem: we seek intervals for the component delays, so that the time separation between i and j is guaranteed to be no greater than a specified bound. we give a polynomial time method to solve it, and explain how it is useful for relaxing some bounds associated to some component delays while preserving the global separation time from i to j.



the direct problem of time separation of events has received considerable attention in the literature(see, e.g. for an extensive survey). even in the case of acyclic timing constraint graphs, the direct problem is np-complete. many researchers have thus proposed polynomial-time approximating algorithms, which give an upper approximation of the maximal separation time. in contrast here, the time generated will be guaranteed to be the exact maximal time(for a possibly restricted domain of component delays, however). other researchers have replaced some of the bound values by parameters, then have computed the exact solution space using exponential-time procedures(e.g., fourier-motzkin elimination or presburger-based procedures)). a variant of this approach has been proposed using additional techniques of abstract interpretation or parametric reachability analysis.



note that checking the unsatisfiability of system(4) is exponential in the number n of events, due to the presence of min and max constraints in(2)-(3)(the general problem is indeed np-complete; see, e.g.). we loose therefore the polynomial-time complexity result of the basic method. still, this enhancement turns out to be useful in practice.
