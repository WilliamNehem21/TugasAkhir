in this paper, experiment platform for cavity flow is built in low-turbulence wind tunnel. based on the measurement of wall static pressure and sound pressure with microphones, the basic flow oscillation characteristics of different type cavity in low speed are studied. the effect of geometry parameters of length to depth ratio and width to depth ratio on cavity flow pattern and noise characteristics is obtained. the results show that in the incompressible flow state, the basic flow pattern of cavities is not affected by flow velocity; length-to-depth ratio of 1 to 12 covers the flow pattern from open to close, and with the length-to-depth ratio increase, the cavity radiation spl increases; with aspect ratio increase, the sound pressure energy of cavity also increase.



cavity flow is a problem often encountered in practical engineering, and is currently a hot aerodynamics research field internationally. there are a variety of complex unsteady cavity flow such as aircraft landing gear, weapons bay, car sunroof and so on. when the flow passes over the cavity, flow oscillation will be produced and radiate noise. the research of cavity flow typically involving complex flow-sound-vortex interference, unsteady character and shear layer instability problems, which has great research significance.
