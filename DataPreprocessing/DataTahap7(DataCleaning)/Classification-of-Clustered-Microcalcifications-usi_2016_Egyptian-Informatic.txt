during training, a set of numeric values of features of mccs corresponding to the mccs category is used to update the weights and biases of the neurons to minimize the output neuron error. however, the best ann structure is not known in advance. the best ann structure depends upon the number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each hidden layer, activation function, learning algorithm and training parameters. to train mlffbp-ann, various training algorithms are available. in the proposed research work, levenberg-marquardt training algorithm is considered to train mlffbp-ann for characterization of mccs as benign or malignant.



svm is used. kernel function converts non-linear classification problem to linear classification problem through mapping the input feature space to higher dimensional feature. after this, an optimal separating hyperplane is used to separate the two classes of the two-class pattern classification problem.



roc analysis is another measure that is used to find the accuracy of classifier related to medical decision. in roc analysis, roc curve is plotted to measure the accuracy of classifier. to plot roc curve, 1-specificity is taken along x-axis while sensitivity is taken along y-axis and at various threshold settings, the curve is generated by plotting the sensitivity against the 1-specificity. the meaning of 1-specificity is false positive rate while sensitivity is true positive rate.
