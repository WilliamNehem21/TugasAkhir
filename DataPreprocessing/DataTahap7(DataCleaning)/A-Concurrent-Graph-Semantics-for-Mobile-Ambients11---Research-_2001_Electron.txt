one of the additional advantages of formulating the reduction semantics of mobile ambients in terms of graph rewriting is the existence of a welldeveloped concurrent semantics, which extends the concurrent semantics of petri nets and which allows to derive graph processes, event structures and prime algebraic domains from graph transformation systems. a concurrent semantics puts an upper limit to the amount of parallelism that is intrinsic in the reductions, and moreover it allows to derive causality links between reduction steps, which can be useful in better understanding the behaviour of a process, e.g. with respect to security and non-interference.



the set of sorts sm contains the elements sp and sa. the first symbol is reminiscent of the word process, since the elements of sort sp can be considered as processes reached by a transition. the second sort, sa, is reminiscent of ambient, and the elements of this sort correspond to names of the calculus.



we open the section recalling the basic tools of the double-pushout(dpo) approach to graph rewriting, as presented in[9,10], and introducing a mild generalisation of its well-understood process semantics. we then provide a graph rewriting system ym for modeling the reduction semantics of mobile ambients. finally, we discuss the concurrent features of the rewriting system ym, as captured by the process semantics, arguing that they enhance the analysis of the causal dependencies among the possible reductions performed by a mobile ambient process, with respect to the original interleaving semantics.
