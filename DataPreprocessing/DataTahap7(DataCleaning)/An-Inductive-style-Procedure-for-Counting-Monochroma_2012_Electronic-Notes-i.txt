in the weak symmetry breaking(wsb) task, each of n+ 1 processes has to decide either 0 or 1 such that not all processes decide the same value. a wsb algorithm should be wait-free, namely, processes are asynchronous(there is no bound on their relative speeds), and potentially faulty(any proper subset may halt without warning). also, it should be comparison based, namely, processes can only use comparison operations(<,>,=) on the values they read from the memory.



two combinatorial approaches for proving the characterization of c were introduced in. both are based on the index lemma 5.2, which is a restatement of corollary 2 in. one approach consists of replacing the inside of k with a very simple complex, where the number of monochromatic simplexes can be counted, and



in this paper we describe in detail the other approach in. we present an inductive style procedure that yields an alternative proof of the characterization of c. the procedure gradually modifies the binary coloring of the subdivision, making sure that each time the binary coloring of a vertex is changed, the binary coloring of other vertexes on the boundary also changes, to preserve the symmetry of the binary coloring. the proof consists in computing how each one of these color changes affects c. in algebraic topology language, the proof consists on computing the degree of the chain maps induced by the simplicial maps produced during the procedure.



consider a chromatic n-pseudomanifold k that has a binary coloring on its vertexes. this section presents a lemma that can be used to count the monochromatic nsimplexes(with respect to the binary coloring) of k, by counting on bd(k). this lemma is the basis for proving theorem 6.1 in section 6.



recall that the index and content of kn are computed with respect to the coloring c defined in definition 5.3. assume kn has a coherent orientation. the lemma 6.2 computes the value of the index at the beginning of the procedure.
