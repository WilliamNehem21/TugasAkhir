modes when different ssp branches are excited. the array has an overlapped impedance bandwidth of 61.9%(3.17 to 6.01 ghz) and an overlapped ar bandwidth of 40.2%(4.01 to 6.03 ghz) in two cp states, and the peak gain is 11.68 dbic.



however, these technologies have limited bandwidth improvement for antennas and may increase the size. to further enhance the performance of the antenna, the proposed design in this paper incorporates spoof surface plasmon polariton(sspp) technology. sspp have generated significant interest in the microwave community. these are electromagnetic(em) excitations that propagate along corrugated metal introducing two chamfered triangles, and one of which is connected to the remaining polygonal shape. the detailed parameters are as follows: l1= 40 mm, d1= 20 mm, d2= 10.7 mm, d3= 9.3 mm, d4= 0.7 mm, h1=



42.6%(3.45 to 4.48 ghz, 4.68 to 5.57 ghz), and a peak gain of 11.68 dbic. the proposed antenna has potential applications in wideband and multi-polarization wireless platforms, increasing overall channel capacity and mitigating polarization mismatch issues in complex channels.
