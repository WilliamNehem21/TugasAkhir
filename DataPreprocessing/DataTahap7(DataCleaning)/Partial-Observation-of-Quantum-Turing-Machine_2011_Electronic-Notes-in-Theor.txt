since a qtm has a unitary evolution, no measurement can be applied until the machine halts. it turns out that it may be useful to observe the machine during the evolution, for instance to know whether the machine is already halted or not. this problem has been solved by proving that one can add a halt qubit that can be measured after each transition, and which switches from 0 to 1 when the machine halts. we introduce a formal and more general framework to describe a partial observation of the machine before and after each transition:



more generally, for any qtm m and any partition k of its internal states,[m]k is well-observed. however, the evolution of the machine depends on the partition k, so the language recognized by the machine and the execution time depend on the partition k. proposition 5.1 states that if k is composed of a unique block, then the evolution of a qtm m and the oqtm[m]k are the same. another example where k is a bipartition is given in lemma 5.2. in that example, for a given qtm m, m and[m]k do not have the same evolution, however in this particular example the computational power of m and[m]k are the same.
