nowadays message transmission on the internet still has to face some problems such as data security, and copyright control. therefore, we need secret communication schemes for transmitting message on the internet. encryption may provide a safe way, which transforms data into a cipher-text via cipher algorithms. however, encryption makes the message unreadable, but making message suspicious enough to attract



there are five secret keys namely r1, r2, v1, v2, t and 1 6 v1, 1 6 v2,(v1+ v2)< 6. the average different values of a fourpixel block are utilized to classify the block as a smooth area or an edge area. the range of average different value is partitioned into two different levels, smooth level and edge level. q-bit of the secret data is embedded in pixels located in the block, where q is decided by the level in which the average different values belong to. in the embedding process of secret data, according to the secret keys v1 and v2, the smooth level will use lower value v1 while the edge level uses greater value v1+ v2. the data embedding process is given in section 3.1.1 and the extracting phase is described in section 3.1.2.



step 5: for each pixel yi in the block, according to level of that block, separated sq= q bits of secret data. for edge blocks, sq divide into two pieces sq1 and sq2, where sq1 contains v1 bits and sq2 contains v2 bits. for smooth blocks, sq divide into one piece sq1, where contains the same v1 bits.



for instance, we extract the embedding example in our nonadaptive algorithm. the stego-pixels are 17 and 237. set kr kc is:{0011,0001,0000,0010,1111,1101,1100,..., 0101, 0100,0110} and has q= v1+ v2= 2+ 2= 4, n= 7.8.0.347(r2009a) program on windows xp platform. we used a series of pseudo-random numbers as the secret data to be embedded into the cover images and also utilized the peak signal-to-noise ratio(psnr) value to evaluate the stego-images quality. the psnr is defined as follows.
