contingencies in power system caused oscillation in rotor angle which leads to power swing. in the case of power swing, distance relay is designed to block the operation to avoid wrong operation of relay. however, this blocking scheme proves to vulnerable as it could block the trip signals when a fault occurs during power swing. hence, it is desired to develop the proper fault detection technique to avoid such circumstances. this paper presents a new fault detection technique during power swing based on s-transform. to ascertain validity of the proposed scheme, it was verified with the ieee 14 bus test system and simulations results show that the proposed technique can detect fault occurring during power swing.



all of the techniques which have been reported are not able to operate properly during high resistance faults and/or symmetrical fault. in order to overcome such drawbacks, the new fault detection technique during power swing based on s-transform features of bus voltage has been proposed. in order to ascertain validity of the proposed scheme, evaluation and simulation are conducted under ieee 14 bus test system.



a new fault detection technique for the distance relay during power swing has been presented in this paper. it make use of the utilization of s-transform processing tool to process the distance relay input signals based on bus voltage to detect fault occurs during power swing. this technique is proven to detect different type of fault with different value of fault resistance.
