implemented with super coding(sc) and successive interference cancellation(sic) with filters at the transceiver of noma efficiently utilize the spectrum with no loss. it allows several users to multiplex on the identical channel, to access the spectrum simultaneously in the power domain. therefore, sus can utilize the spectrum bot at the presence and absence of pus which increase the throughput of the system. in this work, we combine noma into matched filter detection technique to acquire a smarter spectrum allocation. to the best of my knowledge noma based cr is not implemented so far. further, several parameters like pd, pfa, ber vs snr and psd are discussed to analyse the performance of the proposed system.



nominal 5g and iot communication rates. the results are analyzed to assess the performance of the proposed systems from different perspectives. in this work matched filter spectrum detectior is designed and evaluated. the pd) and pfa at several snr values are studeied. it is observed that the proposed technique efficiently detect the unsed spectrum. the simulation results shows a improve detection at 25 db snr.
