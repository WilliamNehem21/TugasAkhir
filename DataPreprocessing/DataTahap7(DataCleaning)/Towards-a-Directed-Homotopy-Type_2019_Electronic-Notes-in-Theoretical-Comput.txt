such results present an illuminating perspective on the theory of higher groupoids. this theory is, to some extent, already very well understood by topologists who have studied concrete models of it for the better part of a century. however, if one thinks of the theory of higher groupoids as being a theory of(reversible) paths, then one might wonder whether there is also a type theory which describes a theory of irreversible, or directed, paths. one might hope that such a type theory would shed light on the less well understood theories of higher categories and directed spaces. both of these theories have a notion of directed paths at their heart, and for both of these theories, there are many competing concrete models. thus, having a synthetic theory of directed paths might shed light on this situation.
