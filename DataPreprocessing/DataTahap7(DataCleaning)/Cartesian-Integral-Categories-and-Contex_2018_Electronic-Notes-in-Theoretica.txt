the notion of a cartesian integral category is introduced and motivated. morally, this notion should be the cokleisli category of a(tensor) integral category. however, unfortunately, integral categories, as introduced, do not in general have enough structure for this to be true. the objective of this paper is then to find an appropriate(tensor) integral structure on a coalgebra modality which actually produces as its cokleisli category a cartesian integral category. the main theorem of this paper is that any contextual integral category with a pseudo-linearizing transformation has its coklleisli category a cartesian integral category. the result seems to be quite general as, in particular, it covers all example in which the linear maps arise from a differential.



definition 3.1 a left additive category[5, definition 1.1.1] is a category such that each hom-set is a commutative monoid, with addition+ and zero 0, such that composition on the left preserves the additive structure, that is f(g+ h)= fg+ fh and f 0= 0. a map h in a left additive category is additive if composition on the right by h preserves the additive structure, that is(f+ g)h= fh+ gh and 0h= 0.



every cartesian differential category[5, definition 2.1.1] admits a system of linear maps[3, proposition 4.1.3] given by the maps which are linear in the cartesian differential category sense[5, definition 2.2.1]. the above three examples of systems of linear maps are all examples of this.



we now turn our attention towards obtaining cartesian integral categories as cokleisli categories of contextual integral categories(theorem 7.6). in this section we discuss simple slices of cokleisli categories and provide a system of linear maps cokleisli categories of coalgebra modalities.
