in this paper we work in a type theory with dependent types, natural numbers, inductive types and guarded recursion. the presentation of the paper will be informal, but the results of the paper can be formalised in gdtt as presented in. we start by recalling the core of this type theory(as described in), introducing further constructions later on as needed.



in the topos of trees model, the d modality is interpreted as dx(0)= 1 and dx(n+ 1)= x(n), i.e., from the logical point of view, the d modality delays evaluation of a proposition by one time step. for example, if 0 is the constantly empty presheaf(corresponding to a false proposition), then dn0 is the proposition that appears true for the first n computation steps and is falsified after n+ 1 steps.
