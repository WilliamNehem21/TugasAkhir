questions(i) and(ii) are answered by using theorem 3.1 and corollary 3.3 for loops with a potentially non-deterministic body, but which behaves deterministically on the variables that occur in the loop guard. questions(iii) and(iv) are answered using a technique based on mathematical induction, but only for loops of form



proof. because this is a theorem about a formula whose instances are formulas, then a system of formal derivation of predicates will be used to ensure a correct result. the reader should understand the following demonstration as a family of demonstrations(one for each instance of predicates inv, nbg, and dombg), which results from applying each of the following derivations in the order they are presented. the rules of inference that are used in this work are those of the calculative logic(original of) presented in the book of gries.
