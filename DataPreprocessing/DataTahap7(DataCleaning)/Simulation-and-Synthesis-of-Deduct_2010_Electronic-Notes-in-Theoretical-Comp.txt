into a set of inference rules, which forms a sound and complete deduction calculus for the logic. ideally we also want to be able to guarantee termination if the logic is decidable. automated synthesis of calculi is a very challenging problem and in general it is of course not possible to turn every specification of a logic into a sound, complete and terminating deduction calculus. it is however possible to solve the problem for a large number of logics.



the main insight allowing inference rules to be extracted from the clausal form is the following. hyperresolution on range-restricted clauses has the property that all positive parent clauses are ground clauses and all conclusions are ground clauses. this allows the negative, non-ground parent clause of a hyperresolution inference step to be interpreted as an inference rule i of the ground calculus. the positive, ground parent clauses of a hyperresolution inference step represent the premises of the rule i, and the conclusions represent the conclusions of the rule. more details can be found in[6,22,24].



in first-order resolution an important notion is redundancy elimination. this notion carries over to other calculi leading to three forms of redundancy: redundant formulae, redundant rule applications and notably redundant inference rules. this means that reasoning modulo redundancy can be formalised also for modal deduction calculi leading to stronger results and better systems.



of different deduction approaches. examples of empirical studies undertaken with(m)spass following essentially this approach can be found in[5,16]. such experiments allow more meaningful comparisons of different calculi, or different styles of deduction, than experiments based on the comparisons of independently implemented provers[12,16].
