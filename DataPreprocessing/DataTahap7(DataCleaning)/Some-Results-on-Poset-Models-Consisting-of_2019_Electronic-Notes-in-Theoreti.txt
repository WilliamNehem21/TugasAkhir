given a topological space x, the set q(x) of all nonempty saturated compact subsets of x is a poset with respect to the reverse inclusion order. the posets of the form q(x) play important roles in several aspects of domain theory. in this paper, we investigate some further properties of such posets, in particular their links to the dcpo models of t1 topological spaces.



it is well known that every sober space is well-filtered. but there exists a wellfiltered t1 space which is non-sober. there are also dcpos whose scott spaces are well-filtered but non-sober(see,[4, example 2.6.1],). there are even coherent well-filtered spaces which are non-sober.
