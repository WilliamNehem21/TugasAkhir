any type can be truncated to a proposition by freely adding paths. this is the propositional truncation(or(-1)-truncation) which can be expressed as a higher inductive type(hit). the type constructor _ takes a type a as a parameter; the point constructor|_| coerces terms of type a to terms in the truncation; and the path constructor ident identifies any two points in the truncation, making it a proposition. we must do this as a postulate as agda does not yet support hits:



as christensen explains, a type u is rarely the base of a univalent fibration. yet, in that same paper, christensen characterizes a class of types that is always the base of univalent fibrations. we explain this point and exploit it to build a custom univalent subuniverse in the next section.
