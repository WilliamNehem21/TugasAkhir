the cloud environment provides different services at various levels to support the organizational process. the cost-effectiveness of cloud services has helped organizations in maintaining their data at the least cost. unlike traditional data management, organizations do not need to maintain their data servers which claim higher costs from the organizations which cannot be offered by all the units. to support such organizations in maintaining their data at the least cost, the cloud service providers provide several services at various levels like presentation, network, and data layers. this has encouraged organizations to maintain their data at the least cost while allowing users to access his/her data through different services.



the preprocessing algorithm finds the features and performs noise removal from the access trace data set. additionally, the method identifies and adds the list of routes to reach the source and destination to the set. the features extracted and preprocessed traces have been used to perform latency approximation.



cloud computing has gained immense popularity as a storage and data access solution, facilitated by the internet and remote servers. instead of owning physical resources, clients lease them from third-party providers. user management and key management are crucial aspects in cloud computing, encompassing tasks such as user setup, key generation, expiration, and destruction. the security of data is a significant timal service is selected and data has been encrypted. encrypted data has been forwarded through the selected route. the proposed approach improves the performance of different qos factors with reduced latency. as an extension of this work, multi-key homomorphic encryption techniques can be implemented to further increase secrecy and address cloud security challenges.
