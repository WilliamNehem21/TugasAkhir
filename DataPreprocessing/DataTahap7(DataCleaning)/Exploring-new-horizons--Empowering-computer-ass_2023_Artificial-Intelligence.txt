the field of computer-assisted drug design(cadd) has seen remarkable progress and is constantly evolving. cadd techniques can be broadly classified as structure-based drug design(sbdd) and ligand-based drug design(lbdd), based on the information and availability of protein/target and ligand structures, respectively. the term artificial intelligence was introduced by john mccarthy in 1956, who defined it as the field dedicated to the creation of intelligent machines. essentially, ai encompasses the capacity of machines to carry



these algorithms can be employed using various approaches to address the challenges posed by limited data. in this review, we show the application of fsl in the field of drug discovery, providing examples using qsar and other methodologies. by highlighting these examples, we hope that researchers will be encouraged to explore and utilize fsl for modeling datasets with scarce resources.



few-shot learning(fsl) can be employed in various types of data for supervised learning problems. these include:(i) classification: this type of fsl approach, known as n-way-k-shot, involves considering n from the number of classes, and k is the number of examples. alternatively, one-shot learning(osl) is employed when only one example is available, while zero-shot learning(zsl) is applied when zero examples are provided[33,34];(ii) regression: fsl can also be applied to regression tasks, where the goal is to estimate a function based on only a few input-output example pairs sampled from that function. in this scenario, the output represents the observed value of the dependent variable, while the input records the observed value of the independent variable[25,35]. furthermore, fsl can be used in semior unsupervised learning, using the reinforcement learning to weight orient the prior knowledge and prediction between the tasks[36,37].



the three methodologies differ in terms of the type of data utilized in the training set. in the case of augmenting data using the sample of the training set, additional samples are generated by applying variations to the existing data. when augmenting data using weakly or unlabeled data sets, the augmentation process involves incorporating weakly or unlabeled samples from large data sets. lastly, for augmenting samples using similar data sets, aggregation techniques are employed to combine similar samples from large data sets, which are commonly utilized in generative neural networks, in this approach, the large data should be labeled, different from weakly or unlabeled data.

one popular approach in representation learning is to use deep neural networks(dnns), such as graph convolutional neural networks(gcns), to learn the representations. these networks are trained on large-scale datasets to capture the inherent structure and patterns in the data. the learned representation can then be used for fsl tasks by leveraging the similarity or distance between samples in the embedding space[41,44].
