neural network pruning methods aim to remove redundant weights in a dense model. according to the pruning granularity, these methods can be categorized into either weight pruning or channel pruning. in weight pruning, individual weights are zeroed out, leaving a sparse set of weight tensors. weight pruning can significantly reduce the model size, but it also introduces irregular memory access, leading to very limited or even negative speedups on general-purpose hardware(e.g. cpu, gpu). differing from weight pruning, channel pruning methods remove entire channels to compress the model. since channel pruning only changes the dimension of weight tensors, the pruned model still adopts a dense format, which is well-suited to high rank of feature maps, then prunes the least important channels. however, liu et al. find that the pruned network can achieve the same accuracy no matter it inherits the weights in the original network or not. this study inspires us that the essence of channel pruning lies in finding optimal channel numbers in each layer, instead of selecting unimportant channels based on rule-of-thumb designs. following that idea, lin et al. use artificial bee colony algorithm to search optimal pruned network structure. however, like many conventional channel pruning methods, lin et al. use the reduced flops and parameter numbers to measure the pruning quality, the latency speedup of pruned model cannot be guaranteed.



in this paper, we propose a latency-aware automatic channel pruning(lacp) method. differing from conventional methods, we take channel pruning in an automatic manner. our method aims to search the optimal pruned network structure, i.e., the channel number in convolutional layers, instead of selecting important channels. an intuitive challenge in finding optimal network structure is that it is impractical to exhaustively searching all the possible combinations of pruned network structures. to make the algorithm feasible, effective shrinkage on search space is necessary. we first analyze the inference latency of pruned convolutional layers on gpu. results show that the inference latency of convolutional layers presents a staircase pattern with the number of channels, which means the inference latency of a convolutional layer changes suddenly at certain channel number intervals. based on this observation, we greatly shrink the search space of pruned structures. then we apply an evolutional procedure



the rest of this paper is organized as follows. section 2 reviews related works. section 3 presents the proposed latency-aware automatic channel pruning method in detail. section 4, show the experimental results and analysis. finally, we draw the paper to a conclusion in section 5.



deep neural networks are usually over-parameterized[15,16], leading to huge storage and computation cost. there are extensive studies on compressing and accelerating neural networks. we classify current related research works into two major types: network pruning methods and neural architecture search(nas) methods.



pruning methods reduce the storage and computation cost by removing unimportant weights from the origin network. existing pruning algorithms can be categorized into weight pruning and channel pruning. in weight pruning, individual weights are zeroed out. lecun et al.



parameters and then efficiently optimized model parameters and architecture parameters together via gradient descent. most prior nas based pruning methods are implemented in a bottom-up and layer-by-layer manner. in contrast, our work mainly focuses on the optimal channel number of each layer.



gies to remove unimportant channels. the algorithm aims to find a thinner network structure than the unpruned model, meanwhile, keeping a comparable accuracy. we adopt an evolutionary algorithm to achieve the goal of our search algorithm. a certain number of candidate network structures make up a population, the candidate



in this section, we describe the detailed implementation of our lacp method. as algorithm 1 shows, our method adopts evolutionary search as the overall framework. in the beginning, the initial population is randomly generated from the search space. each sample in the population



we use two kinds of models in our experiments: vgg and resnet. vgg is a single-path network. the 16-layer model is adopted for compression. resnet consists of a series of blocks, and there is a shortcut between two adjacent blocks. for dimensional matching in the pruned network, the last convolutional layer in each block will not be pruned. two different depths of resnet are adopted, including resnet18 and resnet34.



for each group of experiments, we report test accuracy, the reduction of network inference latency, the reduction of flops, the reduction of parameter numbers, and the reduction of channel numbers as the performance metrics. we use the pytorch expansion package thop to count the flops and parameter numbers of network. to measure inference latency of network, we run the model 10 times for gpu warm up, then run the model 300 times with input batch size 128, and take the average inference time.



for each pre-trained model used in our experiments, we train it with 200 epochs using stochastic gradient descent with momentum 0.9, and the batch size is set to 128, the initial learning rate is set to 0.1, which decays by 10 every 50 epochs. the weight decay is set to 1e-4.



we conduct our experiments on cifar-10, cifar-100 and tinyimagenet datasets with vgg and resnet models. to search for optimal pruned network structures, we set the number of search cycles to 10 and the population size is 30, so lacp searches 300 pruned network structures in the whole process. in each population, the numbers of new pruned network structures that generated from mutation and crossovers are both set to 15. in the end, we fine-tune the best pruned network structure for 200 epochs with a learning rate of 0.1, which is divided by 10 every 50 epochs. the weight decay is set to 1e-4. all algorithms use the same pre-trained model, and the number of fine-tuning epoch is set to 200. for a fair comparison with abcpruner, we set its maximum searching number of pruned network structures to the same 300.



structure automatically. by analyzing the inference latency of pruned networks, we indicate that neither flops nor the number of parameters can accurately represent the real inference acceleration. besides, we analyze the execution mechanism of convolutional layers on gpu. results show that the inference latency of convolutional layers presents a staircase pattern with different number of channels. based on this observation, we greatly shrink the combinations of network structure,



enabling efficient search of low-latency and accurate pruned network. we conduct extensive evaluations to compare our method with existing studies on public datasets, and report the real latency metric. experimental results show that our method can achieve better inference acceleration, while maintaining higher accuracy.



we shrink the search space of pruned network structure through the analysis of the gpu tail effect. however, our analysis is based on empirical profiling. a more thorough and general investigation of the gpu tail effect could be helpful. besides, how to generalize our method to different hardware platforms is also worth studying in future work.
