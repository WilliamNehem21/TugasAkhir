in this context, the semantics in cpm of a term m is a completely positive map from vectors of cm to vectors of cn for some natural numbers m and n. note that a completely positive map in this setting is the same as a(partial) stochastic map from[0, 1]m to[0, 1]n. the result presented in specializes to this case and the semantics is fully abstract.



the naive idea to develop a full and complete semantics for the probabilistic linear lambda-calculus is the following. consider a category whose objects are polytopes and whose maps are cpm maps sending polytopes into polytopes. then interpret the language in this category.
