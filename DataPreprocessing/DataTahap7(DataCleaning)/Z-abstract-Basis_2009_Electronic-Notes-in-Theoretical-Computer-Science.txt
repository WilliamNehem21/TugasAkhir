in this paper, the notion of a z-abstract basis is defined and its properties are discussed. it is proved that for a union-complete subset system, the basis of a z-continuous poset, with the restricted z-relation, is a z-abstract basis and the rounded z-ideal completion of the z-abstract basis is isomorphic to the z-continuous poset. conversely, the rounded z-ideal completion of a z-abstract basis is a z-continuous poset.



studied z-continuous posets, and this research was carried on by p. venugopalan in. z-subset system is a generalization of directed set system. since the concept was defined, many theorems in domain theory have been given the corresponding conclusions with respect to z-subset system. as is known to the mathematicians in domain theory, abstract basis is an important concept because of its relation to continuous posets. can the corresponding concept of abstract basis related to z-subset system been defined? how is its
