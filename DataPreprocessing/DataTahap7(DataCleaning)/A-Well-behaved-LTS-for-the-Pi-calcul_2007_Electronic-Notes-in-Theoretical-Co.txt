the pi-calculus and its many variations have received much attention in the literature. we discuss the standard early labelled transition system(lts) and outline an approach which decomposes the system into two components, one of which is presented in detail. the advantages of using the decomposition include a more complete understanding of the treatment of bound outputs in pi as well as an lts which is more robust with respect to the addition and removal of language features. the present paper serves as an overview of some of the techniques involved and some of the goals of the ongoing work.



we use the syntactic convention of a, b for name constants, k, l for terms of name type, x, y for variables(including name variables), p, q for terms of process type, x, y for variables of function type. type contexts are finite maps from variables to types. we shall consider only typed terms.
