proof. consider(mk+ i, nl+ j)k,l. it is clear that[mk+ i]k=[m]ki and also that[nl+ j]l=[n]lj. then the last pair in the standard k, l-encoding will be(i, j), and the preceding symbols will just be the k, l-encoding of(m, n). that is,(mk+ i, nl+ j)k,l=(m, n)k,l(i, j), as desired. 2



indeed we might have guessed this from our definition of the automata operating on pairs of digit representations. if we look at the pairs of red and black digits, they give the pairs in the encoding of that position in the array. at the position(2, 3)2,2=(1, 1)(0, 1)=(0, 0)(1, 1)(0, 1), highlighted in bold, we indeed get the thirteenth element of the stream and 001101= 2.



we have described how to interpret wvk,l(w,...,w). a: w is to be interpreted as the grid ord(a: lin(w)). as a result of these definitions and the fact that they have isomorphic generating grammars, every weave term is the z-ordering of a zip term. this means weave specifications will have the same existence and uniqueness conditions on their solutions as their related zip specifications.



has the unique solution given by the 2,2-automatic array from section 2.5. as a result of the fact that all weave terms are the z-ordering of a zip term, we can translate between the two formats easily. this gives the following theorem immediately.
