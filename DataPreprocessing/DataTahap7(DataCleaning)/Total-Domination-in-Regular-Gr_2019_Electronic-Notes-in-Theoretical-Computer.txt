analysis of a local algorithm, as described in their paper.(again, the previous sentence would hold for a host of parameters other than total domination.) in this paper, this result by hoppen and wormald plays a fundamental role as the tool that allows us to transfer a result obtained in the random graph context(theorem 1.2) to the large-girth context(theorem 1.1).



pairings at each round, involving at most 2d vertices. to verify(ii), we first compute e[x(t+ 1) x(t) ht] for each variable x. in fact, the conditional expectations in our process may be computed based on gt, rather than in the full history ht. we are able to prove that
