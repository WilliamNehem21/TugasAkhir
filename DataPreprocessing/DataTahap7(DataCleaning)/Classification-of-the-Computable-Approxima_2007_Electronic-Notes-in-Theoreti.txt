in this section we will give the precise definitions of the main notions discussed in this paper. at firs the most general notion of(f, e, d)-effective computability is defined. then we explain, how this notion can be reduced to a simpler notion of f-effective computability in two steps. therefore, it suffices to investigate only the f-effective computability later on.



another natural restriction to the modulus and distance function is that they should be nondecreasing. thus, we consider only the unbounded nondecreasing modulus function e and distance function d in this paper. even under this restriction, an(e, d)-divergence degree v can still be a non-monotonic function. however, because we are interested only in the bounding function f which bounds the function v, we assume also that the function f is also nondecreasing when we discuss the(f, e, d)-effective computability of real numbers.
