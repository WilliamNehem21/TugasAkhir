here the square brackets on the left refer to the coproduct of fh and fv in h/mon(a) and those on the right to h+ v in funf(a). the verification uses the universal property of the free monad on h+ v and is not difficult. the fact that(20) holds follows from the same diagram.



finally, the rational monad rh and the monad th are both characterized by universal properties; rh is the free iterative monad and th the free completely iterative one. it remains to be seen whether ch can be characterized by some universal property, too. unfortunately, context-free trees cannot serve as a guiding example in this respect as no universal property of them is known.
