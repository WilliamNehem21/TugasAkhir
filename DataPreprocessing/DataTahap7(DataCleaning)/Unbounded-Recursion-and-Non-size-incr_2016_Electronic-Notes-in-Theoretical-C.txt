type systems for the non-size-increasing polynomial time functions have been extensively studied, see e.g.. such systems constitute an alternative to predicative recursion which rules out not only recursive definitions leading to exponential growth, but also natural algorithms computing non-size-increasing functions.



where the leftmost inclusion is strict because sbs0 and sbs1 are not regressive. using the encoding technique of regressive machines introduced in[9, section 6], one can show that r(p)= s(p), but it does not seem possible that such technique can be applied to show that r(sbs0, sbs1)= s(sbs0, sbs1). a possible continuation of this work could address such question as well as the search of function algebras for the regressive and non-size-increasing functions of well-known complexity classes.
