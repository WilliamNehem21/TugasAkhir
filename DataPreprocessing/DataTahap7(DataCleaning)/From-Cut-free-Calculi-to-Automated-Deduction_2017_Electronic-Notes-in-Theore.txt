here we consider weaker variants of the contraction rule, the so-called bounded contraction rules, which for a fixed k, contract k+1 copies of a formula into k copies. these rules are special cases of knotted rules and play an important role, e.g., in finite-valued lukasiewic logics or varieties of residuated lattices.





we now move in the direction of proposing a notion of focusing for systems with bounded contractions. we start by analyzing the possible orderings of applications of rules. the goal is to organize proofs in order to reduce the non determinism, as in.



we can hence separate the proof steps into two phases. in the negative phase all negative rules are applied eagerly until the left context has only atomic or negative formulas and the succedent formula is positive or atomic. when this process terminates, we may possibly apply k a number of times and the positive phase starts by choosing a negative formula on the left or a positive one on the right. the focusing persists until a positive formula appears on the left context or a negative one appears in the succedent, and we come back to the negative phase.





there are a number of ways of continuing this work. the first goal is to determine the exact complexity of flew plus bounded contractions. that is, knowing that checking validity in such systems is pspace-hard, theorem 4.2 implies that such complexity can be either pspace-complete or exptime-complete.



also, all the results presented in this paper strongly rely on the fact that the base logical system allows weakening. without it, the situation is more complicated. for example, there is no more a clear separation between formulas behaving classically or linearly, and hence the notion of lazy splitting has to be completely reformulated.
