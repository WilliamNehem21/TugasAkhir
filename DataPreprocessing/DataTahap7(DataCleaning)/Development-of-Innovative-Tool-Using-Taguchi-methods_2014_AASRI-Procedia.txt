the software for innovative tool using taguchi-methods is developed and evaluated. there are two trials in the innovative tool using taguchi-methods; first trial is accomplished for selecting important control factors and its optimum region, and second trial decides the optimum combination of the control factors by more detail trial using only important control factors. the optimum condition regarding cooling system for cutting was investigated for evaluating this innovation tool in the experiment. it is concluded from the result that(1) innovative tool using the taguchi-methods was useful for development with short-term and lower cost, and(2) this tool could quickly and exactly decide the optimum cooling condition.



levers of all control factors, then important control factors and meaningless control factors were sorted with the several comments for the second trial. at that time, maximum, intermediate and minimum values for each lever of the each control factor should used for pursuit of all possibilities. second trial decides the optimum combination of the control factors by more detail trial using only important control factors. the second trial is tried for getting the best combination using the optimum level of each control factor. the optimum condition regarding cooling system for cutting was investigated for evaluating this innovation tool in the experiment.
