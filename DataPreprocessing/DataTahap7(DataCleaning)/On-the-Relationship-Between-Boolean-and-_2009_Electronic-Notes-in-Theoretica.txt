an interesting property of the dnf fuzzification is how it relates to the probability of a one occuring at a given time in a given cell. since the fuzzy values are in the range[0, 1], we can interpret them as probabilities, i.e., we can let a fuzzy value xt denote the probability that a cell yi of a boolean ca assumes value 1 at time



we will first need some notation. given a random variable z, let e(z) denote its expected value. note that when z is a binary random variable, then e(z) is the probability p(z= 1). essentially, we show that applying the fuzzification f of g to the expected values of a cell yi and its 2q neighbouring cells, we obtain the expected value of g[yi], the cell at the next time step.



in this section, we consider another property of boolean cellular automata extensively studied in the literature: additivity(e.g., see[8,17,26]). we continue the investigation of the link between boolean and fuzzy ca showing a connection between additivity and a new fuzzy property that we call self-oscillation. in doing so we characterize the class of self-oscillating fuzzy ca. although for simplicity we are considering one dimensional cas, note that the results of this section hold for any dimension.



to begin we note that functions converging to either zero or one can never be self-oscillating since values are, respectively, either always greater than or always less than the point of convergence. we will now prove this lemma by induction on n, the the number of variables in f, i.e., on the size of the neighborhood.
