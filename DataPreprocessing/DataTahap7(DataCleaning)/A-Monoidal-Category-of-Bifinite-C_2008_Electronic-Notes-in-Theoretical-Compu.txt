the tensor product of two monics in c may not be monic any more. furthermore, the tensor product behaves quite differently in distinct subcategories of c. for example, in the category ie, the tensor product of two extensional chu spaces remains to be extensional, and from proposition 2.2, we know that the tensor product of two monics is still a monic. however, in the category b tensor product of two biextensional chu spaces may not remain biextensional, and this can be shown by the fact that the attribute set of the tensor product may be empty, as given in the next example.
