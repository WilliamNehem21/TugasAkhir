rule-based approaches are useful when modelling synthetic biology. they alleviate the quantitative combinatorial explosion that results from molecular entities existing under multiple different conditions(for example, states of phosphorylation). they are inherently flexible in nature; the association of different independent rule sets implicitly generates different overall systems, thus allowing modular development of subsystems and their composition into a conjoined whole. they are also fully capable of accommodating complex regulatory structures and combinatorial networks, and of doing so without ever needing to fully enumerate the species that a set of rules might produce(thus greatly reducing computational complexity).





the kappa model created during the course of the project was a representation of the system described above. it was composed of 145 rules detailing the function of sixteen biobrick parts, not including those responsible for creation of the light sensors(assumed to be constitutively expressed) and the proteins associated with the various pathways. these rules could be decomposed into seven constituent modules: the core repressilator(itself a combination of three distinct devices), three light sensing pathways, and similarly three light emitting pathways. the modular nature of the model is described in greater detail in section 4 below.



manner, thus aiding comprehension of the underlying biology, and can be easily re-used both in different contexts within a model and across multiple different models. the associated biobrick modelling framework is well-suited to working with individual parts and this can only improve in the future with the development of dedicated support tools. the modularity of the approach also makes it easy to apply flexible iterative development methodologies to the problem, easing not only the complexity of the model but also the complexity of the modelling process as well.
