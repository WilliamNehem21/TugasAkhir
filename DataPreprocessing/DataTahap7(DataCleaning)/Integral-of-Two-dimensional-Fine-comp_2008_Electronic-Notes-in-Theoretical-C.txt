j(x, n) satisfies the axioms of the effective uniformity(cf.). we call the topology generated by i(n, k) the fine topology and put prefix fineto such notions. we put no prefix to notions which are defined by means of euclidean topology.



in the proof of proposition 3.1 in, the crucial properties are those of lemma 2.1, whose two-dimensional version is lemma 3.2, and the fact that the complement of a finite(disjoint) union of fundamental dyadic intervals can be represented as a finite disjoint union of fundamental dyadic intervals. a similar fact also holds for fundamental dyadic rectangles. so, we can prove the following proposition.
