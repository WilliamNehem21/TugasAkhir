definition 2.2 let c be an euler diagram and define the euler graph of c to be the edge-labelled directed plane multigraph g(c) whose vertices are the points of intersection 4 in proj(c) and whose edges are the curve segments in proj(c). if a curve segment is a simple closed curve, then arbitrarily choose a point on the curve to be a vertex.



{1, 2,..., n} from which all rays intersect each curve exactly once. the following generalization of results by bultena et al. establishes a connection between the euler dual and ray monotonicity; they form the basis for our drawing algorithm.



it so that the regions have a specified area. our solution works for all euler diagrams that have a region representing the intersection of all curves and for all weight functions. our method also yields heuristic solutions for many cases where there is no region of common intersection.
