digital city emerge with the development of internet and computer technology. the major functionality of digital city is providing information service for city residents. one of the valuable services in digital city is providing the city public travel route information. normally, a medium city has about one hundred public travel routes and one thousand stations. how to select proper travel route and save travel time is the problem that city residents have to consider.



traffic status in city changes with time. but, there's regularity in traffic status change. for example, during rush hour of working days, traffic flow on city main road is very big and traffic jam is easy to happen. in order to provide convenient and time-saving travel route solution for traveler, while designing travel route system, the regularity of traffic status change should be considered.



the data source of public traffic transfer system is the bus route and station information in city public traffic system. according to start and target station, the public traffic transfer algorithm will output all possible transfer solutions between two stations. then, these transfer solutions are sorted according to time or distance.



actual public traffic route is very easy to be affected by the traffic status of city road. when choosing travel route, people always want to avoid the section of road which is in bad traffic status. therefore, the public traffic transfer algorithm need to predict the traffic status of the route of bus transfer solution at specified time. in this paper, the traffic status prediction is achieved through data mining of traffic status history statistics data.



each bus route in city has a unique number. the different directions of same route have different numbers. the reason is as follows. first, some streets in city are one-way street. second, the stations on different directions of same bus route are not fully identical. third, start and end time of different directions of same route are different. this number is the unique identifier of bus route.



the route relation matrix only represents the relation of two bus routes. it divides the relation of bus routes into two categories: intersections existing and intersections not existing. the n-th power of matrix represents whether two routes can be reached via n times transfer, also records the number of transfer solutions between two routes via different intermediate routes. in the real bus routes, two routes may have multiple intersections.



formula 1 defines the necessary condition of changing from route a to b via b. but it's not sufficient condition. whether the actual transfer solution is feasible or not is also determined by following conditions: position of start station, position of route intersection and position of target station. even a feasible transfer solution existing, since the route has direction, the solution is only feasible for partial stations on route.



in order to recommend the optimal transfer solution, we need to know the consideration of traveler when selecting the travel route. according to the survey of top considerations of traveler while selecting public traffic route in hefei city, 2002, 38.24% of travelers select minimum times of transfer as the top consideration, 32.53% of travelers select minimum travel time, 20.51% of travelers select shortest distance, 8.71% of travelers select minimum travel expense.



according the above survey, while selecting travel route, the major considerations of traveler are number of transfer and travel time. the route transfer algorithm between two stations in previous section can insure the solutions with less times of transfer will be obtained earlier than the solutions with more times of transfer. therefore, the algorithm can insure the optimal solution of transfer times.



the second consideration of traveler for transfer solution is time. the travel time of a transfer solution is very easy to be affected by the road traffic status. therefore, the best method of saving travel time is selecting the transfer route which excludes the section of road in bad traffic status.



in this paper, firstly, the history data of city traffic status is reorganized and analyzed. then, through data mining of the traffic history data, the prediction to traffic status of some areas in city is present. the traffic status prediction is used as reference when selecting bus transfer solution.



data cube is used to modeling and inspecting the data in database in multi dimensional way. when evaluating the transfer solutions, the most useful traffic information data is the traffic status of some road sections at particular moment. therefore, the data cube is built according to following rules.



according to above definition of data cube, the road section traffic status information of given time period in some day of a week can be acquired. for example, in data cube, the history data of vehicle speed information in 8:00-8:30 time period of monday can be analyzed. if 80% of all history vehicle speed records are lower than 5 kilometers per hour, then, it can be predicted, traffic jam is very likely to happen in this time period.



according to experience, rollup operation can be performed on data cube. through dimension conflation to aggregate on the data cube. for example, according to common knowledge, there's big difference between the traffic status of work day and weekend. but the difference of traffic status between different workdays is small. therefore, conflation can be performed on the date dimension. for statistics, date is divided into two categories work day and weekend.



by predicting the traffic status of road section contained tin transfer solution, the road section which is easy to be jammed can be avoided while selecting travel route. this is helpful for guiding traveler to select proper bus travel route. for example, there are two transfer solutions a and b acquired through the route transfer algorithm. by analyzing the road sections contained in solution a through data cube, 70% of vehicle speed record is lower than 10 kilometers per hour. for solution b, 75% of all vehicle speed history record is between 10 kilometer per hour and 20 kilometer per hour. it means that the traffic status of road sections in b is better than a at this time, therefore, recommend b solution to traveler.



route relation matrix m is used to describe the relation between routes in public traffic system. by matrix calculation, the transfer relation between bus routes can be acquired. the bus transfer algorithm between two stations present in this paper can be used to get all feasible transfer solutions between two stations.
