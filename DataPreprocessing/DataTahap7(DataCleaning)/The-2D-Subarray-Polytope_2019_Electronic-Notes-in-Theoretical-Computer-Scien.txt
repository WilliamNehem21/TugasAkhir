a slightly more general version of the problem has also been studied under a polyhedral approach in and in. in the former, the authors analyze new lower bounds on the optimal cover size based on the fractional solution of the linear programming relaxation of the proposed formulation. the latter discusses two integer programming models for the rectangle cover of a convex polygon.



although sub-cubic, these algorithms may not be of practical use when m and n are close to real-sized images. furthermore, in a column generation environment we need not solve the column generation problem to optimality, since a column with a negative reduced cost suffices to continue with the procedure. hence, fast heuristics may be useful for this problem and, in particular, linear programmingbased heuristics(e.g., rounding heuristics) may be of interest. due to these facts, we are interested in an integer-programming based approach for the maximum subarray problem for d= 2.



the associated polytope may be regarded as a two-dimensional version of the full interval vectors polytope, i.e., the convex hull of vectors in{0, 1}n having consecutive ones. the corresponding polytope has been studied in and the results therein have inspired some of the results in the current work.
