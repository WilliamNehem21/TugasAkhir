termination is one of the most important properties of any kind of rewriting. for conditional systems, it is not sufficient to only show well-foundedness of the rewrite relation, but it also has to be ensured that evaluation of the conditions terminates. these properties are captured by the notion of operational termination. in this work, we show that operational termination for the class of conditional rewrite systems discussed above can be reduced to(regular) termination of unconditional systems using a syntactic transformation.



the present paper shows that operational termination of a conditional system can be reduced to termination of an unconditional system using a syntactic transformation. this transformation is similar to the transformation used for ordinary conditional rewriting, see, e.g.,[13, definition 7.2.48]. powerful methods based on dependency pairs for showing termination of unconditional systems are presented in, and in combination with the current paper these methods can be used for showing operational termination of ccess as well.



this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, the rewrite relation is defined. in section 3, we formally define the notion of operational termination and show that termination and operational termination coincide for unconditional systems. section 4 introduces a transformation from conditional systems into unconditional ones. we show that termination of the transformed system implies operational termination of the original system. the omitted proofs may be found in the full version of this paper, and contains several nontrivial conditional systems whose operational termination can be shown by applying the transformation presented in this paper and using the termination techniques presented in.
