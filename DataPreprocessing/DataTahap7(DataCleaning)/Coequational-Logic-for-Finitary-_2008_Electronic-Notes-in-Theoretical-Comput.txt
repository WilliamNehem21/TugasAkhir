induction step from k to k+ 1. we assume that there is a tree tk such that the statements(i)k to(v)k hold. we then prove that these statements also hold for k+ 1 instead of k, referred to as(i)k+1 to(v)k+1.



the first direction of theorem 4.7(completeness) was easily proven: nothing else but the existence of first representative trees was needed, which is guaranteed for every finitary functor. but for the other way round(soundness) we needed some more effort, especially in propositions 4.1 and 4.6, which are the core of the simpler logic: they guarantee that the simplification of section 4.3 works. in these propositions we needed the assumption that the functor preserves preimages. we will now prove the necessity of this assumption for theorem 4.7.
