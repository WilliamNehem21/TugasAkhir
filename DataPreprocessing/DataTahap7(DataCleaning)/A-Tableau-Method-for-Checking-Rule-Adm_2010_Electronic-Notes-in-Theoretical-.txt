the most important property for the result of this paper is that the models chn(s4), n> 0, and their definable variants possess the co-cover property. that the admissible rules for s4 can be characterized by the class of models with the co-cover property is shown in. a more general result appears in[18, theorem 3.5.1]. similar characterisation results for ipc appear in[9, theorem 4.1(iv)] and[10, corollary 3.14].



step 1 can be done in polynomial time, step 2 can be done in exponential time, and step 3 can be done in exponential time. this means the time complexity of the algorithm is bounded by a doubly-exponential function in the length of r. a more detailed complexity analysis based on the techniques from[8,9] implies that the rule admissibility problem for s4 is conexptime-complete.



quantifiers on p. however, using skolemisation it is possible to eliminate all existential quantifiers preceding the p-quantifiers in the formulae and then we can omit the quantifiers of p. in addition, we split the long formulae in two parts. we get:



the generated calculus t can be refined as follows. first, it is possible to refine the calculus by moving negated conclusions in certain rules up to premise positions. we move formulae that contain only propositional variables and do not contain any complex modal terms upwards. it is not difficult to check for each rule that the condition given in[22, theorem 3] for this refinement to preserve soundness and constructive completeness is true.
