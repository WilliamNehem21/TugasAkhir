the paper describes modeling of semi-active suspension systems based on variable damping coefficient limit. the models are designed in simulink while the fuzzy logic controller is incorporated through fuzzy tool box. section 2 describes the modeling of systems and road disturbance profile. section 3 explicates the design scheme of fuzzy logic controller. section 4 describes the simulation and results. a parametric analysis is presented based on the statistics. conclusion is elaborated in section 5.
