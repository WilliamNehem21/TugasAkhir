the smartphone hardware and software ecosystems have evolved very rapidly. multiple innovations in the system software, including os, languages, and runtimes have been made in the last decade. although, performance characterization of microarchitecture has been done, there is little analysis available for application performance bottlenecks of the system software stack, especially for contemporary applications on mobile operating systems.



in this work, we perform system utilization analysis from a software perspective, thereby supplementing the hardware perspective offered by prior work. we focus our analysis on android powered smartphones, running newer versions of android. using 11 representative apps and regions of interest within them, we carry out performance analysis of the entire android software stack to identify system performance bottlenecks.



smartphones have become an integral part of our daily lives. people depend on smartphones for many tasks related to business, finance, entertainment, and social interactions. currently, there are more than 2 billion mobile devices in use worldwide. the ericsson mobility report 2019 states that there are 6.1 billion mobile broadband subscriptions globally and the number of long-term-evolution(lte) subscriptions have grown to 3.9 billion. this widespread adoption of mobile devices can be largely attributed to increasing device affordability, which has been made possible due to numerous hardware and software innovations. this includes the open-source nature of the android operating system, which has allowed smartphone vendors to customize the software stack for their hardware. as a result, android has quickly gained a majority market share for smartphones.



we believe that a top-down analysis of application characteristics will augment our understanding of mobile devices by supplementing prior work. hence, we study the software subsystem of android based smartphones by tracing the entire system(application+ operating system) stack at runtime, capturing performance bottlenecks. prior works[4,6,7] have measured cpu utilization using thread level parallelism(tlp) as a metric to identify the amount of parallelism the hardware can exploit. while tlp is a useful metric to decide the number of cores to be placed on the chip, it does not provide information on the computation being performed by the cores and the functionality supported by the computations. knowledge of the functionality for which the computation is being performed is necessary to optimize software and to design novel hardware accelerators to be used alongside the cpu. generally, in android smartphones, a particular thread or a group of threads is responsible for a particular functionality. by identifying the threads having high execution times, one can identify the functionality that consumes higher cpu time and should be optimized. hence, we focus this paper on trying to answer the following questions.



for system-level(app+ operating system) tracing, we use the systrace tool. systrace is a tool shipped with android studio and is primarily used for analyzing the performance of an android device. it is a wrapper around atrace and ftrace. atrace performs user space tracing while ftrace traces the linux kernel. the traces capture not only the threads spawned by the app, but also background threads being executed by the android operating system. from the traces obtained using systrace, we find the time for which each thread executes on the processor core.



the android operating system and the apps spawn a large number of threads. since systrace performs system level tracing the generated traces have information for a large number of threads. this leads to the resulting plot being cluttered and difficult to interpret. hence, to reduce clutter and improve interpretability, we group threads working for a common functionality into a single bin. we identify two major bins which aid our analysis. they are: also a major time consumer for the inter process communication bin. they are used for communication between framework and vendor processes. the vendor processes are processes spawned by the code that the vendors add to android framework and are generally device-dependent.



applications. during an app launch, renderthread is the most timeconsuming thread for 5 out of the 11 apps, while it is in the top 2 most time-consuming threads for 9 out of the 11 apps. this is expected since when a new application is launched, new views corresponding to the launched application need to be rendered on the screen.



finally, the work focuses on regions of interest(rois) for analyzing the execution time breakdown. the authors have tried to select the most relevant rois for each application, which is similar to studies done in the past, which are based on the most common user behavioral patterns, and whose performance determined user engagement[1,20]. however, we acknowledge that the set of rois for each application is not necessarily the most representative nor is it necessarily exhaustive. future work will focus on identifying a much more representative and exhaustive set of regions-of-interest for the application.



in this work, we performed a system level performance bottlenecks analysis for an android smartphone for eleven popular applications. our results demonstrate that for all applications, the highest time consuming thread is either renderthread or another thread related to frame rendering. further, on grouping threads into bins based on their functionality, we find that the highest time consuming functionality is inter process communication. we find similar distribution in time consumption for both app executions and app launches. our results identify that software optimization and hardware acceleration should target inter process communication to maximize performance and improve user experience.
