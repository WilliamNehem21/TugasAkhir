that are absurd from an application-programming point of view are possible(and sometimes even very common) in kernel programming. for instance, many kernels see some piece of main memory at different virtual addresses.(other important ways in which kernel programming differs are the use of casts and pointer arithmetic, however, those are outside the main scope of this paper.)



here state is the type of all possible states of the hardware model, and data is a type parameter for the result of the state transformer(if it terminates successfully). both types are theory parameters in our pvs formalization, making them effectively polymorphic. in the verification of concrete c++ programs however, data is instantiated with a fixed type for each state transformer. the state parameter is either instantiated as well(if we verify against a concrete hardware model), or left polymorphic if we verify against the plain-memory specification(see section 3) in general. the type exprresult is defined as follows: with successor state s and result d. hang stands for non-termination, for instance because of a while loop or a page fault that keeps occurring at the same instruction. fatal is reserved for unrecoverable errors, which we want to rule out by verification. a result of the form exception models hardware exceptions and interrupts that will be handled by the micro-kernel. 5



stmtresult is that stmtresult contains abnormalities like break and return to model the corresponding c++ control-flow statements, very similar to. further, ok does not carry a data element. the parameter of type data is used inside return to model the return type of c++ functions.



state transformers can be composed in the obvious way. for two state transformers f and g their composition f## g is a state transformer that performs the effect of g on the successor state of f if f returns ok. otherwise g is discarded and the result of f is the result of the composition. if f is an expression transformer, the data in any ok result is discarded.



the memory formalization in the hardware model is split into different layers of memory models, for instance for physical and virtual memory. these different memory models share a common interface. every memory model defines a type state of possible states and the following record of operations.



7 the source code that we currently target does not involve any devices. in general, cache policy checking for memory-mapped devices is trivial to add with our mechanism for side effects(see section 4). to model cache effects on cachable devices, the model of the device should include the relevant cache effects.



8 a c++ compiler is permitted to perform arbitrary optimizations with respect to non-volatile data. memory accesses to such data are not part of the observable behavior of a c++ program, which makes a correct semantics difficult. at the moment our c++ semantics treats all data as volatile. a verification based on



these things here, see section 4 for details.) the general idea is simple. memory at blessed addresses is sane: read access does not change anything in the blessed address range, and write access only changes the bytes written(in the expected way). moreover, these special properties are maintained as long as only blessed addresses are accessed. no guarantees are made however for a memory access outside the blessed address regions. we have shown in pvs that these properties are satisfied by normal virtual memory(that is outside memory-mapped devices) under the following preconditions:



our hardware model contains physical memory(ram) as a base of all memory models. physical memory provides one byte of storage for every address up to a certain maximum. accesses above the maximum yield fatal as result. unsurprisingly we can prove that all states of physical memory form a plain memory, with all addresses below the maximum read/write-blessed.



although most device drivers reside outside the micro-hypervisor, some devices(e.g. the interrupt controller) must remain under kernel control to prevent malicious code from monopolizing the system. to program these devices, the micro-hypervisor code accesses certain device registers. unlike normal ram, these registers show very special behavior when accessed. special-purpose processor registers(such as the ia32 control registers[ia32-3a-2.5] 9) are similar to device registers in that read or write accesses to them may cause special effects. for our verification attempt, the following special effects are important.



side effects reading or writing causes side effects on some devices. for example, writing to the ia32 apic end of interrupt register signals completion of the interrupt-handling procedure[ia32-3a-8.8.5]. this may cause the immediate delivery of the next pending interrupt.



to obtain the random value we apply a completely unspecified function random to the seed and the current access count. because access count is strictly increasing, we get potentially different values for every access to rnd val. under-specified and non-deterministic behavior of more complicated devices can be modeled in a similar fashion.



other special-purpose processor registers and device registers leave the value of certain reserved bits undefined. in this case we match against an unspecified value in the memory write side effect transformer. because the initial register contents are not specified, we can establish that reserved bits are unaltered by a write access only when the written data originates from a previous read of this register.



side effects on reads(respectively on writes) cause additional parts of the system state to be updated. here, one can either update the memory state itself, or add an additional device state. for the random number generator, we decided to use the latter approach. as described earlier, our rng device implements a side effect to count all memory accesses in its internal state.



to detect this kind of error, we introduce a crossed-page indicator cp as argument to our side-effect transformers. initially being false, this indicator is set to true when the address translation splits a contiguous memory access. the side effect transformer unaligned access(see page 12) of our rng device always checks the cp flag and delivers an error if it is true.



added to the precondition. in blessed memory states that the variable is correctly allocated in blessed memory, valid in mem that the memory contains a valid bit representation for the variable. typically the latter is established by a previous write to this variable.



in this paper we have presented two details of our approach to model the memory of an ia32 system. the first detail is a specification of well-behaved plain memory. this specification allows us to maintain an abstract level of reasoning with reasonable efficiency on top of a complex model of paged virtual memory. the second detail is our modeling of memory-mapped devices and reserved bit restrictions. we use side-effect state transformers that are performed before and after memory access to uniformly model both, reserved bits and memory-mapped devices. as demonstrations we have included the formalization of a(memory-mapped) random number generator, and an example verification of a simple c++ code fragment.
