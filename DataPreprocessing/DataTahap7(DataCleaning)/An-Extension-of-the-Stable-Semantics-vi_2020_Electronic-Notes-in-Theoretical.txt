that if statements about future events are already true or false, then the future is as much determined as the past and differs from the past only in so far as it has not yet come to pass. in order to avoid the situations in which further development is impossible, he proposed to reject the law of excluded middle, that is, the assumption that every proposition is true or false. moreover, he proposed a logic system where a third truth-value is added, which is read as possible. the lukasiewicz logic



programs in terms of the intermediate logic g3, and then we extend such definition, in a conservative way, in terms of the paraconsistent logic gj. then in section 4, we present lukasiewicz 4-valued logic along with the new 4-valued logic m 4 that bears relation to all of the logics previously presented. finally, in section 5 we present some conclusions.



next we introduce the following 4-valued logic, which we will call m 4. it has among its properties the particularity that when restricted to a particular set of three of its values it expresses logic g3. it counts with two negations, one of them is defined as lukasiewicz negation(in l4), which becomes the strong negation.
