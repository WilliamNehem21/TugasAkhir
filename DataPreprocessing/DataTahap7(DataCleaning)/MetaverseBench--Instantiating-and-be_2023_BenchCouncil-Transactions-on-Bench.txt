on the one hand, technologies enabling the metaverse have made considerable progress, including but not limited to artificial intelligence, blockchain, and extended reality. specifically, artificial intelligence, especially deep learning and reinforcement learning, which have advanced significantly since the 2010s, has been crucial for developing the metaverse and is expected to be fundamental for realizing it. with the rise of blockchain technology, decentralization has become a vital feature of the metaverse. improvements in devices and wearable technologies have also spurred growing interest in virtual and augmented reality among the general public. on the other hand, since 2020 and the global covid-19 pandemic, online industries like online education have grown explosively. analysts estimated the global online education market size at$210.1 billion in 2021 and predicted it would reach$848.12 billion by 2030. online offices, gaming, and other industries have also seen similar growth. the rapid growth of these industries not only drives the development of relevant technologies but also promotes the evolution of the metaverse.



however, existing benchmarks typically focus on specific technological domains. for example, mlperf and aibench aim to benchmark deep learning systems, while bigdatabench aims to benchmark big data systems. the interdisciplinary nature of the metaverse means that existing benchmarks can only cover certain aspects of its related technological domains. furthermore, the entanglement of various technologies significantly complicates the metaverse system. therefore, zhan claimed that it is critical to propose a benchmark suite that quantitatively defines the challenges of the metaverse system and explores and evaluates state-of-the-art and state-of-practice solutions. such a benchmark suite is necessary to systematically assess the metaverse system and address how far different technologies are from realizing the metaverse within the current computing, storage, and network capabilities.



in this study, firstly, we summarize various definitions and concepts of metaverse by investigating existing literature, and we propose a comprehensive and sophisticated conceptual system of the metaverse from the perspective of computer systems. secondly, we present a methodology based on the aforementioned conceptual system for benchmarking the metaverse system. finally, we introduce an implementation of a benchmark suite based on this methodology, named metaversebench. our contributions are as follows.



we propose the metaverse conceptual system from the computer systems perspective, including three key aspects: components, technological domains, and specifications. the fundamental components include the access system, avatar, environment, and activity. we have summarized nine relevant technological domains: artificial intelligence, big data, extended reality, blockchain, cloud computing, edge computing, and networking. furthermore, we distill five specifications to which the metaverse should adhere: automatic computing, immersive experience, decentralized architecture, ubiquitous access, and hyperspace interaction.



we propose a benchmarking methodology for the metaverse system, which combines our conceptual system with the scenariobased approach proposed in. considering the complexity of the metaverse system, firstly, we build a typical metaverse application scenario and analyze its workflow, extracting critical paths, modules, and algorithms. next, we select representative workloads based on nine technological domains to determine candidate workloads. finally, we combine the results from the previous two steps to acquire the final workloads representing the designated scenario.



this study is structured as follows: section 2 reviews representative definitions of the metaverse. section 3 introduces the metaverse conceptual system. section 4 presents the methodology for benchmarking metaverse systems. metaversebench is presented in section 5. preliminary experiments under metaversebench are discussed in section 6. section 7 concludes related work, while section 8 outlines the conclusions and plans for further research.



researchers who engage in the metaverse debates are interested in identifying the essential concepts necessary for its construction. we propose a conceptual system encompassing three aspects: the components that make up the metaverse, the technological domains that enable the realization of the metaverse, and the specifications to which the metaverse should adhere. despite numerous proposals for metaverse concepts in recent years, a comprehensive conceptual system that covers all three aspects has yet to be put forward. in this section, we will review the state-of-the-art concepts of the metaverse and present our conceptual system for the metaverse.



dionisio et al. argued that realism, ubiquity, interoperability, and scalability were decisive areas enabling the metaverse. among the four areas, realism allows users to feel fully immersed; ubiquity facilitates users to access via various devices and maintains the identities of users; interoperability enables interaction across multiple virtual worlds; and scalability allows the metaverse to accommodate a massive number of users. lee et al. proposed a metaverse activities in the metaverse, eliminating spatial constraints and language barriers. economic activities involve concepts such as digital currency, digital assets, and digital market, with high reliance on decentralization and interoperability. typical cultural and entertaining activities include literary and artistic creation, cultural tourism, and playing electronic games. for education and research, the metaverse provides platforms enabling immersive learning and teaching and interoperable experimental environments by applying extended reality and various sensors.



artificial intelligence. relevant technologies based on deep neural networks have experienced tremendous progress in the last decade to become powerful driving forces for the development of the metaverse. for access systems, ai-based biometric identification technology can be applied to verify the identity of users as they attempt to log into the metaverse. for avatars in the metaverse, ai-based personalization algorithms can be used to create avatars that are more personalized to the individual user based on factors such as their preferences, interests, and behavior within the metaverse. this can make interactions with avatars more engaging and meaningful. for the metaverse environment, ai-based generation and reconstruction techniques can automatically create and populate vast and diverse backgrounds within the metaverse. for activities in the metaverse, ai-based natural language processing technology can enable users to interact with others and the metaverse environment, which helps create a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. it would allow users to quickly and easily access the necessary functions and features.



big data. the realization of the metaverse poses daunting challenges for the storage, transmission, and processing of big data, due to which big data is a necessary element. for access systems, big data can be used to monitor and analyze user access patterns and identify potential security threats, such as unauthorized access attempts or suspicious behavior. this can help to identify and prevent security breaches and enable the implementation of more effective access control mechanisms. for avatars in the metaverse, by collecting and analyzing data on user preferences, behaviors, and interests within the metaverse, it is possible to build detailed user profiles that can be used to personalize the avatar experience. this can include avatar appearance, behavior, interaction style, and the content and activities presented to the user. for environment and activities in the metaverse, it is possible to gain insights into how users interact with the environment and what features and activities are most popular by analyzing large datasets on user behavior and preferences. this can inform the development of new social features and activities and enable the creation of more engaging and interactive user experiences.



data security and privacy. data security and privacy are critical considerations in the metaverse, as users interact and engage within virtual environments that collect and process vast amounts of personal and sensitive information. for the metaverse access systems, robust access control mechanisms need to be implemented to restrict data access to authorized personnel only, and role-based access controls should be utilized to ensure that individuals can only access the data necessary for their specific roles. data encryption must be adopted for other metaverse components to protect data during transmission and storage. moreover, by utilizing anonymization and pseudonymization, we can minimize the use of personally identifiable information whenever possible, further protecting user identities and reducing the risk of data breaches.



network. networks play a crucial role in enabling connection and communication within the metaverse. first, the metaverse relies on high-speed connectivity to help seamless communication and interaction between users. therefore, networks must be designed to support high-bandwidth applications and low-latency connections. moreover, the metaverse is expected to accommodate a large number of users, and as such, networks must be designed to be highly scalable to handle high traffic and data volumes. last, deploying wireless networks is significant to enable users to access the metaverse anytime and anywhere.



autonomic computing. the metaverse is a persistent virtual world that remains available and accessible to users at all times, even when they are not logged in. in other words, the metaverse should be a self-running system parallel to the real world.



immersive experience. the metaverse offers a high level of immersion, allowing users to feel fully present in the digital space through the use of advanced graphics, haptic feedback, and other sensory experiences. immersive experiences heavily rely on wearable devices such as ar/vr glasses, but the metaverse should expand its boundaries to include touch, smell, taste, and other perception approaches.



decentralized architecture. the metaverse is designed to operate distributed and decentralized without being controlled by any single entity or organization. in a decentralized metaverse, no single company or organization has complete control over the platform, the digital assets, or the user data.



ubiquitous access. the metaverse is designed to be accessible and available to users from anywhere, at any time, and through any device. in a ubiquitous metaverse, users can seamlessly transition between the physical and virtual worlds and between devices such as smartphones, computers, and vr headsets.



hyperspace interaction. the metaverse enables seamless communication and interaction between applications, platforms, and digital spaces, even between the metaverse and the physical world. in an interoperable metaverse, users can transfer and use digital assets, identities, and experiences across different environments and contexts. in a hyperspace-enabled metaverse, users can move from one virtual environment to another without noticeable lag or disruption, creating a seamless and immersive experience.



education. generally, the education industry involves three elements: teachers, students, and learning environments. in the metaverse education scenario, students could interact with their environment, collaborate with classmates, and engage in experiential learning activities. for example, they could explore historical landmarks, visit foreign countries, or participate in simulated experiments that might not be possible in the physical world.



etc.) into the candidate workloads. as for technologies facilitating interactions, we focus on underlying ai-based algorithms. specifically, we select representative algorithms in computer vision: semantic segmentation, image classification, object detection, and image generation, and in natural language processing, text classification, question answering, machine translation, and speech recognition as candidate workloads. decentralized networks based on blockchain involve various aspects such as consensus protocols, smart contracts, governance mechanisms,



metaverse components function in the critical path, we can get the key elements of each component. the part that most affects the user experience in the access system is user authentication. for avatars and environments, sophisticated models enable users to feel immersive, so we focus on the creation and rendering of models. activities are the results of interactions between different avatars and between avatars with environments. we focus on not only technologies that can help facilitate those interactions but also the performance of decentralized networks based on blockchain to ensure a consistent experience. moreover, as the essential part, the capabilities for storage, computing, and transmission of big data are also considered.



we present metaversebench as our solution instantiation for the metaverse benchmark. for most benchmark suites, workloads, datasets, and metrics are the three fundamental elements that apply to metaversebench. moreover, selecting datasets and metrics depends on specific workloads; the paramount step is determining the workloads.



we adopt a three-step process to determine the workloads. firstly, we follow the critical path and key elements of general scenarios. we select representative workloads from the nine technological domains described in the conceptual system to form a set of candidate workloads. secondly, we conduct an in-depth analysis of general scenarios and build the mapping from specific workloads to them by reviewing the workflow of metaverse components. finally, we extract and refine workloads that cover the critical path and the components from candidates to reflect general metaverse scenarios as realistically as possible.



although benchmark evaluations exist for the related technological domains involved in the metaverse, such as xrbench for evaluating the performance of machine-learning hardware for future extended reality systems and bigdatabench for evaluating big data systems and architectures, creating benchmarks for complete metaverse systems remains uncharted territory. the hyperledger foundation introduced hyperledger caliper, a benchmark tool for blockchain. at the same time, in 2020, dimitri et al. developed bctmark, a generic framework for benchmarking blockchain on an emulated network in a reproducible way. additionally, there are benchmarks available for artificial intelligence, such as mlperf and aibench. however, building benchmarks against complete metaverse systems is still uncharted.



regarding benchmark construction, this paper focuses on the workload abstraction of multiple individual real-world tasks. the challenges brought by the subsystems composed of multi-tasks and the entire system consisting of various subsystems greatly exceed that of a single task. we plan to build the respective metaverse subsystem based on different workload abstractions. then, we will complete the complete metaverse system. finally, we will construct the metaverse system-oriented metaverse benchmark suite.
