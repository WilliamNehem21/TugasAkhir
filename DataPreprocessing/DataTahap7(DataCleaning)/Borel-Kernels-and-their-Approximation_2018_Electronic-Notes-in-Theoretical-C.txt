this paper introduces a categorical framework to study the exact and approximate semantics of probabilistic programs. we construct a dagger symmetric monoidal category of borel kernels where the dagger-structure is given by bayesian inversion. we show functorial bridges between this category and categories of banach lattices which formalize the move from kernel-based semantics to predicate transformer(backward) or state transformer(forward) semantics. these bridges are related by natural transformations, and we show in



as an endofunctor gpol of pol, the category of polish spaces, one sets gpol(x, t) to be the space of borel probability measures over x together with the weak topology. this space is polish[15, th 17.23], and the portmanteau theorem[15, th 17.20]) gives multiple characterizations of the weak topology.
