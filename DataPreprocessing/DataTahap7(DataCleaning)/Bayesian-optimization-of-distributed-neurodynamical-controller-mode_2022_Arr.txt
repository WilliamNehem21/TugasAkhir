neuroscience-inspired learning and control methods have seen increased interest from robotics, artificial intelligence, and multi-agent control. here, we presented a demonstration of exploring and visualizing the parameter space of a multi-agent model with complex dynamical behaviors using sample-efficient bayesian optimization with gaussian process surrogate models. we introduced an objective function for a spatial cooperative foraging task in neuroswarms simulations to predict reward-capture performance across two distinct maze environments. training the surrogate model was facilitated by the



by learning umap embeddings, we demonstrated visualization of 9-dimensional parameter points to identify and select high performing clusters of parameters. we illustrated the identification of parameters that generalized across environments by jointly evaluating the neuroswarms metacontroller in two distinct maze environments. overall, our study serves as an example application of bayesian optimization of complex multi-agent models to explore and select for complex behaviors like goal-directed spatial navigation in a system with distributed neural control.



future work is needed to develop new controller models and critical spatial tasks to explore the capabilities of multi-agent objective functions that adapt efficiently to the characteristics of diverse environments(e.g., occlusive geometry, dynamic change, reward distribution, cue richness, etc.). we theorize that heterogeneous variation of swarm spatial structure and intertemporal coordination dynamics will be able to support a form of swarm metacognition that allows adjustment to the available goals in an environment, without initial knowledge of the goals or their locations. this approach could extend the flexibility of bayesian optimization to operate in diverse environments and adapt efficiently to tasks with difficult or uncertain goals.
