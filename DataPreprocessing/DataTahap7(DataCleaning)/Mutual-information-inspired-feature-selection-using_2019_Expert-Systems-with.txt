the rest of the paper is organized as follows. section 2 describes the fundamentals of mi and cca and related studies. section 3 presents the proposed method, mrmjr-kcca, and its implementation. section 4 gives the experimental results and the discussions. the conclusion is provided in section 5.



we experimentally evaluate mrmjr-kcca using two learning algorithms on the selected subset of features, i.e., support vector machines(svm) and random forest(rf) due to their excellent performance in classification applications(alickovic, kevric,& subasi, 2018; chernbumroong, cang,& yu, 2014; sani, massie, wiratunga,& cooper, 2017). the pair of parameters gamma and c in svm, and the number of trees in rf are determined in 10-fold cross validation process individually. the results report the average accuracy from 10 times test. at the same time, we compare our proposed method with other available popular fs methods presented in section 1.
