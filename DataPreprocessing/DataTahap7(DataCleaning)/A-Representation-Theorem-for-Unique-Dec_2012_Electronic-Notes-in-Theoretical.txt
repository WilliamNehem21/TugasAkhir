by symmetric monoidal m-category, we mean an m-category with a symmetric monoidal structure on its underlying category. we do not assume that the symmetric monoidal structure is compatible with the m-enrichment. for symmetric monoidal m-category c and d, a symmetric monoidal m-functor from c to d is an m-functor from c to d that is symmetric monoidal.
