the quantum intervention e?f is the quantum intervention e? f} obtained by composing each intervention em with f. all the quantum operations of qdl are interpreted using variants of this basic scheme. in particular, the unitary strategy is a special case of the above with f being the superoperator u associated to a unitary operation u. the way a new quantum intervention is created from the initial one e? motivate the use of quantum intervention: implementing a similar scheme with other quantum measurement formalisms like projective measurements would not allow to represent quantum operations as general as trace-preserving superoperators.



we did not explore fully the categorical properties of quantum arenas introduced in this paper. for example, one could consider the category of the category of arenas of the form[h] and probabilistic strategies that correspond to quantum operations. this category or some of its subcategories could provide new models for the categorical structures associated to quantum mechanics[1,2,13].
