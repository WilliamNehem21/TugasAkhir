we observe that the domain s constructed in theorem 4.3, though satisfying property(b), is not a simply connected domain. in fact, it contains an infinite number of holes. whether this construction can be strengthened to make s a simply connected domain, or a multiply connected domain(i.e., a domain with a finite number of holes), is an interesting open question. we do know that the result of theorem 4.1 also applies to the k-path problem for k> 1. so, we have the following weaker lower bound for simply connected domains s satisfying either property(a) or property(b).
