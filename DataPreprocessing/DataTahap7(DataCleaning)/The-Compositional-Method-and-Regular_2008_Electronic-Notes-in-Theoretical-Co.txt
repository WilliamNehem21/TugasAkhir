the compositional method, introduced by feferman and vaught in 1959, allows to reduce the model-checking problem for a product structure to the model-checking problem for its factors. it applies to first-order logic, and limitations for its use have recently been revealed by rabinovich(2007). we sharpen the results of rabinovich by showing that the composition method is applicable to the asynchronous product(and the finitely synchronized product) for an extended modal logic in which the reachability modality is enhanced by a(semi-linear) condition on path lengths. we show that a slight extension leads to the failure of the composition theorem. we add comments on extensions of the result and open questions.



in the area of model theory feferman and vaught developed in a compositional method which allows to do this. they proved that the first-order(fo) theory of a generalized product of structures is reducible to the first-order theory of the component structures and the monadic theory of the index structure(over which the product is formed). many variants have been regarded since the original result of feferman and vaught; a good overview can be found in. further references are[6,9,13,15].



we look at different products of transition systems, namely the asynchronous and the synchronized product. the synchronized product is defined mainly according to, except the fact that we use the same labels for the local transitions in all components. the abbreviation[n] is used for the set{1,..., n}.
