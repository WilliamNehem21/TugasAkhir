the state space s is partitioned into the set of transient states st and m sets of recurrent states sri(recurrent classes). the sub-matrix t is the sub-stochastic dtmc of the transient states st. each rectangular sub-matrix fi is the probability matrix of going into the i-th recurrent class from st. each square sub-matrix ri is the dtmc of the i-th recurrent class.
