when using discounting with weighted timed transition systems, there are several choices available. one can discount by steps as e.g. in[14,17], or by elapsed time as e.g. in. under the former version, events are discounted by the number



we have shown that if one wants an accumulated weight function in a timed transition system to satisfy a certain natural additivity property, as given in definition 2.2, then there is only very little choice left as to how to define it. in particular, neither the quotient approach of nor the step-based discounting in[14,17] give rise to accumulated weight functions which are discounted in time.
