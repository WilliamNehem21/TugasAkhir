characterizations: the morphologies of the hcsts were observed using optical microscopy(rh2000; hirox, japan). an sl200ks goniometer(kino industry co., ltd, usa) was used to record the changes in the contact angle of the stretchinginduced hcsts. the tensile properties of the as-prepared samples were analyzed using a universal material testing system(instron 5943; instron, usa). relative resistance changes were measured using a digital multimeter(keysight 34470a; keysight, usa). a g571 air permeability tester(standard international group(hk) limited, china) was used to test the air permeability of the various textiles with a testing area and pressure of 20 cm2 and 200 pa, respectively, according to gb/t 5453.
