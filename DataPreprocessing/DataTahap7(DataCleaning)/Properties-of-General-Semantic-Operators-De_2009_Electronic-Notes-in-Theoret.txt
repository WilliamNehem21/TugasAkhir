the overall structure of the paper is as follows. in section 2, we discuss finitelydetermined operations in general and show how they are used in giving the definition of our general semantic operator tp,c. in section 3, we show how this operator subsumes the three special cases mentioned above. in section 4, we discuss monotonicity properties of tp,c and its scott continuity. in section 5, we briefly discuss the question of the computation of tp,c by artificial neural networks. finally, in section 6, we present our conclusions.



in this list, the semiring(i) is just classical two-valued logic and is finitely determined, but(ii),(iii) and(iv) are not finitely determined. if we take a finite number of truth values and use approximations based on a finite number of intervals, then the semiring(ii) is a finitely-determined logic, and semirings(iii) and(iv) have finitely-determined disjunctions. the semiring(v) depends on the cardinality of a: if a is finite then we have a finitely-determined logic, otherwise not.



we close this discussion of constraint problems in relation to the general semantic operator by considering a simple example of a constraint problem that can be turned into a sclp(and can ultimately be solved on an ann, see theorem 5.1). this example shows that we can solve a csp, combine constraints and project over a subset of variables using methods from logic programming.
