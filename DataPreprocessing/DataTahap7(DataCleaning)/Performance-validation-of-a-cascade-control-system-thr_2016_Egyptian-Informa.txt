since both not involve messy and lengthy cables[16,17]. generally, a wireless sensor node consists of a computational module, communication module, power supply and appropriate sensing system[18,19,26]. both wired and wireless technologies are extensively used for monitoring and controlling[16,20]. in future, both wireless sensor network and mobile communication may assume an indispensable part of our lives due to their flexibility, deployment and low cost.
