in this paper we present how sweeping line techniques, which are very popular in computational geometry, can be adapted for static analysis of computer software by abstract interpretation. we expose how concept of the sweeping line can be used to represent elements of a numerical abstract domain of boxes, which is a disjunctive refinement of a well known domain of intervals that allows finite number of disjunctions. we provide a detailed description of the representation along with standard domain operations algorithms. furthermore we introduce very precise widening operator for the domain.



section 2 introduces the problem we solve. in section 3 we describe our adaptation of the sweeping line technique. section 4 presents the representation of elements of the domain of boxes and section 5 outlines the implementation of the domain operators. section 6 describes a new widening operator for boxes. in section 7 we discuss transfer functions and we conclude in section 8.



the basic version of the domain of intervals makes it possible to represent only convex sets. we would like to extend this to represent finite disjunctions of intervals. we define this more formally in what follows. let var be a set of variables and i be chosen to be ring of reals r, or rationals q, or integers z. the abstract domain of intervals is a tuple:



the idea of the sweeping line technique is to imagine that a line(usually a vertical one) is swept across the plane, stopping at some points. a data structure, which is associated with the sweeping line, is updated every time the line is stopped. when the line has swept across all points, a result of interest is computed from the data structure.
