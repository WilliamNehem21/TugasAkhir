emerging contaminants(ecs), such as endocrine disruptors, persistent pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and synthetic dyes, have been widely found in natural water environments[1-3]. even trace amounts of ecs in the water environment can trigger bioconcentration and produce ecotoxicological effects, posing a serious threat to public water safety[4-6]. human exposure to ecs primarily occurs through ingesting food and beverages associated with contaminated soil, water, plants, animals, and microorganisms. due to their hydrophobic properties, ecs tend to accumulate in biological tissues with high lipid content. in particular, species at the top of the food chain exhibit increasing bioaccumulation and biomagnification[7, 8]. the specific harms to humans are manifested in disruptions to the endocrine and immune system, often involving the mimicry, suppression, or alteration of hormone function. these disruptions can lead to delayed brain development, premature puberty in children, reproductive issues, and an elevated risk of cancer and its associated complications[9, 10]. however, removing ecs poses a formidable challenge, both in terms of relying on nature's self-purification abilities and the conventional wastewater treatment processes deployed in municipal wastewater treatment plants[11-13]. despite the utilization of relatively uncomplicated and cost-effective technologies in contemporary wastewater treatment plants, the effective elimination of ecs remains an elusive goal. this is primarily attributed to the exceedingly low-level concentrations of ecs in water, the intricate composition of the actual wastewater, and the inherent resistance of ecs to
