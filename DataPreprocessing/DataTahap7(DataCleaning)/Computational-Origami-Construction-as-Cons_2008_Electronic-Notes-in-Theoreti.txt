(o1) we can make a fold along a line that passes through given points p and q.(o2) we can make a fold along the line that superposes given points p and q.(o3) we can make a fold along a line that superposes two given lines m and n.(o4) we can make a fold along a line that is perpendicular to a given line m, and



online(q, l) holds, then r(p, q, l) holds. in particular if for any combinations of values of p, q and l for which formula(a1) holds, then r(p, q, l) holds. this can be written as a 3-ctrs(type 3 conditional term rewrite system).



we have seen the model of computation for computational origami. the model comes with a formal language to reason about the model. however, the formal language is not sufficient for end-users, i.e. origamists, to explore the possibilities of computational origami. the computational origami environment eos developed by us assists the user to perform origami construction and reason about geometric properties. the programming and computational capabilities described in this paper are an abstraction of what have been implemented so far. we need more programming supports for computational origami.
