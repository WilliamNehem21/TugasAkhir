we present a construction technique for abstract interpretations which is generic in the choice of data abstractions. the technique is specialised on c/c++ code, internally represented by the gimple control flow graph as generated by the gcc compiler. the generic interpreter handles program transitions in a symbolic way, while recording a history of symbolic memory valuations. an abstract interpreter is instantiated by selecting appropriate lattices for the data types under consideration. this selection induces an instance of the generic transition relation. all resulting abstract interpretations can handle pointer arithmetic, type casts, unions and the aliasing problems involved. it is illustrated how switching between abstractions can improve the efficiency of the verification process. the concepts described in this paper are implemented in the test automation and static analysis tool rt-tester which is used for the verification of embedded systems in the fields of avionics, railways and automotive control.



we have described techniques for concrete and abstract interpretation of c/c++ programs represented in gimple, which basically produces a control flow graph model for each c/c++ function or method. the results are implemented in a tool and they are currently applied for integrated module testing and static analysis of safety-critical embedded systems software in the railway and avionic domains. applications in the field of automotive control are currently prepared; they focus, however, on model-based test case generation. due to the intermediate model representation of the tool which uses the same class of hierarchic transition systems for code(control flow graph) and model(e. g. uml 2.0 statechart) representation, the test case generation mechanisms are the same for code-based and model-based testing. currently a correctness proof for the abstract interpretation semantics constructed according to the rules given in section 5 is elaborated: we show that application of these rules always result in a valid abstract interpretation semantics according to definition 2.1.
