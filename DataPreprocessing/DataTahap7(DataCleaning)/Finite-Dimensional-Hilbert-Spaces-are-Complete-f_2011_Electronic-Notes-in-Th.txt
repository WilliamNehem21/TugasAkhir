before attempting to prove theorem 2.2, we reduce the statement to something simpler. by arguments analogous to those of hasegawa, hofmann, and plotkin, it suffices without loss of generality to consider terms m, n that satisfy some additional conditions. the additional conditions are:{a1, a2, a4}. define[b]]m to be a 2-dimensional hilbert space with orthonormal basis{b3, b5}. note that the names of the basis vectors have been chosen to suggest a correspondence between basis vectors of[a]]m and wires labeled a in the diagram m, and similarly for[b]]m.
