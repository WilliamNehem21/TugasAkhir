the purpose of this paper is to investigate the connections between km-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces and the associated order structures of formal balls. we introduce the notions of yoneda t-completeness and yoneda s-completeness on km-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces. in both cases, the associated posets of formal balls are directed complete. in particular, for a subclass of km-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces, yoneda t-completeness and yoneda s-completeness are characterized respectively by directed completeness of the associated posets of formal balls.



remark 2.12 for more details of theorem 2.11, we recommend the reader to. moreover, it is interesting to note that there exist fuzzy quasi-metric spaces such that any map of the characteristic family is not an ordinary quasi-metric. an extraordinary example was given in.



in this paper, we concentrate on the relationships between fuzzy quasi-metric spaces and the related order structures of formal balls. for this purpose, we introduce the notions of yoneda t-completeness and yoneda s-completeness on km-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces. the relationships between completeness on fuzzy quasi-metric spaces and the associated posets of formal balls are discussed. moreover, yoneda t-completeness and yoneda s-completeness on a subclass of km-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces are characterized, respectively, with the aid of order-theoretical properties of the associated posets of formal balls.
