in order to simplify the writing of the reduction rules, pi denotes a variable x such that f(x)= i. the quantum program state then becomes a pair[q, m'] with m'= m[pf(x1)/x1]...[pf(xn)/xn] if the domain of f is{x1,... xn}.



the entanglement relation of a new qubit relates this qubit with itself. since the information about entanglement is stated in the typing rules(5) by a relation over variable names, the new qubit must be immediately named. that is why the syntax always gives names to newly created qubits let x= new m in m.



a more elaborate example would be the data used during the execution of the one way quantum computer: a rectangular array of qubits, where all qubits are initially entangled with their neighbours, and where the entanglement within this quantum data structure is consumed in a stepwise manner by successive 1-qubit measurements. an interesting special case, which would at least fit the one way quantum computer, is the family of quantum data structures corresponding to graph states[4,7]. this will be studied further in the scope of this work in progress, with the associated notion of types.
