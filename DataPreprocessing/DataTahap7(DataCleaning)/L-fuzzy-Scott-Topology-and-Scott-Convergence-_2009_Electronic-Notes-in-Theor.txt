domain theory, a formal basis for the semantics of programming languages, originates in work by d. scott[17,18] in the mid-1960s. domain models for various types of programming languages, including imperative, functional, nondeterministic and probabilistic languages, have been extensively studied.



in[25,26,27], for an arbitrary frame l, we call a map between two fuzzy dcpos fuzzy scott continuous if it is order-preserving and preserves joins of fuzzy directed subsets. such a category of fuzzy dcpos is cartesian closed. also, a natural l-topology, called a fuzzy scott topology, on fuzzy dcpos are defined and studied.



the aim of this paper is to define and study an l-fuzzy topology on fuzzy dcpos. we shall call it an l-fuzzy scott topology. and then to establish scott convergence theory for stratified l-filters. likewise the fuzzy scott topology, an l-fuzzy scott topology is an l-fuzzy counterpart of a crisp one.
