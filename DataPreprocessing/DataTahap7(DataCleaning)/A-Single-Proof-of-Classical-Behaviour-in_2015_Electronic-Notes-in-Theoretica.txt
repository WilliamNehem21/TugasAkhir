in physics the authors in have established an approach to formalize concepts in quantum mechanics, the so called principle of superposition, via paraconsistent methods. in general most of scientific knowledge as theories can have inconsistencies. most of the time scientist do not throw away these theories if they are successful in predicting results and describing phenomena.



finding a strong negation in the cn hierarchy is interesting because we can collapse a fragment of these logics into classical logic, that is, we can have a translation which provides an embedding of classical logic into any logic of this cn system. this fact is mentioned in many papers[6,5], on the other hand the proof does not explicitly appears. in this paper we present an inductive proof about the relation between strong negation and classical behaviour in the cn systems. the proof follows from three lemmas and two theorems. from this proof we can see that many properties in c1 can also hold in cn, excluding the obvious ones.
