value u0= 0.12345678901267. at the generation procedure, if the value of f markov repeats, we discard it and continue to iterate the chaotic map until all the integers between 0 and 255 have been obtained. therefore one can see that f markov is one vector of



used in a cryptosystem. we fix key parameters p= 29, d 0.001, r 27 and just consider the other key parameters to be the cipher keys. then the proposed algorithm consists of six keys x0, y0, z0, n0, u0, key0. the ieee floating-point standard suggests the computational precision for a 64-bit double precision number



pixels is usually high in the plain image. an effective encryption system should reduce the correlation between adjacent pixels greatly to resist the statistical attack. zero correlation is the best result for an ideal crytosystem. 3000 pairs of adjacent pixels at the horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions are selected from the plain image and ciphered image randomly to calculate the correlation coefficients by(4.1).



keys. this makes a slight modification of the plain image can give a completely different ciphered image, and therefore the proposed image encryption algorithm can strongly resist differential attack, chosen-plaintext attack and known-plaintext attack. an effective diffusion process is also presented to change the gray values of the whole image pixels. experimental results and performance analysis including key space analysis, histogram analysis, correlation analysis, information entroy and differential attack have been discussed to demonstrate the security and validity of the image encryption algorithm.
