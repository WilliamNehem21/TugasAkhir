the existing techniques for permutation analysis have been adapted to particular sets of inference rules. there are many situations where the permutations can not be explained by the above definitions. in particular the above analysis of permutations via the notions of active and principal formulae is sometimes too coarse to capture when permutations are possible.



ther checking of permutabilities of given rules. we could say that the notion of strong permutation position is dedicated to the analysis of possible permutations in a given proof i.e. when we have the concrete instances of a given inference rule. recall that such permutations and inference movements in a



the active, quasi-active, principal and extra part of an inference rule are not changed by its permutation up or down, in a given proof. the context part of an inference can change during inference permutation. the appropriate changes in the context have been specified in detail.



theorem 4.7 if we eliminate redundant steps in a given proof prior to any other proof transformation(i.e. prior to any permutation), then a permutation of a strong additive rule j over a unary rule i results only in the permutation result of the form



success in a proof search is not simply a matter of finding a proof, but of providing more information about provability. parts of a constructive proof may be irrelevant to the actual computation which results. it is also obvious that a more efficient implementation of proof search strategies demands the finer control and management of the formulae involved in the proof-search.



we will briefly, informally explain our approach on the propositional fragment of linear logic excluding contraction and binary additive rules. these rules may be incorporated into what follows without much difficulty. also, in the rest of this section we restrict our attention to detection and elimination of unused formulae that appear in the succedent only.
