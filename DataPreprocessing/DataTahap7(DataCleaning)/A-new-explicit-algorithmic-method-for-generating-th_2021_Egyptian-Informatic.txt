number theory has many increasingly important applications in computer science and cryptography. one of the central topics of number theory is the prime numbers. the prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1, which have no positive divisors other than 1 and itself but the natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called composite numbers.



the reset of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, the proposed method for generating the prime numbers is given along with its algorithm. in section 3, a unified framework is proposed to obtain the sieves of eratosthenes and sundaram using our proposed method. conclusion is summarized in section 4.
