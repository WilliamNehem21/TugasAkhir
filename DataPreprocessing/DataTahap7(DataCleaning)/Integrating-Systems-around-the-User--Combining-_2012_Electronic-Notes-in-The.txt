interactive theorem proving today permits the verification of sophisticated theorems and complex algorithms, although the process remains cumbersome and timeconsuming. we believe that in many instances, access to other tools such as computer algebra systems(cas) can accelerate this process. whilst there have been significant advances in combining provers with external tools, as described in previous work, the increased complexity of current proof developments places new demands and challenges on tool integrations.
