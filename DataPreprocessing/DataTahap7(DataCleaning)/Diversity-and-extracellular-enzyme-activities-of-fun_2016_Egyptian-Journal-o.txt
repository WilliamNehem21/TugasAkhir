endophytes have been explored for diverse applications owing to their production of extracellular enzymes. the enzymes function so as to obtain nutrition from their host, hydrolyze food substances and are involved in eliciting defense mechanisms against pathogens. there is an imperative need to discover and utilize diverse novel enzymes with high stability for industrial processes. the present work aims to examine the diversity of endophytic fungal assemblages and their ability to produce extracellular enzymes in selected plants.
