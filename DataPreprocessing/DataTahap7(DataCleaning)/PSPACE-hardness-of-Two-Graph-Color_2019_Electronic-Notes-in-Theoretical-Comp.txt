proof. suppose that alice is the first to play and colors vertex r first(color 1 in the greedy game). then bob can color vertex t2(color 1). with this, s and t cannot be colored 1 and then bob can force t1 or t3 be colored with 4 by coloring one of the two black vertices(color 1) in his next turn.



now suppose that alice is the first to play and colors vertex s first(color 1). thus no vertex in{r1, r2, r3, t1, t2, t3} can be colored 1 and then all black vertices will be colored 1 in the greedy game coloring. therefore all vertices in{r1, r2, r3, t1, t2, t3} can be colored with 2 or 3 in the game. moreover, alice can color r and t in her second and third turns using the colors{2, 3} winning the game.
