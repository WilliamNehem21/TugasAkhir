applications of the methods have included multi-stage-inventory problems, planning and scheduling problems(ning and you, 2017) and treatment-length optimization problems in radiation therapy. in particular, robust optimization techniques that employ inexactly revealed data are of great interest in tainty sets involving the intersection of two ellipsoids and a nonconvex and nonhomogeneous quadratic function. it is known that generalizations of s-lemma for non-convex quadratic systems involving more than two quadratic functions are often not possible unless the system enjoys some hidden convexity(see example 2.1). for a survey of s-lemma and its generalizations, see polik(2007), jeyakumar et al.(2009a) and derinkuyu and pinar(2006).



established in jeyakumar et al.(2009b), do not yield corresponding s-lemma type results for diagonal matrices due to homogenization of the given non-homogeneous system. simplified s-lemma results are known for homogeneous systems involving diagonal matrices in bental et al.(2009); polik(2007)
