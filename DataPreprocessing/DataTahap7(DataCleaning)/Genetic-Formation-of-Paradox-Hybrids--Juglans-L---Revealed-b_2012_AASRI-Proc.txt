juglans sect. rhysocaryon with 16 black walnut species is unusual in the angiosperms for its intercontinental and insular distribution endemic to and spanning the americas. this indicates a great potential in association with crop improvement of the persian walnut(j. regia of sect. juglans, commonly used for nut-producing) and high quality wood for cabinetry as well as agroforestry potential for rehabilitating degraded areas such as cloud forest areas. therefore, an in-depth study on the paradox would be valuable for walnut breeding and the commercial industry.
