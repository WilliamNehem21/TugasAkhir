rewriting logic is a very expressive formalism for the specification of concurrent and distributed systems; more generally, it is a logic of change. in contrast, vlrl is a modal logic built on top of rewriting logic to reason precisely about that change. here we present a technique to mechanically prove vlrl properties of rewrite theories using the reflective capability of rewriting logic through its maude implementation.



rewriting logic provides a formal framework for modelling concurrent systems in terms of states and state transitions, which is efficiently implemented in the maude system. it is a logic of change in which deduction directly corresponds to the change. in contrast, the verification logic for rewriting logic(vlrl) is an action modal logic to talk about change in a more indirect and global manner, like other modal and temporal logics. vlrl was developed to prove abstract properties of systems specified in rewriting logic.
