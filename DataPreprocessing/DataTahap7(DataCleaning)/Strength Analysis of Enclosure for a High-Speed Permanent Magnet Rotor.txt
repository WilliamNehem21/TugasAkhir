the most important task of the rotor design is the reliable operation of the high-speed pm rotor. with the increase of rotor speed, the interference fit between the pm and enclosure will decrease. on the other hand, the interference fit between the pm and enclosure could be changed due to the different temperature expansibility of pm and enclosure. the contact pressure between the pm and enclosure must be large enough over the whole speed range in order to guarantee the pm withstanding compressive stress.
