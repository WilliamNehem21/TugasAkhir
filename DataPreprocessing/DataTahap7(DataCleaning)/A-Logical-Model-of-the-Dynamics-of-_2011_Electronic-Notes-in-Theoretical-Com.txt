when we delete links, in the case of[x< y], the situation is more complicated. we would have to repair by deleting more links, and there need be no unique maximal way of doing this. this means that the operation of upgrading preferences so as to make them strict, while retaining transitivity is non-deterministic. for the remainder of the paper, we will consider only the case this non-transitivitypreserving but deterministic operator, so as to simplify the dynamics. 4 initially in state z then she cannot stay there, and y or n are the only places to go. also, by lemma 5.2, it can never enter state i. so the only way to loop is by swtiching from y to n and back. by symmetry again, we can assume that n, a|= y and n+ 1,a|= n. this can only happen by strong suggestion, so n, a|= sn, which implies n, a|= f n.
