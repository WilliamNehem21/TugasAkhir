the arrival of massive amount of expression data puts the emphasis on computational methods to overcome the difficulties of interpretation of experimental data. instead of providing a clear explanation of biological systems, data reveals the difficulty for analyzing them. the variety of components and their interacting capabilities lead to cope with their complexity. this opens a field of modeling to investigate computational biological systems.



the paper is organized as follows: section 2 gives the basics of brn. the core of the paper is in section 3 where we give a formal semantics for brn. in section 4 we show on a small example how to use the tool hytech to analyze a brn.
