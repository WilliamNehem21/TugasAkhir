inside q, so that the next intersection vertex along this component, i1, is marked as exit, the second next, i2, as entry, and so on. for the second component of p, its first vertex p6 is found to lie outside q, hence i5 gets an entry and i6 an exit label, etc. for q, the algorithm determines that q1 lies outside p and then marks i2, this time as a vertex of q, as entry, then i7 as exit, and so forth.
