self-sustain(pramanik, 2016). population pressure on agricultural land and strong demand for foods necessitate speedy production or high-yield agriculture. due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, insufficient irrigation infrastructure, insufficient transportation systems, depleted soil fertility, soil erosion, and other factors, agricultural production has fallen quickly(de la rosa and sobral, 2008).



there has been a significant amount of research on site suitability studies utilising mcdm and ml techniques, including site suitability assessment for rice cultivation, site suitability for agriculture(zaredar and jafari, 2010), for land management purposes(rojas and loubier, 2017) for land-use suitability for land suitability analysis for various crops, for avulsion potential zone construction(pal and sarkar, 2018), for the recognition of touristic potential zones, site suitability for conservation of water(srdjevic and medeiros, 2007) and water management, predicting the soil suitability; prediction of cardiac disease; mapping the risk terrain for crime(wheeler and steenbeek, 2021) and executing surface and pressurized irrigation system, etc.



in this study, the fcopras(fuzzy complex proportional assessment), ahp, and machine learning approaches, namely random forest and multilayer perceptron have been used to discover the potentiality of the soil for agriculture, and roc and accuracy techniques have been also applied to estimate the proficiency of the applied models and algorithms. before arriving at the outcome, the weight of the alternatives for each variable was calculated(malczewski and boroushaki, 2008; murayam and bunruamkaew, 2011) using ahp. the opinions of three experts were considered in the whole process of the fcopras. to aggregate the performing variables, the wlcm(weighted linear combination method) was used.



vantageous uses of the geographic information system(gis) is the study of site suitability and preparation of land use maps. gis and multicriteria decision analysis(mcda) can be used well enough for planning and managing how agricultural land is used(adeniyi, 1993; shearer and xiang, 2009). gis makes it easy to store, process, and analyse complex raw data at plenty of different levels. combining mcdm and machine learning(ml) with geographic information sys-



physical soil parameter related to soil porosity, soil moisture, and hydraulic conductivity, which is essential for soil quality evaluation and land use management. crop health is dependent on a sufficient supply of rainfall and soil nutrients, among other things.



multilayer perceptron algorithms. one of the most basic feedforward neural networks is the multilayer perceptron. multilayer perceptrons are bidirectional neural networks in which the inputs are propagated forward and the weights are propagated backward(breiman, 2001). a multilayer perceptron has an input layer and an output layer with one or more hidden layers. all mlps connect all neurons in one layer to all neurons in the next layer. the input layer receives the input signals, and the output layer performs the intended task. all of the calculations are done by the hidden layers.
