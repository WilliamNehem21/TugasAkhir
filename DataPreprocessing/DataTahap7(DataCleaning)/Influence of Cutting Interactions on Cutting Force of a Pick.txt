in mechanized continuous mining, selection of most appropriate machines and operational parameters heavily depends on the estimation of drum reactive torque and forces that are directly related to the forces acting on the individual picks of the drum. in addition, optimizing pick design also needs to have a good understanding of the forces acting on picks. therefore, it is important to accurately predict the forces acting on a pick during mining production.



in rock cutting, a pick is subject to three orthogonal forces, namely cutting force(also called drag force), normal force and sideway force(also called lateral force). this paper focuses on the cutting force as it is a major concern of existing literature. researchers focus on the cutting force because it is the major force to form and remove chips from rock. it directly affects specific energy. a lot of research effort has been made to calculate(predict) the cutting force of a pick[3-8]. various cutting force models including theoretical, empirical, semi-empirical and numerical models have been developed. although these models have various forms, consider different factors and developed based on different pick types(e.g., radial and point-attack), depth of cut(doc) is always a major variable. for example, both evans and goktan indicated that cutting force is proportional to the square of doc, but yilmaz et al revealed that the cutting force had a linear relationship with doc while liu et al demonstrated that the cutting force had an exponential relationship with doc based on their laboratory experiments.
