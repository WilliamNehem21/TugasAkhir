we consider a generic proto-cell model consisting of any conservative chemical reaction network embedded within a membrane. the membrane results from the self-assembly of one of the chemical species(membrane precursor) and is semi-permeable to some other chemical species(nutrients) diffusing from an outside growth medium into the proto-cell. inside the proto-cell, nutrients are metabolized into all other chemical species including the membrane precursor, and the membrane grows in area and the proto-cell in volume.



embedded crn, nutrients are metabolized into all other constituents, including the membrane precursor that gets incorporated into the membrane. the membrane thus grows in area and the proto-cell in volume, thereby diluting all constituents. a stationary growth regime was typically reached in previously proposed models[2,3,4], but it is unclear what grants such a property to the proto-cell. the present work addresses this question by proving necessary and sufficient conditions for such stationary proto-cell growth.



we introduce a generic proto-cell model consisting of any conservative chemical reaction network(crn) embedded within a membrane. the membrane results from the self-assembly of one of the chemical species participating in the crn(membrane precursor). this membrane is semi-permeable to some other chemical species(nutrient) diffusing across the membrane between an outside growth medium and the inside of the proto-cell. we prove a simple algebraic necessary condition as well as a topological sufficient condition for stationary proto-cell growth. both conditions are independent of reaction kinetics, membrane characteristics or nutrient flux.



this paper is organized as follows. section 2 presents the proto-cell model. section 3 gives the proof of the simple algebraic necessary condition as well as that of the sufficient topological condition. section 4 is devoted to discussion. and section 5 gives a conclusion.



lemma 3.4 for any moiety or positive linear combination of moieties b that is fed with some nutrient flux bt fnu> 0 and such that all concentrations for chemical species in sme admit strictly positive lower bounds, the corresponding quantity bt a has an upper bound. in particular, d= mt a is bounded.



lemma 3.7 if every siphon containing any species in sme contains the support of a moiety, and if this moiety is fed, then the concentrations of all species in sme have strictly positive lower bounds for all times after a sufficient time(i.e. are persistent).



proof. it is based upon the previous work of angeli et al that gives a sufficient condition for persistence(of any species) in a chemical system. this sufficient condition is that any siphon includes the support of a moiety. their proof relies upon a key result(proposition 5.4. in) which we restate here in a slightly different wording:



proof. if every siphon containing any species in sme also contains the support of a moiety b, and if this moiety is fed with some nutrient flux fnu, bt fnu> 0, lemma 3.7 ensures that all species in sme are persistent. applying lemma 3.4 to the particular case of the mass ensures that if all species in sme are persistent, then the cytoplasmic density d is bounded. and lemma 3.3 ensures that if d is bounded, the proto-cell dynamical system has a stationary point. persistence of all species in sme further ensures that this stationary point corresponds to a positive growth rate.



the sufficient condition for stationary growth is verified by a broad range of networks. generating numerically large random conservative crns with arbitrary stoichiometry, we have found that once the crn reaches a certain number of reactions, the quasi-totality of these networks are such that the only siphon is the full set of species, so that the sufficient condition is verified for any choice of membrane precursor ame, sme, or nutrients snu. it could thus appear that a broad range of chemical reaction networks are compatible with the emergence of life.
