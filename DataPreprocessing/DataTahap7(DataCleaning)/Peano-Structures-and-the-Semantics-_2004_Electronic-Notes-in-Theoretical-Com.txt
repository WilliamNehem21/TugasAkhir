a similar treatment for general iteration seems to be non-existent. one motivation may be the lack of a clear inductive definition of the domain of general iterates, whereas primitive iterates(and even functions definable by primitive recursion) can be easily defined by induction on the carrier of a peano algebra. however, general iteration has received an algebraic treatment using closure theory[5,8], iteration theories and coalgebras.
