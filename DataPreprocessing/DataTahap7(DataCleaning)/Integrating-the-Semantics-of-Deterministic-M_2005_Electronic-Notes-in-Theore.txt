because there are different participant classes in the development and use of communication systems, the event and the state viewpoints must use different representation schemes. because the participants must be able to access to all information they need, the representation schemes must be powerful enough. to reason about the whole system and guarantee the coherence between the viewpoints, the two representation schemes must share the same semantics. formal semantics of event driven representation schemes include traces and lts. for state driven programming languages, analysts may adopt system be able to execute the feature. the body depicts the events that the subscriber(l) and the other features(r) must launch, and the predicates that must be satisfied. the post-condition indicates the new status of the subscriber and which events are launched, after the execution of the body.
