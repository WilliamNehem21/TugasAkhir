during the last couple of decades, many new and different data models have been introduced. first, so called semantic data models have been developed[17,33,47], which were originally just meant to be used as design aids, as application semantics was assumed to be easier captured by these models. later on some of these models, especially the nested relational model, objectoriented and object-relational models[6,24,43,44] have become interesting as data models in their own right and some dependency and normalisation theory has been carried over to these advanced data models[25,26,27,39,41,46,52]. most recently, the major research interest is on the model of semi-structured data and xml. work on integrity constraints in the context of xml can be found in[2,15,23,22,51]. one key problem is to develop dependency theories(or preferably a unified theory) for these advanced data models. biskup
