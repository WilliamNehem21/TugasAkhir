software patches are made available to fix security vulnerabilities, enhance performance, and usability. previous works focused on measuring the performance effect of patches on benchmark runtimes. in this study, we used the top-down microarchitecture analysis method to understand how pipeline bottlenecks were affected by the application of the spectre and meltdown security patches. bottleneck analysis makes it possible to better understand how different hardware resources are being utilized, highlighting portions of the pipeline where possible improvements could be achieved. we complement the top-down analysis technique with the use a normalization technique from the field of economics, purchasing power parity(ppp), to better understand the relative difference between patched and unpatched runs. in this study, we showed that security patches had an effect that was reflected on the corresponding top-down metrics. we showed that recent compilers are not as negatively affected as previously reported. out of the 14 benchmarks that make up the spec omp2012 suite, three had noticeable slowdowns when the patches were applied. we also found that top-down metrics had large relative differences when the security patches were applied, differences that standard techniques based in absolute, non-normalized, metrics failed to highlight.



in january 2008, two major vulnerabilities were reported, spectre and meltdown[1,2]. these vulnerabilities made it possible for attackers to gain access to data, stored in memory or caches, by bypassing security mechanisms. the exploits took advantage of cpu features that make it possible to use speculative execution to increase cpu performance. it was fear that the security fixes would have a major detrimental effect on performance by possible curtailing the speculation capabilities of cpus.



a number of cray supercomputers were used to analyse the effects patches had on runtime performance. a number of benchmarks were tested, and it was found that the overall impact of the security patches was minimal. another study, showed the effects different patches had on two computational intensive workflows, pmatlab and keras with tensorflow, on a intel based cluster. it reported that significant negative effects, up to 21% for pmatlab and 16% for tensorflow, once the cpu microcode update was applied.



the meltdown vulnerability allows an attacker to gain read access to all memory, even when lacking the appropriate privileges to do so. the spectre exploit allows attackers to gain access to private information through branch mispredictions. for this study, we focused on the effect the patches had on pipeline bottlenecks. the following variant security patches were provided the os vendor and applied to the system:[11,12]: category if it is a back end stall. otherwise, it will be assigned to the frontend bound category. back end stalls occur when there are not enough resources in the back end portion of the pipeline to handle new slots. front end stalls take place when the front end cannot supply slots to the back end portion of the pipeline. non stalled slots are classified as bad speculation, when a slot will never retire due to an incorrect speculation, or slots were blocked by the pipeline due to recovery operations due to an earlier bad speculation. retired slots are the slots that successfully completed their operations.



it is possible to disable the spectre variant 2 and meltdown variant 3 through an interface made available by the red hat linux vendor, which is also available to the centos distribution. the vendor also made available a script to check the state of the security patches, to see whether or not the system currently has its patches enabled or disabled. in this study, version 3.1 of the verification script was analysed the effects of the security patches through the use of the topdown classification method to see how bottlenecks were affected on a subset of benchmarks. we showed that while benchmark runtimes were similar, their bottleneck profiles were different. with the use of ppp techniques, we were able to highlight and quantify these relative differences when compared to the baseline, a system with its security patches disabled.



the dsb metric decreased when patches were enabled. while the number of uops that were delivered to the instruction decode queue remained the same or had a slight decrease, there were increases in cpu_clk_unhalted.thread_any, the divisor. this resulted in more cpu cycles for the same number of delivered uops for all the benchmarks. for instance, 370.mgrid331 and 350.md had increases of 46% and 28.16% for cpu_clk_unhalted.thread_any, resulting in



the backend bound metric measures the fraction of slots where no uops were delivered to the backend portion of the pipeline due to bottlenecks in the computational or memory subsystems. this metric is further divided into memory and core bound subcategories. in this study, the following memory subsystem stalls due to load accesses were tracked through their corresponding top-down metrics: l1, l2, l3 and dram. additionally, the store bound metric tracks stalls due to store memory accesses.



l2 bound rates were higher when the security patches were enabled. this was attributed to large increases in the l2_bound_ratio rates, higher execution stalls for l1 cache misses, cycle_activity.stalls_l1d_miss, and a decrease in cpu_clk_unhalted.thread. 370.mgrid 331 had an increase of 32.11% while 359.botsspar and 371.applu331 had increases in the low highest ppp rates occurred when the ports utilization had the largest increase while the core cycles decreased the most. this is the case for 360.ilbdc. it had a ppp rate of 80.01%, because of an increase in the ports utilization rate of 44.63% and a drop in the core cycle count of



the bad speculation metric is used to account for the slots that were wasted due to incorrect speculation. these uops will never get retired. in this study, we analysed one additional subcategory, branch mispredicts, which had relevance due to its rates. the branch mispredicts metric tracks slots that were affected by wasted uops that were fetched from an incorrectly speculated path, or stalls that occur when the out-of-order portion of the machine needs to recover its state from a speculative path. with patches enabled, 350.md had an increase in the bad speculation rate, while the misprediction machine clears fraction remained the same. for these two benchmarks, the effect of the patches was a decrease in the number of bad speculation events resulting in a lower branch mispredicts rate. 370.mgrid had a 6.82% increase due to an increase in the misprediction machine clears ratio.



in this study, we analysed the effects that the spectre and meltdown security patches had on cpu pipeline bottlenecks. previous studies reported the effects patches had on performance, by focusing on two computationally intensive workflows on an intel based cluster, and on a diverse set of multiple benchmarks on different cray based clusters. the first study ran different tests under different conditions: before patches were applied, and with patches applied one at a time. this strategy was very comprehensive because some of the security patches, the bios and microcode fixes, could not be disabled once they were applied. the authors found that there was a negative effect when patches were applied and even when they disabled some of the patches via the vendor provided tunable feature, the performance degradation on their workflows was significant. the microcode and bios fixes had a major impact on performance. the second study reported minimal effect on their results. the systems used in their experiments were compared before and after all of the recommended patches were applied.



its regular backend bound rates stayed relative little change between patch settings, 3.90%. its ppp normalized rate was found to be 28.86%, because its cycle count increased by 46.04% between patch settings. for both benchmarks, there were more cycles for the amount of stalls as compared to the baseline, so the cycles became overvalued.



other techniques, such as the roofline model, can give users an idea of how their code is performing relative to memory and floatingpoint peak performance. another approach is to use statistical methods to model performance based on metrics such as cache hit rates and memory latencies. these tools can provide information on how performance is affected when changes to the system settings or the code base are made. but they have some limitations. statistical models



we showed that top-down classification metrics varied when the security patches were enabled. we were able to quantify the relative changes when compared to a baseline run. additionally, the use of ppp normalized rates made it possible to put into context the large percentage changes reported by the relative difference between metrics. the next step is to understand the effects these relative changes, which are not reflected in regular metrics, have on power efficiency. our goal is to identify relationships between cpu pipeline bottlenecks and power efficiency before and after patches are applied. other works have focused on the effect spectre and meltdown patches had on power efficiency by focusing in models based on performance metrics, for instance instructions-per-cycle, and branches-per-cycle, to develop models. our future work will focus in understanding the relation between ppp rates and power efficiency.
