the connective exclusive or(xor, for short) plays an important role in computer programming. for example, it is used as a primitive operation in many encryption algorithm(e.g, des, blowfish, rc5, cast, rijndael)[29,47]. the one-time pad is an encryption algorithm where the plaintext is combined with a random



in the literature, special attention has been given to the research on the validity of many classical logic tautologies in fuzzy logic, especially those that are related to fuzzy implications. fuzzy implications have been widely studied, playing important roles in different domains[18,19,46,48,51,52,54,55]. recent papers studied different classes of fuzzy implications[2,4,5,12,18,44,53].



in fuzzy logic, one can use the xor connective in order to evaluate the degree with which one and only one of its immediate antecedents is true. unfortunately, in the literature, there is no autonomous definitions for that fuzzy connective, in the sense that it would be independent from the other connectives. in the following, we introduce a definition for the fuzzy xor connective satisfying this condition of independence.
