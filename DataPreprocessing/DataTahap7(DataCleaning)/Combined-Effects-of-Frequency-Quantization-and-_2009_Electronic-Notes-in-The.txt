gardner also examined numerically the case where the input signal was embedded in additive white gaussian noise, and attempted to derive some rules of thumb to indicate how this additive noise interacted with the quantization jitter. though some characterization of the output noise was done, the results obtained were only moderately accurate, and were only valid within certain regimes. no overall understanding of the problem was arrived upon.



the second, intermediate, region is where the additive noise starts to have an effect, but there is also still a significant dependency on the quantization level, demonstrating that the additive noise and inherent jitter are interacting in some way. the region encompasses several orders of magnitude on both the input and output variance axes, and there are points where, for example, the output variance has risen to over an order of magnitude above the noise-free level, but quantization still has an significant effect. given this, an understanding of the behaviour in this region should be of interest to pll designers. in addition it was noted that the pdf of the output jitter becomes closer to gaussian as this intermediate region is traversed.



the final region is where the output variance is independent of quantization, and the graph of the output variance is a line of slope 1. this, as expected, and as noted in, is exactly the response of a linear, analogue pll. the pdf of the output in this region is close to gaussian.
