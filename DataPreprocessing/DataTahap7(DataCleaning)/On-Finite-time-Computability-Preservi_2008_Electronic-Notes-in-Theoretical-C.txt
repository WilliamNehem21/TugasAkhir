in such an implementation, the output infinite list is constructed from the input infinite list. in many cases, the whole output list is constructed with infinite number of cons operations. however, one can also construct the output list by applying finite number of list operations tail and cons to the argument. in other words, the output infinite list is constructed by concatenating a finite list and a suffix of the input, both of which are computed from the input infinite list. in this case, one can construct the output infinite list in a finite time when the input infinite list is given.
