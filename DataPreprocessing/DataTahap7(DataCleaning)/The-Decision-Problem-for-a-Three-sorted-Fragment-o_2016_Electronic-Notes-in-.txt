more recently, in, the three-level quantified syllogistic 3lqsr, involving variables of three sorts has been shown to have a decidable satisfiability problem. the decision algorithm for 3lqsr was inspired by the procedure presented in to prove the decidability of 3lsspu. in particular, the notion of relativized interpretation introduced in, can be seen as a variant of the notion of assignment of the small model defined in. the language 3lqsr, as well as its extension 3lqstr introduced in this paper, does not allow one to express the construct of general union. the latter construct, on the other hand, is a primitive operator of 3lsspu. later, in, the satisfiability problem for 4lqsr, a four-level quantified syllogistic admitting variables of four sorts, has been proved to be decidable. the latter result has been exploited in to prove that the quite expressive description logic are the atoms allowed in the fragment 2ls(two-level syllogistic) which has been proved decidable in. since x={x1,..., xk} is a level 0 quantifier-free atomic formula in 3lqstr, 2ls with finite enumerations turns out to be expressible by 3lqstr-formulae.



is not a purely universal formula of level 0, and the variables x1,..., xn are not linked to z. as we will see below, in the general case we need 3lqsr-formulae of an exponential length in n, thus showing that the fragment 3lqstr is strictly
