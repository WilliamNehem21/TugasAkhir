the fukui function(ff)[46,47] of a molecule provides information about reactive sites and the method of understanding as well as categorizing chemical reactions. the atom with the highest ff value is highly reactive site as compared to the other atoms in the molecule. the use of the fukui functions for the site selectivity in title molecule for nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks has been made with special emphasis on the dependence of the fukui values with the basis of b3lyp/6-311g(d, p) level of theory. using the mullikan atomic charges of neutral, cation, and anion, state of nearly same as, 2-{[5-(adamantan-1-yl)-4-methyl-4h-1,2,4-tria zol-3-yl]sulfanyl}-n,n-dimethylethanamine, and nearly one fifth of thiazole azo dyes. urea is benchmark compound for nlo properties, therefore we compare our results with urea. the calculated value of hyperpolarizibily of the compound is nearly nine times greater than hyperpolarizibily of urea so it is a good claimant as a nlo material.
