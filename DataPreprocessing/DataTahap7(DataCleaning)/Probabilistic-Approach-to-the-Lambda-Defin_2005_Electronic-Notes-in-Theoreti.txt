in this section we present some properties of numbers characterizing the amount of types of different ranks. we may observe that many results and methods could be rephrased purely in terms of binary trees with given properties. obviously any type of size n can be seen as a binary tree with n leaves. more advanced type counting can be found moczurad, tyszkiewicz, zaionc. see also kostrzycka and zaionc and.
