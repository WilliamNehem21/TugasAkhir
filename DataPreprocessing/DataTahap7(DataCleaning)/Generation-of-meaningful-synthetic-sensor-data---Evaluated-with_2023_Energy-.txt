not possible due to data privacy issues. moreover, the ground truth data of the individual appliances that compose the readings of the smart meters is not always complete or even available, and collecting this data is also problematic. in practice, it is necessary to use already trained models and transfer them to other households, as data acquisition for individual households would be extremely time consuming and expensive, making it effectively impossible to train individual models per household.



for this reason, transferability is vastly more challenging for nilm tasks than it is in other domains. training with relatively few households is expected to result in models whose performance is not robust to transferability. however, for the reasons mentioned above, it is practically impossible to collect data from a sufficient number of households to train robust and general models.



in order to generate useful data, it is necessary to analyze which factors affect the nilm models and how. we demonstrate that it is essential to understand how the synthetic data must be generated to train transferable ml models. in this work, we highlight the impact of unknown appliances in the smart meter data, for which we introduce the concept of unassigned power consumption(upc).1 upc pertains to appliances for which no ground truth data is available. as we will demonstrate in this work, the upc has a significant impact on how nilm models can be trained in a reliable manner.



this work is organized as follows. it starts with an analysis of related work(section 2). we then explain in detail how smart meter data is structured, the concept of upc, and how we are able to generate synthetic data(section 3), before explaining the methodology we developed to reliably compare the quality of energy data using nilm algorithms(section 4). we then describe how we prepare the data for our synthetic datasets and how we design the experiments to evaluate the impact of unknown appliances in smart meter data on training robust ml models(section 5). finally, we present the results of the extensive evaluation using statistical methods as well as the developed methodology(section 6) and discuss the results of our work(section 7).



examining whether the patterns learned by one appliance can be transferred to other appliances. most of the papers investigate whether nilm algorithms of an appliance can be transferred to different domains(e.g., other households), a topic we understand as cross-domain transferability. in this work, we focus on cross-domain transferability, hereafter abbreviated as transferability. we understand transferability as the ability of a model developed for a specific dataset to be generalized to new households not present in the training set.



with antgen, the authors introduced a tool(available on github4) that was used to create synthetic data based on real-world data. to evaluate the generated synthetic data, different nilm models were trained and tested on this data. also, for comparison, different nilm models were trained and tested exclusively on the real data(on freely available datasets). however, the authors only examine whether nilm models can be trained on the generated data, they do not consider the transferability of nilm models.



trained on it. unless a clear-cut correspondence between a selected stochastic metric for data and the performance of nilm models on this data is established, this approach is not reliable. klemenjak et al. present metrics to measure the transferability of nilm models, but we consider them also insufficient due to the instability of the models given



the following section describes in more detail the approach we use to generate the synthetic energy datasets to highlight the impact of unknown appliances in smart meter data. first, we categorize the appliances that contribute to the aggregated smart meter data of a typical household(see section 3.1). we then introduce the concept of unassigned power consumption(see section 3.2), before describing syntised, the simulation framework we use to generate the synthetic data for this work(see section 3.3).



multi patterns include appliances, such as a washing machine or a dishwasher, with different operations and therefore different pcps, which can vary not only in length but also in process steps. for example, a washing machine is capable of running different programs, e.g. a short and a long wash program, which can result in completely different pcps.



iawe or uk-dale). there can be many reasons for this, such as cost or the fact that not all appliances are well suited for recording. however, this means that there are always appliances in a household that contribute to the smart meter data, but there is no ground truth data available.



when generating synthetic data, using only a few known appliancelevel data can result in very simple smart meter data without the typical noise. during our work, we observed that training on clean data does not contribute to better performance of nilm models in terms of transferability(see section 6). to address this issue, we introduce the concept of unassigned power consumption(upc).



with our approach of extracting the upc, unsynchronized time series, i.e. time shifts between the ground truth data and the smart meter data, can occur due to the different recording sensors, resulting in negative values. since negative values are not realistic in smart meter data, all negative values are set to zero.



having established the evaluation methodology, we are now able to reliably compare data using nilm algorithms. furthermore, we are capable of generating single and multi pattern appliance type data using syntised. with these elements, we are now in a position to address the goal of this work, which is to determine the impact of unknown appliances in smart meter data on training robust ml models for transferability.



in this section, we describe how to prepare the data of a public dataset in order to be able to generate synthetic data(see section 5.1), before we describe in detail how to generate the synthetic datasets we used for the evaluation(see section 5.2). after that, we describe the nilm disaggregation algorithms we selected for the evaluation(see section 5.3). finally, we explain how we set up the experimental environment to achieve the goal of this work(see section 5.4).



as already described, syntised uses real appliance data to generate virtual smart meter data(see section 3.3). for this study, the appliance data is derived from the gelap dataset. an advantage of this dataset is that the appliances contained therein are available separately(ground truth data) as well as aggregated(smart meter data). there are



the other is the multi pattern type, which includes appliances with multiple programs and more complicated pcps. since an extensive evaluation with all the necessary details for all instances of both appliance types would be beyond the scope of this work, we examined one appliance each that is representative of its pattern type. we select the particular instances kettle and washing machine, where the kettle represents the single pattern type, while the washing machine represents the multi pattern type(see section 3.1).



kettle and four households that contain a washing machine. in the following experiments, these households will serve as training and validation data. the remaining real households of the gelap dataset are not synthesized and were used as test households for the evaluation.



the third dataset, hereafter called mupc(mapped upc), is also based on the noupc dataset and is basically created like the ndupc dataset, except that a different upc is used. instead of using the synthetic noise, this dataset is created with upc where all negative values are set to zero(see section 3.2). the purpose of this dataset is to test whether it matters for the transferability of nilm models how exactly the upc is constructed and whether it matters if the upc is close to the real data upc.



the last state-of-the-art algorithm we test is the window gated recurrent units(windowgru). it is a neural network that was developed based on rnns and is similar in structure, but the lstm units of the neural network were replaced by gated recurrent units(gru). the goal was to reduce redundancies and also computational overhead without affecting the performance. the windowgru is the most computationally intensive algorithm presented in this work.



now that we have defined the environment and constraints for our experiments to determine the impact of unknown appliances in smart meter data on training robust ml models for transferability, we can run them and evaluate the results. in this section we present the results of the statistical comparison of the synthetic datasets as well as the results of the comparison using the nilm algorithms(see section 6.1). we also compare the models of the synthetic dataset that provide the best results for the nilm models with the models trained on real data(see section 6.2).



the presented results demonstrate that transferable nilm models can be meaningfully trained on synthetic data. considering the first research question of this work, we can definitely conclude that we are able to meaningfully train transferable nilm models on synthetic data when the data is generated with upc. in certain cases these models even perform significantly better in terms of transferability than models trained on real data. the question remains why this is the case, even though we generated the synthetic data based on real-world data, so they are comparable to a certain extent. however, the method we use to generate the upc(we subtract all known appliances from the smart meter data) causes spikes in the upc if the signals from the recorded appliance and smart meter sensors are not perfectly aligned. this means that these spikes occur in the synthetic data, but not in the real data. interestingly, the spikes appear to be quite similar to the pcps of the tested single pattern type appliance, where we demonstrated the largest performance improvements for the nilm models. these additional false positive pcps in the upc potentially increase the learning challenge for the nilm models and thus may help improve their robustness for transferability. however, this assumption needs to be confirmed by further experiments.



our results demonstrate that this work is essential for understanding how synthetic energy data needs to be structured in order to train meaningful ml models. an key factor in reaching this conclusion was to reliably evaluate the quality of data using nilm models. we are convinced that the results of this work provide a crucial baseline for understanding synthetic data that can be further strengthened. our methodology demonstrates that it allows to reliably evaluate energy data and also nilm models. this enables the design and deployment of improved energy data and nilm models in the future, which are important for ml-based energy management and optimization systems.



we focus our nilm evaluation on appliances that need to be activated by a user, because they represent the vast majority of appliances in a typical household, resulting in two appliance types(see section 3.1). since an extensive evaluation with all the necessary details for all instances of both appliance types would be beyond the scope of this work, we examined one appliance each that is representative of its pattern type.
