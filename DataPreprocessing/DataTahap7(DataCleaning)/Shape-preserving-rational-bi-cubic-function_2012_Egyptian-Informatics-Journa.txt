abstract the study is dedicated to the development of shape preserving interpolation scheme for monotone and convex data. a rational bi-cubic function with parameters is used for interpolation. to preserve the shape of monotone and convex data, the simple data dependent constraints are developed on these parameters in each rectangular patch. the developed scheme of this paper is confined, cheap to run and produce smooth surfaces.



monotonicity is a key tool for the specification of digital to analog converters(dacs), analog to digital converters(adcs) and sensors. these devices are enormously used in control system applications. erythrocyte sedimentation rate(esr) in cancer patients, uric acid level in patients suffering from gout, approximation of couples and quasi couples in statistics are a few other monotone quantities. convexity arises in the data generated in nonlinear programming, scientific applications such as design, optimal control, parameter estimation and approximations.



asaturyan proposed a subdivision scheme for convex surface data interpolation. the rectangular patches in which convexity was lost were identified and divided into nine subrectangles. convexity preserving interpolation scheme was applied on these sub-rectangles. it was observed that change in a sub-rectangle affected the whole domain thus established



the paper underlines the problem of monotone and convex data interpolation. the data values are interpolated by rational bi-cubic function. this rational bi-cubic function enjoys eight parameters in each rectangular patch. the range of these parameters is determined to ensure shape preservation of data. the developed schemes of this paper deal positively to both data and data with derivatives, assure local command on the surface and promise c1 smoothness.
