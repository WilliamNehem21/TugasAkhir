in 2006, g. hamrin and v. stoltenberg-hansen investigated a class of special continuous domains, within which each domain has an almost algebraic basis. an inspiration for the notion of an almost algebraic basis is due to. in that paper a



the paper is organized as follows. section 2 introduces some notions and definitions we need. section 3 discusses the properties of almost algebraic domains. section 4 investigates the properties of continuous l-domains endowed with countable, almost algebraic and m-closed bases and the function spaces among them. section 5 gives a cartesian closed category of continuous l-domains with almost algebraic bases.



since the class of continuous(resp. algebraic) l-domains is also closed under finite cartesian products, the above lemma, whose complete proof appears in[8, 9], shows that the category of continuous(resp. algebraic) l-domains with continuous functions is cartesian closed. moreover, it is one of the maximal cartesian closed subcategory of continuous domains.
