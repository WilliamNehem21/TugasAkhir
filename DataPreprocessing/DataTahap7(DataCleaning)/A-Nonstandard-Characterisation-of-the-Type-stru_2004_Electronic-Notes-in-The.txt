an alternative approach to this hierarchy is via algebraic domains with totality. the base domain will then be generated from the set of closed rational intervals. normann[5,6] proved a density theorem for this hierarchy, and showed that it may be characterised in the cartesian closed category of kuratowski limit spaces.



in the proof of this claim, we are relying on the transfer principle. the argument would have been unproblematic if c had been a genuine natural number. the transfer principle tells us that the argument then is unproblematic for hyperfinite c.
