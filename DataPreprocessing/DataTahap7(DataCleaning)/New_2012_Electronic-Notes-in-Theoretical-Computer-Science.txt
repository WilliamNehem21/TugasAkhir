the issue is related to the philosophical problem of the identity of indiscernibles. leibniz proposed that objects that have all the same properties must in fact be the same object. although the subject of much debate in the philosophical literature[8,9,14], it is certainly desirable in programming language semantics, especially object-oriented programming, to allow the existence of distinct but indiscernible semantic objects. but it can also be the source of much confusion, as is well known to anyone who has ever tried to explain to introductory java students why one should never compare strings with==.



the operational semantics of the language is defined by the small-step rules given below. in addition, there are context rules that define a standard shallow applicativeorder evaluation strategy(leftmost innermost, call-by-value) and left-to-right evaluation of tuples and expressions e.x.
