in the current work, six machine learning algorithms, specifically xgboost, random forest, lightgbm, adaboost, knn, and ann are used to train the data. on the basis of prediction accuracy, the best model is chosen for next stage of optimization. the following subsections present details about the theoretical framework used in the study.



the supervised learning algorithm xgboost, accurately predicts a target variable by combining the values of simpler variables. it implements regression trees as weak learners and minimizes the objective function by means of a convex loss function and penalty clause. the training procedure is iterative, with the addition of new trees for forecasting residues and errors and the execution of gradient boosting to minimize loss. instead of selecting the best model based on the data, xgboost parallelizes the dataset's boosting by training hundreds of models on diverse subsets.



the rf approach, which combines multiple independent decision trees to precisely anticipate new input data, is a key part of machine learning's supervised learning strategy. ensemble learning solves classification and regression problems. using each tree's projections and predictions, optuna hyperparameter tweaking minimizes overfitting and maintains accuracy. least squares create the decision tree, x(n) was separated into r1 and r2 after choosing the separation point(sp). calculating the minimal output y value by calculating c1 and c2. this means that(n) is this ap's optimal separation point from x.



knn is a popular regression technique that calculates distances between neighbors using weighting techniques. it provides more accuracy but is time-consuming. however, it necessitates adaptive neighbors and weighting to accommodate dataset properties, and traditional knn may not be accurate due to dataset density variations.. let{n j}k represent the target values of an instance's k nearest neighbors. after that, the conventional knn prediction yi for the i-th instance is calculated as shown below: 20. ideally, the number of neurons for the analysis should be set to 10. the feedforward neural network is a versatile tool that can be employed for various types of input-output mappings. the performance metric employed in this study is the mean squared error(mse), whereas the training method utilized is bayesian regularization(trainbr). although the trainbr approach normally takes longer, it may provide a high degree of generalization for difficult, constrained, or noisy datasets and adaptive weight minimization determines when training ends.
