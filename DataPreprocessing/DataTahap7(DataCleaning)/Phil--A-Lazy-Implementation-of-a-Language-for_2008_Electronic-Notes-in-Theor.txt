the matching mechanism employes a cost-based pattern transformation algorithm which searches for patterns in an approximate way(i.e. modulo renaming, insertion, and deletion of xml items) and ranks the results w.r.t. their cost. in order to improve efficiency, the implementation uses sophisticated indexing techniques and exploits laziness to automatically avoid the construction of unnecessary data structures. we analyzed both the expressiveness of our filtering language and the performance of the system using the well known xmark benchmark suite.



a more flexible approach is followed in approxxql[12,11], which is an approximate query language which provides a more sophisticated approximate matching mechanism. it is based on a cost-based query transformation algorithm which allows to rename, insert and delete xml items in order to find the best match between a pattern and a given xml document. however, this language is still rather simple and does not offer the full expressive power of modern query languages.



the filtering language has been implemented in the prototypical system phil using a lazy functional language(haskell). through a thorough experimental evaluation, we will show the convenience of such a lazy implementation and the usefulness of the undertaken approach. in particular, we will illustrate how laziness automatically avoids the construction of unneeded data structures and allows to directly obtain a simple and efficient implementation of the filtering language.



the rest of the paper is structured as follows. in section 2, we formalize our filtering language, while section 3 illustrates how the filtering problem can be reduced to a tree matching problem. in section 4, we outline our approximate pattern matching algorithm. section 5 provides some experiments and a qualitative as well as quantitative evaluation of the implementation of our methodology with a particular focus on the benefits offered by lazy functional languages in this application domain. finally, section 6 concludes.



filteronebest is an operator that allows one to search for the best approximate match between a given pattern and an xml document. approximate matching has to be intended modulo renaming, insertion and deletion of pattern items. more precisely, when no exact match is found, either some tag items of the filtering pattern may be renamed or new elements may be inserted/removed in order to find an approximate match. any insertion/deletion/renaming operation has a fixed cost. filteronebest returns the match with lower cost.



informally speaking, given a pattern, we try to generate a result for every position in the document where there is a tag that matches the pattern root. filteronebest then selects the position referring to the document subpart that better matches the pattern. when there is more than one best approximate match, the operator will only deliver the first one it discovered.



following, our methodology discards the injectivity property, which is required in the path inclusion problem. although this can imply a possible loss of precision of the computed results, the efficiency of the matching method is greatly improved, since the computed non-injective embeddings encompasses several injective embeddings at the same time. moreover, while the unordered path inclusion problem typically searches for exact answers(in a sense that the labels and the structure of the pattern tree are precisely embedded in the data tree), our goal is to find a match even when no exact instances of the pattern tree can be recognized inside the data tree.



insertion. a new tree node(corresponding to a tag selector) can be inserted into the pattern tree. however, it is not allowed to add a new root or new leaf nodes. in particular, leaf nodes cannot be inserted, because they represent user-dependent data which cannot be automatically inferred by the algorithm.



we start describing a basic procedure for approximate tree matching for ground patterns. next, we will add all the other components of a filtering rule(variables, conditions,...). the core algorithm is a slightly modified version of the one proposed by schlieder in which not only finds a single best match, but also allows to find all the best matches of a pattern tree w.r.t. a data tree.



in order to construct an approximate match of a pattern tree w.r.t. a data tree, some nodes may need to be inserted into the pattern tree or simply renamed. to avoid the explicit insertions of nodes into a pattern tree, we use a special encoding of the data tree which measures the insertion distance between two nodes in a data tree. formally, given two nodes u and v of a data tree d such that u is an ancestor of v, the insertion distance between u and v is the sum of the insertion costs of all nodes along the path from u to v(excluding u and v). moreover, information regarding label renaming of pattern tree nodes is formalized by providing an extensional representation of the synonymity relation(i.e. any node label is decorated with the list of its possible synonyms) along with the associated renaming cost.



2 for the sake of efficiency, the implementation indeed uses two indexes to encode the data tree: the former to store the leaf nodes of the data tree(i.e. the plain text elements) and the latter to store the inner nodes(i.e. the xml tags).



for the sake of simplicity, we first describe how the methodology works on an unconditional, positive, ground filtering rule, and then we will describe how to implement the other language features. basically, the problem amounts to finding one or all best approximate matches(i.e. also called embeddings) of a ground pattern against an xml document. we assume to have already generated both the expanded pattern tree p and the data tree index d representing the data tree.



as shown in section 2, a filtering rule is a quite complex object which may contain non ground patterns and filtering conditions. moreover, according to the filtering operator and the filtering mode chosen, it can be employed for approximate/exact matching and to implement positive as well as negative filtering. in the following, we briefly discuss how to adapt the algorithm presented in the previous section to cope with such features.



the algorithm we described is mainly used for approximate filtering. nevertheless it can be employed for exact matching. we just have to look for matches with a null embedding cost, since no insertion, deletion, or renaming of nodes is allowed in this case. therefore, to optimize the search one can think to ignore the basic pattern transformations. unfortunately, the insertions are implicitly defined in the matching algorithm, and hence we cannot avoid them. however, deletions and renamings can be disabled in the following way:(i) to avoid deletion of nodes, we simply use the original pattern tree instead of using its expanded representation;



in order to evaluate the usefulness of our approach in a realistic scenario, we have benchmarked our system using the xmark benchmark suite. the suite offers a set of 20 queries, each of which is intended to challenge a particular primitive of the filtering engine, along with the xml documents generator xmlgen which can be used to produce the synthetic data on which running the experiments. by means of our formalism, we are able to express 17 queries out of 20. the remaining 3 queries cannot be formalized, since they involve document transformation and computational capabilities which are out of the scope of a simple filtering language(e.g. lexicographic ordering(query n. 19), currency conversion(query n. 18), and output formatting(query n. 10)).



the growing complexity of the world wide web demands for tools which are able to tame the so-called information overload. to this respect, filtering and query languages allow one to extract relevant and meaningful information within the enormous amount of data available on the web. in this paper, we firstly presented a declarative xml filtering language which has several advantages w.r.t. other approaches. it is inspired by the approximate pattern-based query language approxql and extends it by introducing a number of new syntax constructs which provide a much more expressive framework(e.g. negative filtering, pattern variables, nested queries, conditional filtering, etc.). secondly, we implemented the language



finally, let us conclude by mentioning some directions for future work. we are currently formalizing a denotational semantics of the language which precisely models the behaviour of the language constructs. moreover, we are trying to combine the filtering language with an ontology reasoner which simplifies and automatizes the retrieval of the synonymity relation by querying a given(possibly remote) ontology.
