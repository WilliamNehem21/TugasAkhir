the expression of ghsr mrna is researched by in situ hybridization or an rnase protection assay mainly in ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and in the pituitary. the main function of ghsr is to promote gh secretion and release in conjunction with ghs, which is closely correlative with animal growth.



significant difference is denoted with letters(the capital for the xinjiang and the small for the kazak) and means without a common superscript indicate significant differences(p<0.05) between ages in the same breed. double stars** indicate extreme differences(p<0.05) between breeds at the same age.

sensitivity of arc ghsr expression to modulation by gh suggests that ghs-rs may be involved in feedback regulation of gh. according to research of shuto et al(2002),they creat transgenic(tg) rats expressing an antisense ghsr mrna. tg rats had lower body weight and less adipose tissue than did control rats. the stimulatory effect of ghs treatment on feeding was abolished and daily food intake was reduced in tg rats. the ghsr gene lies on human chromosome 3q26 within multiple phenotypes linked to a quantitative trait locus strongly related to obesity and the metabolic syndrome. baessler et al.(2005) found that common snps and haplotypes within the ghsr gene region were involved in the pathogenesis of human obesity. the above results suggested that ghsr was involved in the monitorship of gh secretion, adiposity, and food intake, so studying the developmental changes of sheep ghsr mrna expression was useful to explore sheep growth and development and the regulatory mechanisms.



the present research showed that the hypothalamus ghsr mrnas expression level in both breeds increased firstly and then declined with growing, and that in kazak sheep was extremely lower than that of xinjiang fine wool sheep from day 60 to 90. from day 2 to 90, the pituitary ghsr expression level of kazak sheep was extremely higher than that of xinjiang fine wool sheep, which was similar to the difference of body weight between the two sheep breeds in the early growth period. the mrnas expression level of pituitary ghsr increased with growing in both breeds, and was highly positively correlated with the cumulative growth curves, which predicated that ghsr played some role in sheep growing.



a endogenous ligand of ghsr, ghrelin, was get in rat stomach tissue. ghrelin was able to stimulate the release of growth hormone(gh) after binding to ghsr. moreover, it was soon established that ghrelin had function in weight regulation as its administration increased food intake and caused fat and weight gain in rodents. huang zhi guo et al.(2006) studied the hypothalamus and pituitary distribution and developmental changes of ghrelin mrna expression in sheep and found ghrelin mrna mostly existed in abomasum and was increased steadily in the early growth period. the present research found sheep pituitary ghsr mrnas expression level was was highly positively correlated with abomasum ghrelin mrnas expression level.the results predicated that it may be pituitary ghsr but not hypothalamus ghsr through which ghrelin influenced sheep growing.
