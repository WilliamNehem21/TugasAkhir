pedestrian detection has a wide range of application prospects in many fields such as unmanned driving, intelligent monitoring, robot, etc., and has always been a hot issue in the field of computer vision. in recent years, with the development of deep learning and the proposal of many large pedestrian data sets, pedestrian detection technology has also made great progress, and the detection accuracy and detection speed have been significantly improved. however, the performance of the most advanced pedestrian detection methods is still far behind that of human beings, especially when there is occlusion and scale change, the detection accuracy decreases significantly. occlusion and scale problems are the key problems to be solved in pedestrian detection. the purpose of this paper is to discuss the research progress of pedestrian detection. firstly, this paper explores the research calculates the confidence of all bounding boxes in the regression. at the same time, multiple convolution layers with different scales are generated in the convolution layer to detect multi-scale objects and improve the detection accuracy. ross girshick et al. introduced convolutional neural network(cnn) into the field of object detection for the first time in 2014, and proposed r-cnn by combining cnn with traditional machine learning methods. r-cnn uses selective search to obtain as many pre-selected boxes as possible, uses cnn network to extract features instead of manually designed features for the first time, and uses multiple svm classifiers for classification and regression. then in 2015, ross girshick designed a region proposal network(rpn) to replace the selective search in r-cnn, and selected softmax classifier to replace multiple svm classifiers, which greatly improved the detection performance. with the rapid development of deep learning technology, many researchers have proposed many detection methods with better performance, such as faster rcnn, mscnn, yolov4, csp, saf-rcnn and other methods based on r-cnn. although hand-designed features are effective in simple cases, their generalization ability is weak and it is difficult to obtain high-level semantic information. deep features obtain feature representations based on the learning of a large number of samples, which can be learned end-to-end, with strong robustness and better generalization ability. in recent years, pedestrian detection has gradually evolved from hand-crafted features to deep features.



multiple gestures of pedestrian object: pedestrian objects are both rigid and flexible and pedestrians may present a wide variety of postures, such as stationary, standing, squatting, bending, or walking. in addition, the appearance of pedestrians are all dressed differently, in various colors and styles. these variations pose a great challenge to current pedestrian detection. how to design a pedestrian detection method that is not affected by changes in pedestrian posture and clothing appearance is a challenge that needs to be solved for pedestrian detection nowadays.



weather and low-lighting: rain, snow, fog, haze, dust storms and other phenomena seriously reduce the clarity of photos, the reduced visibility of the pedestrian object and the blurred contours severely limit the performance of pedestrian detection. at night when the light intensity is low, the pedestrian images have higher gray values, lack of color information, and increased interference information. also low light conditions generally use infrared images, which have low resolution, contain less pedestrian information, and have blurred pedestrian object outlines. these problems seriously affect the accuracy of pedestrian detection. how to solve the problem of pedestrian object



occlusion: occlusion in pedestrian detection is divided into two main categories: one is intra-class occlusion between pedestrians, and the other is inter-class occlusion of pedestrian objects by other objects. the mutual occlusion between pedestrians brings a lot of interference information, which may lead to false detection and affects detection performance. when the pedestrian object is obscured by other objects, the structure of the pedestrian is incomplete and the information of the pedestrian object is missing, which can easily produce missed detection and reduce the accuracy of pedestrian detection.



multi-scale pedestrian: different distances of pedestrian objects from the camera will bring different spatial scales of pedestrians, there may be multiple pedestrians at different scales in the same image. this has caused a significant negative impact on pedestrian detection. large-scale pedestrians have richer information for better detection. but small-scale pedestrians tend to have lower pixels, blurred appearance and contours, contain less valid information, which easily misses detection and seriously affects the accuracy of pedestrian detection. it is a great challenge to accurately detect pedestrian objects at different scales.



real-time detection: the application of pedestrian detection in automatic driving, intelligent monitoring, etc. has high requirements for detection speed and needs to be able to detect in real time. with the development of deep learning, the pedestrian detection model is becoming more and more complex. while the detection accuracy is improved, it also brings a lot of calculations, which reduces the detection speed of pedestrian detection. how to achieve real-time detection while improving the accuracy of pedestrian detection is a great challenge in the field of pedestrian detection.



faced with many challenges, pedestrian detection, although a category of general object detection, can still be studied as an independent problem. in recent years, in order to improve the detection accuracy and detection speed of pedestrian detection, researchers have proposed many new detection methods with better performance. this paper discusses and explores the research status of pedestrian detection from 2019 to 2022, summarizes commonly used pedestrian data sets and evaluation indicators, and focuses on the analysis of occlusion and scale problems and corresponding solutions of pedestrian detection.



although the earliest hand-made features such as hog, hear, lbp and luv are no longer so excellent with the development of pedestrian detection technology, they also provide ideas and innovative inspiration for later researchers. over the past 19 years, researchers have designed many new feature descriptors with better performance. wenshu li et al. designed ehog feature by enhancing the contrast of hog feature in order to balance the speed and accuracy of pedestrian detection. ritesh kumar mishra reduces the redundant information of hsg by adding a feature selection module to reduce the feature size and improve the calculation speed. ming yang et al. proposed a feature et al. proposed f-csp network. f-csp introduces fpn and bfp to improve the original feature fusion module. fpn can reduce the number of channels of the feature map, and bfp fuses multiple feature maps into a feature map, reducing other parameters. based on the original yolov3 network model, jingwei cao et al. improved the multi-scale bounding box prediction based on receptive field and introduced the soft-nms algorithm, which improved the performance of the detection algorithm in various complex scenes. haohui lv et al. proposed yolov5-ac based on yolov5s, introduced l1 regularization in bn layer to remove networks with small impact factors to reduce model size and improve speed, introduced cem module to extract more features and used two attention modules cxam and cnam to filter useless features. correct the position offset to improve the accuracy. wei liu et al. designed the progressive localization fitting(alf) module, which

the log-average miss rate(mr) is an indicator to describe the miss rate in the detection results. false positive per image(fppi) describes the average false detection rate per image. their calculations can be shown in(5) and(6). the mr-fppi curve is similar to the p-r curve used for local receptive field, the convolution is replaced by dilated convolution and the step size of the convolution is reduced in the backbone of fpn. chen zhang et al. proposed a multi-scale pedestrian detector. the detector fuses pooled features with different resolutions and context information in the fully connected layer to make full use of their unique



the attention mechanism can find the correlation between the original data and highlight some important features. the introduction of the attention mechanism in pedestrian detection can better fuse different features and improve the robustness of pedestrian detection at different scales. in 2019, zhichang chen et al. believed that the competitive attention module can be used to improve the hard negative samples and multi-scale problems of pedestrian detection, and the competitive attention module helps the network architecture to obtain blocks to obtain more mutual information between features, and introduces a feature aggregation module to combine high-level features and low-level features. yuzhe he et al. proposed a multi-scale feature balance enhancement network. the network extends a bottom-up short-circuit path to improve the utilization of low-level feature information, designs a feature balance module to obtain the same amount of semantic information from different resolutions, and uses a feature enhancement module to expand the receptive field to retain more information. the method proposed by ren j makes good



zhou is not effective for small-scale pedestrian detection with height less than 40 pixels. the method proposed by yanwei pang only considers the similarity between reconstructed pedestrians and large-scale pedestrians, and ignores the dissimilarity between reconstructed background and large-scale pedestrians. the method proposed by jialian wu is a general component, which can be effectively applied to other detectors with backbone networks.



some researchers have improved the robustness of multi-scale pedestrian detection through multi-scale detection. in 2021, hexiang zhang et al. proposed yolov3-z based on the retinex algorithm and the improved yolov3 algorithm. the retinex algorithm is used as a preprocessing algorithm to improve the brightness and contrast of pedestrians, and the yolov3 algorithm is improved by adding multiple scale detection. in 2022, chintakindi balaram murthy et al. proposed a lightweight real-time detection algorithm(efficientliteset), which introduced a three-scale transformer prediction head(tph) in tiny-yolov4 to replace the original detection head, which could correspond to certain body parts, and the occlusion situation can be represented as a specific combination of body parts. therefore, a channel attention mechanism was designed to obtain a more efficient representation of occluded pedestrians. in 2022, jiali ding et al. proposed a head-aware pedestrian detection network(hapnet) based on the structural relationship between the human body and the head. hapnet detects both the head and the body of pedestrians, and proposes a head-side affinity module to represent the association between the head and the body. ameen abdelmutalab et al. proposed a multi-branch pedestrian detection algorithm(mb-csp), which used four
