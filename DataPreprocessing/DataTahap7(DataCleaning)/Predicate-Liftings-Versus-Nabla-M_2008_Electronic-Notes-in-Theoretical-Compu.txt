it is also possible to give inductive presentations like the previous one in the case of products and coproducts. this is especially useful in the case of products of functors. singleton liftings are even more important because they generate all the other predicate liftings as it is shown in the next result.



logical translators are particularly useful because they can be combined to obtain logical translators of more complex functors. in other words, logical translators can be extended via products, coproducts, and composition with the covariant power set functor. this is summarized in the following result.



proof. the proof of this theorem was already done along the text, it can be found in the examples. we will only point to the appropriate examples. the case of coproducts follows from example 3.13, the case of products follows from example 3.14, and the case of the power set functor was discussed in examples 3.12, and 2.27.



proof. the proof goes by induction on the complexity of t. examples 3.10 and 3.11, in the previous section, show that for each singleton lifting of the base cases, the identity and constant functors, there exists a logical translator. the previous theorem implies that those logical translators can be inductively extended to any singleton lifting for a fixed kpf t. this concludes the proof.



we have presented a new technique to compare coalgebraic modal languages which is based on the use of logical translators to define translations. the key property of logical translators is that they are natural transformations. this was an essential characteristic used in the proofs of theorem 4.2, theorem 4.6, and theorem 5.6.
