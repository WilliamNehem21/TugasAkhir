semantic account of the interaction between first-order structures and formulas of bounded variable count. in addition, the parameter of tree-width is given a semantic description via looking at coalgebras of the pebbling comonad. in the first section we give a brief overview of brief overview of the quantifier rank and variable count, and their relationship to tree-width and tree-depth. in the second, we synthesise the pebbling comonad, and the ehrenfeucht-fraisse comonad from(which is an analogue of the pebbling comonad but for quantifier rank) into one which simultaneously captures quantifier rank and variable count, and whose coalgebras can be used to capture both tree-depth and tree-width. this is a minor modification of the comonads found in and, in order to move on to the material in the third section, though also novel to this paper is how to generalise the comonads to deal with constants in the signature, and free variables.
