in our markovian framework, the interaction of a process term and a test should be closed with respect to the class of exponential distributions, i.e. it should not give rise to transitions whose rate cannot be expressed through a positive real number representing an exponential distribution. this strictly depends on the synchronization discipline that is adopted. the simplest way to achieve exponential closure is to enforce the markovian generative-reactive form of communication. therefore, only the so-called passive actions can occur within the tests. passive actions have no duration associated with them. instead, they are given positive real numbers interpreted as weights, which are used to make a probabilistic selection among a set of passive actions with the same name. the idea is that, in any of its states, a process term to be tested generates the proposal of an action to be executed by means of a race among the exponentially timed actions enabled in that state, then the test reacts by probabilistically selecting a passive action(if any) with the same name as the proposed exponentially timed one.
