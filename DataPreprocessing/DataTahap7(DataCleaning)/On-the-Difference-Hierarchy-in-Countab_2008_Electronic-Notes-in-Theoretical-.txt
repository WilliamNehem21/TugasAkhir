the aim of this paper is two-fold. first, we continue to study some versions of the classical hausdorff difference hierarchy(dh). second, we discuss in some detail a class of effective topological spaces introduced in[12,24] which is relevant to our study of the dh and to computability in topology.



here we briefly discuss some notions related to countably based t0-spaces and computability over them. ideas and many of results here are not new. they are slight modifications and/or extensions of those in(see also exercise 3.2.17 in).
