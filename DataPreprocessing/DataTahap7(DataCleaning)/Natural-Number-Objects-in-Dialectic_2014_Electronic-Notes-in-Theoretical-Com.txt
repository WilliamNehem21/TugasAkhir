to investigate iteration and recursion in dialectica categories we would like to define a natural numbers object in dial2(sets). first we need to decide with respect to which one of the monoidal structures in dial2(sets) we will define our prospective natural numbers object. in principle, we can use either the cartesian structure of dial2(sets) or any one of its tensor structures.



tensor products, unlike cartesian products, are not unique up to isomorphism and the category dial2(sets) has(at least) two prominent tensor products, besides categorical products and coproducts. these tensor products(in definition 3) share a common unit, the object(1, 1,=), which we could use to obtain a natural number object, as in the monoidal generalization of nno in definition 1. instead of doing this, which in principle would mean investigating all possible tensor products in dial2(sets), we will instead go back to the notion of a peano-lawvere category, as introduced by burroni in.
