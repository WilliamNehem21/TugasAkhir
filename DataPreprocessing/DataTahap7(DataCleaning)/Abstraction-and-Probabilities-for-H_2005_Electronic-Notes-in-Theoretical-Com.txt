we presented propositional hybrid logics as established enhancements of propositional temporal logics with the ability to name and re-bind specific states. we then provided a sound relational abstraction technique for hybrid kripke structures and a hybrid version of computation tree logic. we further motivated and discussed a definition of hybrid labelled markov chains and a syntax and semantics of probabilistic computation tree logic in this hybrid setting. our abstraction techniques for hybrid kripke structures should be transfer-
