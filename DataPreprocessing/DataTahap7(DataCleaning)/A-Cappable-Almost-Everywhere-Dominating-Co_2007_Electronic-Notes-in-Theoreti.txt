although this is a very common feature in constructions of c.e. degrees(and in the cone avoidance strategy it seems unavoidable), by combining the construction in with known techniques from the theory of promptly simple degrees(in particular the use of the recursion theorem in order to trigger prompt diagonalizations) we were able to show that outside any upper cone of promptly simple degrees there is an a.e. dominating c.e. degree. theorem



the construction will be a tree argument where the level 3e belongs to the backing strategy me, the levels 3n+ 1 belong alternately to domination and minimal pair strategies(e.g. 3(2e)+ 1 belongs to de and 3(2e+ 1)+ 1 belongs to qe) and level 3e+2 belongs to pe.
