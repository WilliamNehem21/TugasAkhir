intel has announced that in future each standard computer chip will contain many processors operating concurrently on the same shared memory; their use of memory is interleaved at the fine granularity of individual memory accesses. the speed of the individual processors will never be significantly faster than they are today. continued increase in performance will therefore depend on the skill of programmers in exploiting the concurrency of this multi-core architecture. in addition, programmers will have to avoid increased risks of race conditions, non-determinism, deadlocks and livelocks. to reduce these risks, we propose a theory of correctness for fine-grain concurrent programs. the approach is just an amalgamation of a number of well-known and well-researched ideas, including flowcharts, floyd assertions, petri nets, process algebra, separation logic, critical regions and rely/guarantee reasoning. these ideas are applied in combination to the design of a structured calculus of correctness for fine-grain concurrent programs; it includes the main features of a structured concurrent programming language.



a modular structure can be imposed on a petri net by enclosing certain of its subnets into a box, with its own named ports on the perimeter. the assertions on these ports describe what that box assumes from its neighbours, and what it guarantees. thus for purposes of reasoning about correctness, the entire enclosing box can be regarded as a single action, ignoring the details of shape and content of the subnet which it contains. in execution, however, the enclosing boxes are completely ignored.



the dynamic pattern of behaviour of an enclosing box is often intended to be the same as that of the boxes that it encloses. to make this explicit, it is a useful convention to hide(e.g., erase) the port names of the internal boxes, and re-use them as port names for the enclosing box. thus the same regular expression can then be re-used to describe the dynamic pattern of both the enclosing and the enclosed boxes. this convention is exploited in the definition of a small calculus of operators by which petri nets can be composed in a well structured fashion. an operator of the calculus is defined in terms of a box that encloses its operands. some of the ports of the operands are connected to each other, and other internal ports are connected to ports on the perimeter of the enclosing box. the pattern of connections defines the meaning of the operator. a proof is then given that the enclosing box follows the same pattern of dynamic behaviour as its operands.



concurrency is introduced, controlled, and eliminated in a petri net by means of transitions. the transition is a primitive component of a net, drawn usually as a bar, and it acts as a barrier to tokens passing through. it has entry ports on one side and exit ports on the other. the transition transmits tokens only when there are tokens waiting on every one of its entry ports. these tokens are then replaced by tokens emerging simultaneously from every one of the exit ports. if there is only one entry port, the transition acts as a fan-out, transmitting control to many concurrent threads. if there is only one exit port, the token acts as a fan-in, synchronising the termination of the threads. it helps to describe these cases separately. a more general transition can easily be treated as a fan-out followed by a fan-in.



each token as carrying with it the ownership(i.e., write permissions) for just a part of the state of the computer, and the channels which connect it to the real world environment. we will call them resources. a token also carries a record of partial ownership of a resource,(i.e., read permissions). when the token passes through a box, the program in the box is allowed to access and update only those parts of the overall state whose partial or total ownership is carried by the token. this restriction could be implemented physically by a hardware memory in which every variable carries a permission tag. but it is far more practical to prove in advance that a program observes all the relevant restrictions.



when a token reaches a fan-out transition, the resources that it owns are split into two or more disjoint parts(possibly sharing read-only variables); these parts are carried by the separate tokens emerging from the fan-out. when a token reaches a fan-in transition, it is merged into a single token, together with a token from each of the other entry ports of that fan-in. the token that emerges carries the sum of all the permissions of all the tokens that pass through the barrier at the same time. this sum must be consistent, in the sense no write permission is added to any other permission, read or write.



fortunately, observance of this rule is guaranteed by the fact that any two tokens in the system always carry disjoint permissions. this is because the only way of generating tokens is by a consistent split of existing tokens. if a language which allows dynamic generation of resources, a new resource is always disjoint from all existing ones. as a result, at all times the entire resources of the system are split disjointly among all the tokens travelling in the net. this ensures that the ownership claims of two tokens arriving at the same fan-in transition will always be compatible.



reasoning about ownership is conveniently conducted in the framework of a new variety of modal logic, known as separation logic. the distinctive feature of separation logic is that each assertion implicitly(or explicitly) makes an ownership claim on the variables that it mentions or depends on. the logic is effective in dealing with heap variables, whose ownership cannot generally be determined by compile time checks. the logic introduces a new associative operator, the separated conjunction of two predicates, usually denoted by a star(p*q). this asserts that both the predicates are true, and furthermore, that their ownership claims are disjoint. separated conjunction is used to express the correctness condition for petri net transitions. the assertion at the entry of a fan-out is just the separated conjunction of all the assertions at the exits. conversely in the case of a fan-in, the assertion on the exit is the separated conjunction of all the assertions on the entries.



it is highly desirable to design a calculus that avoids false postconditions. this is done by ensuring that any construction that could lead to a false postcondition is given a false precondition. this is safe, because the programmer has to prove that the precondition is true before the construction is entered, and this cannot be done if the precondition is false.



inconsistency on fan-in arises from race conditions. for example, if two threads make incompatible assignments to the same variable, then an inconsistency arises on the fan-in which implements their synchronised termination. fortunately, in separation logic assignment to the same variable by different threads is ruled out. the primitive axiom of assignment checks that ownership of the assigned variable is carried by the token, and also checks the necessary read permissions to evaluate the expression. if the check fails, it is the precondition that is set false. thus the kind of race condition that leads to inconsistency is ruled out by the proof of correctness of the net.



unfortunately, the same rules that prohibit race conditions also prohibit any form of communication or co-operation among the threads. to relax this restriction, it is necessary to establish some method of communication between threads. for the purpose of exploiting multi-core architecture, the highest bandwidth, minimum overhead and lowest latency are achieved by use of shared memory for communication. of course, sharing must be confined to a region of memory disjoint from the memory that is permanently owned by the threads that share it. ownership of the shared resource is carried in the normal way by a token, which resides normally at a place specially assigned to it within the petri net. this token must therefore be split off by a fan-out before the start of the threads that are going to share it; and it should be merged again after all these threads have terminated. the declaration of a shared resource can be achieved by the same concurrency operator as that described above.



in order to access and update the shared resource, a thread must acquire its token by means of a fan-in transition. after updating the shared state, the thread must release the token back to its designated place. the region of the thread program which enjoys temporary ownership of a shared token is called an atomic or critical region. use of this kind of critical region gives the programmer control over the granularity of the interactions of the threads, at a level above that of individual memory accesses.



shared resource, the one that gets it is selected non-deterministically. as a result, the order of execution of the critical regions is an arbitrary interleaving of the critical regions of all the threads that share the resource. to reason effectively about this non-determinism, a useful level of abstraction is provided by rely conditions and guarantee conditions. both of these are relations between two states of the shared resource. the guarantee condition for a thread is a relation that holds between the initial state and the final state of the resource at the beginning and the end of every critical region within that thread. the rely condition for a thread is a relation which holds between the final state at the end of each critical region and the initial state at the beginning of the next critical region executed(where initiation and termination of the thread are treated as the end and beginning of a critical region). the rely condition plays the role of an assumption in the proof of each thread. it places an upper bound on the changes to the shared resource which the other threads can make while the given thread does not own it. the concurrent execution of all threads sharing a resource is correct if each threads guarantee condition implies the rely condition of all the other threads. in the case of multiple resources, there can be a separate rely and guarantee condition for each pairing of each thread with each resource.
