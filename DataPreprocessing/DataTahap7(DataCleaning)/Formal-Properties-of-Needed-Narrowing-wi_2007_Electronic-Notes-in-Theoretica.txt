the first case of our definition corresponds exactly with the homologous one presented in, and it is very useful in our proofs when dealing with bf. moreover, the second case generalizes the associated one in the same paper, but taking now into account the specificities introduced in the new fuzzy setting by similar terms. this last case will be applied when analyzing bv and bc cases, as we are going to see in the following proof of our first theorem.
