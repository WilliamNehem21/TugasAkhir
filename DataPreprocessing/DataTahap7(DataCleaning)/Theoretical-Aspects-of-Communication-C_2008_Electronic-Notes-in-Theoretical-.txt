follow these descriptive principles, there is a simple and direct epp which is type preserving and which is sound and complete with respect to the original dynamic semantics. this epp theory(including type disciplines and epp mapping) will be published as a supplementary document to the specification of ws-cdl 1.0, and will be implemented as part of an open-source reference implementation of wscdl. thus, the present work started from practice, gets related to theory, and finally again comes back to practice. this will further motivate and encourage a dialogue between theoretical studies and engineering. we argue such a dialogue is highly beneficial, not only for advancement of rigourous engineering but also for enrichment of theory.



it is worth outlining the direct engineering background of the present work, ws-cdl. ws-cdl has been developed in order to meet engineering needs for the development of business protocols on the world-wide web. the central engineering idea of ws-cdl is embodied by the term choreography in its name. the underlying intuition can be summarised as follows:



on this side, the conditional construct does not appear. in fact, seller must be independent from whatever the choice at buyer is. this is realised by the external choice where both operations, quoteacc and quotenogood are offered on session channel s.
