de nition 2.2 the free arc is an arc of a directed multigraph for which there is not given any limit time. the weight of a free arc is a continuous function of t, the time of leaving the starting node of the arc. the function depends on the means of transport.



nding connections, using e.g. an algorithm based on dijkstra's algorithm or one of its numerous variants(,), from the source to the destination, two values are evaluated in every node: the current time of entering the node and the current weight of the connection. due to the model presented above, the weights of the paths are appropriately compared in the nodes visited. it is also possible to include the following factors into the weights of the paths: the time of arrival, the number of changes and the time of departure(as late as possible).



nd the optimal connection, i.e. the connection with the earliest arrival time(given the departure time) or, by symmetry, the latest departure time(given the arrival time). the optimality criterion takes into account the weight, or the cost, associated with one change(the p parameter, as described above).
