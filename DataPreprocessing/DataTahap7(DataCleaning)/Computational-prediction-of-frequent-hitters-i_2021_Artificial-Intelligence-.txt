high-throughput screening(hts) assay technologies are a cornerstone of modern drug discovery. they allow the biological testing of large numbers of compounds on targets of interest within a short period of time. a major challenge faced in high-throughput screening is false-positive hits resulting from different types of assay interference.



biomacromolecules. several computational approaches have been reported for the assessment of small molecules with regard to their risk of forming colloidal aggregates. these tools include aggregator advisor, chemagg and scam detective. aggregator advisor flags potential aggregators based on their molecular similarity to a set of 12,000 known aggregators, taking logp into account. chemagg and scam detective are machine learning models for the classification of small molecules into aggregators and non-aggregators. whereas chemagg is based on a xgboost model, scam detective utilizes a set of random forest models.



a second important cause of assay interference is the chemical reactivity of compounds, in particular that related to electrophilicity. chemically reactive compounds may bind covalently to biomacromolecules or interact with the assay screening technology in an undesired way. computational approaches for identifying reactive compounds are mostly based on sets of rules which describe substructures that have been linked to chemical reactivity.





the six assays with the highest hit rates are all measuring cyp p450 enzyme activity. in the case of the cell-based assay data set, this concerns four assays, with hit rates of 59%, 55%, 17% and 15%(note that for approximately three quarters of the assays included in the cell-based assay data set their hit rates are below 1%). for the extended cell-based assay data set the seven assays with hit rates above 16% were removed.



specific bioactivity assays designed to measure a specific biological property such as the activity of an enzyme. cytotoxicity assays are not included in this category. counterscreen assays are included if they measure a specific biological effect. an example of a counterscreen assigned this label value is a luciferase counterscreen that is commonly employed to identify compounds which can cause interference in luciferase-based(bioluminescence) assays



in order to ensure the consistency of predictions, compounds with identical morgan2 fingerprints[39,40](1024 bits) but differing promiscuity labels(e.g., symmetric molecules) were removed from the respective training set. for any compounds with identical morgan2 fingerprints only one instance was kept in the respective training set.



to obtain a training set and a test set(separately for all three data sets), a stratified random split was performed to obtain 90% training data and 10% test(hold out) data. following a fingerprint-based data merging procedure(i.e. merging of instances having identical fingerprints and identical class labels, and removal of any instances having identical fingerprints but conflicting class labels; see materials and methods for details) the target-based, cell-based and extended cell-based training sets contain 243,949, 256,873 and 265,049 compounds, respecseems surprisingly high. however, a closer look reveals that the agreement stems primarily from compounds consistently labeled as nprom. among the 20,481 compounds present in both data sets and labeled as prom in at least one of them, only 6616(32%) have identical class labels. this indicates that target-based and cell-based assays perform indeed differently and that they should be represented by dedicated models.



ences in model performance were observed with respect to the type of assay modeled: the best setups yielded comparable mccs for the targetbased assay set(mccs 0.679 and 0.592 for hprom-nprom and promnprom classification, respectively), cell-based assay set(mccs 0.602 and 0.577, respectively), and extended cell-based assay set(mccs 0.631 and 0.599, respectively).



methods for details) were tested on the holdout data(i.e. 10% of the data that was set aside prior to model building). the 24 models result from the combination of three different training sets(i.e. target-based, cell-based and extended cell-based assay data set), four machine learning algorithms(knn, et, rf, mlp), and two different types of classification(i.e. hprom-nprom and prom-nprom). all of these models are built on morgan2 fingerprints and utilize the



importantly, a substantial decrease in performance was observed for the hprom-nprom knn classifiers for all three assay data sets(for example, the knn classifier of the target-based assay data set; three nearest neighbors; cross-validation mcc 0.624; test set mcc 0.376) and also the prom-nprom knn classifiers for all three assay data sets(for example, the knn classifier of the target-based assay data set; three nearest neighbors; cross-validation mcc 0.587; test set mcc 0.421). this decline in the performance may be related to model overfitting.



in the test of the hit dexter 3 models on the dcm data set, any test compounds also present in the training set of the respective models were disregarded(leaving 24,111 to 37,711 dcm compounds for testing, depending on the individual training set). the target-based, cell-based and extended cell-based hprom-nprom mlp models correctly assigned 99.0%, 98.6% and 98.7% of the dcm compounds to the nprom class. in comparison, the percentage of correct assignments of the prom-nprom models were 95.4%, 93.7% and 93.6%, respectively. this result corroborates the validity(in particular the specificity) of the models.



the mlp classifiers turned out to obtain the best classification performance and robustness in most cases, with mccs of up to 0.648 in discriminating hprom from nprom compounds, and mccs of up to 0.580 in discriminating prom from nprom compounds. use cases that require models with high sensitivity or high specificity can be approached by adjusting the decision threshold applied in classification.
