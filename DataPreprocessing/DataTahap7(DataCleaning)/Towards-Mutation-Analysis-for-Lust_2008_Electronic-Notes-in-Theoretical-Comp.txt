twenty-two operators were defined. those operators were classified into eight classes and three levels(sal, pda and cca). statement analysis(sal) replace each statement by a trap 4, by a continue or by a return(for subprogram). it also replaces the(target) label in each goto and each do statement. the predicate and domain analysis(pda) takes the absolute value or the absolute negative value of an expression. it replaces one arithmetic/relational/logical operator by another, inserts a unary operator preceding an expression, alters



n-selective mutation is mutation omitting the n most productive mutation operators. in, 2-selective was defined by omitting svr(scalar variable replacement) and asr(array reference for scalar variable replacement) operators. 4-selective mutation also omits csr(scalar for constant replacement) and scr(scalar for constant replacement).
