this view leads to a consistent, but incomplete game model for ll with exponentials, which is finitary, in the sense that each play is finite. the game is based on a set of inference rules which does not enjoy cut elimination. nevertheless, the cut rule is valid in the model.



where an edge between two notions of validity indicates that the target is a model of the source, and a negated edge in the other direction indicates that the model is not complete. we conjecture that the vertical negated edges may be rectified by passing to local strategies in the sense of. however, the horizontal negated arrow cannot be rectified.



(this does not use contraction or cut.) for other cases, one just shows that a list of new hypotheses starting with? do not hinder the derivation too much. this only adds weakenings and exchange rules, but no cuts nor contractions.



on the left, the broken edge or formula is shown. it determines two subtrees, which are pictured as triangles, and named to emphasise the analogy with inference rules. in the initial position of the tensor move(third line), there are several triangles connected to the left-hand vertex v: they denote subtrees which have v as only vertex in common.
