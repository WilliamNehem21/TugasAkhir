the converse can be simply shown by using the weighted subject reduction property. notice that similar results for idempotent intersection type systems cannot be proved in a combinatorial way, they are typically based on reducibility arguments[31,17,25]. this is exactly the place where the quantitative approach by means of non-idempotent types makes the difference.
