analytic calculi consist solely of rules that compose the formulas to be proved in a stepwise manner. as a result, proofs from an analytic calculus satisfy the subformula property: every formula that appears(anywhere) in the proof must be a subformula of the formulas to be proved. this is a powerful restriction on the shape of proofs and can be exploited to prove important meta-logical properties of the logical system such as consistency, decidability and interpolation.



proofs: if a follows from b and c follows from a, then c follows from b. that is, one can cut the intermediate lemma a. cut-elimination implies that this deviation through a is not necessary. mathematically, this means that proofs follow directly from the axiomatic theory. computationally, it implies that systems do not have to guess lemmas. logically, cut elimination often implies consistency.



note that the cut rule has an inherent duality: the cut formula a is both a conclusion of a statement and a hypothesis of another. in analytic systems, this duality is often an invariant, being preserved throughout the cut-elimination process. developing general methods for detecting such invariants enables the use of meta-level frameworks to uniformly reasoning about object-level properties.



introduction rules for the modalities. these problems are often connected to the fact that the modal rules in such calculi usually introduce more than one connective at a time, e.g. as in the standard presentation of the rule k for modal logic k:



note that, in order to introduce!(this rule is usually called promotion) all the formulas must be marked with?. clearly, this rule is not context-independent(compare it with the rule k in the introduction). the other three rules correspond to dereliction, weakening and contraction.



sll is strictly greater than sell. in fact, although in this work we consider only unbounded subexponentials, the exact same reasoning can be done for the bounded case by simply adjusting some of the inference rules in sll. hence all sell encodings shown in can be transported to sll.



the cut-elimination results in this work do not extend the ones in(as we are focusing on a particular class of subexponentials), neither the opposite(due to(1) reflected, e.g., by the fact that k cannot be handled in). what we have shown is that, for such a class, the simplicity of is recovered while, at the same time, subexponentials are handled in a very natural way. this brought back to the spot the core of cut-elimination: the duality of inference rules.



usually, the embedding of the ol into the logical framework is not simple/direct. the approach followed here is rather different: we provide easy-to-check conditions that guarantee that the property holds. in the near future, we plan to formalize our results in coq, as done in. also, it would be interesting to analyze the case of non-normal modal logics. finally, it would be interesting to explore the failure cases: is it possible, at the meta-level, to identify the reasons for the lack of analyticity? this would push the line of investigation towards finding necessary conditions for cut-elimination.
