phenotypes and how specific it is when describing a pathology. the function also provides scatter and dimension reduction plots to analyse the clusters and features in the data. an additional output is a model report summarising the cluster assignments which can be used in other modelling analyses. this information can be used to compare association and network size influences for different clusters and gene expression patterns.



additional functionalities of the package create an analytical environment to summarise gene functional classes or infer what cellular compartments are typically associated with the gene/protein. such assessments in the context of expression changes or disease association can highlight emerging patterns in specific cellular states under the investigation. a specially designed function to extract gene pattern profiles can aid in a further refinement of causal gene networks when considering a specific phenotype or a condition.
