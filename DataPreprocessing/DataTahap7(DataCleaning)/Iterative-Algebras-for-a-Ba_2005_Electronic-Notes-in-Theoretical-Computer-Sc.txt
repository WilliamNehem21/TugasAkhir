the category alg(ffi,) is a full subcategory of alg s, and it is easy to verify that it is closed under limits and filtered colimits in alg s. it follows that it is a reflective subcategory, see theorem 2.48 in. since the forgetful functor of alg(ffi,) is a restriction of that of alg s, the proposition follows.
