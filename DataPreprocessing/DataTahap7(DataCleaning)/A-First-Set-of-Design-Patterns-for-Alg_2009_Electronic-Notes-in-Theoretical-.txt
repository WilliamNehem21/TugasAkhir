section 2 briefly summarizes the main elements of design patterns. section 3 presents a pattern for easy navigation in both directions without the need of an undo stack. section 4 introduces a pattern for enabling the extension of different aspects of an av system without touching other parts. section 5 summarizes the patterns in this paper and outlines future av-related pattern research aspects.



design patterns describe problems that occur many times in different parts of our environment. by describing the core of the solution to the problem, the same basic approach can be used to solve the problem, although the actual code is most likely different each time[4, p. 2]. a design pattern, as described in the basic book by, has five essential elements:



the book by mentions many other aspects of a pattern that can be discussed, such as the motivation and sample code. however, we will not strictly adhere to the format for the sake of clarity and brevity. we will use the pattern name as the name for the sections. the other elements will appear as subsections.



during a visualization of an algorithm, a user may become confused at some stage. additionally, the visualization of a user-written algorithm may show a bug that needs to be tracked backed to its origin. both situations benefit from the ability to easily step back to the previous step or steps. here, a step is taken to be a closed set of operations that happen at the same basic time and represent complete actions. thus, one move of an object along a line will always be part of exactly one step, even if it is rendered using a set of intermediate animation frames. however, the next step may contain another move of the same object.



the main limitations of the classical undo stack have been described above: it may reach the fixed memory limit quickly, consumes much memory, and may redundantly store the same set of objects in different positions. our proposal may seem counter-intuitive at first: we navigate backwards by quickly moving forwards from a well-defined position in the av contents. a similar approach is also used in reverse debugging and checkpointing.



ensure that the chosen step actually exists. in the case of manual step input, the user might provide a step number that does not exist, or may navigate forwards beyond the end or backwards beyond the start of the animation. if the chosen step does not exist, stop at this stage.



the amount of memory used by the application increases, as each graphical object has to be stored twice. as the clones have to be prepared at each step(see 3. in the list above), this may also lead to increased memory fragmentation and garbage collection, which can impact the runtime.



if a new transformation subtype for a given graphical object shall be supported, the developer only has to add appropriate code to the getmethods and propertychange methods. no change of the transformation effect or graphical object classes is necessary. the developer can also put the changes into a new handlerextension and register thisin this case, no existing code is touched at all.
