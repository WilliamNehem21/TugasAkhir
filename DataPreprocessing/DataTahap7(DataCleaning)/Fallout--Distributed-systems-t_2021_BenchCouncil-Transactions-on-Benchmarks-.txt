to aid with post-run analysis, fallout saves a range of logs and other artifacts locally on the central server so that they can be inspected after the test run has finished. this is the most common situation for analyzing metrics and other benchmark data collected as part of a manual test run. for automated test analysis, fallout will push the archived metrics to a central grafana server where other tools run further analysis on them, including hunter, our statistical significance detection tool that uses change point detection. fallout uses artifact checkers to inspect the logs for specific error or warning messages and allows the test run to be marked as failed if any are present. other artifact checkers are used to post-process files. for example, the hdrtool artifact checker merges hdr files retrieved from multiple clients and produces aggregated metrics.



of the fallout operations that ran during a test failed. the history of operations is passed to checkers as an argument so that they can run arbitrary checks against it. there is no limit to the number of checkers that can be included in a fallout test and a test will only pass if all checkers pass.



once one or more benchmarks have been run on a cluster, we use multiple tools to display benchmark and os metrics. fallout includes a built-in way to display client-side benchmark metrics as part of the web ui but we usually collect many more metrics for runs such as apache cassandra and os metrics. we use a central grafana server, known as the history server, to display all of the historical metrics that are accumulated during test runs.



adelphi is an open-source qa tool that runs on top of kubernetes and allows users to run data integrity and performance tests against apache cassandra. it is packaged as a helm chart and includes a limited number of benchmarks and testing tools so that users can compare two clusters against one another. adelphi takes care of executing the tests but does not provide facilities to create and terminate the underlying kubernetes clusters or present the benchmark and test results for analysis.



on google cloud platform, amazon ec2, microsoft azure, as well as our internal openstack-based private cloud. because ctool already existed when fallout was created, fallout has a very modular architecture and relies on other tools and components to do certain tasks whereas most of the corresponding functionality for dsi is built into the service. lastly, as far as the authors are aware, dsi does not expose an api for other tools to call.
