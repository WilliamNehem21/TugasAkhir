care and disease diagnosis and treatment. smart medical care is the key to solving this problem. the use of wearable devices and mobile phones, combined with advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, can realize functions such as health monitoring and online diagnosis. however, in practice, in the process of real-time monitoring and



the federated learning training model based on end-edge-cloud layering is used, and the original data is not local, which reduces the risk of user privacy leakage at the root. finally, differential privacy is used in uploading the model to the cloud data center and sending it to the edge serverso that the attacker cannot obtain the detailed data of the training through inference attacks. the privacy and security of the model are guaranteed.



differential privacy methods are usually implemented by adding fuzzy noise, and their essence is to protect sensitive information by adding quantitative randomness to the data. commonly used noiseadding mechanisms are the gaussian mechanism and laplace mechanism. in the gaussian mechanism, we have the following formula.



cloud data center: the cloud data center is a centralized platform that can collect data from various hospitals. it has strong security protection and rich computing and storage resources. however, it is far from users and inconvenient to communicate with them.



the accuracy of the model that under breast cancer dataset tends to convergethe. specifically, accuracy rate growth rate of eicpp is higher than that of fedavg and fedma. eicpp is close to convergence around the 14th round, fedma is close to confluence around the 20th round, and fedavg is only relative to the 24th round reaching a junction. at the same time, from comparing the accuracy rate at the final intersection, it can be seen that eicpp can get 95.47%, fedma can go 82.56%, and
