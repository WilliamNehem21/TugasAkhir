methods. zeng et al. presented a new search scheme based on enhanced asymmetric scalar-product preserving encryption algorithm and encrypted inverted index technology to support generic lbs query over encrypted data for cloud environment. in this scheme, the user can specify the geographical scope and search keywords. after searching, the cs returns the point of interest(poi) records which matches the given area and keywords. yang et al. presented a verifiable privacy protection scheme for knn query under road network environment based on voronoi diagram, 2-hop tag index, and some cryptographic primitive, which could simultaneously preserve the privacy of spatial data and knn query, and verify the reliability of query results. xie and wang



organization. the remainder of our thesis is organized as follows. section 2 introduces the system model and design goals. in section 3, we give some preliminaries. then, the detailed construction of the proposed scheme is illustrated in section 4. the security analysis and performance evaluation are demonstrated in section 5 and section 6, respectively. finally, the paper is concluded in section 7.



cheap storage and reliable computation services. to guarantee lbs data confidentiality, each lbs data will be encrypted at first and then uploaded to the cloud. besides, lsp also provides registration service for the lbs user. once the user passes registration, lsp sends an authentication certificate and the key to the user via a secure communication channel.
