weighted finite automata(wfa) define real functions, in particular, grayness functions of graytone images. inference algorithm that converts an arbitrary function(graytone image) into a wfa that can regenerate it is given in. in this paper we define the theoretical construct of cooperating distributed weighted finite automata with n-components(n-wfa) and study the power of this construct in various modes of acceptance. we give an inference algorithm and the de-inference algorithm for the n-wfa.



in section 2 we give the preliminary definitions of the weighted finite automata and its applications to digital images. in section 3 we introduce the construct of cooperating distributed weighted finite automata and study the acceptance power of this construct in various modes of acceptance. in this section we also deal with the representation of gray-scale images using n-wfa and give an inference algorithm and the de-inference algorithm for the n-wfa. section 4 deals with the conclusions of this paper.
