generality. the definition, as stated, is specialised to simple graphs. yet, the underlying concept is quite robust and can be stated mutatis mutandis for other kinds of graphical structures: multigraphs, directed graphs(bi-rank-width), hypergraphs, petri nets etc. this suggests that the fundamental theory ought to be done in a more general setting.



fix a ring r(e.g. the integers); this is the source for the entries of our matrices, which we will not explicitly reference during the development in order to reduce the number of subscripts. we use r, s to range over r.



group. next, if[k]=[l] then k+ kt= l+ lt. since k and l are upper triangular, they clearly agree in all non diagonal entries. the ith diagonal entry of k+kt= l+lt is 2kii= 2lii. using the additional assumption on r, kii= lii.2
