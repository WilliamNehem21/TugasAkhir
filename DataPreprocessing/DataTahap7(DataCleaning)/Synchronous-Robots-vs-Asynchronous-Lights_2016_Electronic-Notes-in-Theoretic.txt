we provide two different tasks, and show that on graphs one task can be solved in the fully synchronous model but not in the asynchronous lights-enhanced model, while for the other task the converse holds. hence we can assert that the fully synchronous model and the asynchronous lights-enhanced model are incomparable on graphs. this opens challenging directions in order to understand which peculiarities make the models so different.



several modeling assumptions have been also considered that can affect the computational power of the robots. in particular, in some cases, robots may have distinct identities, i.e. each robot is associated with a different identifier that can be used during the compute phase. if robots are without identifiers, they are said to be anonymous. in some other cases, robots may have a finite but persistent memory device whose content is preserved from one lcm cycle to the next; robots are said to be oblivious if they do not, which means that they start each cycle without any information about what happened in the past.



in this research area, many different problems and tasks have been studied: robots might be asked to gather in certain specific locations(also known as the gathering problem), to form a desired geometric pattern(also known as the pattern formation problem), or to explore an unknown area(also known as the exploration problem). in addition, several different settings have been investigated. robots can move on a euclidean plane, or they are constrained to move on a given input graph, which can either be known in advance or not. robots can be able to communicate, e.g. by means of tokens as in, or not. finally, there might exist or not an objective function to be optimized, associated with the problem(see[3,11,12,13] and references there in). for instance, one may ask for the minimum number robots, the minimum number of steps performed by all the robots, or the minimization of the maximum number of steps performed by a single robot, to achieve a certain goal.



our work is inspired by the paper of das et al., which concerned with the problem of comparing the computational capabilities of robots operating in lcm model and moving in the euclidean plane, under different levels of synchronization, with those of both luminous robots and partially oblivious robots. in details, the authors of provided a series of results that prove relationships of dominance between classic models and variations of them that consider the capability of either using lights or snapshots, or a combination of them.



ships of dominance. we denote by a direct arrow between two models, say a and b the fact that every problem solvable in a is also solvable in b. moreover, we denote by a triple bar symbol the fact that every problem solvable in a is also solvable in b and viceversa. in particular, the authors of showed that:



note that, since the robots are identical and anonymous, assuming that the nodes of g can be uniquely identified is crucial to the feasibility of the problem. in fact, in anonymous graphs, if two robots occupy the same node, then the adversary can make both robots always move concurrently. in this way they will never reach different destinations, hence the problem becomes unsolvable.



input: two robots, named r1 and r2, and a graph g, which is a path p of at least six nodes. the two robots reside at distinct nodes of p, which are neither the endpoints of p nor neighbors of the endpoints of p. let d be the initial distance, i.e number of edges, between the two robots.



r1 concludes that r2 has already moved, so it is now its turn. the movement to be done is evaluated according to the current lights of r2. in details, if l2 is red, then r1 must move away from r2 of one edge. in fact, as we noticed, r2 has already terminated its movement. hence, it is waiting for r1. if d was the distance between the two robots before both robots moved, then d+2 must define the final placement



of the two robots in the current step. since they both contribute of one edge, when only one robot moves, the current distance dj is dj= d+ 1, therefore, by moving of one edge, the two robots will reach distance d+ 2. similarly, if l2 is blue, then r1 must move closer to r2 of one edge.
