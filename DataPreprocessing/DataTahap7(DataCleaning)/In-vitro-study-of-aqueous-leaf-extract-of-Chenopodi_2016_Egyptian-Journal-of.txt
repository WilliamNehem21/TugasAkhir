growth assay. growth assay in single diffusion gel growth of brushite crystals was carried out according to the methods previously described by of joshi et al.[2005b] with little modification. single diffusion gel growth method was followed to grow calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate(chpd). when crystals achieved the maximum growth the inhibitive effects of citric acid solution having different concentrations were studied by adding them into the supernatant solution.



glass test tubes of 2.5 cm diameter and 15 cm length were used for growing the crystals. five milliliters of sodium metasilicate solution of specific gravity 1.06 were acidified by adding appropriate amount(2.7 ml) of orthophosphoric acid so that place, 10 ml of 1 m aqueous solution of calcium chloride was carefully poured on the set gels. crystals were found growing very rapidly within two days from pouring the supernatant solutions. elongated platelet type and star shaped crystals were grown in the gel. the apparent length of growing crystals was measured under microscope at different time intervals. the plot of apparent length of growing crystals versus time showed that the crystals achieved maximum length on the 5th day of pouring supernatant solution on set gel. aqueous solution of citric acid as a standard and caae was added in the same volume as the calcium chloride solution on the 5th day after acquiring the maximum length of chpd crystals, and their effect was studied on the growth of chpd crystals up to the 8th day. for ph 5.0, many crystals having star and platelet star and platelet type morphologies were observed. the photographs of the test tube showing the growth of the crystals were recorded.
