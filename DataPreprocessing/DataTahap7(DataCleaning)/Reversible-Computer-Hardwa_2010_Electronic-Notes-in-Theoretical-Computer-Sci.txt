conventional logic gates(e.g. and gates) cannot be used for building a reversible computer. an appropriate design approach is necessary. both small building blocks and a more complex circuit in mos technology are presented. today, these are useful in low-power digital electronics. tomorrow, these may be useful in quantum computers.



dual-line hardware allows very simple implementation of the inverter. it suffices to interchange its two physical lines in order to invert a variable, i.e. in order to hardwire the not gate. conditional nots are not gates which are controlled by switches. a first example is the controlled not gate:



this, however, does not mean that the reversible mos circuits are useless today. indeed, as they are a reversible form of pass-transistor topology, they are particularly suited for so-called adiabatic addressing. here, all signals are gradually set, first to an intermediate level, then to their final values. in practice, such procedure leads to a factor of about 10 in power reduction.
