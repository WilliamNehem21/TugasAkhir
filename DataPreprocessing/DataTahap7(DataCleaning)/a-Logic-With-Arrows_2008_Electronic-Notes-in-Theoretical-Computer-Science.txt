the first author was instrumental in developing so-called nominal techniques, including nominal logic[22,14]. these have similar applications to a-logic and they have a freshness predicate#. however they are inconsistent with the axiom of choice; for example nominal logic is inconsistent with a unary term-former f such that(f s)#s always. it seems that we can axiomatise such an f in a-logic, as



in the semantics, predicates are sets of(tuples of) elements of the domain. at is a unary predicate. atoms are simply a subset of the underlying domain; those in[[at] which is the interpretation of at in the domain. elements of[at] are special; they cannot be in the image of the interpretation of any term-formers.
