in order to prevent this difficulty, we define the notions of fundamental functions and speed condition. the intuitive meaning of fundamental function is the follows. in the development described by a fundamental function, one can always trace back the cause of each phenomenon to the initial condition. the formal definition of it is given in definition 2.10 and 4.2. the speed condition is a condition for the transition rules. the intuitive meaning of speed condition is that a wave progressing at speed v does not make the effect faster than its speed v. the formal definition of it is given in definition 4.5.



remark 3.14 the definition of propagating speed of q mentions the negative occurrences of the state other than q. that is because the negative occurrences of the state other than q can be turned into the positive occurrence of q by the replacement as in remark 3.11.
