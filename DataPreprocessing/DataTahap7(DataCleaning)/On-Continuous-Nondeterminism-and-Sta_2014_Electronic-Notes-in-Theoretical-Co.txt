that reachability for pointed ncas was defined by complete analogy with nfas: no proper sub nca exists. for pointed dfas(viewed as ncas with identity closure) this is the usual notion of reachability, since there is exactly one wz-path from the unique initial state. however the same cannot be said for pointed nfas.



every pointed nfa has a smallest sub nfa, which is necessarily reachable. that is, one simply discards all those states not reachable from the initial states by transitions. from the categorical standpoint this means that the intersection of all pointed sub nfas exists. similarly, for any pointed nca, the intersection of all pointed sub ncas exists i.e. we can always construct a unique reachable sub nca.



example 4.3(1) if n(l) is an nfa(i.e., has identity closure) then it is topological. for example, this is the case whenever dl= 2nl where dl(resp. nl) is the number of states of a state-minimal dfa(resp. nfa) accepting l, see.



if n(l) is topological then so is n(rev(l)). indeed, recall that they are duals. then since n(l) is topological iff the closed sets czl form a distributive lattice, its order-dual is also distributive and is isomorphic to czrev(l).
