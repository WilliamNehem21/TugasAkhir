we define a rule-based notation with stochastic semantics. the main entities in the notation are objects with attributes that are defined at the type level, so that every object of that type has these attributes. for the above diffusion model we could have for example a type x(n: int) with attribute n for the position of the x molecule in the array. objects are instantiations of this type with concrete values for the attribute like x(n= 1) for a molecule in the first cell, x(n= 2) for a molecule in the second cell and so on. the rules describe how objects are added or removed(section 3) at the type level, so that a rule applies for all objects of that type(x(n= 1), x(n= 2) etc.). this leads to a more compact representation of the model because each rule corresponds to multiple concrete reactions. if we make our species attributes of some type, for example in our case we could have cell(pos: int, x: int), when we create new cell objects we are also creating new species that will automatically be picked up by the cell rules. this solves the second problem we noted. our language is like a rule-based of coloured petri nets. this rule-based textual representation becomes very important for the readability of larger models and our embedding in haskell gives extra expressive power that is also crucial in practice(see section 6 for full discussion).





we will think about all the processes that affect growth in the following way: we think of assimilation of carbon per leaf as increasing the carbon concentration of the central cell depending on the photosynthesis level of a leaf(which will depend on its size); we think of maintenance respiration as the central cell giving some carbon to a leaf; and we think of growth respiration as the central cell giving some carbon to a leaf and the leaf mass increasing. we will also have creation of new leaves. there are interesting dynamics here such as the interaction between growth and assimilation: the more we grow, the more the leaves can photosynthesise, and the more carbon can go to the central cell.



objects or agents are the main entities in the language. each object is an instantiation of a type that provides the general structure of all objects of that type. agent types have a name and a number of named fields for their attributes. their syntax is:



an example of an agent type is the leaf agent type that we have seen in the previous section that has mass and age fields: leaf(mass: real, age: int). any specific leaf object is an instantiation of this agent type, for example: leaf(mass= 3.5, age= 3). the types for the fields are not fixed here and the language is parametric in them. in the next section, when we define the haskell embedding, we will fix these to be the haskell types.



the state of the system is a multiset of objects of the defined types. we write multisets using{|...|} brackets. for example for the types of objects we had in the example in the previous section a possible valid state of the system is:



rules have a left-hand side, which is matched against the state of the system. any match can then be replaced by the right-hand side. the left-hand side is really simple: it can only select objects based on their type and bind the values for their fields to some variables which can then be used in the expressions for the values of the objects appearing on the right-hand side. the variables can also be used in the rate and condition expressions. we impose some constraints on the use of the variables: variables can only appear once in the left hand side of rules and the number of patterns, fieldpats, for some agentname should match the fields in the type declaration of agentname. variables appearing in the expressions of rhs, rate, and cond must appear on the lhs of the corresponding rule. the cond is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value and determines the applicability of the rule. again, we deliberately do not fix the exprs and vars to any specific sets and we could think of the language as being parametric on these. in the haskell embedding we fix these to be haskell variables and expressions.



given the agent type a(a: int), consider for example the left-hand side a(a= x), a(a= y) and state{|a(a= 1), a(a= 2)|}. to distinguish these four different a agents, let us call them a1,..., a4. then we find two distinct matches m1=



in any implementation of the language, eventually all entities have to become data structures in some programming language in order to set the model in motion on a computer. there are two extremes to this. at one end, we could make the model definition exactly like the abstract one presented in the previous section and then translate it to the programming language constructs. at the other end, the model definition could happen directly as constructs in some programming language. there are advantages and disadvantages to both but here we choose something in the middle: the model definition stays inside the programming language but we tweak the language a bit so that it understands the convenient rule syntax.



this looks very close to how we have been writing rules in our abstract syntax, but with some minor syntactic differences such as the placement of the rate expression at the end of the rule preceded by the@ symbol. crucially, being inside a programming language means that we can use any valid haskell expression in the places where expressions are expected, i.e. in the values of fields in the right-hand side of rules, rates, and conditions.



with the functions isfirstthree, isleaf:: object-> bool and the evident implementation. these are the most generic query constructs, but starting from them we can specialise to the most common use-cases with default filter and accumulation functions. for example, to select elements from the multiset we have special selects for objects with a specific type, or objects that have certain values for a field. and to aggregate we have special aggregate functions like sum, min/max, average, count.



the correspondence to our system is straight-forward, coloursets are our object types(records with named fields), tokens are our objects, and transitions are our rules. cpn transitions also have predicates that are the same as our conditions. one difference is that cpns also allow union types instead of just product types as in our language. a stochastic version of this cpn formulation has also been



the dynamics of the two types of entities, continuous variables and objects, are not integrated like our language. in chromar creating new objects or updating the values at the fields of objects works in the same way by removing and adding objects. the main difference is though that an execution of a simile model ends up as a system of odes whereas in chromar we are in the stochastic world. again the graphical notation of simile becomes, in our experience, problematic for larger than a few variables models.



we have defined an extension to the representation of reactions where we extend the simple, typed objects to objects employing rich types, namely records with named typed fields. writing rules on these richer types yields a more compact representation than one would get by writing reactions on the simpler types in the traditional reactions setting. moreover it sometimes helps writing systems that are impossible to write otherwise for example systems with dynamic number of species by allowing us to store variables as object attributes which means that creating new objects creates new species.



in terms of the simulation our implementation is simple and basically follows the steps we presented in section 3. the idea about dynamic creation of reactions also appears in. one area of improvement is the reaction generation step where we currently generate all the active reactions at every step. in practise though we do not need to completely regenerate them at every step since only a subset of them changes between steps. the performance gains will depend on the efficiency of calculating the change in the reactions set after a change in the state. similar techniques where the matches are generated only once at the beginning of the simulation and then updated according to state changes are used in kappa.



finally, in a lot of use-cases the environment in which the rules are operating is not constant. this is especially important in plant biology since plants are very adaptive to environmental inputs, for example our system in section 2 is very detached from reality since the assimilation rule is always active whereas in reality it should switch on only during the day when the plant photosynthesises. incorporating a changing environment means somehow incorporating time inside our language. such an extension would be really powerful and very practically useful.
