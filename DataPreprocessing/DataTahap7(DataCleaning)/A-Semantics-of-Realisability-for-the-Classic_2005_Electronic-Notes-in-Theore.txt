until very recently(see the introduction of for a brief history), no proof of the strong normalization of the cut-elimination procedure was known for full logic. in, p. de groote gives a such proof for classical propositional natural deduction by using the cps-transformation. r. david and the first author give in a direct and syntactical proof of this result. r. matthes recently found another semantical proof of this result(see).



the paper is organized as follows. section 2 is an introduction to the typed system and the relative cut-elimination procedure. in section 3, we define the semantics of realisability and we prove the correctness theorem. in section 4, we give some applications of this result.
