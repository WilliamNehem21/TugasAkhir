it comes as no surprise that there are so many approaches: despite all ultimately cope with the same issues, they are inspired by different aims and perspective, leading to different solutions and choices. it is therefore important to investigate the relationships between these metamodels. first, this will point out similarities and differences between metamodels. possibly, apparently peculiar idiosyncrasies are either justified, or revealed to be inessential. moreover, these interconnections allow for transferring properties, techniques and constructions among metamodels, thus cross-fertilizing each other. in fact, this formal comparison allows for highlighting weak points of some metamodel, and possibly for suggesting improvements.



on sets, permutations coincide with automorphisms(because there is no structure to preserve), hence the notation denoting the permutation group. we stick however to permutations since now this is almost the standard usage in theoretical computer science, and it is the term used in our main references: see[14, section 2.1] and the initial paragraphs of[6, section 3].
