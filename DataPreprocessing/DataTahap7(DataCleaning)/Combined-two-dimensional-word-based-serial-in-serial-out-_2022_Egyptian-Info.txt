modular exponentiation is a fundamental part of cryptographic algorithms. there are two binary approaches used to compute modular exponentiation: most significant bit(msb)-first approach and least significant bit(lsb)-first approach. in lsb-first approach, the modular multiplication and squaring operations can be executed concurrently to reduce the processing time. there are many attempts in the literature to combine the multiplication and squaring operations in a unified structure to increase performance and hardware utilization[7,8,26]. to the best of our knowledge, the suggested combined multiplier-squarer structures are dedicated



this paper is organized as follows. section 2 gives a brief explanation to the combined polynomial multiplication-squaring algorithm in gf 2m. section 3 develops its associated dependency graph(dg). section 4 explains the explored two-dimensional word-based siso systolic processor. section 5 provides the area and delay complexities of the proposed design and the best of the existing word-serial designs. section 6 concludes this work.



output cw and ce affects only south output cs. hence at time n output cw is valid while output cs is not since we need to add to it ce. this will result in increasing the total number of iterations needed to produce the final result by one time step. therefore, the total number of iterations needed to complete the combined multiplication/squaring computation will be given by:



of the existing word-serial multiplier structures[12,17,33,34] in terms of area and time complexities. the area is estimated in terms of numbers of tri-state buffers, 2-input and gate, 2-input xor gate, 2-input multiplexers, and flip-flops. the time is represented by latency and critical path delay(cpd).
