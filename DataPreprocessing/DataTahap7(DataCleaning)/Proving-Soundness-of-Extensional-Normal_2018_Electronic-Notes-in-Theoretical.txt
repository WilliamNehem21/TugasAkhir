the complete proof of theorem 3.8 can be found in the coq formalization. we sketch some of the compatibility proofs to show how proofs are done in our framework, in particular the crucial case of app, where we need the distinction between active and passive tests. we compare ourselves to the proof technique of, which would do an induction on the definition of the closure using definition 3.1. we do not need an induction on the number of evaluation steps for our small-step definition, but a nested induction proof for a big-step relation would exhibit the same issues. the strong up-to techniques lam, refl, and red are easy to deal with; we detail the proof for lam.
