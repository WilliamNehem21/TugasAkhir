of course, nn has a natural topology, namely the product topology starting from the discrete topology on n. when we view nn as a topological space we call it the baire space. similarly, 2n with the relative topology is the cantor space.



remark 3.1 in many cases, including some of the examples given above, it is best to view the domain and the range of h as represented spaces different from p(n), thus unraveling the coding used in the reverse mathematics approach. e.g. the functions arising from examples(i) and(iii) are best viewed respectively as a partial multi-valued function from p(2<n) to 2n and a total single-valued function from in to i.



definition 5.3[the space of all effective banach spaces] let bs be the set of all constructive banach completions. this set contains all effective banach spaces up to isomorphism, and we consider it as the space of all effective banach spaces.
