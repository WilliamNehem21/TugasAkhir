(1) to the reachability problem of an autonomous system, i.e. a system without the input bu. under the assumption that the inputs are stepwise constant, this can be done by shifting the input bu into the state space. the price we pay for having a system without inputs is that the number of dimensions increases by the number of inputs.



note that in the case of a being not invertible, before applying the standard approach one needs to transform the system such that it has an invertible system matrix. this is not necessary when applying the proposed alternative approach. further, a more careful analysis reveals that computational complexity of both approaches is essentially the same.
