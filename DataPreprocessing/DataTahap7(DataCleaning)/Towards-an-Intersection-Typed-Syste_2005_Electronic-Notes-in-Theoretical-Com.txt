typed and type assignment proofs are isomorphic, i.e. both the application of the erasing function j on all terms in a typed proofs produces a correct type assignment proof, and every type assignment proof is obtained from a typed one by erasure.



it is necessary to know exactly how the rules for introducing and eliminating the universal quantifier work. however, we think that the production of an usable language is not the only justification for the problem we studied. the relationship between typed and type assignment systems is an important theoretical issue, that is interesting in itself.
