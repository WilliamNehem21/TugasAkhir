esa techniques can be applied in motors and generators, and it is important to note that the voltage signature analysis(vsa) is related to an upstream circuit analysis under monitoring, i.e. towards the generator; already the current signature analysis(csa) is related to a downstream analysis of the circuit under monitoring, i.e. toward the load.



in one hand, csa or vsa are techniques used to analyze and follow the trend of energized dynamic systems. the proper analysis of the results of applying the technique helps in the identification of predictive problems in stator winding, rotor problems, problems in the coupling on charge-coupled, efficiency and charging system, bearing problems, etc. these techniques use electric machine under monitoring as a transducer, allowing the user to evaluate the electrical and mechanical condition from the power panel and it consists primarily of monitoring one of the three phases of the current or voltage of the machine.
