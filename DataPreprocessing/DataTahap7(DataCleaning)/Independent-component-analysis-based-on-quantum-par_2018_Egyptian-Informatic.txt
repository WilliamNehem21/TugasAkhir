i.i.d. and well-condition. the proposed method is considered the best from the previous method that depending on some measurements as snr and sdr. the performance of this method has been tested on two metrics signal-to-noise ratio(snr) and signal-to-distortion ratio(sdr).



the most commonly mechanism for analyzing latent data is independent component analysis(ica). ica is a probabilistic and statistical method for separating a multivariate signal into additive subcomponents supposes the mutual statistical independence of the non-gaussian signals of the sources. ica methods use one of two properties: non-gaussianity or sample dependence[1,2].



the independence assumption is correct in the most cases, so, the blind, ica, separation of mixed signals gives very good results. the methods, that use the statistical properties of the signals, it will find the independent components by minimizing the statistical dependence of the estimated signal factors(components). non-gaussianity feature used to measure the independence of the component, by the kurtosis measurement or approximation of negentropy.



the rest of this paper is organized as: section 2 shows the background theory which includes the fundamentals of ica, pso and qpso. section 3, the proposed technique is technique. section 4 describes the results of experiments, and evaluates them of some evaluation measurements. the conclusion is reported in section 5. finally, the references in section 6.



li et al. presented a method to reduce the drawbacks in the bss by using improved particle swarm optimization(pso). their method is based on updating the dynamic inertia weight in pso and introduce the fitness function of pso based on bss.
