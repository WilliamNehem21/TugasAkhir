to solve the above problem, the intelligent control system is designed in this paper for weathering steel corrosion test. the system includes a simple temperature expert controller and a humidity fuzzy controller by correction factor method. the proposed method has been successfully used for weathering steel corrosion test, and achieved satisfactory results.



the pulse-type humidifier controls the humidity of the test chamber, humidifier pulse signal trigger control to produce steam for humidification, making humidity changes uneven in the chamber. the humidity of the test chamber by a variety of interference, there are many uncertainties. therefore, it is not possible to establish the mathematical model used to control humidity.
