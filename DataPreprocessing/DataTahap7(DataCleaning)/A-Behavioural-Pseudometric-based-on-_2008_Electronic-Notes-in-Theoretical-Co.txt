another approach is based on distance functions over processes(or, states). for instance, giacalone et al. and desharnais et al.[3,4] define the pseudometrics on the states of probabilistic transition systems respectively. in the framework of lts, van breugel provides three avenues to define behavioural pseudometrics. the behavioural pseudometric is a distance function between states, which is a quantitative analogue of bisimilarity. in the framework of quantitative transition system(qts), de alfaro et al. define the distance between traces and lift this trace distance to distances over states. furthermore, they provide the notion of branching distance, which generalizes the notion of bisimilarity.
