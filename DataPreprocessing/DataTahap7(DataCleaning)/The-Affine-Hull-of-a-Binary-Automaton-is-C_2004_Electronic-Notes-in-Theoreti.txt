in section 2, some usual notations are recalled and in section 3 we explain why all the operations used in this article over the affine spaces can be done just by using a gauss elimination algorithm. in section 4, the binary automata are presented and in the following section, an algorithm for computing the affine hull of the set of vectors accepted by a binary automaton is provided. finally, in section 6, this affine hull is proved to be useful for computing the place invariants of an effective counter system, a model introduced in this last section.



remark 4.4 ndd also allow to represent vectors in zm by considering a 2-complement representation. we have not considered this special feature to simplify the presentation of this article. however, the extension can be easily done by considering a 2-complement representation or by remarking that for



in the subsection 6.1, we prove that we can compute the affine hull of the reachability relation of a counter system in polynomial time in function of the affine hull of the reachability relation in one step. this polynomial time complexity is explained in the next subsection 6.2. in fact, we show the polynomial time link between the affine hull of the reachability relation of a counter system and a natural extension of place invariants. in the last subsection 6.3 we prove that the place invariants of an effective counter system can be computed in polynomial time.
