the synchronous product of two nondeterministic automata with fuzzy transitions. moreover, it is proved that the algebra constituted by any set of fuzzy synchronous languages and the signature previously defined forms a ska. finally, section 5 concludes and enumerates some topics for future research.



let us revisit the example mentioned in the introduction, concerning the joint fuzzy flow of two reagents. the fuzzyness in a flow represents potential malfunctions in the control apparatus. in order to model the confidence values of execution, we assume the structure g of example 2.6. consider, for instance, that the machine releases the reagents c and m with certainty values 0.95 and 0.93, respectively. we model such situation by taking the action corresponding to adding c with certainty



most of the results presented in the context of fuzzy languages are constructed using either the real interval[0, 1] or a generic residuated lattice l to model the(possible) many valued membership values. however, one of the main results of this paper, theorem 4.6 relies on properties provided by a specific characterisation of a lattice ordered structure: the operator; of the parameter must be idempotent and commutative. the definition presented for h-nfa differs from in the semantic structure used for membership values. although the original definition uses the unit interval[0, 1], we consider values from a more generic structure, a complete heyting algebra.
