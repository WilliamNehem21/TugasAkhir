categorial grammars have been studied in the domain of natural language processing, we focus here on classical(or basic) categorial grammars that were introduced in and on lambek categorial grammars which are closely connected to linear logic introduced by girard. these grammars are lexicalized grammars that assign types(or categories) to the lexicon; they are called k-valued, when each symbol in the lexicon is assigned to at most k types; they are also called rigid when 1-valued. such k-valued grammars are of particular interest in recent works on learnability. in this context, it is important to acquire a good understanding of the properties of the class of grammars in question.



classical categorial grammar. a classical categorial grammar over is a finite relation g between and t p. if< c; a>2 g, we say that g assigns a to c, and we write g: c 7! a. we write subt p(g) the set of subformulas of types that are assigned by g to some symbol in.



we define g2d similarly, by exchanging the roles of all ui and vi. proposition 3.7 g1d and g2d are both rigid injective pcp-grammars. example 3.8 let d1=<(ab; abbb);(bb; b)> we get p rd1= fa; b; 1; 2; t;#g



this paper has answered a decidability question concerning each class of k-valued classical categorial grammars, and each class of k-valued lambek grammars: the emptiness of intersection of two langages is an undecidable problem for each class. the proof relies on a specific class introduced here as pcp-grammars, a subclass of unidirectional grammars, for which we establish several properties. in particular, the problem we have focused on is undecidable for this subclass(thus not trivial).
