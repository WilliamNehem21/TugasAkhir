the algorithm developed may be embedded in to any existing query languages so that the use of non aggregate functions is possible which makes the complexity of the query get reduced in terms of query processing and also the time efficiency. section iii, iv describes the proposed algorithm with a working example. the objective of this algorithm is to make the pattern shift by a length more than the pattern length as compared to the existing algorithms. the efficiency can be seen from the moves made by the pattern itself.



in the preprocessing phase failure functions are first computed. in case of any mismatch in the search process the algorithm uses three attribute values of the input present immediately after the aligned sliding pattern. these attribute values are called look ahead elements.
