in the following we have to deal with closed and compact subsets of normed and metric spaces. given a metric space x we denote the set of all closed subsets of x by a(x) and the set of all compact subsets of x by k(x). to represent these spaces we use the representations for closed and compact subsets of metric spaces that are defined and studied by brattka and presser in.



the norm of a normed space x is strictly convex if and only if every nonempty(closed) convex subset of x is a set of uniqueness[8, theorem 5.1.18]. if every nonempty closed convex subset of a normed space x is a set of existence, then x is reflexive. additionally, a normed space x is reflexive and has got a strictly convex norm if and only if every nonempty closed convex subset is a chebyshev set. it follows that every nonempty closed convex subset of a uniformly convex banach space x is a chebyshev set, that is the metric projection onto it is a total and single-valued function.
