the motion pattern of a moving object is relatively complex; so the motion process of the entity is simplified for the sake of the study. the following study mainly concerns rigid entities. first, the collision detection is carried out when the entity is in translation on horizontal ground; then the collision detection of the entity in fixed-axis rotation is analyzed. because complex motion of entities can all be reduced to the combination of these two basic motions.



translation is the most common movement in engineering and life, and is also the simplest movement. therefore, to study the motion of an entity in a virtual scene should also start from the study of translation. in translation, an entity can move in a straight line or along a curved path. but in a virtual scene, the motion of the entity is embodied by the change in its location at each frame. the location of the entity at the next frame is only associated with its location and speed at the current frame; so the translation between two frames can be regarded as linear motion.



in this paper, a dynamic collision detection method is put forward for the distortion phenomenon of armored vehicle penetrating the ground object in visual scenes, and a dynamic collision detection model is constructed. the model is verified to be of good detection effect of collision after simulation and a number of contrast tests, and thus capable of solving the problem mentioned above. the shortcoming of this model is its failure to incorporate the specific shape of armored vehicle in the model, which will be considered in future studies.
