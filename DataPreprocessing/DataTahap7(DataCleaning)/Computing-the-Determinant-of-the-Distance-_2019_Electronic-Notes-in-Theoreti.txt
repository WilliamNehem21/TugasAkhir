lemma 2.1[3, lemma 2.3] let g be a graph. if h is the graph obtained from a graph g by adding a pendant vertex to any vertex of g, then det(d(h)) is invariant, regardless of which vertex of g has been connected to the pendant vertex by an edge.



{v1, v2,..., vk} and{vk+1, vk+2,..., vn}, respectively. let g be the graph obtained from g1 and g2 by adding an edge between vertices v1 and vn, and let h be graph obtained from g1 and g2 by identifying vertices v1 and vn and then adding a pendent vertex from v1(or vn). then, det(d(g))= det(d(h)).
