is an exchange rule defining a bond flipping from the site 2 of a to 1 of c. bond flipping is of a peculiar interest to model nano-machines where links between components are dynamically rearranged. despite the simplicity of these reactions, their implementation in spim calculus is complex if the stochastic semantics must be preserved. let us discuss the problems through a number of examples.



the reductions of spim calculus are communications on a channel. since they are fixed, they will not play any relevant role in the following definition 2.4.(they will be embodied in the(init) item of the definition.) therefore we omit the formal definition here.
