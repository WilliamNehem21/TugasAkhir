given a colored graph f, we say that a multicolored cluster graph h contains f if h contains a copy of f for which the color of each edge of f is contained in the list of the corresponding edge in h. more generally, if f is a graph with color pattern p, we say that h contains(f, p) if it contains some colored copy of f with pattern isomorphic to p. in connection with this definition, we may obtain the following embedding result. the proof of this result follows from arguments such as in the proof of the key lemma.
