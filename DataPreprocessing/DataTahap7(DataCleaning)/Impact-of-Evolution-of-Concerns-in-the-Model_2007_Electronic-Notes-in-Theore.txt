separation of concerns is an important principle for designing high quality software systems and is both applied in the model-driven architecture(mda) and aspect-oriented software development(aosd). the aosd and mda techniques seem to be complementary to each other; historically aosd has focused on modeling crosscutting concerns whereas mda has focused on the explicit separation of platform independent concerns from platform specific concerns and the model-driven generation processes. in order to assess the benefits of aosd for mda we provide a systematic analysis on crosscutting concerns within the mda context. the analysis consists of three steps. first, we define an abstract model of mda transformation with respect to concerns. second, we define a number of evolution scenarios that correspond to a selected list of crosscutting concerns. third, we analyze the model transformations in mda with respect to the abstract model, the evolution scenarios and the related crosscutting concerns. this analysis results in the definition of a number of key problems related to the integration and evolution of crosscutting concerns in the mda approach. based on this analysis we provide a set of recommendations for the language and the process that is used in the mda approach.



software systems. to this end mda separates platform independent models(pims) from platform specific models(psms). the pim is a model that abstracts from any implementation technology or platform. the pim is transformed into one or more psms which include the platform specific details. finally the psm is transformed to code providing the implementation details. obviously by separating the platform specific concerns and providing mechanisms to compose these concerns afterwards in the code mda provides a clean separation of concerns and as such the systems are better reusable easier to port to different platforms and have increased interoperability.



however, current software systems also have to cope with other concerns than platform specific concerns. very often software systems also need to deal with other important concerns such as distribution, persistence, synchronization, and error detection. these concerns tend to crosscut various components of the software architecture and as such increase the complexity and decrease the maintenance of software systems.



aspect-oriented software development(aosd) aims to cope with these crosscutting concerns by providing explicit abstractions called aspects. by separating the crosscutting concerns in aspects and providing the composition of aspects with the components the impact of crosscutting concerns is better managed. both aosd and mda provide in essence useful techniques for separating the concerns and in that sense aosd and mda techniques are complementary to each other; historically aosd has focused on modeling crosscutting concerns whereas mda has focused on the explicit separation of platform independent concerns from platform specific concerns and the model-driven generation processes. as such we think that both aosd and mda can benefit from each other to even further tackle the challenges of current large and complex software systems.



since aosd is primarily focused at solving the problems related to crosscutting concerns we will provide a systematic analysis of crosscutting concerns within the mda context. the analysis consists of three steps. first, we define an abstract model of mda transformations as defined by so-called concern transformation patterns(ctp). ctps characterize the corresponding transformation and help to pinpoint the key problems in the transformation. second, we define a number of evolution scenarios that correspond to a selected list of crosscutting concerns. the evolution scenarios are applied to a concurrent versioning system which is developed using an mda-based approach. third, we analyze the model transformations in mda with respect to ctps, the evolution scenarios and the related crosscutting concerns. this analysis results in the definition of a number of key problems related to the integration and evolution of crosscutting concerns in the mda approach. based on this analysis we provide a set of recommendations for the language and the process that is used in the mda approach.



in section 2 we will present the concern transformation patterns as an abstraction of different potential transformations. section 3 explains the case on concurrent versioning systems. this case will be used to explain the notion of crosscutting concerns and to analyze the impact of crosscutting concerns in the mda process.



section 4 will define the number of scenarios including the concerns that will be applied to the cvs in the mda life cycle. section 5 defines the lessons learned and provides recommendations for coping with crosscutting concerns in the mdaapproach. finally section 6 will provide the conclusions.



composition of concerns b and c in model a, whereby b and c can not be localized. note that patterns 1, 3, 5, 6 and 7 lead to such a merged composition in which one or more concerns are not explicitly localized. patterns 5 to 8 can be considered as composite concern transformation patterns because each of them could be in essence defined as a composition of two other primitive transformation patterns. pattern 5 could be seen as a composition of pattern 1 and 3, pattern 6 as a composition of patterns 1 and 4, pattern 7 as a composition of patterns 2 and 3, and finally pattern 8 as a composition of patterns 2 and 4.



in the first two patterns the transformations do not include an explicit concern but are mainly used to compose the provided concerns(in this case a and c). in the first pattern the composition result is a merged output in which concern c is not separated anymore. in the second pattern, the concern c is kept separate indicating a more composable design.



patterns 3 to 8 include transformations that add concerns themselves. in pattern 3 and 4 include situations in which no additional concerns are provided to the transformations. the third pattern represents a transformation in which the model a is transformed to the target model a<b>. here, the concern b is introduced by the transformation process t<b> and it is not separable from the concerns that are originally defined in a. assume for example that the model a represents a pim which is transformed to a java psm. in case of pattern 3, it is assumed that the java specific concerns introduced in a<b> cannot be separated from the original concerns of a. in pattern 4, the model a is transformed to the composition of the the transformation t<b> are merged in the target model a<b,c> and therefore they cannot be treated separately anymore. in pattern 6, concern c is merged but concern b from the transformation is provided as a separate model. in pattern 7 concern b from the transformation is merged while concern c is represented as a separate model. finally pattern 8 shows the case in which concerns b and c are separated. in fact this can be considered as the most maintainable alternative because the concerns are fully separated, both in the source and the target.



given the models and the transformation of mda we can now focus on the analysis of crosscutting concerns in mda. to illustrate the impact of crosscutting on model transformations we will add the concerns security, logging, versioning strategy and persistence. obviously, these concerns might be introduced at the cim, pim, psm or even the code level. if we also consider the various orderings in which these concerns might be introduced in the model transformation process, it becomes clear that the number of model transformations increase dramatically. an exhaustive analysis of all the possible alternative model transformations with these specific concerns could provide us a complete overview of the problems that we might encounter. however, it is from a practical point of view not possible to analyze all these possibilities. further, our goal in this paper is not to provide a complete analysis for the specific set of concerns but rather to pinpoint practical recurring problems that might appear in mda while applying crosscutting concerns. secondly, in principle it also does not seem to be necessary to provide an exhaustive analysis to identify the key problems. this is because we can easily group the transformations and reason about crosscutting concerns in the model transformations in a more abstract manner.



for the pim to psm transformation we have defined scenarios s5 and s6, which transform the pim to a relational db platform model, and a java platform model, respectively. both scenarios can be applied after scenario s4. below we discuss both alternatives.



for the psm to psm transformations the scenarios s7(versioning strategy), s8(adding persistency) and s9(upgrading to remote security checking) are applied. these scenarios are applied either after scenario s5(relational psm) or scenario s6(java psm). it appears that both transitions have different implications.



if the target model is not expressive enough this might lead to scattered concerns. this could occur even in case the concern was separated at the source model. in the given scenarios the concerns security, logging, versioning and persistency were crosscutting due to lack of explicit abstraction mechanisms in java and the relational database platform. the lack of a modeling language for aspects, leads to the problem that aspects cannot be neatly separated from the other concerns. this means that a solution has to include a modeling language for aspects for the different modeling stages of the mda process.



the ordering of the transformation plays an important role in the quantity of crosscutting that can or will occur. the previous two points have already showed the impact of introducing concerns earlier or later in the mda process. moreover, the ordering is also important within the same abstraction level. for example the security and logging concerns both impact each other as it has been discussed in section 4.3. in that case we have to explicitly reason about the semantic conflicts and the impact of the ordering on the model transformations. it would be worthwhile if the transformation would be aware of the ordering semantics. for this the domain of the concerns should be well-understood.



obviously all the vertical model transformations including cim to pim, pim to psm and psm to code introduce some crosscutting behavior. this crosscutting behavior is the platform concern itself. unfortunately, it is very hard to separate the platform concern. at least we have not been able to show this in our analysis. the transformations are easier in case the models are closer to each other. for example, in the given analysis we have chosen for transforming a uml-based pim to a java based psm. this is naturally different than transforming a umlbased pim to a relational psm, which results in different kind of crosscutting(next).



have seen that crosscutting is not visible in the model. compared to a java implementation some crosscutting concerns are more localized in database operations. this shows that the selection of the platform does not only impacts how much the concern is crosscutting, but also how much this crosscutting is visible. in our relational psm the crosscutting is not directly visible and as such, was compared to the java psm more difficult to address. the visibility of the crosscutting is of course also important for the next transformation(code).



respect to the language of the target. for example, in case of mapping the pim to the psm with the concerns security and logging to a relational psm, results in a different type of crosscutting than in case the target language is uml. in the first case the crosscutting is not directly visible and hidden over many database operations, while in the latter case the crosscutting concerns is scattered over different uml classes. a crosscutting concerns is usually defined as the scattering of the concern over multiple units of implementation and tangling of multiple concerns in local implementation units. obviously from our study it seems that the notion of crosscutting should be further specialized to distinguish between various types of crosscutting and as such provide a deeper insight in the problems of crosscutting concerns.
