work can be modified to account for more general cell-to-cell relationships. specifically, we consider the following two general scenarios. first, the number of cells may vary at different time points, and as a result, some cells may need to be reused when constructing cell-to-cell lineages. this can lead to multiple lineages passing through a single cell at specific time points. second, cells may exhibit different proliferation rates at the same time points, i.e., the numbers of new cells produced by two cells at the same time point could be significantly different. this could result in the varying proportions of cell groups across time. to address these general assumptions, we present a comprehensive discussion of our generalized methods and experimental results in the supplementary materials.



independently for each time point. these simulation datasets contain five same cell types in both time points. in the simulation setting, the number of cells ranges from 200 to 600, and the number of genes in one cell ranges from 100 to 500. the cell alignment and cell-to-cell correspondences were constructed using the cellst based only on the gene expression information of cells at each time point and no information



with the benchmark pathway expression patterns(black curves). the expression of cell fate trajectories illustrates consistent patterns with the benchmark expression of the two simulated pathways over time. in addition to the consistency, we observed that cells have unique behaviors over time from the cell fate trajectories. some cells grow slower and have lower expression values, while others grow faster and have higher expression values than the simulated average development patterns. the cell fate trajectories predict the unique cell development behaviors by smoothing the constructed cell lineages to reduce cell-cell variance.



those results proved that the cell fate trajectories and dynamic gene networks in the cellst method can be used to discover critical genes in a cell differentiation process. we also demonstrated the cellst cell fate trajectories have full coverage on different cell lineages even in some rare cell types since the trajectories track individual cell behaviors. lastly, those individual cell fate trajectories reflect unique gene expression patterns when cells develop into different mature cell types.
