here g is a finite group whose elements are{g1,..., gk, 1} and g is an element in g. here 1 denotes the identity of g. we denote by multiplication the group operator. if the ordering of the group is known we will drop that from the subscript of the syntax. also we denote by ltlgrp(g) the logic if the only group used is g.



lemma 3.4 and lemma 3.5 let us rewrite formulas with past operators nested inside future operators. observe that there are dual lemmas where the past operator is replaced by the future operator and vice versa. using these two lemmas we give a series of lemmas to show that formulas in ltlgrp can be separated. these lemmas are proved using induction on the structure of the formula.
