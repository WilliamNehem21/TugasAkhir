the structure of the paper is as follows. section 2 presents the apartness latticeordered semigroups. section 3 defines the supermetrics over this structure, and it provides the main novel concept of the paper. in section 4 we present the relationship between supermetrics and additive functions. some results related to the complete apartness lattice-ordered semigroups and to their completions are presented in sections 5 and 6.



an important property is(b2c); it is similar to a property which characterizes the finite-dimensional normed spaces. in our framework, the boundedness is given by the lattice order. on the other hand, we can get more results if we work with an alo-semigroup satisfying(mc). starting from an arbitrary alo-semigroup s together with an increasing additive function f over s, and using a standard procedure of completion for metric spaces, we can build an alo-semigroup s1 and a strictly



in this paper we define a supermetric over the set underlying an alo-semigroup. the properties which the distance function needs to satisfy are expressed in terms of the semigroup and lattice operations. several results of these supermetrics are proved. we define the notion of a pseudo-supermetric over an alo-semigroup, and we characterize the supermetrics as the strict, increasing additive functions from such a structure to the reals. we investigate various notions of completions of our structures with respect to the introduced supermetrics, and we show that each structure endowed with a strict, increasing additive function(which corresponds to a unique supermetric) has a completion, and any two such completions are isomorphic.
