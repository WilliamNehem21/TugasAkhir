the turbo encoder used in lte consists of two convolutional concatenated encoders that are connected by an interleaver. the code rate of turbo coder used in the lte is 1/3 and its two generated polynomials are g0= and g1=. from two candidates as quadratic permutation polynomial(qpp) and almost regular permutation(arp), qpp was selected to improve the maximum throughput of the system. this interleaver is a conflict-free parallel turbo coder and provides maximum flexibility in supporting the parallelism. in lte, the value for qpp inverse polynomial interleaver is 4. from the 1/3 rate output of the turbo coder, rate matching(rm) algorithm selects bits for transmission via puncturing or repeating. in rate matching, the bits in the code block are punctured and repeated to achieve a desired effective code rate(ecr).



ulation scheme and ecr of 0.0762, has the lowest error rate, thus the best transmission quality. lower order modulation schemes have lower data rates as the number of bits per symbol is less. it results in increasing the symbol pulse-width thus decreasing signal bandwidth and a better ber performance.



value while increasing the quantity of cqi feedbacks, a penalty of enhancing snr must be paid. since higher cqi values indicate higher modulation orders and higher ecrs, thus higher bit rate is transferred, which causes increasing the signal bandwidth and overlapping. so, we see that at low channel snrs, higher cqi feedback values will have worse ber performances than the lower cqi feedback values.



lte system is presented, where the ber difference between different channel bandwidths is insignificant. this is due to taking the advantage of ofdm technique in downlink transmission, which results in decreasing isi in high data rates. in addition to ofdm technique, using turbo coding, interleaver, and harq retransmissions help to keep the system ber at low levels.
