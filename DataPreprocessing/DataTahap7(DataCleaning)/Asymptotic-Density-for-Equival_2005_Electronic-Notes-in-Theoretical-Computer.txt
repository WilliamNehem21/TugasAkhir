this paper is a continuation of searching for asymptotic density of some propositional logic in the following sense. we investigate the size of the fraction of true formulas of given length n against the number of all formulas of length n. generally, we intend to find the limit of that fraction when n. if the limit exists, it represents a number, which we may call the density of truth for the logic investigated.



another interesting result is presented in. the previous language is extended by adding negation. it turns out that the limit still exists, but negation lowers down the density of truth to the level of 42.32%. additionally in author presents a simple and fast(log(n)) probabilistic algorithm for checking if a given formula is a tautology.



more general results can be found in, where authors consider language build with two connectives(and, or) and literals. they proved that asymptotic density exists for any boolean function defined in this language, when number of variables is fixed. additionally, they improved, already known, the upper bound for asymptotic density of chosen boolean function.



all that we need now is to determinate the number tk. the following simple observation will provide us with enough information to write closed form(lemma 2.5) for tk. but this form is too complicated and theorem 2.6 give us the useful form for tk.



lemma 2.2), that every formula can be identified as a binary tree, where every leaf is labeled by an appropriate variable. so all we need is to evaluate a number of binary trees with 2n leaves where every label occurs even number of times. and then, by the remark 2.4, we get the number of all tautologies of even length.



in our case there are c2n binary trees with only one label. each of those trees must be labeled to preserve the condition on even number of each variable. let 2ij(j= 1,..., k) stands for the number occurrences of the label vj.
