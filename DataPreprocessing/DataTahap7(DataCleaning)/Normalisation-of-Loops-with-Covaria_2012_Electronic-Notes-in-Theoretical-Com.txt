several approaches have been explored in flow analysis concerning loop bounds[2,1,7,11,14,5]. most of these approaches use abstract interpretation to build a map which associates to the variables an abstract representation of its value. this permits to give safe, but possibly overestimated, sets of the states at the different program points.



if q1= 0 and if this x assignment is the one which leads to exit the loop, then x= q2x+ k20 is the default increment. when the first branch of if is executed, either the constant value of x gives that the loop condition is false at the next iteration so the maximum number of iteration of the loop is obtained when the second branch is always executed. either the loop condition is true so the loop may never terminate(resp. if q2= 0 is the last iteration case then x= q1x+ k10) else it is undefined.
