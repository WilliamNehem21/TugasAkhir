curve 4(b) shows that the desorption of acetic acid from cuo catalyst occurs slowly where the steady state value of conversion was obtained after 25 min. furthermore, the conversion at the steady state reaches 20% compared to 54% for the unsaturated catalyst. these results reflect that the basicity of cuo catalyst is reduced by 34%. this behavior suggests that the re-



curve 4(c) represents the effect of time on the desorption of acetic acid from cuo mixed with 30 wt.% nio catalyst. it shows that desorption of acetic acid occurs rapidly and hence the conversion of the ipa and the yield of acetone increase rapidly with time. also, the sample nearly restores its activity~95% after about 10 minutes. the remained value of~3% may be attributed to the adsorption of acetic acid on strong basic sites on the catalyst surface.
