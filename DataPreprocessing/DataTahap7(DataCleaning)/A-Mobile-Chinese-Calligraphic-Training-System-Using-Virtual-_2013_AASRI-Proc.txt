2d writing process recurring is used to demonstrate writing process by 2d animation method. it is helpful for learner to master the right stroke order. in tradition way, showing the writing process is often given by teacher face to face. the shortcoming of traditional way is that the writing process demonstrated by teacher cannot cover all the characters in calligraphic class and if someone wants to see the demonstration more times it will make teacher boring.
