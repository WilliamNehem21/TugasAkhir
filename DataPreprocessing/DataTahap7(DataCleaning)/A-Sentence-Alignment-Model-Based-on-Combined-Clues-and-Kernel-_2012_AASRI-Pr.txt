in various fields of research on natural language processing, the importance of bilingual corpus is more and more obvious. different applications call for aligned bilingual corpus of different granularities and corresponding technology, which includes article, paragraph, sentence, phrase and word level. sentence level aligned bilingual corpus is indispensable to example based machine translation.



multi-alignment penalty factor is to deal with alignment conflict. for an instance, when aligned conflicts happen and judge if the style is 1-2 or the two aligned 1-1 and 0-1, we need to calculate the similarity of these three kinds and then multiply the corresponding penalty factor. then we can compare their similarity modified.



on all kinds of alignment styles our system always has a lower error rate than gale system. the error rate of our system is 2.3% and gale is 3.5%. the exprimental results and analysis above fully prove the effectiveness of our calculating model.
