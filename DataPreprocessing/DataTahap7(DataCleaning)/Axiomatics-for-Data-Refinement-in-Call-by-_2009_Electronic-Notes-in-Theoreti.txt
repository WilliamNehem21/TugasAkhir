see for a solution using predicate transformers). the other approach, which has many sources but which has been advocated strongly by tennent, has been to use binary logical relations[21,19,4] to model data refinement. binary logical relations model data abstraction and are well suited to higher order types, but they do not compose. so one seeks a common generalisation that both accounts easily for higher order types and is closed under composition. that has led to the notion of lax logical relation[24,15] and variants. here, we explain and develop the notion of lax logical relation in the setting of call by value languages, based on but clarifying and extending the work of.



finally, we reach the modelling of data refinement. with the above extensions or improvements of previous work, we routinely generalise the notion of lax logical relation in. in doing so, we give a version of the basic lemma that is a much more direct generalisation of its usual formulation than appears in. we also give a condition, satisfied by all our leading examples, under which lax logical relations compose; one can see immediately that lax logical relations account for higher order structure too.
