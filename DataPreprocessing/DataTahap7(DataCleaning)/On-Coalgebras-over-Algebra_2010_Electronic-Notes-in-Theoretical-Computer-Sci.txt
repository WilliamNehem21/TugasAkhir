the situation described until now in this section can be presented as follows: if two endofunctors t and h are given, one may search for the appropriate monad such that(t, h) form a commuting pair. as there is a special bond between algebras of t and coalgebras of h, it is not clear whether the general case of any two(finitary) set-endofunctors would have a solution. but there is another possible approach: start only with one endofunctor and additionally with a(finitary) monad; find then a distributive law inducing a kleisli(or algebra) lift. once this is accomplished, one should built a second endofunctor on set(assuming this is possible) in order to obtain a commuting pair, using the functor obtained on alg(m).



the second part of the paper introduces the notion of a commuting pair of endofunctors with respect to a monad. this seems to be new, however a detailed analysis and more examples are needed in order to better understand this structure(like the connection between bisimulations and traces exhibited in). we plan to do this in a further paper.
