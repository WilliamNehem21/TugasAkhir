in this section we present our main result, which is a uniform version of the first two items of the second main theorem of pour-el and richards. we also prove corollaries of this result. the proof of the main result is suspended to the following sections because we need some technical preparations for it.



we already proved this result in, even for normal operators and real hilbert spaces. but the result there only gave us information about the spectrum. the result presented here shows that we also can get some information about the eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator in complex hilbert spaces.



there remain several interesting questions regarding the computability of the spectrum of linear operators. in pour-el and richards also gave a version of the second main theorem for bounded normal operators and for unbounded closed self-adjoint operators. in we stated our results not only for normal operators on complex hilbert spaces, but also for self-adjoint operators on real hilbert spaces as well as normal operators on complex hilbert spaces. it is still an open question whether a uniform version of the results of pour-el and richards regarding normal and unbounded operators can be proved, i.e. if it is possible to obtain information about the eigenvalues from a program of the operator in these cases.
