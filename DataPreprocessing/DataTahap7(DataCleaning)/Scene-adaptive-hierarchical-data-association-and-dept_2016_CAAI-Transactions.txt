recently, combining rgb and depth data for computer vision applications becomes more and more popular, because recent emergence of depth sensor(e.g., microsoft kinect) has made it feasible and economically sound to capture in real-time not only color images but also depth maps with appropriate resolution and accuracy. the introduce of depth data provides more information from the third dimension which reduces troubles which are caused by the illposed problem in 2d image processing. moreover, the depth data is seldom affected by bad illumination conditions which are common in indoors environments, which can be a complementary cue of rgb data.



therefore, in order to handle more practical challenges and achieve a time-critical indoor multi-tracking system, depth data is adopted in our work. previous works adopt depth data for motion detection, background subtraction and 3d body pose estimation, which provides robust and various target detection schemes. many depth-based features are also proposed by previous works[35,36] for both target detection and representation. in this work, based on depth data various depth-based cues are used for target representation, such as 3d position, 3d motion and 3d spatial layouts of basic features for appearance modeling. the introduction of these depthbased features increases diversity of features, which provides more reliable features for target representation. this highly improves robustness of the system in practical application with problems of cluttered environment, bad illumination conditions and scale variation on 2d image plane.



symmetry of human body to hand view variation. although previous works try various spatial layout schemes for better introducing spatial information, they have essential defects because the spatial information they used is purely based on the image patch on 2d image plane. but in practical situations detected regions always exhibit dislocation, truncation or occlusion, caused by unsatisfied detector performance in complicated environments. therefore, in order to handle this problem, we propose a novel depth-invariant part-based



besides some low level features mentioned in section 3.2.3, such as color, motion, etc., appearance is one important high-level feature for target representation, which is widely used in pedestrian-related applications, such as person reidentification[30,39], pedestrian detection[40e43], multitarget tracking[4,29,28], etc. low-level descriptors are generally used in existing works, but they do not take full advantage of body structure information and result in low



in this section, we conducted several experiments for observation, comparison and analysis from the following three sections to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework: first, we verify the necessity and effectiveness of sceneadaptive feature selection framework in section 5.2, based on analyzing the reliability differences of features on various scenes, and compare the proposed scene-adaptive hierarchical data association framework with non-scene-adaptive framework in various scenes on both rgb-d datasets and rgb datasets, to evaluate the generality of the proposed framework. then, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate performance of the depth invariant part-based appearance model(diam) in various scenes, which is given in section 5.3. third, we analyze advantages and disadvantages of the proposed hierarchical data association framework and nonhierarchical framework, conducting experiments on rgb-d datasets and combining various features, which is elaborated in section 5.4.



given in section 3.3. due to its statistical nature, occasional idswitches can be overlooked in data association. the variation reference ufk in formula(14) can be obtained by averaging variations of each feature fk during association in several sequences in different scenes. it is a constant value based on prior statistics which is scene-independent. the weighting factor ur is empirically set to 0.5 to control the impact of mfk



where gt is the number of ground truth detections, mt the number of miss-detections, fpt is the false positive count and mmet the number of instantaneous identity switches. here, we adopt mota to to evaluate performance of multitracking performance. in addition, taking into consideration of evaluating real-time capability of algorithm, we also compute the frames per second(fps).



besides the whole performance evaluation given in section 5.2, in this section we will conduct more detailed experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the hda scheme. we organize the experiments from two aspects: first, we analyze how hierarchical feature space construction influence the performance of hda. second, we compare hierarchical data association(hda) scheme with non-hierarchical data association(non-hda) scheme while applying the same hierarchical feature space.
