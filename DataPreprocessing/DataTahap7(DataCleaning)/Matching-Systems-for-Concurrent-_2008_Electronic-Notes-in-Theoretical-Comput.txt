matching systems were introduced by carbone and maffeis, and used to investigate the expressiveness of the pi-calculus with polyadic synchronisation. we adapt their definition and investigate matching systems for ccs, the pi-calculus and mobile ambients. we show among other results that the asynchronous pi-calculus with matching cannot be encoded(under certain conditions) in ccs with polyadic synchronisation of all finite levels.



the remainder of the paper is organised as follows. in section 2 we define the calculi we shall be considering. then in sections 3 and 4 we investigate weak and strong matching systems, respectively. we finish with conclusions and further work.



for the converse direction, by lemma 3.2 it is enough to show that ccsn does not have a wms of degree n+ 1. so suppose for a contradiction that(c, s, x1,..., xn+1) is a wms of degree n+ 1 in ccsn. we shall show that there is a combination of clients and servers which does not contain a match, and yet erroneously returns success.



we showed that the calculus of mobile ambients has weak matching systems of all finite degrees. furthermore, ma does not have replicated strong matching systems of degree two or higher. our work leaves open the question of whether ma has a strong matching system of degree two or higher. again, we conjecture that the answer is no.
