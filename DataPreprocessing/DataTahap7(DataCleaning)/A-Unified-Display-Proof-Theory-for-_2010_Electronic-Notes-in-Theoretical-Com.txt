in bunched logics, which are read as true or false relative to resources: roughly speaking, the additives have their standard propositional meanings while the multiplicatives denote resource composition properties. in computer science, such resource readings of bunched logic have very successfully been exploited to obtain logics for program analysis. most notably, separation logic, which is based upon an interpretation of resources as portions of heap memory, has spawned a host of program analysis applications that discover and reason about the structure of heap memory during program execution(recent examples include[7,8,10]). bunched logic has also been variously employed in addressing other computing problems such as polymorphic abstraction, tree update and typed reference update and disposal.
