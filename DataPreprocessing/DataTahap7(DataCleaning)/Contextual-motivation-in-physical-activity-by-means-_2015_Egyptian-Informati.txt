a technique that may better assist in diagnosing the critical medical conditions; and finally, a programming interface was presented for such diagnosis. the interface offers a novel diagnosis technique, based upon the relational ars and the supervised learning algorithm and helps in software development to report the probable approximation of the illness. the interface is flexible enough and can accommodate new types of symptom of any disease with very minuscule efforts. gupta et al.



tant mining technique in many cases of health informatics. distinguishably, this paper attempts to fan out the focus of the arm in the recent public health concerns and implications of physical activity to regulate exercise patterns as a strategy toward healthy living. the strong association between physical activity and health benefits is widely reported in the literature already and low levels of physical activity are attributed as a major contributing factor to the higher health risk.



in this paper, we applied the concept of arm to help explain and address the issue of physical activity and exercise patterns. more specifically, we associate mild exercise with regular sleeping pattern; there is good support and confidence that people will perform the exercise along with sleeping event. we propose that one should engage herself/himself in a mild exercise just before sleep. we further propose that the type of exercise is an open choice, but to avoid any disturbance in sleeping order, we recommend a light exercise. the next section describes the experimental evaluation of this study, utilizing the ar concept.
