reynolds associates each type with a predicate. here, each type is associated not with a single predicate, but many: one for every color. these multiple predicates are essential to interpret parametricity when it is nested. indeed, using a single predicate yields inconsistencies. furthermore these predicates are definable in the logic: the type a ei a expresses that a satisfies the parametricity predicate associated with the type a on color i. for each term a and color i, the term a(i 0) is the erasure of i in a. it is defined by induction on a(definition 2.2) and can be understood as a realizer of a.



another characterizing feature of proposals for parametricity is the kind of model underlying the semantics. krishnaswami and dreyer propose a model based on q-per. atkey et al. propose a model based on reflexive graphs. the model that we use is based on cubes(functions from subsets of colors). in bernardy and moulin the cubes were reified as syntax in an underlying calculus, while in the present work they refine a presheaf structure.



we have defined a new type theory with internalized parametricity. thanks to our model construction, we have proved the consistency of the system. the missing piece to construct a type-checker is a decision algorithm for the conversion relation. this checker could then be used as a minimal proof assistant for a type theory with parametricity.
