the physics based methods are inspired by physical rules present in the universe such as cooling and heating of materials, newtons law of gravity[14,15]. simulated annealing based algorithms shows different behaviour at different temperature. during the physical process, first it warms the material and then gradually decrease the temperature for decreasing the defects, which reduces the energy of system. simulated annealing gives better performance in finding the optimal solution. further, their is no starting point strategy in such algorithms. some of the popular algorithms in simulated annealing are ray optimization, black hole algorithm, gravitational local search algorithm, find fix finish exploit analyze, electron search algorithm, harmony search and shuffled frog leaping algorithm. these algorithms has shown the promising results in dealing with the real world problems. further, experimentation has been performed to check



the impact of new technologies, especially in urban areas has shown tremendous affect in developing countries. furthermore, rapid advancement of these technologies has overthrow the time and space that the people are now familiar today. in recent years swarm intelligence based iot systems have been introduced in the infrastructural development like smart cities. however, ensuring reliability, security, efficiency, and scalability in smart cities is a challenging task. in these conditions swarm intelligence is a promising techniques which focuses on self organised and collective behaviour of decentralized systems. smart infrastructures can be modelled by using latest software, digital communication networks, sensors and embedded intelligence. the modern infrastructures are developed, taking care of natural hazards, tornadoes, earthquakes, and floods which causes the severe damages and may lead to destruction of electricity, bridges, and communication systems. to overcome these challenges different algorithms have been proposed for the proper infrastructural development like a parallel military-dog-based algorithm and enhanced grey wolf optimizer algorithm. further, these algorithms are used to early access the damage and provide the rapid solutions to avoid the substantial damages.



reasoning: with the current growth of technologies, metaheuristics techniques has been witnessed as the crucial asset. optimization is everywhere, from economic to engineering design, for planning holiday to internet routing. as time, money, and resources are limited, the absolute utility of these resources are important. as real world optimization problems are non linear, to select an optimal model in not an easier task. therefore, meta-heuristic helps in solving these computationally complex problems.



reasoning: swarm intelligence has been involved with iot based system. as iot based systems are complicated, it contains smart objects, si based decentralized algorithms are preferred to resolve these issues. therefore, several intelligent si algorithms can be used to solve these critical issues of iot based systems because of its device mobility, information provision, dynamic properties, and wireless communication. si based algorithms such as artificial bee colony, ant colony optimization, and social spider optimization has been applied to solve several real world problems in normalizing iot process.



reasoning: analyze the frameworks and technologies adopted from different domains for designing meta heuristics algorithms. design pattern conquer the crucial factors of adopting the key practices in an abstract form. different computer scientists and researchers has used pattern based perspectives which includes methodological, structural, behavioral, and component-based patterns for designing the optimization algorithms.



financial risk management and its allied sectors smart. however, real time implementation of meta-heuristic with iot based framework has two significant challenges. firstly, the lack of professional sensors is the major hurdle to develop smart specially in agriculture sector. secondly, the lack of networking communication, specially in rural areas affecting the entire system with the unreliable data transfer. therefore, it is necessary to develop a feasible system for examining the performance of computationally complex problems in different situations.



functional& interoperability challenges: in the recent times, there is no single organisational structure developed which can handle the dynamic and high dimensional data. furthermore, during the data transfer several security challenges such as data tampering, wiretapping, and replay attacks may be attempted causing security threat. for getting the best results several factors such as authenticity, data integrity, and confidentiality must be ensured during data acquisition and data transfer. however, some optimization techniques has been developed which can handle some problem up to certain extent. capital investment in different applications mentioned in the literature may hinder the growth of this industry.
