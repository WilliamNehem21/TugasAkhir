completely positive maps are widely accepted as a model of first-order quantum computation. we begin by establishing a categorical characterization of completely positive maps as natural families of positive maps. we explore this categorical characterization by building various representations of quantum computation based on different structures: affine maps between cones of positive elements, morphisms of algebras of effects, and affine maps of convex sets of states. by focusing on convex dcpos, we develop a quantum domain theory and show that it supports some important constructions such as tensor products by quantum data, and lifting.



there are several existing representation results which allow us to understand and analyze quantum computations in terms of different structures, such as convex sets(e.g.), domains(e.g.), partial monoids and effect algebras(e.g.). however, many of these representation results are only valid for positive maps, and so they do not fully capture quantum computation. our contribution is a general method for extending these results to completely positive maps. roughly, the method allows us to convert a full and faithful functor



we proceed by analogy with classical domain theory. recall that in classical domain theory there are two categories that play important roles: firstly a category predom of dcpos and scott-continuous functions, and secondly a category dom! of pointed dcpos(dcpos with a bottom element) and strict scott-continuous functions(functions that preserve the bottom element). lifting(freely adding a bottom element) is left adjoint to the evident forgetful functor(e.g.).
