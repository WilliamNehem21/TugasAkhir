Computational approaches have revolutionized the field of drug discovery, collectively known as Computer- 
Assisted Drug Design (CADD). Advancements in computing power, data generation, digitalization, and artifi-
cial intelligence (AI) techniques have played a crucial role in the rise of CADD. These approaches offer numerous 
benefits, enabling the analysis and interpretation of vast amounts of data from diverse sources, such as genomics, 
structural information, and clinical trials data. By integrating and analyzing these multiple data sources, re-
searchers can efficiently identify potential drug targets and develop new drug candidates. Among the AI tech-
niques, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have shown tremendous promise in drug discovery. ML 
and DL models can effectively utilize experimental data to accurately predict the efficacy and safety of drug 
candidates. However, despite these advancements, certain areas in drug discovery face data scarcity, particularly 
in neglected, rare, and emerging viral diseases. Few-shot learning (FSL) is an emerging approach that addresses 
the challenge of limited data in drug discovery. FSL enables ML models to learn from a small number of examples 
of a new task, achieving commendable performance by leveraging knowledge learned from related datasets or 
prior information. It often involves meta-learning, which trains a model to learn how to learn from few data. This 
ability to quickly adapt to new tasks with low data circumvents the need for extensive training on large datasets. 
By enabling efficient learning from a small amount of data, few-shot learning has the potential to accelerate the 
drug discovery process and enhance the success rate of drug development. In this review, we introduce the 
concept of few-shot learning and its application in drug discovery. Furthermore, we demonstrate the valuable 
application of few-shot learning in the identification of new drug targets, accurate prediction of drug efficacy, 
and the design of novel compounds possessing desired biological properties. This comprehensive review draws 
upon numerous papers from the literature to provide extensive insights into the effectiveness and potential of 
few-shot learning in these critical areas of drug discovery and development.   
Introduction 
The field of Computer-Assisted Drug Design (CADD) has seen 
remarkable progress and is constantly evolving [1]. CADD techniques 
can be broadly classified as Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) [2] and 
Ligand-Based Drug Design (LBDD) [3], based on the information and 
availability of protein/target and ligand structures, respectively. The 
term artificial intelligence was introduced by John McCarthy in 1956, 
who defined it as the field dedicated to the creation of intelligent ma-
chines [4]. Essentially, AI encompasses the capacity of machines to carry 
out tasks in response to different conditions. In recent years, AI has 
garnered considerable attention for its aptitude to learn from data and 
accomplish specific tasks, and the pharmaceutical industry has equally 
recognized and embraced its immense potential [5–8]. AI algorithms are 
now widely applied in various computational approaches for CADD, 
including the prediction of 3D protein structures [9,10], the develop-
ment of docking scoring functions [11], the execution of molecular 
docking [12,13], de novo design [14], the establishment of QSAR 
(Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) models [15], and the 
prediction of synthetic routes and synthetic accessibility [16], among

However, within the field of drug discovery, certain areas like 
neglected, tropical [17–20] and rare diseases [21–23] frequently face a 
scarcity of comprehensive datasets. This constraint gives rise to concern 
since models encounter difficulties in achieving high performance and 
effectively generalizing to compounds beyond the known chemical 
space [24]. This difficulty poses a significant obstacle for drug discovery, 
particularly when endeavoring to identify novel scaffolds from predicted 
compounds within academic and open science research. 
Few-shot learning (FSL) is a specific subfield within ML that is uti-
lized in scenarios where data resources are limited. It aims to achieve 
satisfactory learning performance despite the constraints of limited su-
pervised information available in the training set. This training set 
consists of input examples along with their corresponding output labels 
[25]. Consequently, various techniques have been developed in order to 
enhance FSL, including transfer learning [26,27], neural network, and 
meta-learning [28,29]. These methods aim to address the limitations 
associated with learning from limited examples and improve the per-
formance of models in FSL scenarios. 
The Transfer Learning (TL) involves leveraging pre-existing knowl-
edge from "upstream" tasks and applying it to a smaller, distinct but 
correlated, task, thereby enhancing the modeling performance even 
with limited samples [30]. In contrast, meta-learning in neural net-
works, often referred to as “learning to learn”, refers to the ability of an 
algorithm to improve its performance for each task through experience, 
considering the number of tasks as well [31]. This approach is applied to 
learning episodes obtained from a specific task family, resulting in a base 
learning algorithm that exhibits strong performance when faced with 
new tasks drawn from the same family [32]. 
These algorithms can be employed using various approaches to 
address the challenges posed by limited data. In this review, we show the 
application of FSL in the field of drug discovery, providing examples 
using QSAR and other methodologies. By highlighting these examples, 
we hope that researchers will be encouraged to explore and utilize FSL 
for modeling datasets with scarce resources. 
Few-Shot learning 
Few-Shot Learning (FSL) can be employed in various types of data for 
supervised learning problems. These include: (i) classification: this type 
of FSL approach, known as N-way-K-shot, involves considering N from 
the number of classes, and K is the number of examples. Alternatively, 
one-shot learning (OSL) is employed when only one example is avail-
able, while zero-shot learning (ZSL) is applied when zero examples are 
provided [33,34]; (ii) regression: FSL can also be applied to regression 
tasks, where the goal is to estimate a function based on only a few 
input-output example pairs sampled from that function. In this scenario, 
the output represents the observed value of the dependent variable, 
while the input records the observed value of the independent variable 
[25,35]. Furthermore, FSL can be used in semi- or unsupervised 
learning, using the reinforcement learning to weight orient the prior 
knowledge and prediction between the tasks [36,37]. 
The taxonomy of FSL revolves around the concept of an unreliable 
empirical risk minimizer [25]. In this framework, the hypothesis h is 
minimized based on the empirical risk, which is derived from the error 
decomposition of the model’s poor decision-making. When a sufficient 
number of supervised samples are available, the empirical risk can 
approximate to the expected risk, leading to favorable performance and 
accurate predictions [38,39]. 
Various methodologies have been developed to address this problem, 
and they can be categorized into different approaches to use prior 
knowledge. According with Wang and co-workers [25], based on which 
aspect is enhanced using prior knowledge, existing FSL works can be 
categorized into the following perspectives: (i) Data, where prior 
knowledge is used to augment and increase the number of samples, 
leveraging related, labeled, and unlabeled data can be employed to 
augment the low data available; (ii) Model, where prior knowledge is 
used to constrain the model and result in a smaller hypothesis space 
between empirical and expected risk, training the model on tasks similar 
to the target problem, it can acquire transferable knowledge and 
improve its generalization capabilities; and (iii) Algorithm, where prior 
knowledge alters the search strategy to better approximate empirical 
and expected risk, employing algorithms specifically designed for FSL 
can further refine predictions or develop new algorithms capable of 
generalizing predictions with minimal data (Fig. 1). 
Apart from these, other authors presented alternative taxonomies for 
FSL, including metric-based, data-based, and optimizer-based ap-
proaches [40–42]. While some authors limit the scope of FSL to transfer 
learning and meta-learning, it is important to note that FSL is a broader 
problem and can be addressed using various approaches. It is worth 
mentioning that even automated machine learning (AutoML) [29] 
techniques can be adapted to tackle FSL problems. 
In addition to the mentioned architectures, there are various other 
approaches that can be utilized for FSL, including Siamese networks 
[43], prototypical networks [44], kernel networks [45], bi-directional 
LSTM [46], convolutional neural networks [24], generative neural 
networks [47], matching networks [41], and others. The method of 
choice depends on the specific requirements and objectives of the 
problem, aiming to achieve accurate predictions even when only a few 
or zero examples are available. 
We performed a search on Google Scholar and PubMed, using the 
keywords "Few-shot learning for CADD", "Few-shot learning for Drug 
Discovery", "Few-shot learning for Drug Design," "Meta-learning for 
CADD," "Meta-learning for Drug Discovery," "Low-resource for Drug 
Discovery," and "Meta-learning for Drug Design". These papers were 
classified based on their architectures and objectives, following the 
taxonomy proposed by Wang et al. [25], which includes data, model, 
and algorithm taxonomies. Some selected papers will be thoroughly 
discussed within its respective taxonomy category. Table 1 includes 
details of each paper found, including the dataset, features, architec-
tures, type of prediction, taxonomy, metrics, and year of publication. 
Recent advances in FSL for drug discovery 
In the following sections, we will present and discuss the recent 
advances in FSF for drug discovery, exploring its three major branches: 
data, model, and algorithms. 
Data 
Within each category, there are various methodologies employed to 
tackle the FSL problem. Data augmentation can be achieved by utilizing 
the training set samples, weakly or unlabeled data sets, or similar data 
sets. 
The three methodologies differ in terms of the type of data utilized in 
the training set. In the case of augmenting data using the sample of the 
training set, additional samples are generated by applying variations to 
the existing data. When augmenting data using weakly or unlabeled data 
sets, the augmentation process involves incorporating weakly or unla-
beled samples from large data sets. Lastly, for augmenting samples using 
similar data sets, aggregation techniques are employed to combine 
similar samples from large data sets, which are commonly utilized in 
generative neural networks, in this approach, the large data should be 
labeled, different from weakly or unlabeled data [25]. 
The work described by Meng, Zhao, and King (2023) adapt to the 
taxonomy of transforming data from the training set, when the model 
performs the augmentation during modeling [81]. The authors used a 
motif-based task augmentation, a meta-learning framework that learns 
to adapt to new tasks with few examples by augmenting the training set 
with molecular motifs. This approach begins with recursive decompo-
sition of molecules in the dataset into substructures until each sub-
structure appears more frequently than a specified threshold. An

extracted motif vocabulary serves as external memory. In meta-training 
tasks, support/query samples retrieve relevant motifs from the vocab-
ulary. Using convex combinations, the approach creates prototype 
clusters to represent each class. Then, the authors evaluated the effec-
tiveness of their approach on several benchmark datasets for molecular 
property prediction. The results demonstrated that incorporating 
motif-based task augmentation significantly improves the performance 
of FSL models compared to conventional approaches [81]. Furthermore, 
the technique exhibits robustness across different molecular property 
prediction tasks, highlighting its potential for practical applications in 
drug discovery and other molecular-related domains. 
The paper described by Gao and co-workers [63] can be classified as 
a framework to transform samples from similar datasets, when is 
aggregated or adapting data from similar and large data set. The authors 
compose a two-step approach where the low dimensional deep learning 
model captures the overall atomic properties, while the fragment-based 
GCN focuses on the local environment of atoms. In the first step, the low 
dimensional deep learning model is trained to predict atomic properties 
based on simplified atomic descriptors. This model provides an initial 
estimation of the atomic properties in a fast and efficient manner. In the 
second step, a fragment-based GCN is applied to refine the predictions 
by considering the interactions between atoms and their local environ-
ments [63]. Finally, the authors evaluated the performance of their 
method based on various datasets for atomic and inter-atomic property 
prediction. The results demonstrated that this combined approach ach-
ieved high accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs 
compared to traditional methods [63]. 
Model 
The model concept is divided in four categories: multi-task learning, 
representation modeling, learning with external memory, and genera-
tive models. The initial classification is multi-task learning, which in-
volves parameter sharing or use the same parameters the across tasks to 
facilitate learning. Although this taxonomy is widely applied and well 
established in drug discovery [70,86–96], it has been already revised 
and discussed previously by other authors [97,98] and therefore will not 
be the focus of this review. In the following sections, we will discuss 
representation learning, learning with external memory, and generative 
modeling. 
Representation learning 
Representation learning in FSL refers to the process of learning a low- 
dimensional representation or embedding space for the input data, 
where similar samples are closer to each other and dissimilar samples 
are farther apart (Fig. 2). This embedding space enables effective 
generalization and inference even with limited labeled data [99]. 
One popular approach in representation learning is to use deep 
neural networks (DNNs), such as graph convolutional neural networks 
(GCNs), to learn the representations. These networks are trained on 
large-scale datasets to capture the inherent structure and patterns in the 
data. The learned representation can then be used for FSL tasks by 
leveraging the similarity or distance between samples in the embedding 
space [41,44]. 
Language Model and GCNs (LM-GVP) is a deep learning framework 
designed for protein property prediction created by Wang and collabo-
rators [68], incorporating both sequence and structural information. 
The technique aims to overcome the limitations of existing methods by 
leveraging the power of language models and GCNs. The language 
model processes protein sequences to capture sequential patterns, while 
the GCNs utilizes structural information encoded as graphs to capture 
spatial relationships among each amino acid, specifying the task. The 
framework is trained on a large dataset and demonstrates impressive 
performance in various protein property prediction tasks. Its extensi-
bility allows for the incorporation of additional features and information 
sources, making it versatile and adaptable to diverse prediction prob-
lems. LM-GVP represents a promising approach for accurate and 
comprehensive protein property prediction by leveraging both sequence 
and structural characteristics of proteins [68]. 
Zhang and colleagues [84] introduced a novel technique for few-shot 
drug synergy prediction using a prior-guided hypernetwork architec-
ture. This approach addresses the challenges in discovering effective 
drug combinations and advancing precision medicine. The hypernet-
work learns prior knowledge about drug synergy from the training data 
and generates task-specific weights for the main network, allowing the 
model to adapt to different combinations. The FSL approach trains the 
model on limited drug combination examples to handle scenarios with 
scarce data. By incorporating additional prior information, such as 
drug-target interactions and molecular properties, the model gains 
valuable guidance and improves prediction accuracy. The model’s per-
formance is evaluated on a validation set to optimize hyperparameters, 
Fig. 1. Three key approaches to improve predictions for few-shot problems. Firstly, low data can be supplemented by incorporating related, labeled, and unlabeled 
data. Secondly, to enable generalization with only a few examples, the model can leverage insights from related tasks. Lastly, an algorithm can be refined or 
developed to enhance prediction generalization for scenarios with limited or no samples.

and its effectiveness is assessed on a test set for drug synergy prediction. 
Overall, this approach shows promise in efficiently predicting drug 
synergies and advancing precision medicine. 
Liu and co-workers [58] proposed a new methodology to identify 
potential drug candidates that can target multiple proteins associated 
with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The researchers proposed a novel GCN ar-
chitecture that effectively captures the structural and functional infor-
mation of both drugs and proteins. The GCN model learns to encode the 
molecular structures and interactions into a low-dimensional embed-
ding space, enabling efficient similarity calculations and predictions. 
This approach provides a valuable tool for identify multi-targeted drug 
candidates [58]. 
The paper described by Sanchez-Fernandez and co-workers [71] is 
another task-invariant example, which introduces CLOOME, a novel 
technique that utilizes contrastive learning to facilitate the querying of 
bioimaging databases using chemical structures. While bioimaging data 
provides valuable insights for drug discovery and biological processes, 
the lack of direct searchability based on chemical structure information 
poses a challenge. CLOOME addresses this issue by employing contras-
tive learning, a self-supervised learning approach, to establish associa-
tions between chemical structures and corresponding bioimages. The 
neural network is trained to maximize similarity between paired in-
stances of the same chemical structure and bioimage while minimizing 
similarity between different pairs. This enables CLOOME to learn a joint 
embedding space where chemical structures and bioimages are seman-
tically linked. By integrating chemical structure information with bio-
imaging data, CLOOME offers new opportunities for efficient and 
targeted analysis, allowing researchers to leverage large-scale bio-
imaging databases for drug discovery and biological research [71]. 
A closely related approach to QSAR is MetaHMEI, described by Lu 
and collaborators (2023) [80], which utilizes a meta-learning frame-
work to predict few-shot modifications of histone modifying enzyme 
inhibitors (HMEIs). HMEIs play a crucial role in epigenetic regulation 
and have potential therapeutic applications. However, predicting 
effective modifications of HMEIs with few data is challenging. Meta-
HMEI addresses this challenge by leveraging meta-learning, which en-
ables the model to learn from a diverse set of related tasks and generalize 
to new tasks with few labeled examples. The proposed model combines a 
Siamese network with a memory-augmented neural network, allowing it 
to capture similarities and differences between HMEIs and effectively 
predict modifications. The results on benchmark datasets demonstrate 
that MetaHMEI outperforms baseline methods in predicting few-shot 
modifications of HMEIs. The findings suggested that meta-learning can 
enhance the prediction accuracy and generalization capability in the 
context of modifying enzyme inhibitors, facilitating the development of 
novel therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic regulation [80]. 
Wang, Yao and Dou [61] presented an innovative approach to 
enhance FSL for molecular property prediction. The technique employs 
property-aware relation networks to effectively capture and model the 
intricate relationships between different molecular properties. By 
focusing on specific properties of interest, the model demonstrates the 
ability to generalize and make accurate predictions even when con-
fronted with restricted labeled data. The approach combines a GCN 
architecture with a property-aware relation module, enabling the model 
to capture and exploit property-specific interactions among molecules. 
Experimental evaluations validate the superior performance of this 
method compared to existing approaches in various few-shot molecular 
property prediction tasks. This advancement has significant implications 
for drug discovery, as it facilitates accurate predictions of molecular 
properties using limited data, ultimately reducing the time and

resources required for validation measurements. 
Learning with external memory 
Learning with external memory is a subcategory within the FSL 
taxonomy, wherein an external memory component is incorporated as 
an additional source of supplementary information to enrich the 
learning and inference process of the model. In this approach, the 
external memory serves as an auxiliary storage module that can be 
accessed for reading and writing during both training and inference 
stages (Fig. 3). 
In the domain of drug discovery, although there are already pub-
lished papers exploring the concept of fine-tuning parameters within the 
learning with external memory approach, the exploration of refining 
representations remains relatively unexplored in the existing literature. 
Seidl and co-workers [60] introduced a technique called Modern Hop-
field Networks (MHopNets) to improve the prediction of reaction tem-
plates in FSL and ZSL scenarios. Reaction templates are essential for 
synthesizing new chemical compounds, but obtaining labeled data for 
all possible reactions is impractical. MHopNets leverage the power of 
neural networks and memory mechanisms to address this challenge. The 
approach involves training a MHopNets to store and retrieve reaction 
templates. By using an attention mechanism, the network learns to 
attend to relevant parts of the input and produce accurate predictions. 
The results demonstrated that MHopNets outperform existing methods 
in both FSL and ZSL settings, effectively predicting reaction templates 
even with limited labeled data. This technique has the potential to 
advance the field of chemical synthesis by enabling the discovery of 
novel reactions and facilitating the design of new compounds [60]. 
Chen and co-workers [85] presented a novel technique called Met-
aRF, which combines attention mechanisms with random forest models 
for predicting reaction yields with limited data. Accurate prediction of 
reaction yields is crucial for guiding chemical synthesis processes, but 
obtaining sufficient labeled data for training can be challenging. MetaRF 
addresses this problem by leveraging the power of attention mechanisms 
to selectively focus on relevant features in the input data. The approach 
involves training an attention-based random forest model that learns to 
assign importance weights to different features based on their relevance 
to the prediction task. The results demonstrated that MetaRF out-
performs traditional random forest models and other state-of-the-art 
methods in predicting reaction yields with only a few trial data points. 
The technique shows promise in enabling more accurate and efficient 
reaction yield prediction, leading to improved chemical synthesis pro-
cesses and accelerated drug discovery efforts [85]. 
Jiang and Gao [53] presented the MetaP framework, which consists 
of two main components: pattern mining and pattern matching. In the 
pattern mining phase, the meta pattern representation is used to capture 
the underlying structure of knowledge graphs. These meta patterns are 
learned from the existing graph data and aim to provide a compact yet 
informative way to represent graph patterns. The pattern mining em-
ploys meta-learning techniques, where the model is trained on multiple 
"meta-tasks." Each meta-task involves a small support set of known facts 
and a query set with missing facts. During the testing phase (pattern 
matching), MetaP is given a new, unseen knowledge graph completion 
task with only a few observed facts. Using the learned meta patterns, the 
model generalizes and predicts the missing facts for the given task. 
MetaP can utilize external information, such as embeddings or linguistic 
features, to enhance its knowledge graph completion performance. To 
evaluate the effectiveness of MetaP, the authors conducted experiments 
on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrated that MetaP out-
performs existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and ef-
ficiency, even with very limited labeled data [53]. 
Generative modeling 
Incorporating generative models into FSL involves the generation of 
new data points or samples for a specific task using a limited number of 
labeled examples. These generative models are designed to capture the 
underlying distribution of the training data and generate novel samples 
that exhibit similarities to the existing data. By training these models on 
a small set of labeled examples, they can subsequently generate addi-
tional samples that serve to augment the available data for the target 
task. 
An example of generative modeling is shown by Dong and co- 
workers [82], who introduced a novel approach to address the chal-
lenge of limited data in drug discovery using reinforcement learning and 
one-shot learning techniques to enable effective molecular design in 
low-data situations. The reinforcement learning agent explores a 
chemical space and iteratively generates molecules, maximizing a 
reward signal associated with the desired properties (specific tasks). 
Additionally, one-shot learning allows the model to make accurate 
predictions using minimal training examples, leveraging knowledge 
from labeled molecules to optimize properties of unseen molecules. The 
technique is evaluated in drug design tasks, demonstrating its effec-
tiveness in generating high-quality molecules even with low data [82]. 
This approach represents a promising advancement in drug discovery, 
addressing the challenges of low-data situations and enabling efficient 
molecular design for improved drug candidates. 
Other example is CancerGPT, from Li and collaborators [74], which 
utilizes the capabilities of pre-trained language models, specifically GPT 
Fig. 3. The concept of learning with external memory. The prior knowledge of training set is stored in an external memory and weighting the test set based on this 
external memory. By combining the most similar embeddings, the model can make accurate predictions. 
S. Silva-Mendonça et al.

(Generative Pre-trained Transformer). These language models have 
undergone extensive training on large volumes of text data, enabling 
them to capture rich contextual information and semantic understand-
ing. Through the process of fine-tuning the GPT model using a labeled 
dataset comprising drug pairs and their corresponding synergy scores, 
CancerGPT adeptly captures the complex interplay between drugs and 
their synergistic effects. Recognizing the limitations posed by scarce 
labeled data, the research paper introduces a FSL framework, empow-
ering CancerGPT to generalize its understanding and make precise 
predictions for previously unseen drug combinations. Moreover, 
experimental evaluations on various cancer cell line datasets demon-
strated that CancerGPT surpasses existing methods in predicting drug 
pair synergy with FSL [74]. The approach showcases remarkable accu-
racy and generalization capabilities, facilitating the identification of 
synergistic drug combinations even with limited labeled examples. 
These results underscore the potential of large pre-trained language 
models, such as GPT, in the domain of drug synergy prediction. By 
leveraging language models and FSL, CancerGPT offers a promising 
avenue for guiding cancer treatment decisions and expediting the dis-
covery of effective personalized medicine combinations. 
Algorithm 
Refining existing parameters 
This approach focuses on the fine-tuning of learned representations 
to better align with the specific characteristics of a new task. By itera-
tively refining the existing parameters, the model can enhance its per-
formance and exhibit improved generalization when faced with new 
classes or tasks that have limited labeled examples (Fig. 4). The refine-
ment process commonly employs gradient-based optimization tech-
niques, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants, to 
iteratively update the model’s parameters and optimize its performance 
for the target task [41,100]. Fine-tuning existing parameters by regu-
larization in FSL refers to the process of refining the pre-trained pa-
rameters of a model using regularization techniques to prevent 
overfitting and improve generalization on new tasks with limited 
labeled data [101] (Fig. 4). The aggregate a set of parameters is the 
process of combining the parameters learned from multiple tasks or data 
instances to obtain a single set of parameters that can be used for 
generalization and inference [100]. 
Gull and Minhas [64] proposed a technique for the accurate pre-
diction of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in different species using zero 
and FSL. AMPs are important components of the innate immune system 
and exhibit potential therapeutic properties. However, the diversity of 
AMPs across various species poses a challenge for accurate prediction. 
The technique, called AMP0, leverages a deep learning framework that 
combines ZSL and FSL approaches. In the ZSL phase, the model is trained 
on a large dataset containing labeled AMPs from one species and learns 
to generalize to unseen species using semantic embeddings. In the FSL 
phase, the model fine-tunes its parameters using a small set of labeled 
examples from the target species, enabling species-specific prediction. 
The model effectively captures the inter-species similarities and 
species-specific characteristics of AMPs [64]. This approach provides a 
valuable tool for species-specific antimicrobial peptides prediction, 
facilitating the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents and aiding in the 
development of new therapeutic strategies against infectious diseases. 
META-DDIE is an approach proposed by Den and co-workers [66] 
that addresses the challenging task of predicting drug-drug interaction 
events using FSL. Drug-drug interactions play a crucial role in drug 
safety and efficacy, and accurately predicting these interactions is 
essential for patient well-being. The proposed technique leverages a 
meta-learning framework combined with graph convolutional networks 
to enable effective learning from limited labeled examples. By training 
on a large dataset of drug-drug interaction networks, META-DDIE learns 
to generalize from a few labeled drug pairs and make accurate pre-
dictions for unseen drug interactions. This approach incorporates a 
graph-based representation of drugs, capturing their structural and 
functional properties, and employs attention mechanisms to focus on 
informative parts of the drug interaction networks. Experimental eval-
uation demonstrated that META-DDIE outperforms existing methods in 
predicting drug-drug interaction events, even with limited labeled data. 
The results highlight the potential of FSL and GCN in the domain of 
drug-drug interaction prediction, offering valuable insights for drug 
safety assessment and facilitating informed decision-making in 
healthcare. 
Seidl and collaborators [75] integrated natural language processing 
(NLP) with activity prediction models to improve drug discovery pro-
cess. Traditional activity prediction models rely solely on molecular 
features and structural information, often lacking the ability to interpret 
and utilize the wealth of information present in scientific literature. This 
paper introduced a novel framework that incorporates NLP techniques 
to extract relevant knowledge from textual sources, such as scientific 
papers and databases. By training the model to understand human lan-
guage and extract key information, it can effectively augment the pre-
diction models with additional context and insights. The proposed 
approach demonstrated significant improvements in activity prediction 
accuracy, outperforming conventional models that solely rely on mo-
lecular features [75]. The integration of NLP with activity prediction 
models opens new avenues for leveraging the vast amount of informa-
tion available in scientific literature, enabling more informed 
decision-making in drug discovery and accelerating the identification of 
potential drug candidates. 
Refining meta-learner parameters 
Refining meta-learner parameters use the process of fine-tuning the 
parameters of the meta-learner model based on the performance and 
feedback received during the FSL tasks (Fig. 5). This step is crucial for 
improving the adaptation and generalization capabilities of the meta- 
learner model [100]. 
Wang and co-workers [56] presented a novel approach that tackles 
the challenge of optimizing molecular properties with limited data. 
Conventional optimization methods necessitate ample labeled data for 
training, which is typically lacking within molecular design. This study 
introduced a meta-learning framework that effectively utilizes prior 
knowledge from analogous molecules to facilitate the optimization 
process. By assimilating insights from a select group of high-quality 
molecules with known properties, the model exhibits the ability to 
generalize and provide accurate predictions for previously unseen 
molecules. To accomplish this, the approach combines a GCNs with a 
meta-learner, allowing the model to effectively capture and exploit the 
structural and property relationships among different molecules. 
Experimental evaluation demonstrated that this approach achieved su-
perior performance compared to baseline methods, effectively opti-
mizing molecular properties even with limited data [56]. This technique 
has significant implications for drug discovery and material design, as it 
enables efficient and effective optimization of molecular properties with 
minimal labeled examples, reducing the time and resources required for 
experimental measurements.

Pappu and Paige [51] suggested an additional noteworthy example 
that harnesses the power of GNNs to effectively model the intricate re-
lationships and structures of molecules. However, the efficacy of GNNs 
is often hindered by the scarcity of labeled data. To overcome this 
limitation, this study proposed an innovative framework that enhances 
the performance of GNNs in low-data scenarios. The technique in-
tegrates a blend of semi-supervised learning and self-supervised 
learning, utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data to enhance the 
model’s ability to generalize. Moreover, the authors introduce a 
self-supervised pretext task that incentivizes the GNN to capture crucial 
features and patterns within the data [51]. The technique has the po-
tential to significantly advance molecular machine learning by enabling 
accurate predictions and insights even with limited labeled data, paving 
the way for accelerated drug discovery and material design. 
Lv and co-workers [73] employed drug-drug interaction prediction 
as a means to comprehend potential adverse effects and optimize drug 
combination therapies. Their approach capitalizes on a 3D GCNs, which 
effectively captures both the structural and spatial information of drugs. 
Additionally, the incorporation of FSL enables the model to generalize 
effectively from a limited number of labeled drug pairs, enabling accu-
rate predictions for unseen pairs. Evaluation conducted on benchmark 
datasets demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses state-of-the-art 
methods when predicting drug-drug interactions in scaffold-based cold 
start scenarios [73]. These results underscore the potential of the 3D 
GCNs, combined with FSL, as a potent strategy for improving predictions 
in scenarios where data availability is limited. Consequently, this 
approach facilitates the identification of potential drug interactions and 
significantly contributes to drug discovery endeavors. 
Ma and collaborators [59] developed predictive models for drug 
response that demonstrate a remarkable ability to translate from 
high-throughput screens to individual patients. This technique effec-
tively tackles the challenge of limited labeled data by leveraging 
knowledge from a small set of examples and generalizing it to predict 
drug response in novel contexts. The researchers trained the FSL model 
on the combined dataset of high-throughput screens and individual 
patient profiles. The model learned to extract essential features from the 
data and to generalize drug response patterns across different biological 
contexts. A critical aspect of the study was to determine if the predictive 
models developed from high-throughput screens could be effectively 
transferred to predict drug responses for individual patients. The 
researchers tested the model’s performance on patient-specific data, 
aiming to demonstrate its potential in enabling personalized medicine. 
The paper includes an in-depth analysis of the model’s predictions and 
offers insights into the features and factors driving drug responses in 
both high-throughput screens and individual patients. Understanding 
these underlying mechanisms is essential for advancing precision med-
icine and drug development. These findings underscore the immense 
potential of FSL in the area of personalized medicine, facilitating the 
development of predictive models that can guide informed drug selec-
tion and significantly improve patient outcomes. 
Learning optimizer 
Learning the optimizer in FSL refers to the process of training a 
model to learn an adaptive optimization algorithm that can effectively 
adapt to different FSL tasks. This approach aims to improve the gener-
alization and performance of FSL models by dynamically adjusting their 
optimization process based on the specific task at hand (Fig. 6) [102]. 
Stanley and co-workers [28] presented FS-Mol, a comprehensive 
dataset specifically designed for FSL within the domain of molecular 
compounds and properties. This pioneering work aims to overcome the 
limitations of existing molecular datasets by offering a diverse collection 
of molecular structures and properties, along with associated task defi-
nitions. FS-Mol encompasses a wide range of molecular properties, 
including aqueous solubility, bioactivity, and toxicity, providing a ho-
listic evaluation framework for assessing FSL models. The dataset em-
powers researchers to evaluate the performance of different algorithms 
and models within a FSL context, thereby fostering the development of 
more robust and effective approaches amongst molecular property 
prediction. The statistical results and benchmarks achieved on FS-Mol 
clearly demonstrate its significance in advancing the understanding 
and refinement of FSL methods for molecular compounds. As a result, 
subsequent papers have begun utilizing the FS-Mol dataset [72,75,103], 
enhancing both the architecture and performance of predictions while 
furthering research in this area. 
Yao and collaborators [65] proposed an approach using chemical 
property relations to guide the FSL process. The model learns to encode 
and exploit the relationships between chemical properties, enabling it to 
make accurate predictions even with limited labeled data. The technique 
combines a Siamese neural network architecture with a relation network 
module, which captures and utilizes the chemical property relations

effectively. Experimental evaluations on various molecular property 
prediction tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms 
existing approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in handling few-shot 
scenarios. By leveraging the relationships between chemical proper-
ties, the technique enhances the model’s ability to generalize and make 
reliable predictions with limited data. 
In their research, He and co-workers [67] developed a novel tech-
nique that utilizes mutual information, a statistical dependence mea-
sure, to establish connections between peptide sequences and their 
bioactivity. This approach involves extracting informative features from 
the peptide sequences, including amino acid composition, physico-
chemical properties, and structural motifs, to identify potential bioac-
tive peptides. They adopted a mutual information-based meta-learning 
framework to train a meta-model capable of adapting quickly to new 
peptide datasets. By learning from diverse datasets and corresponding 
predictive models, the meta-model demonstrated robust generalization 
and accurate predictions on previously unseen datasets. Data augmen-
tation techniques were applied to generate synthetic peptide data, 
introducing variations to the existing sequences, thereby creating a more 
extensive and diverse dataset for training purposes. Upon training the 
meta-model, it exhibited the ability to predict peptide bioactivity from 
previously unseen datasets. The proposed methodology underwent 
thorough evaluation using benchmark datasets and comparison with 
state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its potential as a promising solu-
tion to accelerate bioactive peptide discovery. 
By employing a meta-learning framework, the model learns to 
quickly adapt and make accurate predictions on new peptide sequences 
with limited labeled data. The approach was evaluated on multiple 
bioactive peptide datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in acceler-
ating the discovery of bioactive peptides compared to traditional 
methods. The results highlight the potential of mutual information- 
based meta-learning in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of 
bioactive peptide discovery, facilitating the development of novel 
therapeutics and biotechnological applications. 
In another notable contribution, Lv and collaborators [79] intro-
duced a technique for low-data drug discovery by employing meta 
learning in conjunction with graph attention networks. This approach 
addresses the challenge of limited labeled data by leveraging the power 
of meta learning, which enables the model to quickly adapt and learn 
from a few examples. Graph attention networks are utilized to effec-
tively capture the structural information of molecules and learn their 
representations. The proposed method combines the meta learning 
framework with graph attention networks to train a model that can 
generalize well to unseen molecules and accurately predict their 
properties. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on multiple 
drug discovery tasks convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of this 
approach in low-data scenarios, surpassing the performance of tradi-
tional machine learning methods. These findings underscore the 
tremendous potential of meta learning with graph attention networks in 
accelerating the drug discovery process and facilitating the identifica-
tion of potential candidates even with limited labeled data. 
FSL models and their performance in property and biological 
activity prediction 
Focusing on papers that applies FSL for molecular property predic-
tion, we found around eight manuscripts which use toxicity data sets 
such as Tox21, MUV, SIDER, QM9 and ToxCast [48,54,61,65,76,78,79, 
81]. The papers listed above focus on few-shot molecular property 
prediction and adopt various techniques to address this challenging task. 
Notably, the best metrics were achieved by Meng and collaborators for 
Tox21, MUV, SIDER, and ToxCast [81], followed by Ju et al. [78] and 
Wang and colleagues [61]. Interestingly, Meng et al., adopted the ar-
chitecture from Wang et al. [61], as a benchmark and applied 
augmented the data to them, resulting in noticeable improvements, 
especially for the challenging MUV dataset (AUC-ROC rose from 60.66% 
± 1.09 to 70.75% ± 1.15). Despite the superior metrics achieved by 
Meng et al., the models’ interpretability was not explicitly explained, 
unlike Wang et al., which demonstrated interpretability by capturing 
relationships between molecular properties and predictions. 
In terms of architecture, Altae-Tran et al. [48] appears to employ a 
relatively simpler and more straightforward design compared to the 
other analyzed papers. Since the focus is on one-shot learning, their 
model is tailored to learn from a single instance and make predictions 
accordingly, potentially involving less complex computations and a 
reduced number of layers in comparison to other methods that incor-
porate advanced techniques such as graph attention networks or trans-
formers. Conversely, papers by Meng et al. [81], Lv et al. [73], and 
Torres et al. [76] may feature more intricate architectures. These papers 
introduce meta-learning approaches or utilize advanced graph-based 
models and transformers, which typically require more sophisticated 
computations and a deeper network structure to effectively capture and 
process the complex relationships in molecular data. Despite that, 
Altae-Tran et al. [48] presented the simplest architecture, they don’t 
achieve the same metrics for MUV and SIDER (see Table 1), and don’t 
show the interpretability of their models. 
On the other side, assessing the biological activity of molecules 
presents unique challenges, primarily due to the diverse targets utilized 
Fig. 6. The concept of learning optimizer. The prior knowledge is trained with related task, each task has an error signal and the meta-learner will update an 
optimizer with new parameters, according for each task. In the test set, the model will propose an algorithm with new generalizing parameters and optimizer, using 
the gradient descent to reduce the loss function and achieve the best algorithm to make good predictions.

to enhance their performance [28,50,72,75,80,83,51,52,56,58,59,62, 
64,67]. This diversity underscores the need for a standardized approach 
that can be employed in research endeavors seeking to leverage FSL 
methodologies. The work described by Stanley et al. [28] contributes 
significantly to this field by providing an accessible dataset, the FS-Mol, 
that facilitates the refinement and application of FSL techniques to 
biological activity prediction. However, only a limited number of 
studies, like Schimunek et al. [72], have utilized the FS-Mol dataset to 
enhance existing methodologies, demonstrating improved efficacy and 
accuracy in their predictions. 
Challenges in FSL for CADD 
Despite its promise, few-shot learning for CADD faces many chal-
lenges, such as the need for high-quality and diverse training data, 
model interpretability, and addressing issues of bias and fairness, 
especially when applying personalized medicine approaches. 
High-quality and diverse training data 
The quality of available data can vary widely, and bias can be 
introduced during data collection or curation. Biased or noisy data can 
lead to suboptimal model performance and potentially biased drug 
discovery outcomes. As well as data that span a wide range of molecular 
structures, targets, and properties. Ensuring that the -FSL model is 
exposed to diverse chemical and biological spaces is challenging. 
Limited diversity in the training data can lead to poor generalization. To 
exemplify this, Stanley and collaborators [28] used the ChEMBL data 
only with IC50 and/or EC50 and compounds with high molecular weight, 
is worth mention even with their encouraging results, ChEMBL data has 
different levels of confidence, which is crucial for any methodology of 
QSAR. 
Interpretability 
Understanding why a FSL model makes a particular prediction is 
crucial in drug design. Black-box models may not provide interpretable 
explanations, which can be problematic when trying to identify poten-
tial drug candidates or understand molecular interactions. Therefore, 
interpretability of FSL models is a significant challenge in the field. 
Among the FSL papers analyzed, the level of interpretability varies. 
Wang et al. [61] demonstrated the interpretability of their models by 
capturing the relationships between molecular properties and pre-
dictions. Lv et al. [73], Yao et al. [65], and Ju et al. [78] offered insights 
into crucial molecular interactions, chemical property relations, and 
improving interpretability. Lu et al. [80], Liu et al. [58], interpreted 
their generated FSL models with experimental results and experimental 
data already published in literature, and He et al. [67] presented the 
relationship between the peptides residues and the models learning, 
which are very important to understand the model and how they learn 
with the data. In contrast, Altae-Tran et al. [48], Guo et al. [54], and 
Torres et al. [76] lack interpretability of models due to the limitation or 
complexity of the FSL models. 
Ethical issues and regulatory acceptance 
As FSL become more influential in drug discovery, ethical concerns 
related to their use may arise. There could be questions about the fair-
ness and transparency of these models, especially when they impact 
patient treatments and outcomes. Moreover, convincing regulatory 
agencies (such as FDA, EPA and others) to accept and validate the use of 
FSL models in drug discovery and toxicity research is a significant 
challenge. There may be a need to develop new regulatory frameworks 
and guidelines. 
Model complexity 
FSL models can use different levels of complexity such as augmenting 
data and learn an algorithm or augmenting data with representation 
learning. Due to the new subject of FSL for biological activity prediction, 
the use of different levels and types of data become difficult to compare 
the complexity between the models, with exception of manuscripts using 
the FS-Mol dataset [28,72]. On the other side, for molecular property 
prediction is possible to compare the approaches published by Meng 
et al. [81], Ju et al. [78], and Wang et al. [61] that used the same data 
(MUV, SIDER, Tox21, and ToxCast). This comparison revealed that the 
complexity of models can to be used to achieve a better performance for 
complex data. 
Addressing these challenges will require interdisciplinary collabo-
ration between machine learning experts, medicinal chemists, bi-
ologists, and regulatory agencies. Moreover, advances in data collection 
and curation, and model interpretability techniques specific to drug 
discovery will be crucial for the successful application of few-shot 
learning in this field. 
Perspectives and guidelines for using FSL for CADD 
As shown in this review, there are many successes cases emphasizing 
the significance of FSL in CADD, particularly when supported by 
compelling experimental results. Molecular property-related studies 
often rely on established datasets for model generation, facilitating 
effective comparisons with existing literature. In contrast, biological 
activity-focused manuscripts employ diverse datasets, such as ChEMBL, 
BindingDB, ZINC, FDA-approved drugs, Ellinger, and others, which 
hinders the establishment of a universal benchmark for model evalua-
tion. One promising approach to kickstart this process involves utilizing 
the FS-Mol dataset, made available by Stanley et al. [28], enabling the 
exploration of novel models and advancing interpretability in AI-driven 
drug discovery—an area of ongoing importance. 
The undeniable efficacy of FSL is evident through its impressive re-
sults and predictions. However, the prevalence of complex models raises 
the question of whether such intricacy is truly essential. Interestingly, 
Occam’s Razor theory is often adhered to in model selection, favoring 
simplicity as the optimal approach [104,105]. Notably, certain targets 
exhibit strong predictive capabilities even without resorting to complex 
models [58]. These observations prompt the need for further investi-
gation into the significance of meta-learning models and deep learning 
in FSL. While some molecular property datasets indicate improved 
metrics with more model complexity [61], the question remains less 
resolved for biological activity datasets, warranting more research to 
identify simple and explainable FSL models capable of surpassing the 
predictive performance of traditional machine and deep learning 
models. 
As discussed, FSL can indeed be applied to various aspects of CADD. 
If one wants to start exploring FSL approaches, first need to select a 
specific CADD task you want to address with FSL, which can be pre-
dicting the activity of molecules against a specific target, identifying 
potential drug candidates, or optimizing molecular structures for spe-
cific properties. Then, you should gather relevant data, which is crucial 
for developing your models. Depending on the task, you may need 
molecular structure data, target protein data, bioactivity data, or other 
relevant information. It important to ensure that the data is clean, well- 
curated, and properly annotated. Then, you need to preprocess the data 
and extract relevant features. Next, you need to develop the FSL models, 
starting with simpler models and progressively exploring more complex 
ones. Evaluate the performance of your FSL models using appropriate 
metrics. Fine-tune hyperparameters and model architectures based on 
your evaluation results. As discussed, interpretability is crucial for 
CADD. Therefore, try to explore methods for interpreting FSL model 
decisions, and visualize results and model predictions to gain insights. 
Finally, experiment with different model architectures, loss functions, 
S. Silva-Mendonça et al.

and data representations to improve performance. Certainly, starting 
with a clear problem statement, relevant data, and a solid understanding 
of FSL principles will help make significant progress in applying FSL to 
CADD. 
Conclusions 
FSL has several potential applications in the field of drug design and 
discovery. As perspectives on how this approach could be used: 1. 
Identifying new drug targets: one potential application of FSL in drug 
discovery is to identify new drug targets based on few data. By training 
models to recognize patterns and features in small data sets related to 
different diseases, FSL can be used to identify promising new drug tar-
gets and accelerate drug discovery. 2. Predicting drug activity/efficacy: 
FSL could also be used to predict the activity of new drug candidates 
based on low data. To recognize common features and properties of 
effective drugs to predict which new compounds are likely to be effec-
tive based on their chemical properties and other characteristics. 3. 
Designing new drugs: Another potential application of FSL in drug dis-
covery is to design new drugs based on limited data. By training models 
to recognize common features and properties of existing drugs to 
generate new drug candidates with similar properties, but optimized for 
specific targets or indications. 4. Personalized medicine: FSL could also 
be used to develop personalized medicine approaches based on 
restricted data from individual patients, to predict which treatments are 
likely to be most effective for individual patients based on their unique 
characteristics and medical histories. Therefore, we can conclude that 
FSL has the potential to accelerate drug discovery and improve 
personalized medicine by enabling models to learn and generalize to 
new tasks and domains. However, there are still several challenges that 
need to be addressed, such as data quality, model interpretability, and 
ethical considerations. 
In this comprehensive review, we provide an in-depth analysis of the 
latest research papers in the field, focusing on the growing significance 
of representation learning approaches in accomplishing remarkable re-
sults for FSL tasks. The appeal of this approach lies in its straightforward 
calculation of similarities between embeddings, as opposed to the uti-
lization of intricate meta-learning architectures, making it particularly 
intriguing. Nevertheless, delving deeper into the field of FSL with meta- 
learning models in the context of drug discovery, even with the demand 
for substantial computational resources, offers promising opportunities 
to tackle diverse challenging endpoints like ADME/Tox, as well as 
neglected, tropical, and rare diseases that may suffer from limited re-
sources. While the introduction of new methodologies is undoubtedly 
valuable, there still exists untapped potential for exploring these 
methodologies in crucial areas such as scaffold generalization, 
explainable machine learning, and the chemical space encompassed by 
these models. Finally, bridging the gap between computational science 
and medicinal chemistry is crucial to develop models that not only 
perform well but also possess the capability to accurately and cost- 
effectively predict new drugs, solve protein structure-related prob-
lems, assess drug synergy probabilities, and evaluate drug toxicity and 
ADME properties. Such advancements may ultimately lead to a reduc-
tion in investments allocated to unreliable drugs.
