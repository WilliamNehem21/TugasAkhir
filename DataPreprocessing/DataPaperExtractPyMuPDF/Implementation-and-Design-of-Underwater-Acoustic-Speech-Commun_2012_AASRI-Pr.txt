Abstract 
Due to severe signal degradation caused by multipath propagation and the limited bandwidth and the time-varying and 
space-variant nature of the underwater acoustic channel, underwater acoustic communication is difficult. A suitable for 
underwater acoustic channel communication mode must be employed. Implementation and design of the real-time speech 
communication system based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology, AMBE-2000 was used 
to compress the speech coding. The main hardware circuit and software design of speech communication system were 
analyzed, speech signal was inset comfortable noise, eliminated echo, controlled volume, finally through the system 
debugging and channel pool test. It proved that the underwater acoustic speech communication system was feasible, 
speech was clear.

1. Introduction 
On the land, the radio is usually used in no cable communication. The absorption and attenuation of 
underwater radio are large. No matter how far the transmission distance, can only use large antennas and high 
transmission power, or can not complete underwater communications tasks. Compared to all kinds of known 
as form of energy, the only sound waves in the underwater spread for best performance, which allows to 
sound waves as the carrier of the underwater acoustic communication become the mainstream of the 
underwater communication. In 1945 the earliest underwater speech communication system had been 
developed by the United States navy underwater acoustic laboratory. This system was used in the 
communication between the submarines, which used single side band modulation with carrier frequency 8~11 
kHz, work distance a few kilometers. 
OFDM technology is used in the underwater acoustic speech communication system in this paper. It had 
some advantages. Firstly, the using rate of the frequency spectrum was higher. Secondly, the capability of 
multipath interference resistance and the frequency choice decline were stronger. Thirdly, the capability of 
decline-poor through the united coding of sub-carrier waves was stronger too. Finally the implementation of 
DSP was easier because of the modulation and demodulation of OFDM through the using of IFFT and FFT. In 
the underwater acoustic communication field these advantage of OFDM were the same as which was used in 
the land wireless communication field. System hardware design and system software test had been completed, 
finally the underwater acoustic speech communication system had been debugged. The pool test proves the 
feasibility of this system. Speech effect is clear, can satisfy the hearing requirements. 
2. OFDM Technology 
In an OFDM system, a high rate bit stream is divided into several low rate streams that are transmitted in 
parallel and simultaneously on different frequency, i.e. sub-carriers. By parallel transmission, the symbol 
duration is increased; therefore the relative amount of time dispersion, which is caused by multipath delay 
spread, is decreased. To avoid inter-symbol interference (ISI), a guard interval (GI) is inserted into OFDM 
symbols. The length of GI is chosen to exceed the channel delay spread. Meanwhile for avoiding the inter-
channel interference (ICI), OFDM symbols in the guard interval are cyclically extended. The major sources of 
distortion for underwater acoustic communication systems are multipath fading and ISI. OFDM has 
significant advantages with bandwidth efficiency, immunity against ISI and combating frequency selective 
fading.
