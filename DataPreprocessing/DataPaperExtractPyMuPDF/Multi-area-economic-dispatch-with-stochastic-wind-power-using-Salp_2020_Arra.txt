Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is a newly developed swarm intelligence based optimization method. Its analytical
model mimics self-organized swarming and foraging behavior of salps. Salps are found in the ocean and they form
a swarm called salp chain for their organized movement and foraging. Since its inception in 2017, SSA has been
applied to many engineering domains. This paper presents the solution of complex constrained multi-area eco-
nomic dispatch problem of power system with and without stochastic wind integration using SSA. Simulation
analysis has been carried on four different constrained test cases with diverse dimensions/complexity level. They
are (i) four area system with sixteen thermal units (ii) four area system with forty thermal units (iii) two area
system with forty thermal units and (iv) two area forty-unit system with wind integration. Comparison of
simulation results obtained by SSA with other methods reported in the recent literature has proven SSA’s
capability of constrained handling and offered promising and efﬁcient solutions.
1. Introduction
Due to rising complexity and the size of real-world optimization
problems Bio-inspired optimization approaches became very popular in
past decade among researchers of almost all application domains. The
Bio-inspired optimization techniques are stochastic in nature and they
apply randomness for searching the solution. The randomness helps in
the development of a gradient-free search mechanism. Most of these
optimization techniques are inspired by natural phenomena and they can
be grouped either based on evolution, collective behaviour (swarm-
based), ecological phenomenon, physical science. These algorithms have
proven their great potential to deal with real-world optimization prob-
lems. The classiﬁcation of Bio-inspired optimization methods is pre-
sented in Fig. 1.
Evolution based algorithm utilises the concept of natural evolution
such as reproduction, mutation, recombination and selection. Some of
the popular optimization method in this category are genetic algorithms
(GA) [1], differential evolution (DE) [2] and backtracking search algo-
rithm(BSA) [3].
In fact among bio-inspired optimization methods swarm intelligence
based optimization approaches are quite popular and efﬁcient. The key
features of swarm intelligence (SI) based algorithms are self-organization
and division of work to achieve a given task. For Example, Particle swarm
optimization (PSO) [4] simulates biological behaviour of ﬁsh schooling
and bird ﬂocking, artiﬁcial bee colony (ABC) [5] optimization simulates
collective foraging behaviour of honey bees, whale optimization algo-
rithm (WOA) [6] follows behaviour of humpback whales, grasshopper
optimization (GOA) [7] follows their unique swarming behaviour, spider
monkey optimization(SMO) [8] mimics the ﬁssion-fusion social structure
of spider monkeys, grey wolf optimizer (GWO) [9] mimics the hunting
behaviour and social leadership of grey wolf, TLBO [10] models the ef-
fect of the inﬂuence of a teacher on the output of students in the class-
room and many others.
The next class of bio-inspired optimization methods belongs to opti-
mization methods inspired by the concept of physical Sciences. The most
popular and efﬁcient optimization methods in this class are simulated
annealing (SA) [11] inspired by annealing process of metal, Harmony
search (HS) [12] follows the concept of jazz’s improvisation process and
then the search of the perfect state of harmony by musician, Gravitation
search algorithm(GSA) [13] utilises the concept of Newton’s law of
gravitation and laws of motion, chemical reaction optimization (CRO)

A detailed review and applications of bio-inspired techniques for the
solution of different types of constrained complex practical optimization
problems can be found in Ref. [20–24]. These include applications
related to medical science, job shop scheduling, image processing,
parameter estimation, power, and energy. Economic dispatch (ED) is one
of the most complex constrained optimization problems of the integrated
power system [25]. The main aim of ED is to allocate the power demand
among the committed generator units in the most economical manner
while satisfying all the physical and operational constraints. The practical
ED problem is highly non-linear and non-convex with multiple minima
due to practical operational constraints like valve point loading (VPL)
effects, discontinuous due to prohibited operating zones (POZ) and ramp
rate limits (RRL). Over the past decades various single area ED problems
considering VPL effect [26–31], RRL [27,30,32,33] and POZ [32,34–36]
were solved without considering transmission constraints.
However, many utilities have their own limitations for power ﬂows
among different areas/regions over transmission lines. Every area/region
has its own load pattern and power generation characteristics. Multi-area
economic dispatch (MAED) is an extension of ED, where the objective is
to calculate power generation as well as the exchange of power between
different areas at minimum cost while satisfying additional power
transmission capacity constraints along with all equality and inequality
constraints associated with ED problems. Due to the additional trans-
mission line power ﬂow limit constraints, MAED problem becomes more
complex to solve. Therefore, for the solution of such a complex con-
strained optimization problem a latest and efﬁcient bio-inspired opti-
mization approach is required.
Various bio-inspired optimization algorithms were reported in the
literature for the solution of MAED problems [37–50]. The solution of a

single objective MAED problem with different dimension and complexity
levels are found in Ref. [37–47]. They are harmony search (HS) [37,38],
differential evolution(DE) [39], artiﬁcial bee colony (ABC) [40], ﬂower
pollination algorithm(FPA) [42], particle swarm optimization (PSO)
[44], hybrid cuckoo search algorithm(HCSA) [45], hybrid differential
evolution based PSO (DEPSO) [41] and moth-ﬂame optimization(MFO)
[43]. Considering clean air policy and global warming concept, solution
of multi-objective MAED problems are also presented using PSO [48],
chaotic artiﬁcial bee colony (CABC) [49] and improved Jaya algorithm
(IJA) [50].
In the present scenario, the Integration of wind and solar energy
among renewable energy resources is gaining wide acceptance due to
their emission-free low-cost operation. However, as wind speed is un-
certain therefore, uncertainty associated with wind power is incorpo-

distribution [21,51,52], beta distribution [53] and gamma distribution
[54] are used by researchers to calculate cost due to random wind power.
The effect of large wind power integration in MAED problems is
investigated for a combined wind-thermal system for Taiwan power
system using a direct search approach (DSA) in Ref. [55], where 52 unit
thermal systems were used with cost function as a second-order poly-
nomial in nature. Using all complexity of practical thermal generator unit
as VPL, RRL and POZ, the impact of wind integration was analyzed using
the backtracking search algorithm (BSA) in Refs. [56].
Even though various optimization techniques are proposed for the
solution of MAED problems, according to No Free Lunch Theorem [57],
none of the algorithms can guarantee to solve all optimization problems.
There is always a chance of improvement; keeping that in mind, this
paper presents the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) for the solution of MAED
problem.
Application of a novel swarm intelligence based SSA algorithm for the
solution of MAED problems is the signiﬁcant and major contribution of
this paper. The paper also presents Weibull pdf model for the calculation
of wind power. In order to validate the performance of SSA over MAED
problem, four cases with different dimensions and complexity levels
which possess non-linear, multimodal, non-convex, discontinuous and
probabilistic modal due to wind integration are evaluated. The obtained
results using SSA are also compared with recently reported results in the
literature.
Rest of the paper is organized as follows: formulation of the problem
that combines the concept behind MAED, wind power modeling and the
related constraints are described in section 2. Section 3 presents the
concept behind the SSA, its foraging behavior using an analytical model
and implementation procedure for the solution of MAED problem.
Description of test cases, effect of control parameters, simulation results
and their discussion are presented in section 4. Finally, conclusions are
drawn in section 5.
2. Problem formulation
The key objective of MAED problem is to minimize total operating
cost in all areas in such a manner that it will satisfy all operational
constraints associated with it, i.e. power balance, minimum and
maximum power generation limits, RRL, POZ and area wise capacity
constraints of tie-line/transmission line.

2.1. Wind power modeling’
Wind power is a stochastic variable due to uncertain wind speed.
Therefore power generation by wind farm includes three types of costs:
(i) direct cost, (ii) overestimation cost/reserve cost which is included due
to deﬁcit in wind power and (iii) the underestimation cost/penalty cost
which is taken into account due to more wind power generation than the
scheduled power [21,51–56]. Therefore the cost of jthwind generator in

3. Salp swarm algorithm
Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is a recent bio-inspired optimization
technique [58], inspired by navigation and foraging behaviour of salp
chain, generally found in deep oceans. In its mathematical model, salp
population is divided into two groups called leader and followers. The
best salp (best solution) is considered as the food source to be followed by
the salp chain. After every iteration, the leader salp changes its position
with respect to the food sources. The leader explores and exploits the
search space around the best solution and the follower salps move
gradually towards the leader. This process helps salps in converging to
the global optima quickly while preventing from being trapped in local
optima. Fig. 3 depicts the salp chain. The front salp of the chain is called
leader while other salps of the chain are called followers. The leader salp
guides the follower salps.
The salp locations are deﬁned in the n-dimensional search space:
Where nis the number of decision variables in the problem.
Let us assume there is a food source FSin the search space as swarm’s
target. As per the location of the food source, leader updates its position
using the equation (21) as below:

4. Description of test cases and simulation results
The performance of SSA is evaluated and validated on four standard
test cases of MAED problems with different dimensions and complexity
levels. SSA has been implemented in MATLAB13 environment and
executed on 2.40GHz, i5 processor with 8GB RAM and is simulated over
30 independent runs for all test cases. Description of test cases and the
outcome of simulation results obtained by SSA are presented below.
Test Case I: This test case has four areas. Each area consists of four
power generating unit systems connected using six tie lines [37]. The fuel
cost coefﬁcient data, tie-line power ﬂow limits along with area wise
power demands are listed in Table A1. The network topology used in this
test case with four areas consisting of sixteen power generating units
system is shown in Fig. 5.
The simulation results obtained by SSA in terms of area wise optimum
generation scheduling are listed in Table 1 and the comparison of costs
with other metaheuristics is summarized in Table 2. The optimum gen-
eration cost obtained by SSA is 7337.0139 $/hr. Fig. 6 shows the smooth
and stable cost convergence characteristic obtained by SSA.
Test Case II: It is a comparatively large dimension test case with forty
power generator units having non-convex fossil fuel cost characteristics
with multiple minima. Transmission loss is not considered here. The fuel
cost coefﬁcients data and power generation limits are listed in Table A2
as reported in Ref. [26]. The total load demand is set at 10500 MW. Here
forty power generating units are segregated in four areas. Each area with
ten power generating units shares power demand as 1575MW (15%) in
area one, 4200MW (40%) in area two, 3150MW (30%) in area three, and
1575MW (15%) in area four respectively [40].
The tie-line power ﬂow limitations are considered as follows: (i) be-
tween area 1 to area 2 or from area 2 to area 1 is 200MW, (ii) between
area 1 to area 3 or from area 3 to area 1 is 200MW, (iii) between area 3 to
area 2 or from area 2 and area 3 is 200MW, (iv) between area 4 to area1
or from area1 to area 4 is 100MW,(v) between area 4 to area 2 or from
area 2 to area 4 is 100MW and (vi) between area 3 to area 4 or from area
4 to area 3 considered as 100MW.
Here the best cost obtained by SSA is 122471.666 $/hr, the corre-
sponding generation schedule is presented in Table 3 and its statistical
results are summarized in Table 4. The smooth and stable cost

convergence characteristic for a larger test system obtained by SSA is
presented in Fig. 7.
Test Case III: It has a two-area system with forty thermal power
generating units. Each area consists of twenty generating units, con-
nected using a tie line with capacity 1500MW. This test case is much
complex and highly nonlinear, multimodal and discontinuous with many
local minima as all practical complexities like VPL effects, RRL, and POZ
are considered here. The fuel cost coefﬁcient data is taken as in Ref. [39]
and are also listed in Table A3. The total power demand is considered as
10500MW. The area wise power demands are set at 7500MW and
3000MW respectively. The network topology is shown in Fig. 8.
Here the best cost solution obtained by SSA is 124647.0508 $/hr for
tie line limit (TLLL) of 1500MW. Fig. 9 depicts the steady and stable cost
convergence characteristic of SSA for the two area networks. The opti-
mum power generation schedules are listed in Table 5, which shows the
potential of SSA to satisfy associated operational constraints for larger
and complex test case too and comparison of results in terms of cost with
other methods are presented in Table 6.
Test case IV: It is a two area network with combined wind-thermal
(WT) system having forty generating units [39]. The WT system is con-
structed by replacing three thermal units of Test case III by the wind
generators. These thermal units are 27, 28, and 29. The parameter used
for wind generators are Weibull scale and shape factor as c1 ¼ c2 ¼ c3 ¼
15and k1 ¼ k2 ¼ k3 ¼ 1:5:The penalty cost due to underestimation and
overestimation of stochastic wind power is considered as kp1 ¼ kp2 ¼
kp3 ¼ 5, and kr1 ¼ kr2 ¼ kr3 ¼ 5respectively. The cut-in speedðvinÞ, cut
out speedðv0Þ, and rated wind speed ðvrÞare 5 m/s, 15 m/s, and 45 m/s
similar to Ref. [51]. The rated wind power of three generators are
considered as Pwr1 ¼ Pwr2 ¼ Pwr3 ¼ 110MW. For the TLL capacity of
1500MW, the best total cost solution obtained by SSA is 120857.2447
$/hr, out of which the thermal cost is 120164.95424 $/hr and the wind
over estimation cost 692.2903 $/hr. The Stochastic variation of wind
velocity and corresponding wind power of three wind generators is
plotted in Fig. 10. The optimum generation scheduling of generators is
presented in Table 7 and the stable and steady cost convergence

characteristic for combined WT obtained by SSA is presented in Fig. 11.
4.1. Effect of control parameter
SSA is a population-based algorithm. Apart from population size,
termination criteria and other common parameters it has only one con-
trol parameter C1. To get optimum value, simulation analysis has been
carried out with different population (search agent) sizes keeping
maximum number of iterations 500 as the stopping criteria. Performance
of SSA over 30 repeated trials is analyzed on Test Case I and the outcome
of results are presented in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13, respectively. Here it is
observed that with population size of 200, SSA attained minimum cost
with less standard deviation. However, with further increase in popula-
tion size there is no improvement in operational cost but average CPU
time increases. Therefore, population size of 200 is considered for
simulation analysis of MAED problems.
Now to ﬁnd the optimal value of control parameter C1which is
coupled with current iteration and maximum iteration by exponential
term as deﬁned in (22) and plotted in Fig. 14. Here it is observed that the
value of C1exponentially decreases as iteration progresses, which shows
the exploration in the initial stage and then exploitation in the later stage.
4.2. Comparative analysis
4.2.1. Solution quality
For the test case I, the optimal generation schedule and comparison of
costs are made in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Here it is observed that

optimum cost obtained by SSA 7337.0139 $/hr is found to be compa-
rable with MFO [43], HLSO [41] and better than IHS [38], IFEP [38] and
IDEPSO4 [41], reported in the recent literature.
For large dimension problem (Test Case II), the optimal generation
schedule and statistical results in terms of costs are summarized in Ta-
bles 3 and 4 respectively. By comparison of costs reported by other
metaheuristics it is observed that SSA can acquire lowest cost
122471.666 $/hr as compared to real coded genetic algorithms (RCGA)
[40], differential evolution (DE) [40], evolutionary programming (EP)
[40], artiﬁcial bee colony optimization (ABCO) [40], cuckoo search al-
gorithm (CSA) [45] and ﬂower pollination algorithm (FPA) [42]. Also the
mean cost 122507.5003 $/hr obtained by SSA is found to be superior as
compared to the best cost reported by other methods, which supports to
claims the global search capability of SSA.
For two area network (Test case III) which has non-convex as well as
discontinuous fuel cost characteristics due to VPL effect and POZ both are
considered here. The minimum cost solution obtained by SSA is
124647.0508 $/hr and corresponding generation schedule is listed in
Table 5. While comparing its statistical results in terms of cost with other
methods in Table 6, such as stochastic fractal search (SFS) [47], hybrid
DEPSO with different mutation strategy of DE, DEPSO1 to DSPSO4 [41],
Hybrid sum local search optimizer (HLSO) [41] and MFO [43] and DEC2
[39], it is observed that the minimum cost obtained by SSA is better.
Test case IV is a modiﬁed version of Test case III, and modiﬁcation has
been done by replacing three thermal generators by the wind generators.
It has highest complexity among all cases considered for simulation
analysis. It includes complexity like probabilistic constraints due to wind
integration in addition to VPL, RRL and POZ of the thermal system,
makes the objective function multimodal as well as discontinuous in
nature and hence ﬁnding global minima solution for such a complex
constrained problem has become quite difﬁcult task. For such a complex
and highly constrained test case also SSA is able to obtain optimum
generation cost of 120857.2447 $/hr which is found to be lower by
3789.8061 $/hr as compared to Test Cast III. Its detail solution which is
listed in Table 7, shows the better constrained handling capability of SSA.
Therefore, we can say SSA has a strong ability to ﬁnd a better quality
of the solution.
But for two test cases, it is observed that minimum cost of SSA is
found to be inferior as compared to hybrid version meta-heuristics re-
ported in the literature listed in Tables 2 and 4, respectively. They are (i)
for test case I, the best cost reported using a hybrid harmony search

(HHS) [37] is 7329.85$/hr, while SSA has 7337.0139 $/hr. (ii) for test
case II the best cost obtained using JAYA-TLBO [46] is 121694.4 $/hr
while using SSA it is 122471.666 $/hr.
4.2.2. Computational efﬁciency
The best cost solution achieved by SSA and corresponding generation
schedule for different cases are presented in Tables 1, 3, 5 and 7 show the
ability to satisfy constraints for complex constrained optimization prob-
lems. The average CPU time required to converge into the optimum so-
lution for all four test cases are shown in Fig. 15. Considering dimensions
and complexity levels of problems taken under consideration, such
computational times are quite justiﬁed. Therefore, it can be said that SSA
is computationally efﬁcient also.
4.2.3. Robustness
The statistical results in terms of cost simulated over 30 independent
runs of all four test cases having different dimensions/complexity are
summarized in Table 2, Table 4, Table 6, and Table 8. The robustness of
the algorithm is analyzed on the basis of mean cost and standard devi-
ation (SD). For test case I, the mean cost of SSA is found to be inferior to
hybrid/improved version of metaheuristics reported in literature as
hybrid sum-local search optimizer (HLSO) [41], DEPSO4 [41] but su-
perior to MFO [43]. Here the SD of cost for SSA is also higher as
compared to others.
For large dimension test case II, even the worst cost solution of SSA
122737.9965 $/hr is found to be superior to the best cost reported by EP
[40], DE [40], ABCO [40], FPA [42] and CSA [45] listed in Table 4.
For two area system test case III, with the nonlinear, multimodal and
discontinuous objective function, the mean cost 124688.4065 $/hr of
SSA is better as compared to other bio-inspired methods as variants of DE
[41], MFO [43], SFS [47] and ISFS [47] listed in Table 6. Here also it is
observed that SD of cost 88.1322 for SSA is either superior or almost
comparable to other reported methods except DEC2 [39].
Comparing the results of Test case III and Test case IV, i.e. MAED
problem of thermal system and then MAED problem of wind-thermal
system as presented in Tables 6 and 8, it has been observed that cost is
reduced signiﬁcantly by wind integration but due to additional proba-
bilistic constraints, standard deviation of the cost is found to be large.
Based on this discussion, we can say SSA is a robust optimization
approach.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, a salp swarm algorithm is implemented to solve MAED
problems with different dimensions and operational complexity. By
analyzing the generation schedule, it has been observed that all opera-
tional constraints are fully satisﬁed for all the test cases having different
dimensions and complexity level. It proves that SSA can efﬁciently
handle the constraints. Through comparison of best cost solution with
other metaheuristics, SSA is found to be effective in terms of solution
quality too. The average CPU time required to converge into the optimum
solution has also been analyzed, considering the dimension and
complexity of problems. SSA is found to be sufﬁciently fast converging
algorithm. Despite providing good results, it has been observed that SSA
suffers from premature convergence especially for test cases having
objective function non-convex, discontinuous and probabilistic in nature.
It may be due to parameter C1, which decreases exponentially and is
responsible for exploration and exploitation during the optimization
process. Therefore a more extensive research on the sensitivity analysis of
parameter C1can further improve SSA.
