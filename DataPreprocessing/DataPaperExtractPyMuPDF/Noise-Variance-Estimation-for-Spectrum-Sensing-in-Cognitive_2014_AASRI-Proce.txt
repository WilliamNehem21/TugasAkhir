access the radio spectrum, andspectrum sensing is an active approach used in CRS to locate spectrum holes in 
underutilized spectrum for opportunistic access. In spectrum sensinganopportunistic useractively measures the 
radio environment foravailable spectrum holes. There are many different types of spectrum sensing 
approaches depending on the hardware used for sensing, the sensing entities, sensing dissemination and 
sensing techniques [1].Reliability of a sensing technique depends whether it can accurately ascertain the 
presence or absence of a licensed user signals in the band of interest. The sensing techniques can be classified 
as transmitter detection, interference-based detection and receiver detection [2]. The underlying hypotheses of 
primary signal detection are as follows [2]: 
H0     :  x(t) = n(t) 
H1     :  x(t) = h*s(t) + n(t) 
where 
n(t)is the Additive White Gaussian Noise, 
h is the channel gain, and 
s(t)is the licensed transmitter signal.  
 
H0 represents the null hypothesis, that a primary transmitter isnot present, whereas hypothesis H1 states that 
a primary transmitter is present. 
2. Problem Statement 
Commonly used primary user detection techniques include energy detection [3], matched filter detection 
[4], cyclostationary feature detection [1, 2], self-correlated detection [5], eigenvalue based spectrum sensing 
[6-8], and multi-taper and filter bank estimation [9]. The RMT based spectrum sensing proposed in [10] 
suggests acriterion based on the Marchenko-Pastur law [11] which relies on the known variance of noise 
which suffers the same problem as faced by energy detection. 
In this paper we present a techniquefor noise variance estimation that addresses the limitations of current 
blind spectrum sensing techniques. That is, both energy detection and eigenvaluebased techniques use the 
noise variance in their hypothesis testing criteria, so both are reliant on the correct estimation of noise 
variance. Any uncertainty in noise variance estimation will greatly affect theiraccuracy, resulting either in 
missed detection of spectrum holes or interference to the primary user.Our proposed method for noise 
variance estimation could be used for setting the decision thresholds for energy detection based spectrum 
sensing and also for calculating the upper and lower bounds of the eigenvalues using the Marchenko-Pastur 
law. 
The performance of the proposed scheme is tested through extensive simulations and is found to be 
efficient in terms of estimating the noise variance. In our simulations we have considered various signalswhile 
evaluating the proposed scheme. In the next section, the performance of the scheme is evaluated through 
extensive simulations, and the mean error in estimated noise variance has been evaluated by varying the SNR, 
number of measurements and number of samples per measurement.  
3. Proposed Noise Estimation Scheme 
To address the noise estimation problem, we consider multiple measurement sets, M in number, from the 
same portion of the radio spectrum, i.e. multiple measurements of the same signal under analysis. We assume 
N numbers of samples are collected for each measurement set. Let a single measurement set of the signal be 
represented by SM (N)where M represents a separate measurement and N represents the number of samples for 
the measurement, such that S1 represents a complete sample set for the first measurement,  S2 represents a 
complete sample set of second measurement, and so on. SM represents the complete sample set for the last 
measurement, i.e.

next section, where it is clearly shown that the mean error of the estimate is very close to zero for higher 
numbers of measurements and for higher numbers of samples per measurement. The good estimation 
performance of the noise variance from equation (1) indicates its suitability to be used with energy detection 
and for accurate determination of the upper and lower bounds of the Marchenko-Pastur law.

4. Simulation and Results 
Multiple simulations have been carried out to check the performance of the new method for estimating the 
noise variance. Each simulation has been repeated 1000 times for each set of numbers of samples, number of 
measurements and the SNR.The mean error of noise estimation is calculated using equation (2) where Var is 
the known noise variance and ��is our estimation of the noise variance.

4.1. Mean Error for Different SNR with Varying Number of Samples: 
Fig.(1) shows the mean error in decibels (dB) of estimating the noise variance using equation (1) for 
different values of SNR. The mean error greatly reduces with increasing number of samples taken per 
measurement. The mean error is also low for high SNR values. Fig.(1) also shows that for different values of 
SNR, the mean error follows the same trend and it decreases with an increase in number of samples per 
measurement for all values of SNR. Fig.1(a) shows the mean error for noise estimation using two 
measurements, i.e. M=2. Fig.1 (b) shows the mean error for noise estimation using four measurements. It is 
clearly evident that Fig.1 (b) follows the same trends for mean error as found in Fig.1 (a) but the mean error 
reduces with increasing numbers of measurements, M . 
4.2. Mean Error for Different Number of Measurements (M) with Varying SNR: 
Fig.2 shows the mean error in dB of estimating the noise variance using equation (1) for different values of 
M, i.e. for different numbers of measurements. The mean error greatly reduces with an increase in numbers of 
measurement sets. The mean error is also low for high SNR values. Fig.2 also shows that for different values 
of SNR, the mean error follows the same trend and it decreases with increasing SNR for all trends of different 
numbers of measurements. Fig.2 shows the mean error for 1000 samples per measurement, i.e. N=1000. 
Fig.3shows the mean error of noise estimation using N=25000. It is clearly evident that Fig.3follows the same 
trends for mean error as found in Fig.2 but the mean error reduces with increased numbers of samples, N, as 
also shown in Fig.1.

5. Conclusion 
We have proposed a novel method for estimating the noise variance that can be used in situations where 
multiple data sets are available. We have also shown that the mean error for estimating the noise variance is 
very low for higher numbersof measurements, hence making it suitable for energy detection, multi-antenna 
based spectrum sensing and also for co-operative spectrum sensing. The higher performance of the proposed 
scheme in estimating the noise variance demonstrates its suitability for establishing the detection thresholds in 
hypothesis testing in energy detection and Marchenko-Pastur law based spectrum sensing and it is the next 
milestone for our proposed noise estimation scheme to test its performance for the aforementioned spectrum 
sensing schemes.
