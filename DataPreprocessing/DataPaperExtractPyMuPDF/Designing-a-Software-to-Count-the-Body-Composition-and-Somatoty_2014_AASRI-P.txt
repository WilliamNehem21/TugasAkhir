Sports morphology is a science that is specialised in studying the changes of human body structure which 
occur under physical exercises ,The high performance of tained by athlets makes it necessary to evaluate the 
body capacity and the individual characteristics of each athlet . 
This evaluation considers a number of parametrs such as weight ,height, body surface ,fat mass, muscle 
mass and bones mass . 
From this logic stems the idea to design a software capable to treat in put data (Anthropometric 
measurements ) where the the out put data will be in form of Somatotype and body mass . 
By using Matiegka equation and carter-heat method of anthropometric somatotype, as a consequence the 
objectives of this research are : 
1)
To simplify the computing operations of Matiegka equation and the carter-heat method. 
2)
To increase the precision of computing the results of body mass and somatotypes of several athlets in 
faster time and less efforts. 
3)
To design baseline data of body mass and somatotype for a big number of athlets to follow up their 
morpholic state,thier selection and thier guidance to the most appropriate sport ‘s activity. 
4)
To design a somatochart and body composition chart . 
2. Research terms 
Software: he’s a direction give to the computer to excute precise task in the time from .(Ghistaine and 
Patrick 2000). 
Body composition (body mass) : is a term refers to the human body from three ingredients are ( muscles, 
fats, bones) . (Battinelli,2007) 
Somatotype : is an expression refers to the morphology , and is expressed in three points , the first refers to 
the endomorphy(right), segond (midale)to mesomorphy , third (left) ectomorphy (carter,2002) 
3. Equations adopted in software 
We used the formulas of Mateigka (1921) : 
3.1. Fat mass 
MA = d. s.k. 
MG : absolute fat mass in kg 
d:½�skinfold(subscapular, (biceps+triceps)/2chest,forearm,abdominal,thigh)/6 
s : body surface calculated by the formula Izakson(1958) : 
 s = ( 100 + wieht + ( stature – 160 )) / 100 
k : constant = 1, 3 
- calculating the percentage of fat mass (relative) : 
MG% = (MA/ body mass).100 
3.2. Bones mass : 
MO = l.o².k 
MO: absolute bones mass in kg 
l : stature in cm 
o = (diameters distal arm, forearm, thigh and leg)/4 in cm 
k: constant = 1,2 
- calculating the percentage of bones mass (relative) : 
MO% = (MO/masse corporelle).100 
3.3. muscle mass : 
MM = l.r².k 
MO : absolute muscle mass in kg

l : stature in cm 
r =(� circumference arm, forearm, thigh and leg) / 25.12 - ( �skinfold arm, forearm, thigh and leg) / 80 
k : constant = 6,5 
- calculating the percentage of muscle mass (relative) : 
MM% = (MM/body mass).100 (Matiegka, 1921). 
4. Somatotype 
We used the Heath-carter Antropometric Somatotype (Duqaet and carter ,2001),(Heat and  
carter,1977),(Philipaerts,2002) 
4.1. How the software works: 
programming language : 
visual C sharp(C#)�Microsoft visual studio 2008 
Data base �MySQL (Wamp Server) (Mickey,2002),(Donis,2005),(Loca and John,2010) 
Software platform : 
32 bit ,64 bit Windows (XP , Windows 7) 
Size of program : 2 ,45 MB 
 
 
 
First step : 
After fixing the program (setup software) you’ll see the next interface and it’s « somatotype interface » if 
you want to change the language from english to arab click on « administrator box ». 
fill the information about somatotype then click on the « somatotype box » to show the results , if you want 
to represent data in the somatochart clik on « chart » , if you want to delete data click on « reset » , After 
making sure to fill the correct to data click « save » and you’ll see the message if you want to Continue 
calculate body mass click « OK » , and if want to save the results somatotype just click « NO » if you want to 
close program click on « cancel » 
Observation : to fill the high side of the program (code ,Name , Age ….) are necessary to save the results in 
database. 
41
 Asli Houcine et al. /  AASRI Procedia  8 ( 2014 )  38 – 43 
 
 
The second step: 
Fill the data for body mass then click on « OK » to show results ,same previous steps if you want change the 
language or graphical representation or delete afer confirming data click « save » then click on « data base» 
box , to confirming data save in data base you will see the next interface . 
 
 
 
After clicking on « data base » you’ll see black page , click on 
execution for appearence of stored 
information , if you want to research about ( Name or code or …..) entre Name …, in research box you will see 
the spacial information in blue color . 
If you want to delete the stored information for this code click on « delete » 
, and if you want to delete 
all the information from data base click on « delet all » 
 ; if you want to change in some data click on 
 
then click on Name or code …., that you wanted to change then click on « somatotype » or « body mass » box ,

Email : asli.houcine_sport@yahoo.fr 
You'll find that the data was automatically filled then make a change process then click on « Save » , if you 
want data representation Somatotype or body mass choose the serie name then click on the box
and will 
apear to you the interface . 
 
 
 
When the next interface apear choose graphical represetation chart type then click on « OK » then click on « 
somatochart ». 
 
 
 
To apear somatochart as you see in the picture .  
5. Search Results  
1 ) Facilitating the countable operations for matiegka equations and Heat-carter method for antropometric 
somatotype . 
2) Counting the results of the body mass and somatotype for big number of sportsmen in short period of 
time ,less effort and more accuracy. 
3) Designing basic data rich of the body mass ‘and the somatotype ‘s results of many sportsmen ,So that ,it 
helps in pursing their morphological state and the way to select and guid them to the best sport activity. 
4) Designing the somatochart and diagram for body composition .  
43
 Asli Houcine et al. /  AASRI Procedia  8 ( 2014 )  38 – 43 
6. Recommendations  
1)
Link this software to the hardware to the process to make measurs anthropometry . 
2)
Take care to the morphology side to estimate training program 
3)
It’s necesory to take care of somatotype in selection process and to direct athlets to the right physical 
activity . 
4)
Make more of meetings and conferences about the importance link to the sport domain with ather 
sciences especially electronic engineering science .
