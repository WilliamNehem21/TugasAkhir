Speckle noise is a characteristic artifact in breast ultrasound images, which hinders substantive informa-
tion essential for clinical diagnosis. In this article, we have investigated the use of Non-local means (NLM)
ﬁlter, which is robust against severe noise, to remove speckle noise in breast ultrasound images. Medical
diagnosis systems cannot employ traditional NLM ﬁlters, which exhibit the slowest performance due to
their computational burden during the weighted averaging process. We have integrated a novel auto-
mated clustering based preclassiﬁcation scheme using spatial regularized fuzzy c means (FCM) to allevi-
ate the process. The appropriate number of clusters for each image is calculated automatically through
Gap statistics. Moreover, the rotationally invariant moment distance measure increases the chance of
getting more similar regions for NLM process. The algorithm is evaluated on a breast ultrasound database,
which consists of 54 images including 28 benign and 26 malignant. Two statistical measures, Pratt’s ﬁg-
ure of merit (PFM) and equivalent number of looks (ENL), are used to evaluate the noise suppression per-
formance as well as the capability of preserving the ﬁne details. The results of the proposed method are
compared with the other three state of the art methods quantitatively. The proposed method demon-
strated excellent despeckling performance with PFM of 0.91 and ENL of 7.415. The robustness against
speckle noise and the acceptable processing time make the method more appropriate for computer aided
diagnosis systems.

1. Introduction
Worldwide, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed can-
cer in women and accounts for 14% in overall cancer deaths [1].
Early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer increase the surviv-
ability of patients and reduce mortality [2,3]. Ultrasound imaging
is an effective, convenient, inexpensive and radiation-free imaging
tool for breast tumor diagnosis [4]. Ultrasound has higher sensitiv-
ity for detecting lesions in dense breasts, commonly found among
young women [5]. Reduced rate of false-positive results in ultra-
sound brings down the number of unnecessary biopsies, when
compared to mammography [6]. Since the tumor contour is the
most important information for diagnostic decision, the physician
could observe more clearly the difference in shapes and sizes of
malignant and benign breast lesions using ultrasound [7].
Many ultrasound computer aided detection and diagnosis
(CAD) systems have been developed to provide computerized esti-
mation of the probability of malignancy [8]. The traditional B-
mode grayscale ultrasound remains the standard in the clinic due
to physicians’ familiarity with it [9]. However, the most important
deﬁciency of ultrasound is the poor quality of the image, when it is
corrupted by speckle noise during the acquisition process. The
existence of the speckle ruins the image quality and impacts the
diagnosis accuracy [10,11]. The objective of image denoising task
is to remove the speckle noise while retaining the signal features
as much as possible in order to increase the diagnostic accuracy.
An accurate model of speckle noise formation is necessary for the
development of a despeckling algorithm. Although many statistical

models were developed to describe speckle noise, there is no uni-
versally accepted model available yet. However a general model
[12] for speckle noise is given as gðn; mÞ ’ f ðn; mÞuðn; mÞ, where
gðn; mÞ is the observed image, f ðn; mÞ is the original image and
uðn; mÞ multiplicative component of speckle noise.
Typically, speckle reduction is accomplished by applying vari-
ous ﬁlters. However, these ﬁlters also remove ﬁner edge details,
which are essential for producing an accurate contour of the tumor
for diagnosis [13]. Directional average ﬁlter [14], and partial differ-
ential equation (PDE) based ﬁlters [15–19] are able to preserve
important features such as edges, corners and point targets, while
removing speckle noise in ultrasound images. The anisotropic dif-
fusion (AD) ﬁlter [15] utilizes the local estimations of the image
structures where the image smoothing is devised as a diffusive
process and it is stopped at lesion boundaries to preserve the dis-
continuities. Filters such as speckle reducing AD (SRAD) [16], adap-
tive window AD (AWAD) [17], oriented SRAD [18] and speckle
suppressing AD (SSAD) [19] were also utilized for despeckling
ultrasound images. Although the PDE based methods exhibited
improved speckle reduction and edge preservation, they lose
meaningful details during iterations by producing blurred low con-
trast edges and speckle is often retained in the high intensity
regions. Moreover, in all these methods, the restored value of a
pixel only depends on its spatial neighborhood pixels of the same
image context, known as locally adaptive recovery paradigm [20].
Buades et al. [21] proposed non-local means (NLM) approach,
which exploits speciﬁc characteristics of natural or texture images
such as repetitive patterns. NLM ﬁlter is based on the category of
directional average ﬁlters [14] and it replaces each pixel with a
weighted average of other pixels with similar neighborhoods. The
NLM ﬁler produced the promising results on severely noise
affected images [21–27] and ultrasound images [28–31]. The
drawback of the NLM algorithm is that it consumes more process-
ing time during the calculation of weights. Many methods were
proposed to speed up the processing by eliminating dissimilar
patches before the weight calculation. Techniques such as prese-
lection of contributing neighborhoods based on mean and gradient
values [24], use of local mean and variance to eliminate dissimilar
pixels [23], use of fast Fourier transform (FFT) [25] and utilization
of several critical pixels in the center instead of all neighborhood
pixels [26] were used during the calculation of weights. Grewenig
et al. [27] used two similarity measures: moment invariants and
rotationally invariant block matching (RIBM). The method identi-
ﬁed similar patches present in several rotated or mirrored
instances to obtain more suitable regions. This method improved
the despeckling performance of NLM considerably, but not the pro-
cessing speed. Zhan et al. [31] introduced a weight reﬁning NLM
method, where weight calculation is performed in lower dimen-
sional subspace using PCA instead of the original noisy image space
to reduce computational cost. Although the preselection process
improves the preservation of detail rich regions, the ﬂat regions
are slightly degraded [28]. In fact the ﬂat regions contain a large
number of similar pixels, which tends to improve denoising perfor-
mance. Yan et al. [32] presented the concept of clustering based
preclassiﬁcation to increase the computational speed without

elimination of pixels. The computational intensity is alleviated
considerably by performing the weighted averaging within each
cluster. The ﬁlter produced superior quantitative results when
the appropriate number of clusters with sufﬁcient number of pixel
candidates is chosen manually.
In this article, we have proposed a novel framework for NLM ﬁl-
ter to remove speckle noise in breast ultrasound images. We have
integrated an automated clustering based preclassiﬁcation scheme
into the NLM model to increase the computational speed as well as
the noise reduction performance. During preclassiﬁcation process,
feature vectors are calculated for the image using moment invari-
ants and are clustered by spatial regularized FCM algorithm. Mean-
while, the gap statistics automatically calculate the appropriate
number of clusters for each image. The weighted averaging process
is performed using RIBM within each cluster and it identiﬁes more
similar regions in an image. Thus, the NLM has been facilitated
with more suitable regions without eliminating any pixel candi-
dates to yield superior denoising performance with reduced pro-
cessing time.
2. Methods
2.1. The image database
The image database consists of 54 B-mode breast ultrasound
images including 28 benign and 26 malignant cases. These images
were acquired through high end ultrasound system (Prosound F75,
Hitachi medical systems Europe, Switzerland) from different
patients over different periods with the consent of the patients
[33]. It complies with the HONcode (health on the net foundation)
standard for trustworthy health information. The study protocols
are approved by institution’s ethics committee of Gelderse Vallei
Hospital, Ede, the Netherlands.
2.2. The NLM algorithm
The NLM algorithm makes use of the self similarity of patches in
an image [21]. In an image, the restored intensity NLðvÞðiÞ of a pixel
i is a weighted average of all intensity values within the neighbor-
hood
I.
The
traditional
NLM
[21]
is
given
by
NLðvÞðiÞ ¼ P
j2Ixði; jÞvðjÞ, where v is the intensity, vðjÞ is the inten-
sity at pixel j, and xði; jÞ is the assigned weight. The weights
xði; jÞ ¼

h2
depend on the similarity between the intensi-
ties of the local neighborhood patches (blocks) centered on pixel i
and j. Where Ni is a patch of ﬁxed size and centered at the pixel i.
The similarity term k � k2
2 is computed between weighted Euclidean
distance of vNj (neighborhood of j) and vNi (neighborhood of i).
ZðiÞ is the normalization constant ensuring that P
j2IxRði; jÞ ¼ 1.
The h is the ﬁltering parameter which controls the smoothing.
The improved NLM [32] is given as NLðvÞðiÞ ¼ P
j2LxRði; jÞvðjÞ,
where the modiﬁed weight xRði; jÞ deﬁned as xRði; jÞ ¼
1
ZRðiÞ e
�dRði;jÞ
h2 .
The xRði; jÞ depends on distance measure dRði; jÞ which is deﬁned
in Section 2.5 and the L is the number of elements in a cluster.
The computational time can be reduced by performing calculation
of weights within each cluster instead for the entire image.
2.3. Pre-classiﬁcation using spatial regularized FCM clustering
The Hu’s moment invariant [27] is used as image descriptor. For
an N � M image with an N � M patch centered at location i, where
ði ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . ; N � MÞ, the moment invariants of the patch are rep-
resented by a vector of ð1 � 7Þ. Totally, ðN � NÞ vectors for the
entire image are constructed. The clustering based preclassiﬁcation
is performed for deﬁning a set of candidates that contains different
patches from all over the image, which serve as lookup table (LUT)
for block matching process. The spatial regularized FCM is used as
clustering algorithm. The objective function is deﬁned as follows:
Jm ¼

ð1Þ
where xr is the neighbor of xk; Nk is a set of neighbors within a win-
dow around xk and NR is the cardinality of Nk. The parameter a con-
trols the neighborhoods and its relative importance is inversely
proportional to the amount of noise present in the image.
2.4. Calculating number of clusters using gap statistics
Tibshirani et al. [35] discovered that the ‘‘within cluster disper-
sion”, an error measure decreases when the number of clusters ‘k’
increases. However, when a speciﬁc value of ‘k’ is reached, the error
measure becomes ﬂat. The value of ‘k ‘at such an ‘elbow’, indicates
the appropriate number of clusters and it can be assigned to any
clustering algorithm automatically.
At ﬁrst the input image data xij ði ¼ 1; 2 . . . ; n and
j ¼ 1; 2;
. . . ; mÞ are clustered by changing the total number of clusters from
k ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . ; kn, where the m features are measured in n indepen-
dent observations. The distance between two observations i and i0.

the clustered data are C1; C2; . . . ; Ck and nr ¼ jCrj. The within cluster
dispersion Wk, an error measure [36] is given as follows:

where Dr, the sum of pair wise distances in cluster r is calculated by

tion under an appropriate null reference distribution of data. The
optimum number of clusters is estimated by ﬁnding the value of
k for which logðWkÞ falls below this reference curve. The GnðkÞ is
estimated as follows:
GnðkÞ ¼ EnðlogðWkÞÞ � logðWkÞ
ð3Þ
where the En denotes the expectation under a sample size of n from
the reference distribution. Generate B reference datasets as pre-
scribed in [35], and cluster each one k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; K and ﬁnd within

2.5. RIBM based nonlocal ﬁltering
In NLM algorithm, lack of repetitive patterns in an image
leads to insufﬁcient candidates for weighted averaging. Also,
the use of moment invariants during preclassiﬁcation might have
possibly left rotationally unaligned candidates at neighborhood.
The RIBM can solve these problems by ﬁnding similar regions
50

in an image [36]. The RIBM estimates the angle of rotation
between two blocks by its centroid and using this value, it ﬁnds
the position of the corresponding pixel in another block by rotat-
ing its vector. The new similarity measure in discrete form is
given as [32]:

where I denotes bilinear interpolation function. For each point of ci
in patch Ni, after rotation and interpolation, its corresponding point
cj in patch Nj is obtained.

2.6. Selection of parameters for experiment
The parameters used for our experiments are listed in Table 1.
Hu’s seventh moment invariant u7 is used as feature descriptor
in preclassiﬁcation. The appropriate number of clusters for preclas-
siﬁcation is determined by gap statistics. The block size of 5 � 5 is
chosen for RIBM and the size of the search window is set at 21 � 21
[21,37,38]. The ﬁlter parameter h is an important parameter in
NLM ﬁlter. The optimal value of h depends on the amount of noise
present in the image. Choosing a low value of h leads to noisy
image and a high value of h blurs the ﬁne details of image. In many
methods [31] the value of h is chosen as h ¼ Cr where C is a con-
stant and r is the standard deviation of noise. As we conﬁne our
experiments with breast ultrasound images, the noise cannot be
estimated and so we have chosen h = 15 as suggested in [36,27].
3. Results
The method is evaluated on breast ultrasound image database,
using two statistical parameters namely Pratt’s ﬁgure of merit
(PFM) [16] and equivalent number of looks (ENL) [30]. We have
compared the results of the proposed method with other three
state of the art NLM based methods: traditional NLM (TNLM)
[21], NLM with RIBM [27] and improved NLM [32]. In our experi-
ments, the same set of NLM parameters (Table 1) are used for all
these methods. In the Figs. 1 and 2, (a) is the original image from
the database, (b) the processed image by the method [21], (c) by
the method [27], (d) by the method [32] and (e) shows the pro-
cessed image by our method. Table 2 shows numerical results pro-
duced by all the evaluated methods. The values shown are the
mean values of entire images in the database. An ANOVA test is
also performed to analyze signiﬁcant improvements in the denois-
ing performance of the proposed algorithm over other methods. As
shown in Table 2, the proposed method produced PFM and ENL
values of 0.91 and 7.415 respectively, which are signiﬁcantly
higher than the other three methods with all p values < 0.05. The
values of PFM and ENL for each individual image are plotted in
Figs. 3 and 4 for comparison. All algorithms have been run on Mat-
lab 2009a (Mathworks Inc., USA), in an Intel Core i5 processor
(Intel Corp., USA) based PC with 8 GB RAM.
4. Discussion
We have presented a NLM based method for removing speckle
noise from breast ultrasound images by considering its robustness
against heavy noise [21]. The traditional NLM is a simple and effec-
tive way to reduce noise, while keeping details of the images unaf-
fected. A limitation of the ﬁlter is that it can identify patches as
similar to a given patch with same structure and orientation but
similar patches with similar structure but different orientations
do not have inﬂuence in the average [39]. To rectify this issue,
the orientation of patches is estimated and corrected before
weighted averaging process using RIBM [27,36] to obtain more
suitable regions.
The lower processing time is an important criterion for medical
image denoising. So we have concentrated methods, which reduce
computational time. Yan et al. [32] used clustering based preclas-
siﬁcation [32] to achieve faster processing without the elimination
of any pixels in weight calculation. The k-means algorithm is used
for clustering, where the value of k (number of clusters) has been
set manually though visual perception as well as through peak sig-
nal to noise ratio (PSNR) values. In k-means algorithm, the patches
are divided into distinct clusters and each element of a patch
belongs to exactly one cluster. This restricts the candidates to be
present in more than one cluster. Such a restriction is not present
in fuzzy clustering where the elements of a patch can spread over
Fig. 4. Equivalent number of looks (ENL) is an inherent parameter for measuring noise level in an image. ENL is calculated from a small rectangular homogeneous region of
the images.
Fig. 5. The graph shows appropriate number of clusters automatically selected for
each image through gap statistics. The number of clusters varied from 920 to 1315
for the 54 images in the database.

more than one cluster with an association deﬁned by a member-
ship function. This property increases the probability of getting
more suitable candidates from each cluster for weighted averaging.
However, the FCM does not consider the spatial information in the
image context [34], which makes it very sensitive to noise and
other imaging artifacts. In spatial regularized FCM algorithm, the
local spatial information is incorporated into the FCM [34], in
which the neighborhood effect acts as a regularizer.
Moreover, in clustering based preclassiﬁcation methods, the
number of clusters impacts the denoising performance [32] and
the estimation of optimum number of clusters is the major chal-
lenge. If the number of clusters is more, fewer candidates are pre-
sent in each cluster and degrade the denoising performance. In
contrary, if clusters are less, more number of candidates are pre-
sent in each cluster and make the method sluggish. In our work,
we have used gap statistics [35] to choose appropriate number of
clusters which leads to optimum performance. The curve in Fig. 5
shows the appropriate values of k produced for each image of
our database. It can be observed from the graph that the value of
k is unique for each image, which varies from 920 to 1315.
The PFM is used as a metric to evaluate the preservation of
edges. It uses the distance between all pairs of points to quantify
the quality of edges. It is observed from the curves (Fig. 3) that
our method produced PFM values comparatively higher for the
most of the images in the database, which demonstrates better
edge preservation. The range of PFM is between 0 and 1 and higher
value is for ideal edge detection. Canny’s method, which produces
single response for each selected edges is used for edge detection
[16] with standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel r ¼ 0:1. We
achieved a higher PFM of 0.91, when compared to other methods:
TNLM (0.7), NLM-RIBM (0.759) and improved NLM (0.819). The
inherent parameter, ENL is an effective index for estimating the
speckle noise level in images [30]. The value of ENL corresponds
to smoother homogeneous region in the despeckled image. The
comparison of ENL values is shown in Fig. 4. The ENL is calculated
on a small rectangular homogeneous region in the original image
and the value obtained is 4.43. The proposed method produced
higher value of ENL (7.415), when compared to TNLM (5.566),
NLM with RIBM (5.829) and improved NLM (6.031), manifests bet-
ter despeckling ability over other methods. The TNLM [24] con-
sumed 28 s, the method [27] consumed 31 s, the method [32]
consumed 6.8 s and the proposed method consumed 7.2 s. The pro-
cessing time of the proposed method (7.2 s) is slightly higher than
the method [32] (6.8 s), because of the implementation of gap
statistic in preclassiﬁcation stage. The acceptable processing time
and the ability of preserving image details while removing speckle
noise make it suitable for computer aided diagnosis systems.
5. Conclusion
In this article, we have presented a novel NLM framework for
removing speckle noise in breast ultrasound images. The proposed
method has improved the NLM performance in two ways: an auto-
mated clustering based preclassiﬁcation scheme through gap
statistics and a new similarity measure using rotationally invariant
moment distance measure. The results have shown that the pre-
sented method gives better quantitative results compared to other
state-of-the-art NLM based methods. Thus, the robustness against
noise and low processing time make the ﬁlter appropriate for
ultrasound computer aided breast cancer diagnosis systems.
