Abstract
Attention has a key role in the ﬂight performance of the aviation
pilot, therefore it is among human factors commonly used in the evaluation of
candidate pilots. In this context, our work aims to deﬁne a single integrated
instrument able to measure all the distinctive attention factors and to assist
the assessment and the training of aviation pilots.
In this paper, we present a battery of seven computerized tests, encompassing
classical and innovative solutions inspired by the literature in the ﬁeld, for the
integrated measurement of the attention factors of aviation pilots. The computer
software is validated by means of an experimental trial with 50 experienced avi-
ation pilots and 50 untrained people as controls. Statistical analyzes conﬁrm that

1. Introduction
In the typical routine, an aviation pilot has to switch rapidly between different
sources of information to construct a mental situation model of what the airplane
is doing and how to get it to go where he wants it to go. At the same time, he has
to listen to Air Trafﬁc Control (ATC) instructions, often delivered at sustained
speed. Then, there is the requirement to interpret the instructions from ATC
through the use of paper or electronic charts and to ﬂy, or program the autopilot
to ﬂy, the desired route. At the same time, the pilot has to keep track of the
weather at his current location, along his route and at his destination.
In this context, it is too crucial that the pilot develops Situation Awareness
(SA) that is not speciﬁc to a particular type of aircraft and mission, but general-
izes across many types of aircraft systems [9]. Many researchers recognize the
essential role of attention in SA [8,16,18], as an example Schriver et al. [14] inves-
tigated the behavior of pilots with different experience levels and presented results
that support the link between greater attention and more effective decision mak-
ing of aviation pilots. Recently, Carretta [4] conﬁrmed that attention is among
factors that have consistently shown a relation to ﬂying performance in a study
of the Pilot Candidate Selection Method (PCSM), while King et al. [11] proved
that tests of cognitive functioning, that include attention, can predict the training
outcomes.
Previous work demonstrated that computerized tests are ideal to assess pilot
aptitude [2] and, in particular, to measure attention factors [3]. In fact, many dif-
ferent computerized instruments to measure attention factors are available, but to
the best of our knowledge none of these instruments was designed and tested
speciﬁcally for aviation pilots with validation results published in the scientiﬁc lit-
erature. Moreover, commercially available computerized tests for aviation pilots
usually measure attention indirectly, e.g. via simpliﬁed ﬂight maneuver simula-
tions, which involve several factors at the same time, and cannot give a speciﬁc
attentional proﬁle that can highlight strengths and weaknesses of the candidate
pilot. Indeed, the attentional proﬁle can be useful for ad-hoc training as theoretical
and empirical evidence exists in support of the argument that both the control of
attention and the ability to establish better attention management can be devel-
oped with training [10].
We also underline that the training of an aviation pilot is particularly difﬁcult
and expensive (the full process for a commercial license can cost up to a hundred
thousand of US dollars) and ﬂight schools have a limited number of seats available

for each course, because the limited resources for the training (i.e. aircrafts or cer-
tiﬁed simulators). For this reason, the selection processes are of fundamental
importance and aim to favor those candidates that have the highest attitude, i.e.
that show the highest potential to be successful.
Starting with this background, our research is aimed to design a specialized
instrument to effectively measure aviation pilot attention factors and to give the
following contribution: (i) as an objective instrument to assist the selection of most
promising candidates; (ii) to identify the factors that they should improve during
the training; (iii) to select a subset of variables that have the highest impact on the
classiﬁcation of aviation pilots.
To this end, we designed and implemented a battery of seven computerized
tests. The development of a novel battery was required to simplify the administra-
tion of the different tests and data collection, and to evaluate some additional fac-
tors, like the peripheral foveal vision, that were not studied before. Indeed, the
battery has been designed to allow a multidimensional assessment of attention.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the tests bat-
tery and details the software implementation. Section 3 reports and discusses the
experimental results of the empirical validation of the proposed instrument
through a trial with 50 experienced aviation pilots and 50 untrained people as a
control group. Finally, Section 4 presents our conclusions.
2. Tests battery description and software implementation
In this section, we present the battery of seven tests designed to identify and assess
the distinctive factors of the aviation pilot attention, and we give examples of the
mapping with actual ﬂight routine tasks.
Here we deﬁne attention as ‘‘a concentration of mental activity that allows you
to take in a limited portion of the vast stream of information available from both
your sensory world and your memory’’ [13].
Types of attention assessed include selective and divided attention, with audi-
tory and visual stimuli. In particular, among visual stimuli, the emphasis is given
to non-central stimuli. The tests differentiate among Central, Mid-peripheral and
Far-peripheral focus of the visual attention. Peripheral vision is used to detect
objects that are located at an eccentricity of more than nine degrees with respect
to the foveal vision [15]. ‘‘Far-peripheral’’ vision exists at the edges of the ﬁeld of
view; ‘‘mid-peripheral’’ vision exists in the middle of the ﬁeld of view. Test scenar-
ios were designed using real-world pictures and videos to increase the level of eco-
logical validity with real-life experience.
The software program presents a detailed introduction before beginning each
test. Next a short interactive demo starts and then the subject is required to repeat
until he is conﬁdent to go on with the real test. The battery of tests needs from
50 min to 1 h to be completed. The duration was carefully chosen by means of
a preliminary pilot study (N = 4, 2 pilots, and 2 controls) in order to be
18

challenging enough for the aviation pilots. Tests are presented to the subject auto-
matically in the order shown in the following.
We deﬁne: Reaction time, which is the time elapsed from the appearance of the
stimulus on the screen to the key pressed by the subject; Error, which occurs when
the subject reacts without any stimulus; Omission, which occurs when the subject
does not react to the stimulus. Note that in case of omission the reaction time is
not calculated.
Stimuli are presented randomly in a window of 2 seconds and they stay on the
screen for 2 seconds or until the key is pressed.
2.1. Test 1: simple reaction time
The test of simple reaction measures a purely psycho-physiological attention. The
parameter identiﬁed in this way deﬁnes a useful baseline for the analysis of subse-
quent tests. The test is composed of two parts: the ﬁrst part (1A), in which the
visual stimulus is proposed in the central part of the screen, thus stimulating the
use of the focused vision; in the second part (1B) of the test the same stimulus
is proposed randomly in one of the four corners of the screen, to activate the
Far-peripheral vision only.
For both subtests, the software records reaction times, errors and omissions.
2.2. Test 2: multiple search and memory
This test was to measure the attention shifting that, as an example, occurs when, in
the course of a ﬂight, the pilot has to execute steps out of the habitual task
sequence. The attention’s shifting factor can be measured via the multiple search
and memory tests, in a version involving the visual-spatial channel, in analogy to
the Toulouse-Pie´ ron concentration test [17]. The task consists of the search and
identiﬁcation of random targets, among a set of similar stimuli represented by styl-
ized hands, which show varying numbers of open ﬁngers differently orientated.
The stimuli are presented in three blocks of twenty stimuli, for which the subject
has to ﬁnd ﬁve targets. Targets’ shapes are different in different blocks, to force
the continuous change of attentional focus. Total time elapsed and the numbers
of errors made by the subjects are recorded.
2.3. Test 3: color-word interference
The ‘‘resistance to distraction’’ factor is investigated by two different adaptations
of the Stroop phenomenon, in which the attentional process counteracts and
reduces the interference of automation. In the original version of this test, devel-
oped by Stroop in 1935, dominant color words written in a different color (e.g. red
written in blue) are presented to the subject, which who must name the color in
which the word is written (blue), exceeding the interference resulting from the
Computer-aided assessment of aviation pilots attention
19
habit of reading the words. Ultimately, the test tends to measure the subject’s abil-
ity to overcome, with a particular attentional effort, the distraction induced from
the semantic meaning of the presented stimulus, which must instead be processed
according to the color appearance.
Our software implements an adaptation of this test, which is split into two
sequential tasks:
3A. In the ﬁrst task, which sets a baseline, the subject should recognize a color
by pressing on the keyboard the button that is coupled with the color that appears
on the screen.
3B. In the second task, which is the real test of interference, words that indicate
a color appear ﬁlled with a different color (e.g. RED in blue), the subject should
neglect the automatic recognition of the word semantic and press the button
corresponding to the color in which the word is ﬁlled (i.e., in the example, blue).
To clearly identify the buttons to be pressed, colored stickers were applied to
the keyboard.
Correct answers, errors, and reaction times to individual stimuli are recorded.
2.4. Test 4: ground interference
This test is designed to measure the ability to discriminate a target from an active
background through peripheral vision, resembling the actual scanning of the cock-
pit instrumentation during the ﬂight duty. An active background gives the inter-
ference by producing a distracting effect, which must be suppressed to correctly
identify the target. The screen is divided into four quadrants and in each one a
video is played during the whole duration of the test. The subject is required to
identify the target among ﬁve different stimuli proposed. The stimuli are proposed
in the peripheral area of the screen and they represent human ﬁgures, compatible
with the position, size, and behavior with those that appear in the background
video.
The software measures the reaction times to stimuli proposed as targets, along
with the number of errors and omissions.
2.5. Test 5: divided attention
This test focuses on two parallel tasks: a visual search and auditory recognition.
This simulates the usual duty of the aviation pilot, as he should pay attention
to the onboard instrumentation and follow instructions from the ATC. This is
an example of divided attention, which is the highest level of attention and refers
to the ability to respond simultaneously to multiple tasks or multiple task
demands. The investigation of this kind of attention is realized by means of a
multi-tasking test. Combining two stimuli of different type in the same test we
can evaluate the subject’s ability to vary the attentional focus and, therefore, to
distribute his attention to the management of many different stimuli.
20
R. Cannavo` et al.
In this test, the subject should press one of the two keys as soon as he perceives
the target, which can be among the visual or auditory stimuli that are presented
simultaneously.
Visual stimuli are different pictures that can appear randomly in one of the four
corners of the screen, this way the subject must activate the Far-peripheral vision,
while the background is neutral. In the meanwhile, to distract the subject, random
sentences that resemble possible ATC speech, are spoken. The auditory target is
the word ‘‘go’’, pronounced by the same voice that reads the ATC sentences.
The software records reaction times, number of correct responses, omissions
and errors for visual (5V) and auditory (5A) stimuli.
2.6. Test 6: digit span
This test aims to assess the domain-general working memory capacity, as this has
been identiﬁed among the fundamental components of pilots’ attention [12], which
is involved in the integration of incoming information into the situation model of
the ﬂight. We recall that a poor performance in this kind of sequential task is a
predictor of failure in those learning tasks that require perception, retention and
reproduction of symbols or sounds in a given order sequence [1].
To this end, the software proposes the classic digit span test: series of increasing
length of digits are presented to the subject and he is asked to repeat them by
pressing the appropriate number keys. The test is divided into two parts: (i) the
direct, in which the subject should retype the digits as they appear on the screen;
(ii) the inverse, in which the subject is required to retype from the last digit
appeared to the ﬁrst one. The backward part starts right after the forward one
is ended.
At each step of the test, the number of digits that sequentially appear on the
screen is increased by one. The test begins with three digits and continues up to
eight. To access to the following step, the subject should recall all the digits at
the current step. If the subject does not correctly recall all the digits, another
sequence of the same length is shown. After two faults, the test is ﬁnished.
For this test, the software calculates the omissions as the total number available
of digits (eight) minus the maximum number of digits correctly recalled by the sub-
ject. The error is the total number of errors made (i.e. number of wrong sequences
inputted) by the subject.
2.7. Test 7: global vision
The objective of the ﬁnal test is to evaluate the quality and timing of discrimina-
tion of an attentional process that uses the three visual channels and their interre-
lation. This test extends the ground interference by presenting moving targets that
can appear randomly anywhere in the screen.
Computer-aided assessment of aviation pilots attention
21
The active background interferes with the task and its distracting effect must be
‘suppressed’ by the subject to correctly identify the target. The target is to be iden-
tiﬁed within 5 different moving stimuli proposed. In this case, the shape of the
stimuli is not the only discriminant factor, but the trajectory must be taken into
account: they can move randomly vertical and diagonal. The starting position
of the stimuli can more randomly in vertical and diagonal directions of the screen,
which is divided into Central, Mid-peripheral and Far-peripheral.
The software records the response time to the targets, the number of errors and
omissions (see Table 1). Omissions are grouped according to their starting posi-
tion: Central (7C), Mid-peripheral (7M) and Far-peripheral (7F). Note that errors
occurring without stimuli cannot be counted in a specific area.
3. Validation experiment: results and discussion
3.1. Participants
The number of subjects that completed all the tests in the battery is N = 100,
divided into two groups: 50 aviation pilots (all males) and 50 untrained healthy
people (all males) as a control group. Subject ages were in the range of 20–40 years
old. Pilots were selected among subjects that have completed their training and
experienced at least 1200 real or simulated hours of ﬂight. Controls were recruited,
after a preliminary selection from a wider sample, excluding those who underwent

particular trainings (e.g. sports or a professional car driving experience), but with
at least an education history that allows them to be enrolled in a pilot training
course, i.e. a high school degree. The participants gave written informed consent
to use the data collected during the trial for research purposes. Descriptive statis-
tics of age and experience are summarized in Table 2.
3.2. Setting and procedure
The experimental study was conducted in computer rooms, where the battery was
administered to several subjects at the same time. All subjects were in good health,
rested and comfortably seated in front of a computer monitor at such a distance
that the lateral area of the monitor coincided with the peripheral area of their
vision. Finally, in order to avoid auditory interference all subjects wore a headset
during the whole duration of the test. Before each session, a collective brieﬁng was
done to answer the general questions of the test battery.
The statistics presented in the results section were computed with the SPSS 21.
3.3. Trial results
First, we performed a t-test comparison to verify the hypothesis that pilots and
controls are two independent samples. Results of t-test analysis are summarized
in Table 3. Negative values of t are in favor of the pilots group. All tests have
at least one variable that rejects the hypothesis (i.e. that the two samples come
from the same group) with a statistical signiﬁcance (p < 0.01). The best result is
achieved from the seventh test (Global vision) as all of its variables well differen-
tiate between the pilots and the controls.
In order to investigate whether experience has some inﬂuence on the perfor-
mance, we also executed a pairwise Pearson correlation analysis using the aviation
pilots’ data, but none of the variables signiﬁcantly correlates to experience. This
preliminary test conﬁrms that the proposed battery can be a suitable measure
for identifying candidate pilots, since it is not inﬂuenced by the ﬂight experience.
As further study, the linear discriminant analysis was applied to classify the
pilots against the controls. Table 4 reports the classiﬁcation matrix, showing a very
good discrimination between the two groups (92% overall), along with the cross-

validation with the leave-one-out procedure, which conﬁrmed the good predictive
capability of the tests battery (83% overall).
For further analysis, we applied the forward stepwise procedure to identify the
core subset of variables and the discriminant model is reported in Table 5, which
also reports the standardized canonical discriminant function coefﬁcients. The
subset was obtained after a forward stepwise procedure that used the Wilks’
lambda as criterion used for controlling the stepwise entry of variables: at each
step, the variable that minimizes the overall Wilks’ lambda is entered until no fur-
ther minimization is possible. The Wilks’ lambda criterion is a measure of group
discrimination.
From Table 5 we can note that ﬁve out of seven variables are measures of errors
or omissions (i.e. low), which underline how accuracy of the answers can be more
important than a faster reaction time for aviation pilots. A greater importance for
the peripheral focus can be derived by the presence of 1B errors instead of 1A. In

light of this result, divided attention does not seem to be effective to discriminate
pilots from common people. Therefore, the ﬁnal model does not include any vari-
able of the test no. 5.
4. Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a battery of seven tests speciﬁcally designed for the
assessment of the attention factors of aviation pilots. The battery was imple-
mented in a computer software and validated by an experimental trial with 50
experienced aviation pilots and 50 untrained people as controls. t-test analysis
showed the potential of all the tests in the battery to distinguish between untrained
normal people and experienced aviation pilots, while discriminant analysis con-
ﬁrmed the validity of the battery as an instrument that can effectively measure
all the distinctive attention factors that characterize aviation pilots. Finally, the
stepwise discriminant analysis identiﬁed several attention factors that can be used
to assist the selection of candidate aviation pilots and to focus their training.
In practice, the software presented in our paper allows setting a benchmark for
one of the distinctive cognitive functions of aviation pilots. Candidate pilots can
be assessed against this benchmark and the results, along with other psycho-
attitudinal tests, can be used to select the most promising candidate pilots. The
results prove that our battery of tests addressed all the distinctive attention factors
of the aviation pilots as they are signiﬁcantly different than controls and they are
enough to efﬁciently discriminate between the two groups. Furthermore, the soft-
ware derives an attention proﬁle of the candidate that can be used to train those
factors that are not fully developed at the level of the aviation pilot. Indeed, the
computer software presented here is currently used in the evaluation of candidate
pilots in several ﬂight schools where it is integrated with standard selection proto-
cols and it is employed to develop personal training programs.
Further development will focus on the deﬁnition of a battery of tests that can be
integrated with onboard instrumentation (e.g. with augmented cognition systems
like the one proposed by Di Nuovo et al. [6,7]), in order to quickly evaluate the
current attention level before the start of a ﬂight duty, and to assure that a

future work will study the application of the battery presented here in similar con-
