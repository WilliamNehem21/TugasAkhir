Text-images still have a great importance, despite the spread of electronic texts. Text-images are
protected using digital watermarking. This paper proposes a watermarking method applied to text-
images. This method integrates two transforms: integer wavelet transform (IWT) and discrete cosine
transform (DCT). For the watermark embedding, IWT is performed on the cover image and DCT is applied
to the low frequency sub-band LL. The watermark image is inserted in the lower to medium DCT coefﬁ-
cients to achieve a high degree of robustness and imperceptibility. Experiments using different Arabic
text-images are performed to evaluate the proposed method in terms of imperceptibility and robustness.
Results show that the proposed method has higher imperceptibility compared to other existing methods
applied to Arabic text-images. Also, the proposed method provides good robustness results, especially
against compression and noise.

1. Introduction
With the rapid development of electronic communication tech-
nologies, it has become easy to access and share information, and
as a result, online piracy has spread. Textual information is the
most widely used in comparison to images, audio and video. It rep-
resents the easiest way to translate speech. It is the main compo-
nent of publications and contributes greatly to the educational
process. Text-images are no less important than electronic text.
They are still in use in ofﬁcial transactions and some authors pub-
lish their books as a text-image. However, text-images face some
issues related to the protection of intellectual rights and unautho-
rized use. Watermarking technology is used to solve these issues.
Using digital watermarking technology depends on stashing
data in a digital media. The media may be an image, text, video
or audio. The stashed data called a watermark, the watermark
describes the information regarding the owner of the digital media.
The watermarking method may be visible like logos or invisible. In
invisible watermarking, the watermark is embedded or stashed in
the cover media in a way that the human eyes cannot noticed the
embedded watermark [1]. Two basic stages of any watermarking
method: embedding and extraction processes. The basic water-
marking requirements are robustness, imperceptibility, security
and capacity [2]. The watermarking method which is resistant
against attacks is called a robust method. Otherwise, it is called a
fragile method. Imperceptibility means that the watermark does
not affect the value of the media or causes distortion. The water-
marked media must look like the cover or original media. Security
includes keeping the watermark, embedding and extraction pro-
cesses secure. Capacity is the amount of embedded data compared
to the cover media.
Text-image watermarking has many challenges and difﬁculties.
The text-image has a little information redundancy for watermark
embedding compared to general images. Normal or general images
contain a lot of details that can be exploited for watermark inser-
tion without notice by the human eye. However, text images have
a difference or contrast between the background and the typed
text. Simple changes in a text-image can be noticed because it
has a clear separation between foreground and background [3].

Text-image watermarking methods are classiﬁed based on the
domain into spatial and transform methods [4]. Spatial domain
methods add watermark bits by directly changing the pixels values
in the image while watermarking methods based on transform
modify the coefﬁcients of the transform. Currently, text-image
watermarking based on the spatial domain are not resistant
enough to lossy image compression and other image processing
operations [5,6]. Some of these methods require high complexity
or font size/style dependency. Recently, watermarking text image
is done in transform domain because of its huge robustness com-
pared to spatial domain methods. Not all methods applied to the
general images could be performed on the text-images. The text-
image needs a watermarking method which satisﬁes the impercep-
tibility requirement and balanced with the robustness at the same
time. The problem is how to embed watermark bits into the text-
image without noticeable degradation and satisfy high robustness
against possible attacks.
In this paper, a text-image watermarking method is proposed in
the frequency domain with the contribution of using the combina-
tion of two transforms IWT and DCT. Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT)
watermarking
methods
provide
high
imperceptibility
because DWT transform is compatible with the Human Visual Sys-
tem (HVS) [6]. It means that the human eye is less sensitive to
changes in the image (the inserted watermark). Integer wavelet
transform (IWT) watermarking can exploit the characteristics of
DWT with more advantages. IWT is much faster because it deals
only with integers. The image can be reconstructed without any
loss using IWT and can be stored without rounding off the errors
[7]. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) watermarking methods are
more robust than spatial domain watermarking methods [5]. DCT
watermarking methods have high robustness against compression
and image processing. Also, it is a fast transform. So, the using of
IWT and DCT is suitable for text-image watermarking. This combi-
nation is used to achieve acceptable results of robustness and
imperceptibility.
The embedding is done in the lower frequency coefﬁcients to
increase the robustness. The LL sub-band (low frequency sub-
band) is selected after applying IWT which has the lower frequen-
cies. The lower to medium coefﬁcients are taken after applying
DCT. In the experiments, four different numbers of coefﬁcients
are tested to ﬁnd the relationship between the number of coefﬁ-
cients and imperceptibility and robustness.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses
the related methods towards text-image watermarking. Section 3
presents an overview of the used transforms in the proposed
watermarking method. The proposed method is discussed in Sec-
tion 4 with its embedding and extraction processes. Section 5 pre-
sents the experimental setup. Section 6 reports the experimental
results in terms of imperceptibility and robustness. Section 7 con-
cludes the paper and highlights the future work.
2. Related work
In this section, watermarking methods which performed on
text-image will be discussed and compared. Text-image water-
marking methods in the spatial domain are presented ﬁrst, then
watermarking methods which are performed in the transform
domain.
2.1. Spatial domain text-image watermarking
Yang and Kot [8] proposed a blind watermarking method in the
Latin text-image by integrating spaces between characters and
word space. The watermark is embedded by shifting the character
into right or left to denote ‘‘0” or ‘‘1” using overlapping window.
This window takes three characters each time along the line. The
word space is the inter character space which is larger than the
maximum space between two characters. This method achieved
a high degree of transparency and improved the capacity com-
pared to line shifting and word shifting. However, it is not robust
against image attacks.
The researchers in Ref. [9] proposed a watermarking method by
modifying the spaces between words in the text line. They founded
that the average word spaces of multiple lines in the text-image
represent a sine wave. The frequency, phase and amplitude of
the sine waves used to encode the watermarking signal. The water-
marking method is implemented in both blind and non-blind algo-
rithms. This method suffers from low coding capacity.
A new word shifting method based on word classiﬁcation was
developed in Ref. [10]. The words are classiﬁed depending on its
width. A group of adjacent words composes a segment, the seg-
ments are classiﬁed based on word class information within each
segment. The words are shifted left or right to encode the water-
mark data. This method has higher imperceptibly than traditional
word shifting, since it shifts a small amount using the statistics.
However, it consumes more time for calculations.
Yang et al. [11] developed a blind watermarking method in bin-
ary text-images by ﬂipping pixels. The binary image is divided into
blocks of size 5 � 5. The overlapping window of size 3 � 3 is used
to determine the ability of a pixel to ﬂip. This watermarking
method consumes the time very much and needs lots of calcula-
tions. The authors in Ref. [12] also used the ﬂipping of pixels to
watermark binary text-image. They ﬂip only the edge pixels of
the connected components. The watermark is embedded in the
outer boundary of a character using vertical and horizontal edges.
The visible distortion is less than in Ref. [11] but, it decreases the
capacity.
Kim and Oh [3] inserted the watermark in grayscale text-
images using edge direction histograms. They divide the image
into sub-blocks, the ﬁrst three blocks considered as mother blocks.
The watermarking is done in the remaining blocks. Each block is
used to encode one watermarking bit. The length of diagonal edge
directions is modiﬁed and then compared to the lengths in mother
blocks to extract the watermark. This algorithm is not robust
against binarization attack.
The principle of entropy is used in Ref. [13] to identify the suit-
able location of watermark embedding in the binary text-images.
The image is divided into sub-blocks and the entropy is calculated
for each block. Entropy variation is used to ﬁnd smaller font size
regions which have a higher occurrence in the document. The
watermark is embedded in these regions as ASCII values of a small
text. This method does not require anything else the watermarked
image in the extraction phase. However, it has a lot of calculations.
The researchers in Ref. [14] proposed a blind watermarking algo-
rithm in binary text-images based on entropy. They reduced the
complexity of the previous method [13] and enhance the imper-
ceptibility. Watermark data is embedded in the central pixels of
blocks having small fonts. Aslam and Alimgeer [15] developed a
new entropy-based watermarking method in grayscale text-
images. They ﬂipped the pixels which are in the small size regions.
Only the minimum pixel values are used after computing XOR of
the desired blocks. This method overcomes the previous similar
methods [13,14] in terms of capacity and imperceptibility.
Little text-image watermarking researches [16–18] are done on
Arabic and Persian images in the spatial domain. The authors in
[16] proposed a watermarking method by shifting the points which
are located above or under the Arabic/Persian letters. This method
has a high capacity since most of their letters have points. Davar-
zani and
Yaghmaie [17]
changed the
slope
of
the letters:
to encode bit ‘‘1” and remain them the same to encode
bit ‘‘0”. This method is easy to use and has higher capacity

compared to line or word shifting. Another characteristic of these
languages is the existence of curvaceous letters which is utilized
in
the
watermarking
process.
The
curvaceous
letters
for watermarking are used in Ref. [18]. The
researchers modiﬁed the curve of the letter with the baseline if
the watermark bit is ‘‘1” and nothing is changed in case of bit
‘‘0”. This method is robust against resizing the text-image.
These methods [16–18] share the drawback of they are not
robust to image attacks and require special font in the text-image.
2.2. Transform domain text-image watermarking
A zero-watermarking method for text-images based on DCT is
developed in Ref. [19]. The watermark is generated from the
text-image using the lower frequency coefﬁcient of each DCT block
and logistic mapping. Then, the watermark is registered as the
copyright of the text-image. This method provides very high
imperceptibility since nothing added actually to the original image.
However, the watermark is only generated from the original image
nor external image or text watermarks are used. It is robust against
compression and noise but weak against mean ﬁltering.
Li and Wu [20] developed a watermarking method in binary
text-images using both DWT and DFT. The feature vectors are
obtained from the original image by ﬁrstly applying one level
DWT then DFT to the lower frequency band of DWT. The sign of
lower DFT-DCT coefﬁcients to form the visual feature vector. The
authors combined the feature vectors with the watermark to gen-
erate the key. The key is used in watermark extraction and authen-
tication process. This method provides less robustness against
compression and rotation attacks. The authors use the same prin-
ciple, but instead of using DFT they use DCT in Ref. [21]. They found
the same results with the previous one.
A watermarking method for sensitive text-image based on DCT
is proposed in Ref. [22]. Linear interpolation of the watermark
image and the original image is used to generate the watermarked
image. This method uses a scaling parameter to specify the degree
of visibility of the watermark. It is robust against compression and
noise but weak against geometric attacks except rotation with 45.
The researchers in Ref. [23] proposed watermarking Technique
of sensitive text-images based on SVD. The original image is
decomposed into three components using SVD. The second compo-
nent is interpolated with the watermark image in the watermark
embedding process using linear interpolation. This method has
good robustness and security. However, the inverse of SVD can
result in information loss unlike to the inverse of DCT [22].
Tables 1 and 2 show a comparison of text-image watermarking
methods in spatial and frequency domains respectively. Spatial
methods are weak against most types of image attacks and
restricted to certain font styles or sizes and some of them require
complex calculations. While, transform methods showed immu-
nity against attacks, but they poorly applied to the text-images.
We propose a text-image watermarking in the transform
domain. The combination of IWT and DCT is used in the proposed
method. The embedding is done in the lower frequency coefﬁcients
to increase the robustness. The LL sub-band (low frequency sub-
band) is selected after applying IWT which has the lower frequen-
cies. The lower to medium coefﬁcients are taken after applying
DCT. Overview of IWT and DCT transforms is presented in
Section 3.

watermarking methods in transform domain are more robust than
methods in spatial domain. They are also compatible with human
visual system (HVS) [24].
Discrete cosine transform (DCT), and integer wavelet transform
(IWT) are the used transforms in the proposed method. They are
explained in the following subsections.
3.1. Discrete cosine transform (DCT)
DCT is a mathematical transform which converts the function
from time domain into the frequency domain. It results with many
coefﬁcients: single direct current (DC) and a set of alternating cur-
rents (AC). Fig. 1 shows the DCT matrix bands in 8 * 8 block. Low fre-
quency coefﬁcients located in the upper left corner of DCT matrix.
The coefﬁcients in the middle are medium frequency coefﬁ-
cients. The coefﬁcients in the lower right corner are high frequency
coefﬁcients [25].

F(0,0) is the DC coefﬁcient, which involves the most energy of
the image. The high frequency coefﬁcients represent the edge and
detailed information of the image. The details are increased by
moving to the bottom right [26]. Low frequency coefﬁcients are
modiﬁed in robust watermarking method, while in imperceptible
watermarking method the high frequency coefﬁcients are changed.
DCT is widely used in digital image watermarking because it is
compatible with JPEG compression and its output is real matrix.
3.2. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT)
DWT is a mathematical analytical method used to address sig-
nals for many applications. It captures both spatial and frequency
image information. DWT is used widely in image watermarking
and compression since it provides a good visual image.
DWT decompose the image into one low frequency sub band
(LL) and three high frequency sub bands (LH, HL, and HH). LL con-
tains the most image information and this band is closer to the
original image. LH represent the horizontal details, HL represents
the vertical details and HH represents the diagonal details of the
image. The image is reconstructed from these sub bands using
inverse DWT. The image also could be decomposed more than
one time, LL decomposed into four sub band and so on [27].
The outputs of DWT are ﬂoating point coefﬁcients. The round-
ing error of the coefﬁcients may lead to data loss. Also, dealing with
ﬂoating point numbers in the watermark embedding and extrac-
tion requires high computations. Integer wavelet transform (IWT)
maps the original image into integer coefﬁcients. It is implemented
by modifying DWT using lifting scheme proposed by Sweldens
[28]. It is faster, easier to invert and does not require auxiliary
memory compared to DWT. Fig. 2 shows the difference between
DWT and IWT applied to text-image.
4. The proposed IWT-DCT based method
The goal of this research work is to ﬁnd a watermarking method
for text-images using transforms. Watermarking using DCT pro-
vides high robustness against compression, especially JPEG. DWT
watermarking has good imperceptibility, reconstruction and more
compatible with HVS. IWT overcomes DWT, while it is faster and
has no rounding errors (dealing only with integers).
4.1. Embedding process
The cover image is decomposed into four sub-bands: LL, LH, HL
and HH after applying IWT. The LL image is very close to the cover
image which means that it contains the most energy and other
bands contain the details. This is the ﬁrst step to develop a robust
watermarking method. Then DCT is applied to the LL sub-band and
again taking the lowest coefﬁcients. The numbers of the chosen
coefﬁcients in each DCT block are: 9, 16, 25 and 36. In the proposed
IWT-DCT-9, the ﬁrst 9 pixels in the watermark image are embed-
ded in the 9 DCT coefﬁcients (the ﬁrst coefﬁcient (DC) does not
change) in the ﬁrst block. The second 9 pixels in the watermark
image are embedded in the 9 DCT coefﬁcients (the ﬁrst coefﬁcient
(DC) does not change) in the second block, and so on until the last
DCT block in the LL sub-band. The proposed IWT-DCT-16, proposed
IWT-DCT-25 and proposed IWT-DCT-36 follow the same procedure
with changing the number of the chosen DCT coefﬁcients. Fig. 3
shows the block diagram of the embedding process for the pro-
posed IWT-DCT method.
The embedding process follows the following steps:

4.2. Extraction process
The proposed IWT-DCT based method is a non-blind method
because it needs the cover image in the extraction process. The
extraction process includes IWT decomposition of the water-
marked and cover images. Then, taking each LL sub-band of both.
The DCT is applied and determine the number of coefﬁcients as
in the embedding process. Finally, inverse the equation to extract
the watermark image. Fig. 4 illustrates the block diagram of the
extraction process for the proposed IWT-DCT method.
The extraction process follows the following steps:

The embedding and extraction processes of the proposed
method are simple. IWT is applied to the cover image. Then, DCT
is performed to the LL sub-band. The watermark image is embed-
ded in the low to medium DCT coefﬁcients. Inverse DCT followed
by Inverse IWT to get the watermarked image.
For the extraction process, IWT is applied to the cover and
watermarked images. Then, DCT is performed to the LL sub-band
of both the cover and watermarked images. The watermark image
is extracted by comparing the DCT coefﬁcients from the cover and
watermarked images.
5. Experimental setup
5.1. Studied images
The proposed IWT-DCT method has been implemented using
Matlab (R2015a), Fig. 5 shows the GUI for our implementation. Five
Arabic text-images with size of 512 � 512 are used as a cover
image and the logo of KAU is used as a watermark image with dif-
ferent four sizes: 96 � 96, 128 � 128, 160 � 160 and 192 � 192.
Using a logo as a watermark image has a good advantage where
the extracted image can be correlated with the embedded one by
a human observer [29]. Both of cover and watermark images are
grayscale. These images are shown in Fig. 6. The value of alpha is
set to 0.9 in the embedding and extraction processes.
5.2. Evaluation metrics
Experiments were performed to evaluate the proposed method
in terms of imperceptibility and robustness. Some criteria are used
to analyze the effect of embedding the watermark image in the
cover image and to measure how much the watermarked image
is resistant against attacks. These criteria are called image quality
metrics. The most important criteria are Mean Squared Error
(MSE) [30], Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) [31], Universal Qual-
ity Index (UQI) [32], Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) [33] and
Normalized cross-correlation (NC) [34]. They are described with
their equations in Table 3.
6. Experimental results
6.1. Imperceptibility evaluation results
The embedding process applies to different ﬁve text-images
which are shown in Fig. 6. The watermarked images preserve good
visible quality as shown in Fig. 6. There is no visual distortion in
the watermarked images. Table 4 shows the imperceptibility
results of the proposed IWT-DCT method with a different number
of the used bits. The greater number of the hidden bits, the less
transparency,
but
with
very
few
differences.

IWT-DCT-9 is higher than IWT-SCT-36 because less coefﬁcients are
modiﬁed.
The imperceptibility of the proposed IWT-DCT method is about
58 dB as shown in Table 4 which is a high PSNR value. Fig. 6 shows
the cover and watermarked images using the ﬁve text-images
when the number of the taken coefﬁcients is equal to 9. It is shown
that no visual difference between the cover and watermarked
images. Table 5 compares the imperceptibility results of the pro-
posed IWT-DCT method with other methods: IWT–SVD [34],
IWT–SVD [35], DCT-DWT [36], DWT-DCT [37], DCT-SVD [38] and
IWT-DCT [39]. The averages of PSNR results of the ﬁve text-
images are used in the comparison. IWT–SVD [34] used the combi-
nation of IWT and SVD. IWT is performed on the original image,

then SVD is applied in all sub-bands. The watermark image is
embedded by modifying the singular values of LL, LH, HL, HH.
IWT–SVD [35] also used IWT and SVD in addition to digital signa-
ture. DCT-DWT [36] applied DCT to the watermark image, then
embedded it in the smooth sub-block of the high frequency DWT
sub-band. The smoother sub-block is a sub-block which has a small
value of entropy. DWT-DCT [37] decomposed the original image
four level DWT followed by DCT. The watermark image is embed-
ded in the coefﬁcients of HL14 and LH24 sub-bands of DWT. DCT-
SVD [38] performed DCT to the original image then applied SVD.
The watermark is embedded in the middle DCT coefﬁcients. In
IWT-DCT [39], HH sub-bands of three levels of IWT are selected
for embedding a binary image of size 32 � 32 into a cover image
of size 512 � 512. Integer cosine transform at 8x8 block level is
performed on all selected HH3 sub-bands. The watermark bits
are inserted by swapping speciﬁc DCT coefﬁcients.
IWT watermarking has high imperceptibility as we see in IWT–
SVD [34] from Table 5. DCT-DWT [36] also has high imperceptibil-
ity due to use of entropy to determine the suitable sub-block of
DWT sub-band. Using multi-level IWT or DWT in DWT-DCT [37]
and IWT-DCT [39] provides lower imperceptibility results com-
pared to other methods as shown in Table 5. Also, these methods
have higher complexity than the proposed IWT-DCT method
because of applying wavelet transform at multi-levels. It can be
seen from Table 5 that the combination of the two transforms
IWT-DCT in the proposed method gives the best results in terms
of imperceptibility than others, even of these methods are used
for watermarking general images not text-images.
6.2. Robustness evaluation results
Robustness is one of the most important ingredients of water-
marking. The robustness of the proposed method was tested
against many attacks using test-image-1 as shown in Tables 6
and 8. PSNR is used to measure the difference between original
watermark image and extracted one. Common attacks like his-
togram equalization, scaling (enlarge or reduce), rotation, ﬁltering,
noise and JPEG compression are used in the robustness test. The
robustness results of the proposed method with 9, 16, 25 and 36
DCT coefﬁcients are convergent.
In general, the biggest coefﬁcients used (9, 16, 25, 36) increased
the robustness. IWT-DCT-36 has the highest robustness in most
attacks except in compression, enlarge and noise, IWT-DCT-25
has the highest value. The averages of the ﬁve test-images are used
to compare the proposed method with other methods from the lit-
erature. Fig. 7 shows the averages PSNR values of the proposed

method robustness using the ﬁve test-images. Fig. 8 summarized
the results obtained after JPEG compression using several quality
factors using the ﬁve test-images. The proposed IWT-DCT method
shows good robustness results especially against compression and
noise, but weak robustness in case of rotation and histogram
equalization. Table 9 compares the proposed IWT-DCT method
with four text-image watermarking methods in the transform
domain: DWT-DFT [20], DCT [22], SVD [23] and DWT-DCT [21].
The proposed method overcomes DWT-DFT [20] and DWT-DCT
[21]. As known watermarking in DCT domain withstands compres-
sion attack. DCT [22] has a very good robustness against compres-
sion, but our proposed method improved the robustness against
noise. The proposed method compared to SVD [23] has a higher
robustness against compression and noise. But the main drawback
is in case of rotation attack.
The data from this section shows the contribution of the study
conducted. From Section 6.1 we found that the proposed IWT-DCT
method is an imperceptible watermarking method. The logo is still
detectable after most attacks as shown in Tables 6 and 8 from Sec-
tion 6.2 except in rotation and compression with small factors. So,
the proposed IWT-DCT method has achieved high imperceptibility
and robustness results.
7. Conclusion
In this paper, an invisible watermarking method for text-image
is proposed using the combination of integer wavelet transform
(IWT) and discrete cosine transform (DCT). This hybrid method
includes high robustness against most attacks from DCT and high
imperceptibility from IWT. The lower coefﬁcients from each trans-
form are used to increase the robustness while maintaining the
imperceptibility by choosing a good value for the scaling factor.
Four values are used to determine the suitable DCT coefﬁcients:
9, 16, 25 and 36. Their results are too close in imperceptibility
and robustness, but differ in capacity. The more coefﬁcients used
the more capacity. The proposed IWT-DCT method overcomes
other methods from literature against most attacks especially
noise attack. It has higher imperceptibility compared to other
watermarking methods. However, it has low PSNR values when
testing its robustness against rotation and histogram equalization.
In the proposed IWT-DCT method, the gray scale watermark
image is embedded as it is. As a future work, Binary watermark
image can be used and scrambled before the embedding to ensure
the security. The proposed IWT-DCT method are used in water-
marking Arabic text-image and can be extended for colored
images. In the proposed IWT-DCT method, LL sub-band is selected
with the lower DCT coefﬁcients, other bands: HL, LH and HH can be
used with the lower DCT coefﬁcients.
