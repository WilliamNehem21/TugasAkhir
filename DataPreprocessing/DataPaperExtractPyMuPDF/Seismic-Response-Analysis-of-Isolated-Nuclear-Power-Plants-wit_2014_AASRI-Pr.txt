Abstract 
In this paper, a new friction damper isolation system (FDIS) is suggested for isolated nuclear power plants (NPPs). 
Seismic responses of NPPs are accomplished by means of the finite element approach and setting up a representative 
multi-particle model of NPPs. Results in terms of time domain analysis show that response of structure supported by FDIS 
under small seismic are correspond to fixed structure, and perform similar properties as conventional isolated structure 
under large seismic. The yield force of friction damper is one of the important parameters which are related to responses 
and absorbing energy under seismic input energy in new isolated structures. Compared with cases of different yield level, 
responses of superstructures increase respectively with yield force, while displacements of isolation layer decrease 
effectively. The proposed new isolation system could be beneficial in enhancing the seismic safety of isolated NPPs.

10,000 applications protect not only civil buildings but also bridges and industrial constructions [2]. Isolation 
technology aims mainly at separating superstructure from the supporting ground, in order to reduce the 
transmission of the seismic motion to the superstructure. It can shift the fundamental frequency of a structure 
away from the dominant frequencies of earthquake ground motion, and also provide additional damping to 
dissipate seismic energy. A lot of test programs and simulation researches of isolation system and bearings to 
demonstrate their feasibility and effectiveness have been carried out. 
As a kind of critical industrial buildings, any damage of Nuclear power plants structures will lead to severe 
disasters. Different from conventional NPPs design, seismic isolation is considered to be the most promising 
technology to protect nuclear reactors from violent earthquake. Several studies performed in Japan have 
shown that it would not be possible to design large plants which are economical in areas of high seismicity 
without incorporating seismic isolation [3]. In spite of this, only two of nuclear power plants in commercial 
operation are protected by isolation until now: 4 PWRs (Pressurized Water Reactors) at Cruas in France and 2 
PWRs at Koeberg in South Africa [2].  
Interest in seismic isolation has increased significantly in recent years. Researches and developments of 
isolation in nuclear structures are being carried out by major construction companies, several universities and 
government agencies. In isolated NPPs, the design and qualification of equipment and their supports become 
a simpler task than before and the impact of seismic design on preferred equipment layouts is minimized. 
Since the response of isolated NPPs is highly predictable, the risk of accidents due to uncertainties in the 
ground motions is reduced and inner equipments protection is enhanced [4]. Additionally, standardized design 
of NPPs with isolation system could be approached easier than before. 
Although, significant relative movements under small seismic between the isolated superstructure and 
ground can easily destroy the crucial service networks and pipelines crossing isolation layer. It is an important 
problem limit the usage of seismic isolation into nuclear power plant. In this paper, the friction damper 
isolation system (FDIS) is suggested in reducing seismic response of superstructure. A representative multi-
particle model of nuclear power plant is introduced to study effects of the FDIS in reducing seismic response. 
2. Friction Damper isolation system 
The friction damper isolation system is composed of friction damper and normal rubber bearing. Different 
from normal isolation system, superstructures supported by FDIS under small seismic are kept rigid 
connection as fixed by the friction damper with high yield force and large initial stiffness. In this case, the 
networks and pipelines work well under small seismic. With increase of loading level, friction damper start 
slide while the horizontal shear force of isolation layer reaches design yield force under violent seismic, and 
then dissipate earthquake energy. While friction damper sliding, the FDIS works as normal isolation system 
and seismic response of superstructure is reduced effectively. In this case, destroy of pipelines crossing 
isolation layer has become insignificant damage with the crucial nuclear reactor is protected by isolation 
system. The FDIS overcomes the limit of normal isolation system, and keeps superstructure rigid connection 
with ground under design earthquake, which prevents the damage of crucial pipelines caused by large 
isolation layer displacement under small seismic.  
For the superstructure supported by this friction damper isolation system under earthquake excitation xg(t),
the governing equations of motion can be written as�

where F and Qd are earthquake shear force and design yield force of FDIS. 
Under small earthquake, shear force F<Qd and �=0, the superstructure keeps rigid connected to ground. In 
this case, governing equation of isolated structure supported by FDIS is same as the fixed one, and can be 
expressed by Eq.1. With beyond design earthquakes input, friction damper starts slide for shear force F�Qd
and starts to dissipate earthquake energy, in which governing equation should be written by Eq.1 and Eq.2.  
3.  Nuclear power plant analysis model 
Fig.1 (a) presents the multi-particle model of a standardized Pressurized Water Reactor plant analyzed in 
this study. The model is composed of two sticks: the external containment structure and the internal structures. 
The two sticks are structurally independent and connected only at the base. Each model is composed of 
several rigid masses supported by link elements representing NPPs, which parameters are from Ref [5]. 
Seismic responses of isolated NPPs are investigated using this multi-particle model supported by FDIS. In this 
paper, SAP2000 Nonlinear is used to analysis seismic history responses of fixed and isolated NPPs.

Fig1. Analysis model: (a) Fixed and isolated models of NPPs; (b) Simplify model of friction damper isolation system (FDIS) 
Friction damper isolation system in this analysis is composed of 180 normal rubber bearings (GZP1000, 
which vertical stiffness Kv=4.649�106 kN/m and elastic stiffness is 1.815�106 kN/m) and equal amounts 
friction dampers, its force-displacement characteristics for assembled FDIS provide an additional means of 
energy dissipation as shown in Fig.1 (b). Normal rubber bearing is modeled as linear elastic component in this 
analysis. For the friction damper, its first-slope stiffness K1 is shown in Table 2 and second-slope (post-yield) 
stiffness K2=0. The force-displacement characteristics for FDIS is a bilinear hysteretic model, which first-
slope stiffness equal to K1+ Kh can provide essential rigid connection while shear force F is less than Qd.
To study a wide range of friction damper isolation system properties, three models were prepared with 
yield force Qd equal to 3%, 6% and 12% of the supported total weight W (as shown in Table 1). Seismic 
responses of fixed NPPs (named as UNISO) are also analyzed to compare with isolated NPPs.

4. Seismic response analysis  
4.1 Ground motions. 
According to the Chinese Code for Seismic Design of nuclear power plants (GB 50267-97) [6], seven 
artificial earthquake waves are proposed based on standard response spectrum. Seven artificial waves are 
named from ART1 to ART7, and well-fitting of them with standard response spectrums are shown in Fig.2.

Fig.2 Artificial and standard response spectrums 
In the code mentioned above, Operating Basis Earthquake (OBE) and Safe Shutdown Earthquake (SSE) 
are always required in NPPs seismic response analysis, and  the maximum acceleration of SSE is no less than 
0.15g. To study seismic responses of isolated models, earthquake simulations are performed at four intensity 
loading levels (acceleration amplitude is 0.05g, 0.10g, 0.20g, and 0.40g). 
4.2 Acceleration analysis results.  
Fig. 3 presents the average peak accelerations of node 8 and 12, which are the top of nuclear containment 
and internal structures, respectively. It’s obviously that acceleration responses increase gradually with Qd/W 
ratio of 3%, 6% and 12%. Also, acceleration responses of each case rise with increase of input seismic level, 
and the response of fixed NPPs is much larger than others’. Under 0.05g earthquake, average peak 
acceleration values of case 3%, 6% and 12% are only 14.0%, 22.4% and 37.0% of fixed case response. For 
0.40g earthquake input, the ratios change to 6.5%, 8.0% and 14.5% respectively. The same trend can be seen 
from the response comparison in Fig.3 (b).

seismic input; (a) 0.40g seismic input; 
Fig. 4 shows the average story accelerations of four cases under different earthquake levels. With 0.05g 
earthquake input, isolation displacement of case 12% is less than 5mm, and friction damper is still rigid. In 
such condition, peak accelerations of node 1, 2 and 3 are equal to the value of case UNISO. With increase of 
yield force from 80 to 320kN, ground motion imposed to superstructure arises correspondingly, and response 
of it is closer to fixed one. Friction damper slides under 0.40g sever earthquake input and dissipate earthquake 
energy. Fig. 4(d) presents the excellent isolation effects of FDIS for both containment and inner structures.

Acceleration responses reduce to 53% and 44.5% of input value, and the isolation effects are extraordinary.

In the acceleration analysis above, with the friction damper keeps rigid, response of superstructure enlarger 
than small earthquake input value, and the vibration characteristic is similar to fixed structure. Under violent 
earthquake, friction damper slides during earthquake waves input, and the vibration characteristics of 
structure supported by FDIS are similar to normal isolated structure.  
4.3 Isolation displacement analysis results.  
The average isolation displacements under seven artificial waves are shown in Table 2. It is observed that 
the displacement is decreasing with increase of yield force. In the case 12%, friction damper isolation system 
keeps rigid under 0.05g earthquake input, while isolation layer displacement is less than 5mm (the yield 
displacement of friction damper). With the increase of input earthquake, friction damper slides and isolation 
layer displacement arises correspondingly. The maximum displacement is 99.91mm of case 3% under 0.40g 
earthquake input, which is still far less than the value of normal isolation structure.  
5. Summary 
In this paper, a new friction damper isolation system for NPPs is proposed. This novel isolation system 
effectively reduce large isolation displacement, which limits the use of isolation technology in NPPs. Results 
from FEM analysis are used to verify the effectiveness of this system and investigate the influence of friction 
damper on seismic responses of isolated NPPs. Some conclusions of significance can be drawn as follows: 
1.
Under different loading levels, accelerations of superstructure increase with arise of yield force. With 
0.05g input, the vibration characteristics of superstructure with FDIS keeps rigid are close to fixed one.  
2.
The isolation layer displacement is well controlled by F. The maximum displacement value is, in 
general, decreasing with the increase in the yield force of FDIS. In case 12% with 0.05g earthquake input, 
isolation displacement is less than 5mm and the FDIS is still rigid. 
3.
Under different loading levels, friction dampers slide with the shear force of isolation layer reach the 
design yield force, and then become to dissipate input energy.
