58.75% and the NBP method is 76.25%.We can notice, from the results, that the NBP method is better than 
the classical LBP method.Because in fact, the neighborhood of the central pixel is thresholded by its value 
using the LBP method.So, LBP get the relationship between each neighbor and the central pixel.However, the 
NBP method describes each pixel by the relationship of its neighborhoods.Experimental results demonstrate 
that it is more interesting to capture the relative pertinent information between the neighbors.Thus, the results 
have shown the robustness and the efficiency of the proposed NBP method. 
4. Conclusion 
In this paper, we have proposed a new IRS system. This system used a new feature extraction method NBP. 
The NBP method extracts the relative connection between neighbors of pixels. Each neighbor of each pixel is 
thresholded by the next neighbor and encoded.After that, the NBP image is decomposed into several blocks. 
The mean of each block is calculated. Then, the variations of the meanare encoded. The resulted binary matrix 
is used as a feature descriptor of the iris. In the experimentation, the CASIA iris database is used. Good 
performance has been obtained for the proposed IRS. We can summarize that the proposed NBP method is 
interesting since it gets the relative relevant information between the neighbors of pixels.In future works, we 
will study the combination of the NBP method with other approaches like Gabor transform.
