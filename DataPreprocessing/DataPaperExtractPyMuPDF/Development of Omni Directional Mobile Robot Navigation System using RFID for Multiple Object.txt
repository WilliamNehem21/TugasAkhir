destinations. Both Omni robot and RFID system must be integrated to each other in the way of controlling the 
whole system. Omni robot is concerned due to its capability of mechanical manipulator and is capable of 
tethered and autonomous operation. It also focuses on RFID system which relies on navigation module using 
customized features of RFID technology. RFID system consists of tags, reader with antenna, and software. 
When an RFID reader scans the tag, a pulse of radio energy is sent out and the tag sends back the inventory 
control number. 
The objectives of this paper are; 
 
To design and develop Omni directional mobile robot that can move in indoor environment. 
 
To perform navigation by allocating identification tag at certain located area. 
 
To develop an efficient algorithm in providing better solution during navigation and to go particular 
target. 
 
2. Methodology 
 
Following is the desired algorithm of mobile robot navigation system to navigate desired location of RFID 
tag by identifying the angle between the tags and the reader which is mounted on the mobile robot.Navigation 
elaborates the desired algorithm of mobile robot navigation system to navigate location of RFID tag by 
identifying the angle between the tags and the reader which is mounted on the mobile robot.  
Initially, the robot is pre-programmed with an order list of tag numbers in defining the position of the tag 
whereas the current target angle is determined by calculating current goal location. When the known ID is 
achieved, the target transponder is detected through the signal backscattered from all the tags within the 
communication range. The calculation after input received by the two antennas is recorded and computed 
using; 
  
 
(1) 
The mobile robot is then updating its headed by turn right and left and checked whether the angle between 
calculated and compass is reached. If not, it will turn until it found the correct angle. If yes, mobile robot is 
moving forward and detected more points. Mobile robot is then identifying current tag whether it is goal or 
not. If goal, it will stop. If not it will calculate current to goal angle and compare through continuous loop 
until it find the goal. 
 
3. Omni Robot 
 
The Omni directional mechanismhave three axis and angle (x,y, ) movement abruptly in a two 
dimensional space, which ease to increase robot mobility and more keen access to limited spaces compared 
withconventional two wheel driven robot [1]. Yukawa et al. further explained that Omni-directional 
mechanism in the robot consists of four wheel units with a driving mechanism and a steering wheel 
mechanism. Since the four wheel units drive and steer independently, the position and direction of the mobile 
robot can be controlled with a high degree of accuracy [2]. Omni robot is becoming technically demanding for 
users in industrial and business sectors Figure 1. Many Omni robot navigation system products are appearing 
within medium and long term propositions that lead to development of variety technology advancement in the 
future. The most common and popular navigation techniques suggested in the state of the art generally fall 
under one of the following categories: dead-reckoning based, landmark-based, vision based, and behaviour 
technique based [3].

A. Navigation 
The fundamental requirement for mobile robot through navigation is to estimate the position of the 
autonomous mobile robot. In earlier research, there are several methods used to estimating the robot position 
for example path planning, trajectory planning, algorithmic exploration and path execution with self-
localization. The goal of autonomous robot navigation is built for a system in which dynamically guide and 
control the mobile robot from its start positions to a predefined end position. According to the previous 
research, it is state that the robot successfully done their task if the robot can efficiently interpret the data from 
the sensor [4].  The first method used in previous research is self-localization. This method used the passive 
RFID tag where placed on the floor. The advantages of this method is that there does not required any 
information regarding the RFID tag except their ID number. Besides that, this method is used without need 
for the robot to stop temporarily to observe the RFID tag [5]. 
In addition, it is required to calculate the distance between the robot and the wall at the time robot passes 
the specific area to smoothly organize the movement of the robot. Other than that, by using the trajectory 
planning and path planning, we can estimate the position of the mobile robot. The differences between this 
method is that the presence of moving and avoiding the obstacle. The path planning used common approach 
by performing the specific algorithm to determine the shortest path. While for the trajectory planning in the 
presence of obstacle and find out the path and motion along the path. Furthermore, effective approach can be 
used by combining the dead reckoning and external sensing by using the metric model. By using the odometry, 
the approximate current pose can be obtaining but maintain the pose estimate [4].

Omni Directional robot locality is identical by 3-coordinates: position (x, y) and robot direction angle  in 
an absolute frame. Therobot can mimic the waywhich [5-8] acquired from the current posture (x, y, ) in 
analignment space. Figure 2 shows an active driving two-wheeled robotwhereC is the centre ofmotion of the 
robot. The platformscentre of gravity of is at the origin (o), and (Vx, Vy)represents linear speed or tangential 
velocity, and w is the angular velocity. Here,r is the radius of the wheels, and D for azimuth length between 
the wheels [9]. Robot linear speed is defined by the absolute velocity (Vx, Vy) (Cartesian)in the platform

coordinate system at the origin (o), and w for the angular velocity [9-11]. Theta ( ) denotesthe heading angle 
of the turn in radians. The system is represented in (x, y) coordinate (and orientation) varying with respect to 
time. At any instant, the x the y coordinates of the robot’s centre point are changing based on its speed and 
orientation. While the time varying states, the physical laws governs the behaviour of the mobile robot but the 
system is time invariant.

Where:

wheels,

velocity of the robot. The control inputs = (

) and our control outputs = (X, Y, ). Therefore, desired 
trajectory is X (t), Y (t),  (t).However, it is difficult to study 3rd order and nonlinearsystem. Some nonlinear 
equations can be approximated by linear equations under certain conditions. Most of the system behaves like 
a linear system has a trajectory called the nominal trajectory. In this case chosen conditions for the system 
behaviour and modelled a linear system are followed.

4 Result 
 
Data from in table 1 are collected to check whether the tag is detected fast or not. This experiment is 
aimed to verify the counting number of passive tag that can be detected in 5.3 sec at a distance of 1cm.This 
passive tag can be detected at the range of 150mm.Each trial is tested to check detected tag during navigation. 
Each trial in figure 4 summarizes the path taken by mobile robot to reach its target.For trial 1 and 2, only five 
tag is detected, while trial 3, 4, and 6, six tag is detected and both trial 4 and 5, seven tag is detected. This 
experiment results in random decision path which will be taken by each trial.

applied in real situation. In addition, the position of the mobile robot is determined based on information 
provided by the tag and the orientation information by the compass while the angle between the robot’s 
current direction and the target tag is used to provide action to the actuators.Intelligent controller might be 
applied to the system to reduce an error. Moreover, suitable sensor such as ultrasonic sensor might be used to 
avoid obstacles in indoor environment.
