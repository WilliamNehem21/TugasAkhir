The purpose of this study was to assess if Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) could be used in the Capital Asset Pricing
Model (CAPM) and whether the use of AI could bring a more accurate estimation of expected returns. Cost of
capital deﬁnes the minimum return expected from any investment made by a ﬁrm. Hence for managers to
maximise the value of the corporation, it is essential to have an accurate estimation of the cost of capital.
For the purpose of analysing securities, the adjusted closing stock prices of 10 high-tech public companies were
studied from January 2013 to January 2019. This research assumed that there is a need to predict returns for the
next year. Hence one year of historical data was used to calculate traditional CAPM value and also train the
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to predict stock prices of the upcoming year. A generic deep learning network
architecture was developed with the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and dropout layers. After calculating
the returns using traditional and AI approaches, two methods for calculation of CAPM were proposed and
compared.
Following the analysis, it was found that the use of AI improved the accuracy of cost of equity estimations by
over 60%. The strong ability of the selected deep learning neural network to predict stock prices, increased the
accuracy of estimating returns by at least 18%. This study concluded that AI has signiﬁcant potentials to replace
traditional asset pricing models in the near future.
1. Introduction
1.1. Cost of Capital
Corporate investment decisions are made based on two rationals;
maximising proﬁt and/or maximising market value. For clariﬁcation,
proﬁt maximisation rationale implies that an asset should only be ac-
quired if it increases shareholders’ net proﬁt [1]. This happens when the
expected rate of return exceeds the interest rate. On the other hand,
market value maximisation rationale claims that an asset should only be
acquired if it has a positive effect on shareholders’ equity which means
the cost of acquiring should be less than the value it adds to the market
value of the corporation [2]. Hence to be able to make the best invest-
ment decisions, the calculation of the cost of capital becomes essential.
Capital structure is deﬁned as the sources of funds to ﬁnance growth
and operations [3]. The sum of the debt and equity, which forms the
capital structure bears a cost to the ﬁrm and is deﬁned as the cost of
capital. All investments made by the ﬁrm should be higher than the cost
of capital to satisfy shareholders. Moreover, managers should try to
maintain an optimum rate for the cost of capital that balances beneﬁts
and costs and maximises proﬁts and value of the ﬁrm [4]. However
recent volatilities in the market, for instance, the ﬁnancial crises, has
made this decision challenging as estimating cost of equity capital
became more difﬁcult which inﬂuences the overall cost of capital [5].
The importance of accurate estimation of the cost of capital is high-
lighted in an example. In the early 1980s, the U.S. has started to lose
competitiveness against international competitors. A study conducted by
Poterba [6] demonstrated that U.S. companies had a much higher cost of
capital than, for instance, Japanese ﬁrms. As a result of this high rate, the
long-term decisions that were made by U.S. managers were very different
from Japanese managers and this helped the Japanese to gain competi-
tiveness. The article concluded that this was because the Japanese had a
low cost of debt which was combined with debt-equity ratios much
higher than the U.S. and resulted in an advantage [6]. This, however, has
changed, and today the cost of equity is the most critical playing factor in
the overall cost of capital as discussed in this section.
Some factors inﬂuence the accuracy of the cost of capital calculations.
One of these parameters is the risk-free rate of return which is deﬁned as
the return available on risk-free security. In U.S. analyst use yield to
maturity on government securities to estimate the cost of equity capital.

Since most investments made by a business have a long-term outcome,
the ﬁnancial analyst uses the average of yield to maturity of default-free
securities over many years (between 10 to 30 years in the U.S.) as the
benchmark of the risk-free rate [4]. Hence sudden drops and rises in
these securities can inﬂuence the cost of capital but using the average
value will eliminate the sensitivity to these critical ﬂuctuations. This was
particularly important in ﬁnancial crises that happened in 2008.
Another parameter to consider is the equity risk premium that is the
excess of a return over the risk-free rate which is obtained from the stock
market. This volatile value is dependent on the period under consider-
ation and many assumptions made to make it a rough estimation for use
in the calculation. The volatility of prices or risk associated with in-
vestments in securities resulted in the development of a parameter called
beta. The benchmark for the beta is the market value which is unstable at
any point in time. Beta is essentially showing the volatility of a com-
pany’s stock relative to the market for a deﬁned duration of time which
varies between analysts [7]. Similarly, simpliﬁcations had to be made to
estimate beta for use in asset pricing models which introduces further
errors in the cost of capital calculations [8].
Time and risk pose signiﬁcant challenges in the estimation of cost of
capital. Analyst simpliﬁed these calculations and used average values
over a more extended period for some critical parameters to assist with
estimation of cost of capital [9]. This study identiﬁed these simpliﬁca-
tions associated with time and risk in calculation of cost of equity as the
main problem and aims to explore more advanced techniques to enable
more accurate estimation of expected returns. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)
has gained tremendous momentum in various ﬁelds due to its ability to
ﬁnd intricate patterns and forecast future events more accurately [10].
Many scholars have introduced many different equations that help to
improve the estimation of returns [11–14] and the use of neural networks
in the ﬁnancial domain has been proven by others [15]. However, to the
authors’ knowledge, no one has used AI in the calculation of the cost of
capital to improve the accuracy of estimations.
1.2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is broadly deﬁned as an algorithm that is
capable of learning and thinking. Learning is deﬁned as the ability to
update coefﬁcients and parameters of an algorithm to enable it to
recognise the pattern between input and output data. AI Algorithm is
deﬁned in a variety of mathematical models, namely deep learning,
neural networks, image recognition, etc. [16]. Deep learning is a form of
machine learning that passes the learnings from the input through mul-
tiple layers (typically three or more) to gain a better understanding of
outputs. One of the most signiﬁcant applications of AI that perhaps
threatened employments is the ability to analyse information, ﬁnd pat-
terns and make better decisions than humans while being empowered to
execute activities in many cases [17]. A well-known example of job
susceptibility to AI is the driverless cars that have the potential to elim-
inate many jobs [18]. In the context of ﬁnance, AI has been extensively
used for pattern recognition and prediction of future events.
For instance, calculation of ﬁnancial distress traditionally was done
through the utilisation of a simple equation that utilises ﬁnancial ratios to
evaluate the likelihood of this event empirically. Considering the vola-
tility of the market, these simpliﬁed calculations are associated with a
high degree of errors. To calculate distress more accurately, Bae [19]
proposed the use of radial basis function support vector machines
(RSVM) and compared his ﬁndings with other AI algorithms. The study
argued that a more accurate prediction of ﬁnancial distress can assist
with the better decision making of CFO and boardroom. It continued that
this new information can assist with the better evaluation of ﬁrms and
will beneﬁt investors.
Stock market prices can provide valuable information about the
economy of a country as well as the performance of corporations; hence,
accurate prediction of stocks is extremely valuable to several ﬁnancially
related decision makings including cost of capital. Liu and Wang [20]
also appreciated the nonlinearity and complexity of ﬁnancial information
and tried to use AI to predict stock values. They concluded that their
method was highly accurate and had the ability to beneﬁt corporate
governance, prevent crises, improve performance and attract investors.
A review of more than 60 articles published from 1990 to 1996
showed that the Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) were mostly applied to
bankruptcy and stock price predictions [21]. It is generally discussed that
ANN requires the availability of data, and ﬁnance is one of the most
promising areas that ANN can be used effectively [22]. A more recent
study reviewed articles published between 1994 and 2015 to identify the
application of neural networks in business [23]. They concluded that
most applications of neural networks were still in bankruptcy and stock
price predictions, but also in decision making and classiﬁcation of tasks.
The use of AI in ﬁnancial analysis was considered to be less signiﬁcant
than other business-related ﬁelds [24].
1.2.1. ANN
Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) are being used to ﬁnd non-linear
and complex regularities in ﬁnancial data, including stock prices [25].
Although it has been shown that ANN works quite well in mature markets
return price predictions, other researchers explained that in emerging
markets where there are more inefﬁciencies, ANN can still function
better than traditional methods of calculations [26]. ANN is designed to
function similarly to the human brain to organise and accumulate
knowledge and identify patterns between them on an ongoing basis. This
ability has proven ANN as to be a suitable tool for managers to make
better decisions while selecting stocks [27]; hence, time series fore-
casting and linear approach to these analyses have proven to be less
efﬁcient than ANN [28,29].
The extensive use of ANN in various business-related areas from ac-
counting and economics to marketing and information management has
proven its success in forecasting future events [30–34]. In multiple
studies the power of ANN to outperform statistical methods like regres-
sion analysis has been proven [35,36]. Macroeconomic variables and
ﬁnancial ratios including market to book ratio and price-earnings are
used as inputs to predict outperforming stocks [37–39]. McNelis [40]
tried using stock market of Chile to predict Brazilian stock prices. These
studies demonstrate the importance of information availability in the
improvement of prediction results in training algorithms including ANN.
1.2.2. AI values
Many other researchers have demonstrated that AI has much better
potentials in prediction, pattern recognition and decision making in the
economic context [41–43]. In a report published recently by Accenture
[44] they identiﬁed ﬁve areas that AI has added value in the context of
capital market. These include (1) automation in a way that is intelligent
and enables self-learning, (2) improved decision making beyond the
capabilities of humans, (3) curation of real-time information and cus-
tomisation, (4) ability to tap into new markets by introducing new
products and (5) in building trust inside and outside the company.
1.2.3. AI algorithms
As it was shown in this section, AI is capable of providing more ac-
curate estimations in the ﬁnancial context. However, the main challenge
is determining the best algorithm and method of training the AI engines.
For every problem, scholars have tried numerous different algorithms to
improve the accuracy and efﬁciency of the AI. For instance, G€oçken,
€Ozçalıcı et al. [45] used AI to predict stock prices in conjunction with
optimisation algorithms to identify the best parameters for a neural
network model. Ballings, Van den Poel et al. [46] explored a variety of
different models including Random Forest, Kernel Factory, AdaBoost,
Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbor and Support
Vector Machines. They concluded that the Random Forest model out-
performed others in the prediction of stock prices.
The performance of neural networks can be improved by the addition
of neurons, layers, data normalisation and replacement of hyperbolic

tangent with the function for logistic activation [47–51]. This disserta-
tion will not go into details of deﬁning various algorithm and techniques
in implementing AI as it is outside the scope of this study. Instead, it will
pick an AI learning algorithm that is proven in literature to work effec-
tively and will use it to estimate the required parameters for calculation
of the cost of capital. For the purpose of capital structure performance,
generalised regression networks have been used in the literature [52]. In
terms of neural networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are proven
to perform exceptionally well in the prediction of stock prices [53]. This
will be discussed in more details in the methodology chapter.
1.2.4. CAPM and ANN
As it was described in this chapter, CAPM is relying on the linear
prediction of asset returns in comparison to the market. It was argued
that the beta parameter is able to measure market risk for a particular
security. Due to the inaccuracies associated with the traditional beta
measurement as described in section 2.5.1.1, other alternative models
were introduced that considered different factors while estimating beta
(section 2.5.1.3). A study done by Cao, Leggio et al. [26] showed that the
use of traditional univariate and 3-factor model in ANN would improve
the accuracy of forecasting return prices. They demonstrated that uni-
variable CAPM performed better in ANN than the 3-factor model in
predicting stock prices. What this study has not looked at is whether the
non-linear ANN method can be used for the calculation of beta instead of
the traditional linear regression method. They simply used the existing
formula and Inputted it into the ANN.
1.2.5. Capital structure and General Regression Neural Networks
Pao [54] showed that neural networks are able to capture non-linear
effects when modelling a capital structure that stays hidden in regression
algorithms. General Regression Neural Networks (GRNN) was used to
evaluate the capital structure of 163 UK retail companies [52]. In this
study, they collect various ﬁnancial ratios (including growth in assets, net
proﬁtability, market to book value, etc.) to predict the debt ratio of retail
ﬁrms in 2006. They trained the network using the ﬁnancial data collected
from 2002 to 2005, and their objective was to determine which factors
have the highest inﬂuence on capital structure. They concluded that net
proﬁtability and depreciation to sale ratio are the most important com-
pounding factors for measurements of capital structure. Their ﬁndings
were compatible with pecking order theory and they showed that neural
networks are able to tolerate noise in data.
1.2.6. Novelty and motivation
This study contributes to academic discussion on the role of AI in the
estimation of cost of capital. In particular, it is attempted to assess if AI
could be used in CAPM and whether the use of AI could bring a more
accurate estimation of expected returns. The motivation behind this
research is to provide a more accurate estimation of the cost of capital
and expected returns for business in comparison to traditional methods.
Hence, this study contributes to discussion among business practitioners
on the best investment decisions and ways of optimising their capital
structure towards a better conﬁguration that maximises both proﬁts and
market value.
2. Methods
The previous section discussed the importance of capital structure. It
then explained that the errors associated with calculations of capital
structure using WACC is mostly associated with the equity part. This is
because of the need to estimate the expected return on equity using the
capital asset pricing model (CAPM) calculation. In this paper, it is
attempted to assess if AI could be used in CAPM and whether the use of AI
could bring a more accurate estimation of expected returns. As described
in the previous section, beta is a measure of the volatility of a security
over a deﬁned period and concerning the market benchmark. Any value
above 1 shows high volatility; any value below 1 indicates low volatility
and one itself indicates a good match between market and security
volatility. The calculation of beta is relatively simple, and these values
are available from online sources that report beta of various security.
However ﬁnancial analysts require to calculate the beta based on the
portfolio that they are designing. For instance, a short-term trader may
require a beta that is computed using quarterly historical data. On the
other hand, those who are planning for long-term investment, calculated
beta over ﬁve or even ten years of historical data. The value of beta is an
essential requirement of CAPM calculation.
Similarly, when the management of organisations is estimating their
cost of capital to formulate a capital structure strategy, historical values
have been considered for CAPM calculation. CAPM is calculating the
expected return, which is an event in the future as ﬁnancial data is
considered not reliable to be predicted. In this study, the AI predicted
stock prices will be inserted to the CAPM formula. To do this, the
equation for CAPM will not be modiﬁed, only instead of using historical
data, predictions will be used to estimate risk and market returns. Also,
since future stock prices are predicted, a return can be calculated directly
from these ﬁndings.
In this section, both the traditional method of calculating CAPM and
the newly proposed methods will be compared. To do this, ﬁrst analysis
for calculating CAPM will be performed. It will be followed by the
development of a neural network to predict stock prices. Then a new
CAPM will be calculated using predicted data. This will be followed by
the calculation of return directly from the predicted data. Finally all these
ﬁndings will be compared with the actual returns.
The ﬂowchart (Fig. 1) explains the methodology that will be followed
in this study. It starts by data acquisition and development of Python
code. Using current year data, beta and CAPM will be calculated. Using
next year data, the actual return in that year will be calculated. A
recurrent neural network will be developed to calculate both CAPM and
return using predicted stock prices. All ﬁndings are compared at the end.
2.1. Software
All the calculations in this paper in terms of both analysis of ﬁnancial
data and the development of a neural network is done in Python (3.7),
which is a popular programming language. Microsoft Excel (2019) is
used to organise and manage data that are generated using the Python
code.
2.2. Data
For this study, the data of the top 10 US-based tech companies (based
on their stock performance) that are listed in the S&P 500 are being used
(Standard & Poor’s 500). The ﬁnancial data that are used in this paper are
exported from “Yahoo! Finance”. The ﬁnancial data that are required to
be extracted in this paper include the adjusted closing stock prices. The
range deﬁned for these data includes January 1, 2013 to January 1, 2019.
The adjusted price of the S&P 500 is also exported for the same range to
calculate market performance. This is needed for CAPM calculation as it
compares the return of the security with the market as described in the
previous section.
Ten tech companies are selected for this research as they are
considered well-performing companies in terms of their share prices.
Tech companies experienced huge investments in past decades and are
regarded as fast-growing and highly volatile in the stock market [73].
Also, the technology industry is considered to be relying heavily on debt.
Brounen, De Jong et al. [74] reported that more than 70% of tech com-
panies have a debt ratio of more than 50%. Moreover, this study showed
that different industries have different capital structures; hence, the
public companies selected for this research are considered to be from the
tech industry, to have high volatility, and also have debt in their capital
structure as an indicator of their ﬁnancial health. However, to maintain a
diverse range of tech companies, selected companies have different levels
of debt-equity ratio that is calculated over 10 years ending December

2.3. Calculating Annual Average returns
The method used to calculate the return is the logarithmic rate of
return which is the logarithm value of ending price divided by the
beginning price. This can be calculated using Equation (1):
Rlog ¼ log
�P1
P2
�
¼ logP1 � logP2
(1)
where Rlog is the logarithmic rate of return, P1 is the adjusted closing
price of the previous day and P2 is the adjusted closing price of today.
Financial analysts rely on logarithmic return when they calculate the
return of a single security. Although there is not an ofﬁcial rule for this
calculation, it has been a common practice. It is important to note that
since the stock market is open only 5 days every week, in this study for
consistency the average daily return is multiplied by 250 to obtain the
annual average return.
2.4. Calculating risk
Financial analysts rely on variance to measure the dispersion of data
around their means. Variance (S2) is deﬁned in Equation (2).
S2 ¼
X �
X–Xavg
�
2
ðN � 1Þ
(2)
To calculate the risk of a security, the variance of its returns that were
obtained in the previous section should be calculated. Once it is obtained,
the value should be multiplied by 250 to obtain the annual variance of

security.
2.5. Beta
Beta is a measure that shows which stock is safer and which one is
riskier. To do this calculation equation (3) should be used.
B ¼ Covðrx; rmÞ
�
stdm
2
(3)
where rx is covariance of stock return and rm is covariance of market
return, and stdm is the standard deviation of the market; hence, calcu-
lation of beta is an estimate of its riskiness in comparison to the rest of the
market.
2.6. CAPM
Now that the beta is calculated, CAPM can be used to calculate ex-
pected return of security using equation (4).
ri ¼ rf þ βim
�
rm � rf
�
(4)
where ri is the expected return, βim beta between market and stock, rf
risk-free rate of return and rm is the market risk. The part in the bracket is
also called risk premium. The risk-free value in this study is obtained
from the ﬁve-year US government bond yield which is approximately
2.5%. Market risk is calculated using the logarithmic estimation of
returns using the S&P500 index. This value should be calculated for the
time span that is considered for prediction, in this paper it will be one
year. Subtracting the market risk from risk free rate would result in a risk
premium. Historically a value between 4.5% and 5.5% is used, and for
consistency in this study the value of 5% will be used in CAPM
calculation.
2.7. Neural Network
Neural networks are used to predict the future performance of stocks.
Once this is predicted, the data can be used in two possible manners.
First, using the predicted AI stock prices an annual return on the security
will be calculated using the logarithmic method. Second, using the pre-
dicted stock prices, the calculation of the CAPM will be repeated. In the
second method, instead of using historical data, the predicted data is used
for calculation. In this section, only the information that is required for
the understanding of the algorithms are provided to enable a ﬁnancial
analyst to replicate the process. The details on how the equations were
obtained and the mathematical concepts will not be discussed as they are
outside of the scope of this study.
2.8. Recurrent Neural Networks
The recurrent neural network (AI algorithm) will be used to predict
stock prices which later will be used in the calculation of expected
returns. Stock prices are known as sequential data in the ﬁeld of ﬁnance.
Sequential data is deﬁned as the data that follows a unique order, and
each new data comes at a speciﬁc stage and cannot be randomly placed,
for instance, due to being time-dependent. The most advanced and
powerful AI that can process these data is called Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN). Most major tech companies, including Google and
Apple, are using this algorithm for various reasons including translations,
voice recognition, adding subtitles and even stock price predictions
[75–77].
In standard feedforward neural networks (FFNN), there is only one
direction for the data to move. Because of this forward-moving pattern,
the data of previous layers will be lost, and essentially there cannot be
any internal state or memory. However, in RNN the data goes through a
loop which means it can remember the past as well as the new data, (see
Fig. 2). As an example, for ﬁnancial data, it is required to be aware of the
prices in the previous day to predict the next day prices. If FFNN is used,
it would not matter in which order the data are entered, and the pre-
diction would not consider the sequence of data. However, in RNN and in
terms of stock prices, the prediction will be dependent on the price of the
previous day(s); hence, RNN is able to identify the differences between
the prices and can predict the future with reasonable accuracy.
RNN has one major problem, and that is an issue which is termed as
Vanishing Gradient. This occurs when the gradient (partial derivative
with consideration of inputs) becomes so small that essentially prevents
weights from having any effect. To overcome this problem, a new method
has been proposed by Ref. [78] that is called Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM). This method is brieﬂy described next as it is used in this study to
increase the accuracy of the predictions.
For calculations of RNN, the network is essentially unrolled over time
(see Fig. 3), This technique is used to be able to go through the back-
propagation for optimising the parameters of the neural network. Each
output is essentially fed back into the calculation and this process enables
the ability to memorise parameters over time.
2.9. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
LSTM has three main components that are called input, output and
forget gates. The trick that is used in this method is that the cell as shown
in Fig. 4, can remember data for a random duration of time and the three
main components that act as regulators of information into this cell and
out of this cell. Because of this unique structure of the system, the
network will not have the vanishing problem and essentially will not
forget the parameters. For this reason, LSTM is the best RNN algorithm
for application to time series sequential data.
2.10. Dense layer
In neural networks, high dimensions of vectors are being used. To
change a vector from “n” dimensions to “m” dimensions, a dense layer
should be employed (see Fig. 5). In this study, the ﬁnal layer is deﬁned as
a dense layer to reduce the number of outputs to 1 unit. In mathematical
terms, matrix manipulation techniques including scaling, translation and
rotation are being applied to achieve the desired output.
2.11. TensorFlow and Cost function
High-performance computations are commonly done through readily
developed packages. TensorFlow is an open-source package developed
by Google for developing machine learning and deep learning programs
with various architectures [79]. The advantage of using such a platform
is that the basic equations and rules are pre-deﬁned in the library and the
user can access and reach a solution in a much quicker manner. In this
research, TensorFlow is imported in Python 3 for development of LSTM
that predicts stock prices.
The cost function is deﬁned as the mean squared error (MSE) as in
Equation (5).
MSE ¼ 1
n
X
n
i¼1
ðyi � �yiÞ2
(5)
where n is the number of data, y is the predicted value and �y is the actual
value. Once the error was calculated, an optimisation method was used to
minimise this value. The optimisation method that is used in this study is
one that has proven to work well in deep learning problems and is called
Adam optimisation. Due to the complexity of the mathematical concept
behind this method, no further explanation is given about this algorithm.
However, readers are encouraged to learn more about it from Kingma
and Ba [80].

2.12. Testing and training
The data is split into 90% training and 10% test sets. The input of the
data is one-year stock prices starting and ending on the 1st of January.
The reason 90% of data is utilised is that in one year there are
approximately 250 days that the stock market is open and the LSTM
requires as many data as possible to predict them with good accuracy.
The ﬁrst 50 days are used as the features, and the subsequent prices are
used as the label. Test and validation in this data set are not the same. The
network was tested using 10% of the data obtained from the same
ﬁnancial year; however it is validated using the application of network to
the upcoming year as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. It is important to note that
the data are normalised between 0 and 1 using the training dataset. Then
the same normalisation is applied to test data to maintain the consistency
but reduce the biases associated with normalisation. This is because the
test data is assumed to be unknown.
2.13. Network architecture
The network has LSTM layers that allow for a return sequence fol-
lowed by one dropout layer. This is repeated three times and followed by
a ﬁnal LSTM layer where the return sequence is not allowed and another
dropout layer. Finally, there is one dense layer that predicts one value for
the output. Each layer has 40 neurons and the dropout rate is set to 20%.
The batch size is set to 40 and epoch is set to 200, Fig. 5. Batch size is
referring to the total number of training in each iteration. Each epoch is
deﬁned as one complete iteration that leads to the prediction of values
and calculation of analysis cost. These parameters can be optimised for

each dataset to improve the performance of the network. However, for
consistency and feasibility of this study, these parameters are kept as
constants.
In this study, ﬁnancial data of 10 companies were extracted. These
data are extracted over six years among which ﬁve years are used for AI
development. Data are entered year by year which means for each
company the neural network should be trained ﬁve times. Also, this
analysis should be repeated for the S&P 500 to predict the market per-
formance as they are required in CAPM calculations.
2.14. Outputs
For clarity, in this section the outputs of the study should be described
to enable the reader to make sense of the data that are produced
following the procedures described in methodology section. First, using
historical data of the past one year, CAPM (expected return) is calculated.
Second, using the same data that are used to calculated CAPM, the LSTM
was trained. Upon completion of this training, the network predicts the
prices in the upcoming year from which a return is calculated. Third, the
estimated returns that are obtained from prediction of stock prices from
the AI, are used in calculation of CAPM. At the same time, the actual
return in the upcoming year was calculated from available data. Finally,
the three return values that are obtained for the upcoming year are
compared to the actual returns. This process repeated for all ten com-
panies and for the period of six years. At the end to demonstrate the
results, ﬁgures and tables are generated to enable a quick comparison of
these ﬁnding.
2.14.1. Theoretical framework and development of hypotheses
Scholars have viewed capital structure as either the leverage or
ownership structure of the ﬁrm. The modern theory of capital structure
was established by Modigliani and Miller [55]; and it is around the fact
that ﬁnancial decisions will come either with costs or beneﬁts and the
challenge is to estimate and maintain an optimum capital structure. In-
vestors require to estimate the risk associated with every investment to
determine the expected return [56]. The minimum return that is ex-
pected from the capital structure is calculated through the cost of capital
theories; hence, estimation of the cost of capital will require to rely on

neuron for the output through a dense layer. This is the network architecture used in this study.

both risk and future return on investments. It has, however, been argued
that forecasting the return is perhaps the most problematic part of
portfolio management models for investors [57].
It is argued that the efﬁcient market will quickly reﬂect on the
availability of information and prices will adjust accordingly (Fama and
Makiel, 1970, Fama, 1991). This theory which is called the Efﬁcient
Market Hypothesis (EMH) has generated many arguments regarding
predictive models. For instance, random walk theory implies that stock
prices follow a random path and predicting them would not be possible
[58]. Another theory attempted to estimate the expected return in
regards to market risk which is called Capital Assets Pricing Model
(CAPM) [59,60]. Many researchers have argued that EMH does not stand
true [58]. For example, it was shown that weekly US stock prices are
reasonably predictable through the use of pattern recognition tools [61,
62]; hence, this resulted in the development of a new theory called the
Adaptive Market Hypothesis (AMH) that claims upon the availability of
predictive information, the market will adjust itself [63]. As a result, only
short-term predictability may be possible, but in long-term it will be
self-destructive; hence, the research in predicting ﬁnancial information
may remain hidden to the public and be sold privately to investors or
organisations [64].
Artiﬁcial intelligence and the use of learning algorithms and in
particular neural network have gained substantial momentum in the ﬁeld
of ﬁnance [35]. It is believed that these algorithms are able to function
better than both linear and non-linear regression analysis for a number of
reasons including the ability to compensate for noise, react to changes in
data [65], making no initial assumptions [66] and are able to ﬁnd the
best patterns between input and output data [67]. This leads to the ﬁrst
hypothesis of this research:
Hypothesis 1.
Artiﬁcial Intelligence can be used in the cost of capital
calculation to improve predictability
Multiple researchers have concluded that stock prices are following a
non-linear pattern and traditional methods of statistics may not provide
accurate predictions [35]. The successful usage of neural networks in the
ﬁnancial domain has been proven by many researchers [15]. Weighted
Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is commonly used to determine the
minimum return that should be earned by a business based on their
capital structure [68]. This calculation relies on CAPM to estimate the
cost of equity capital [69]. Although CAPM is still widely used, there are
a number of limitations associated with its calculations. Since CAMP
relies on the estimation of risk (beta), it is crucial to have an accurate
estimation of this value. Beta is calculated through linear regression
analysis over a long period of historical data. As discussed earlier, the
market is not behaving linearly and the usage of long-term historical data
to linearly estimate risk will not be accurate [70–72]. This leads to the
second hypothesis of this research.
Hypothesis 2.
Artiﬁcial Intelligence can be used for a more accurate
estimation of returns in comparison to the traditional method.
3. Results
This section contains all the data generated from this study. It is
important to note that six years of adjusted closing stock prices were
collected for ten high-tech companies as well as S&P500. These ten
companies rely on equity ﬁnancing with various portions as described in
the methodology section. All neural network conﬁgurations remained
the same, after an initial preliminary study on a few companies that
showed the network is able to predict the prices reliably. Due to the
substantial size of analysis performed, the graphs related to the perfor-
mance of prediction of stock prices are brieﬂy discussed, and an example
is presented.
3.1. AI performance
The RNN was designed as described in the methodology section. To
verify the performance of the network, various plots were produced for
each time that the network was trained. Initially, the selected year data
was split into two groups of training and testing sets. After the network
was trained, a plot was provided to evaluate the performance of the
network on the test set. This is only to demonstrate that the network
parameters are able to predict reasonable results as it was necessary to be
used as part of algorithm development and during programming stage.
However, these data by no means are used as validation of the perfor-
mance of the network. The network parameters were optimised until the
error calculated using the objective function (Equation (5)) was found to
be the lowest. To validate the performance, network parameters were
deployed for analysis of the following year’s data. Again, to evaluate the
performance of the network, another plot was provided where the actual
data and predictions are compared.
Due to a large size of analysis in this section, the ﬁgures for only one
company and only for one year is provided in this section as examples.
The selected company is Autodesk, Inc. (ADSK) and the data of 2015–16

was used to predict 2016–17 prices. As shown in Fig. 6, the network was
able to accurately predict the test data, which included the last 25 days of
the year. The numerical values of the errors obtained from each case is
arbitrary and varies from one case to another and since they would not
add any information, are not presented.
Now that the network was trained, the ﬁnancial data of the next year
(2016) was extracted to compare them with the network predictions. The
AI algorithm was able to predict the stock prices during this year quite
accurately, as shown in Fig. 7. The prices of 2015 in conjunction of the
actual and predicted prices on 2016 demonstrate that recurrent neural
network is a suitable choice for prediction of stock prices and the network
was able to establish an intricate pattern between dates and prices for this
company that led to high accuracy prediction of the upcoming year
prices, Fig. 8. Hence, this method of analysis is considered as reliable to
be used on other datasets.
The network hyperparameters are kept constant in this study due the
limitation in time and computational cost of the project. Hence, the re-
sults of the AI algorithm on other companies or other years may be better
or worse than the example provided in this section. However, the per-
formance of the network is not the objective of this research. The aim of
this section of the study was to demonstrate the selected network ar-
chitecture is capable of predicting stock prices with reasonable accuracy.
This would be enough to carry on with the rest of the study and satisfy
research hypothesis. Hence readers should be aware that the perfor-
mance of the network can certainly be improved if the target is to predict
the future data more accurately.
3.2. Comparison of ﬁndings
An overall comparison is provided in this section, Table 1. The AI was
able to accurately predict the stock prices in most cases, and this enabled
AI to predict the most accurate returns in 9 out of 10 companies. The AI
method used to calculate CAPM enabled a more accurate estimation of
returns for 7 out of 10 companies in comparison to the traditional
method. In 9 out of 10 companies AI was able to predict stock prices with
less volatility (standard deviation) than the traditional method. The
comparison between AI predicted CAPM and AI predicted return, AI
predicted return was more reliable, less volatile and more accurate.
The traditional method of CAPM on average for all companies, using
the values presented in Table 1, had an error of 102% and under-
estimated the returns. This value (average values of all companies) for AI

the lowest standard deviation, Fig. 9. These results provide a clear and
consistent message that enables to draw a conclusion on the use of AI in
the estimation of returns that can be used to improve the cost of equity
calculations. Based on these ﬁnding with the use of AI, cost of equity
estimation can be improved over 60% which will inﬂuence WACC
calculation signiﬁcantly and improve the accuracy to a much higher
degree. The results presented in this part were concerned with the ab-
solute error to enable this comparison.
4. Discussion
It was discussed by Markowitz [56] that investors require to estimate
the risk associated with any investments and this was reﬂected in the cost
of capital calculations. Brock and De Lima [57] argued that forecasting
returns are the most problematic part of designing a portfolio. One of the
main reasons was that the market would quickly adjust itself as the new
information became available. Although this argument formed the Efﬁ-
cient Market Hypothesis (EMH) [58], this was criticised by many other
authors that predictive algorithms can forecast the return on security
investments in short-term [61,62]. Compatible to the ﬁndings of these
studies, it was clearly demonstrated in this research that up to one year of
stock prices could be predicted with the least amount of information
available for each of ten companies. This ﬁnding is contrary to Random
Walk Theory which claims that prediction of market prices is not possible
[58].
Two signiﬁcant factors require an in-depth investigation based on
these literature arguments. First, the estimation of risk or beta parameter
may not be needed any more with its current deﬁnition. This is because
market volatility is not playing a signiﬁcant role when stock prices can be
predicted accurately which also impacts capital asset pricing models;
hence, risk should be deﬁned in a new manner that relates to the un-
certainty associated with the prediction of stock prices using AI. Two
possible methods could be suggested. One approach is to introduce a new
algorithm that can incorporate uncertainty (probability of its occur-
rences) as a multiplier to the predicted returns on security. Another
method would be to evaluate the reliability of predictions on historical
data and incorporate the standard deviation as the uncertainty associated
with predictions.
Second, the argument provided in regards to market adjustments
upon the availability of information or Adaptive Market Hypothesis
(AMH) [63] may not stand valid anymore. This is true that the market

will adjust itself upon the availability of new information. However, as it
was demonstrated in this research, AI algorithms including Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNN) can adjust themselves in real-time. Hence this
problem becomes an inﬁnite loop of adjustments through both the
market and algorithms to make the prices more volatile. Considering the
nature of the stock market and the enormous number of available AI
algorithms with various capabilities, it would be unrealistic for the
market to be able to maintain this adjustment in a way that it competes
with all predictive algorithms; hence, if these algorithms become publicly
available and are used on a daily basis by most investors, the impact on
the market would be extremely complicated to forecast at this stage.
However, there is a good chance that AI can adapt and maintain a
reasonably good accuracy of predictions.
A twenty years review on AI algorithms and their application in
ﬁnance demonstrated that very few studies had used RNN [23]. The
application of RNN on the prediction of inﬂation data was evaluated in a
previous study that demonstrated the ability of these algorithms in
dealing with non-linear data [81]. RNN was also applied to the prediction
of foreign exchange rates and considered to be successful for imple-
mentation in real-time prediction platforms [82]. More advanced RNN
algorithms such as LSTM which was used in this study demonstrated a
much better ability to predict stock prices in the Chinese market [53].
Heaton, Polson et al. [83] concluded that deep learning can detect be-
haviours that are not visible to ﬁnancial theories that currently exist.
Compatible to literature, this study found that stock prices can be accu-
rately predicted using deep learning recurrent neural networks that
incorporated LSTM algorithms.
Direct application of AI to cost of capital could not be found in the
literature. However, Nelson, Pereira et al. [84] showed that RNN could
accurately predict the trend in the data. This is compatible with the
concept of beta that is used as a risk factor in CAPM that attempts to use
historical data to predict security trend in comparison to market [85].
This thesis combined the use of RNN with CAPM calculation and
demonstrated that indeed it improves the accuracy of predictions
compatible with ﬁndings of other scholars. Hsia, Fuller et al. [86] con-
ducted a study and concluded that traditional beta might not be accurate
and moving-average beta is able to predict the risk much more accu-
rately. The use of beta in CAPM was only needed to estimate the expected
return [87]. This research suggests that the cost of equity should not be
estimated using asset pricing models such as CAPM anymore as the future
can be predicted with reasonable accuracy. This goes beyond the debated
in the literature on the topic that claims, “beta is dead” [86].
There are a number of limitations to this study. The data collected for
this study considered only ﬁve years of historical data in ten high-tech
public companies. This study used only one year of historical data to
train the network and kept all hyperparameters and network architecture
the same for various stocks. Optimising these parameters or using a larger
dataset to train the network is very time consuming and requires unique
customisation through trials and errors. Also the method selected for AI
relied on literature, and comparison was not conducted between
different algorithms. These issues were considered not timely and
computationally feasible to be performed in this study; nevertheless they
stand for interesting area for further research. This study focused on the
US market which is considered a mature market. Researchers have shown
that the artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) works quite well in these mar-
kets [26]. Hence the application of ﬁndings in this study to emerging
markets may result in a different outcome.
This study argued that the use of AI could provide better estimations
of cost of capital and expected returns in comparison with traditional
methods. Currently, application of AI requires knowledge of neural net-
works and programming languages which may be considered complex to
many ﬁnancial analysts. The complexity of this problem is not associated
with the use of the AI program. The complexity is in development of
software that is capable of utilising the required (company-speciﬁc)

information with the critically selected algorithm to provide accurate
estimations. The development of this software requires programming,
mathematical and ﬁnancial knowledge. With the availability of online
tutorials, this challenge has become much more straightforward to
tackle. Also once an AI engineer designs the network, optimisation of
parameters is an easy job and can be done by anyone in the ﬁrm.
5. Conclusion
The focus of this study was to evaluate if AI could improve the ac-
curacies associated with the estimation of cost of capital and expected
returns. To do this, data of 10 public tech companies were collected, and
traditional CAPM values were calculated every year for ﬁve years. The
actual returns were also calculated using historical data. Then two
methods of using AI was proposed that included estimation of returns
directly from the predicted values, or calculation of CAPM using pre-
dicted values.
Many scholars have introduced many different equations that help to
improve the estimation of returns [11–14]. However, to the authors’
knowledge, no one has used AI in the calculation of the cost of capital to
improve the accuracy of estimations. In this study, AI was used to predict
future stock prices, and the algorithm used for this purpose was Recur-
rent Neural Networks (RNNs). RNNs, which is a deep learning algorithm,
showed an outstanding ability to ﬁnd intricate patterns between
sequential data [84]. The RNN used in this study utilised a recently
developed algorithm proposed by Greff, Srivastava et al. [78] that has not
been applied to prediction of cost of capital. The performance of this
algorithm is further reinforced when the stock prices were predicted in
this study to estimate returns.
Two possible methods were considered that would enable the
implementation of AI in the cost of equity calculation. First, to predict
future stock prices and calculate the returns directly from the predictions.
Second, to predict the stock prices and market behaviour and then
calculate CAPM using forecasted data. Lastly, to be able to compare the
AI method and traditional CAPM calculations and ﬁnd the one that
provides the most accurate prediction of returns, the true value was
needed. For this reason, the true value of return was calculated using
actual stock prices in the following year.
For the purpose of analysing securities, the adjusted closing stock
prices of 10 public tech companies were exported. These prices were
collected for the past six years, starting from January 1, 2019. This
research assumed that there is a need to predict returns for the next year.
Hence one year of historical data was used to calculate traditional CAPM
value and also train the RNN to predict stock prices of the upcoming year.
As it is known from the nature of AI algorithms, the more data provided,
the more accurate the network will become. However, in terms of CAPM
calculation, the more data that provided, the less reliable the prediction
may become [88]. This is because the future may not reﬂect historical
patterns. For consistency in this study, only one year of historical data
was used in both traditional and AI methods.
In regard to the use of AI algorithms, three critical aspects should be
considered. These include the cleaning of the dataset, optimisation of
hyperparameters and network architecture. In this study, the dataset was
collected from “Yahoo Finance!” which was already clean and ready to be
used in the network. A generic deep learning network architecture was
developed with the use of LSTM and dropout layers. This network was
tested on stock prices of a few companies and showed a reasonably strong
ability to predict future prices. Also, hyperparameters were tuned for a
limited number of data to achieve reasonable accuracy. Tuning the
hyperparameters or optimising the architecture of the network is very
time-consuming. This is because there is no correct formula for selecting
them and they must be achieved through trial and error.
The difﬁculty of training and using AI algorithms may be a reason that
the use of AI in the cost of equity was not explored before. It is natural for
a Chief Financial Ofﬁcer (CFO) to rely on simple equations that can
calculate returns very quickly instead of learning how to deal with
sophisticated AI methods. In this study, to overcome this bias of variation
in AI algorithms and networks, once the network was optimised on a
limited number of data, all the parameters and architecture were kept the
same. Of course, in ideal circumstances, these parameters should be
optimised. However, the selected method would show whether the use of
a generic neural network, designed and developed by an AI engineer,
would be superior to traditional methods or not. This would simulate the
situation that ﬁnancial analysts only uses the algorithm without having
any prior knowledge of AI or programming to predict stock prices. As a
result of this issue, the network may not have performed ﬂawlessly on
some of the datasets.
By studying the results, in most cases when traditional CAPM is
compared to the actual returns, it was found that the traditional value
was consistently underestimating the returns in all ten companies and all
ﬁve years. In many cases, AI predicted CAPM followed the same pattern.
On average, the AI predicted CAPM was able to predict a more accurate
return in comparison to the traditional method. This accuracy on average
was 18% closer to the actual value. So by replacing this new method into
the cost of capital calculation, the results of WACC can be improved by
18%.
When comparing AI predicted returns with traditional CAPM, it was
noticed that consistently AI predicted returns were closer to the actual
returns. Quantitatively on average AI was calculated to be 60% more
accurate. Also, the AI predicted returns had the smallest standard devi-
ation, which means there was a reasonably good consistency in the
prediction of future returns. The implementation of this method in WACC
would signiﬁcantly increase the accuracy of the cost of capital calcula-
tion. It should be noted that if the network parameters and architecture
are optimised, these values are likely to improve and get closer to actual
returns.
One major challenge was identiﬁed from the outcome of this study. It
was demonstrated that the cost of equity is signiﬁcantly underestimated
due to the use of CAPM in calculations; hence, using the newly proposed
method, the cost of equity capital should increase using the WACC for-
mula. This means that the balance for the optimum capital structure will
be disturbed if the new method is used and corporations may ﬁnd that a
new balance is required to maximise the value of the ﬁrm for share-
holders [1,89]. If the same cost of capital is to be maintained, an increase
in the debt portion of capital structure would be needed otherwise ﬁrms
will increase their overall cost of capital. This may limit investment op-
tions as higher rates should be considered [6].
As discussed by many researchers [90–93] capital structure cannot be
modiﬁed instantly; hence, ﬁrms try to maintain a balance over time, and
there is always a delay in response to the market changes. One signiﬁ-
cantly positive advantage of using AI in the cost of capital calculations
that is found in this study would be the ability to estimate this value
accurately and at any point in time; hence, ﬁrms can more accurately
plan ahead to optimise their capital structure for achieving a particular
cost of capital. This could be an essential asset to guide ﬁnancial decision
made by Chief Financial Ofﬁcers (CFOs).
The main disadvantage would be the challenges that may arise upon
the availability of this information to the public. It was also discussed that
due to the ability of AI algorithms to accurately predict stock prices, the
use of asset pricing models or estimation of risk (beta) may not be needed
anymore; hence, it was proposed that a new parameter should be created
to enable estimation of uncertainties related to predicted values. To the
author’s knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that AI was applied in the
estimation of the cost of equity; hence, this study has the potential to
disturb the research in the cost of equity estimation to an entirely new era
of artiﬁcial intelligence that linear or simplistic approaches are no longer
a solution. This can only happen if these algorithms are commonly being
used and empirical studies to be performed on their ability and impact on
ﬁnancial decisions made by corporations and investors.
There are some suggestions for future research in this ﬁeld. This study
demonstrated that CAPM is consistently underestimating the expected
returns. This was concluded based on the data collected from 10 high

11
tech companies during the period of January 1, 2013 to January 1, 2019;
hence, there may be a need to add an offset to CAPM estimation to adjust
its value to be closer to the actual returns. The network architecture and
hyperparameters should be optimised for each case to improve the ac-
curacy of predictions. This can be enhanced by training the network
using a much larger dataset. A perfect prediction of stock prices could
almost completely eliminate the need to using any asset pricing models
or estimation of risk (beta). This study predicted the returns for the up-
coming year on any selected security. To design a portfolio, ﬁnancial
analysts may require predicting returns on shorter terms (quarterly) or
longer-term (5–10 years); hence, evaluation of AI performance would be
necessary for these periods.
As the community starts to trust the prediction of stock prices using
AI, there will be a need to develop a new parameter that can evaluate the
uncertainties associated with predictions. This could serve as a replace-
ment to the beta which measures the risk in any investment. This
research focused on the application of AI in one industry (high-tech) that
is based in the US market. Future research should evaluate the outcome
of this analysis in other markets and industries to increase the reliability
of these ﬁndings. Since CAPM is used in portfolio planning, future
research should explore the impact of using AI in designing portfolios in
comparison to traditional CAPM method.
