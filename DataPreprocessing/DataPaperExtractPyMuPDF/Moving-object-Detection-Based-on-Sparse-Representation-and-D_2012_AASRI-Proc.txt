Abstract 
In this paper, we propose an algorithm of moving-object detection via the sparse representation and learned dictionary. 
First, compress image in order to reduce data redundancy and bandwidth. Then initialize data dictionary with CS 
measurement values and sparse basis, train and update it through the K-SVD which can get the sparsest representations. 
At the same time, we consider the correlation between the dictionaries which can effectively reduce the dictionary 
redundancy. Carry out the selective reconstruction depending on the sparse coefficients to determine whether the target 
invades, which can decrease the amount of data to calculate and is better to achieve real-time. We segment the moving-
object through the robust principal component pursuit(PCP) for that the image is consisted with low-rank of the 
background regions and the sparsity of the foreground regions. Analysis, simulation, and experimental results show that 
our scheme has a good detection result, which can significantly decrease data redundancy and the demand for bandwidth 
at the same time.

1. Introduction 
Moving-object detection is one of the core problems in computer vision, which is widely applied in the 
fields of artificial intelligence, intelligent monitoring, video analysis and so on.Common methods for moving-
object detection are optical flow method[1], inter-frame difference method[2] and background subtraction

method[3].Those algorithms are all based on pixel values, which the common drawback is data redundancy 
occupied lots of bandwidth and complex calculation. To solve the problem of large amount of data, scholars 
have introduced compressive sensing (CS) technology[4-5], which can reduce the transmission bandwidth and 
storage memory effectively. Unfortunately, signal decomposition of the above algorithms uses nonlinear 
orthogonal transformation which can’t consider the correlation between images, making signal less sparse.  
However, dictionary learning methods determine the proper representation of data via decreased 
dimensionality subspaces, which are appropriate for the characteristics of the signals and image processing. 
These representations are based on the principle that our observations can be described by a sparse subset of 
atoms taken from a redundant dictionary, which represents the causes of observations in the real world.  
In this paper, we propose an algorithm of moving-object detection via the sparse representation and 
learned dictionary. Make the sparse coefficient sparser according to the CS measurements and sparse basis 
which are used to train dictionary initially. Update the dictionary continually through K-SVD to strengthen 
the sparse representation of the dictionary capabilities. Reconstruct the image depended on whether object 
occurs, which can reduce the amount of data to calculate and is better to achieve real-time. Finally, image 
consisted of low-rank of the background component and the sparsity of the foreground component can be 
recovered through the robust principal component pursuit(PCP) individually. 
2. Sparse Representation of image  
At the phase of video acquisition, write a two-dimensional image of each frame one-dimensional column 
vector in

Where

During transmission, the transmission of just the measurements can restore the original high-dimensional 
image ( M
� N
), which reduces the bandwidth of the signal transmission. Encoding and decoding of 
compressive sensing are used for reducing the data redundancy, but failed to consider the relation between 
adjacent frames. So we mention the dictionary in the next section. 
3. Learning and Updating Dictionary Based on K-SVD 
There are lots of studies on signal sparse representation. Using the data dictionary[9-10] to sparse represent 
the original images which is consisted of sparse linear combination of dictionary atoms and can effectively 
resolve the perceived deficiencies in the image processing. In this paper, adaptive dictionary to get the most

sparse dictionary to represent the CS measurements based on the K-SVD algorithm. In addition, the update of 
the dictionary can exclude the interference of the external environment (light, etc.). The K-SVD algorithm is 
promoted by the K-means clustering algorithm, which is the iterative approach. What’s more, allowing a 
change in the coefficient values while updating the dictionary column vectors will accelerate convergence, 
since the subsequent column vectors update which is based on more relevant coefficients.

0T �is the upper limitation of the 
number of non-zero elements in the coefficient, which is also the greatest difference in the degree of the

We solve the (4) iteratively, specific algorithm is as follows:

� Find the sparsest sparse coefficient � �using an approximation pursuit method(BP,MP,OMP). Once the �

3.2. Dictionary  Updating 
In reality, the background will change because of the light, angle of the camera, which can lead to fatal 
mistake at the time of detecting the moving target if we don’t automatically update the background models. It 
is assumed that�both D �and � �are fixed, and we only care the jth column of D �which�corresponds to the 
kth row of � � (4) can be rewritten as:

The two kinds of the end of the loop iterations, one is to set a number of iterations, this article is set to 20; 
another is to set the error value of the reconstructed image and original image.  
In K-SVD algorithm, the video stream can be approximately represented by linear combination of small 
enough (less than 
0T

which can guarantee that the total error decreases monotonically, which is to ensure the convergence of the K-

4. Moving-object Detection and Segment 
Read into a video stream X , the measurement matrix and wavelet sparse basis are � �and
� respectively. We will get measurement Y via CS that can complete the image compression to reduce data 
redundancy and bandwidth requirements. Assign values �� to the data dictionary to complete the 
initialization of the dictionary. Through the OMP algorithm for continuous learning dictionary, get the best 
dictionary

, strengthening the sparse representation of the dictionary 
capabilities. Read into the test image, using CS K-SVD algorithm to update the dictionary after CS. The 
measured values compared with the data dictionary refactoring, to determine whether the target invade, thus 
selective reconstruction. The final problem can be transformed into a classification problem by setting a 
threshold of the two types of data individually. The whole process is shown in the figure 1.

Compare the measurements of the test image and data dictionary to determine whether the target 
invasive, leading to selective reconstruction. This problem can be regarded as a classification problem, by 
setting a threshold of these two types of data separately. 
Segment the moving-object regions while reconstruct the measurements in this paper. Video streams are 
formed with background region matrix, foreground region matrix and error matrix. As in paper[11] mentioned 
the principal component pursuit analysis, background is low rank, foreground is the sparse component. Given 
the measurement matrix Y

volume. The foreground region is enough smaller compared to the background region, which can be treated as 
sparse matrix. What we propose above satisfy the condition in paper [11], which can be solved by (7). 
5. Experiment and analysis 
We form 100 frames into the matrix to construct the background model, and each frame is written as a 
column vector(streaming video at 25 frames per second, size of image is 512*512). So training sample size is 
262144*100 and CS sampling rate is 20 %. Then initially compressed measurement matrix is 52428*100. The 
initial data dictionary is represented by the measurement, training iterations is 30, sampling column number 
25. The data dictionary matrix decompose as 52428*25and25*50 matrix which is smaller than the original 
video stream. Figure 2 shows the image constructed via the data dictionary.

After establishing background model, the video starts to monitor. Read into the images of moving 
objects, complete the CS’s compression and K-SVD’s background reconstruction. By comparing the 
Euclidean distance of data dictionary, determine whether there is a moving target, and then conduct selective 
reconstruction. As shown in Figure 3(a), column vector is the Euclidean distance between measurements for 
the reconstruction of the input image and background models. The circle stands for images include the 
moving target, and plus sign for the non-moving target images. Thus, we can see that by setting a threshold 
between two values then determine whether the goal invasion or not. Here we set the threshold value as 
4*1012.
By using the proposed K-SVD algorithm, we can obtain the background model as Figure 2(c), which 
ruled out suspicious foreground and the movement goal to the background’s disturbance. As this method is 
based on the brightness of the color property, the three RGB components, if use traditional background 
difference method for processing, it is very sensitive to brightness change. Here, for the time difference 
between moving target image and background image is two hours, the light intensity of car surface metal 
reflector changes sharply, reflecting the vehicle location’s pixel gray values are mutated on the image. After 
the traditional method of background difference, stationary cars will be detected, mistaken for moving targets, 
as is shown in Figure 3(c). Shown in Figure 3(a), the proposed segmentation method is an effective solution to 
a brightness change, rule out the disturbance of suspicious foreground, and improve the accuracy of target 
detection.

6. Conclusions 
The study proposes an algorithm based on the sparse representation and learned dictionary to detect and 
segment the moving-object, which can effectively decrease the data transmission through the CS and K-SVD 
algorithm. Update the dictionary continually through K-SVD to strengthen the sparse representation of the 
dictionary capabilities. The selectivity of the reconstructed image reduces the amount of calculation achieving 
practical application of real-time. Reconstruct the moving-object and background individually through PCP 
method which the image is consisted of low-rank component and the sparse component.
