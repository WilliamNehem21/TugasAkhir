Although cascaded multistage adaptive noise cancellers have been employed before by researchers for multiple
artifact removal from the ElectroCardioGram (ECG) signal, they all used the same adaptive algorithm in all the
cascaded multi-stages for adjusting the adaptive filter weights. In this paper, we propose a cascaded 4-stage
adaptive noise canceller for the removal of four artifacts present in the ECG signal, viz. baseline wander, motion
artifacts, muscle artifacts, and 60 Hz Power Line Interference (PLI). We have investigated the performance of
eight adaptive algorithms, viz. Least Mean Square (LMS), Least Mean Fourth (LMF), Least Mean Mixed-Norm
(LMMN), Sign Regressor Least Mean Square (SRLMS), Sign Error Least Mean Square (SELMS), Sign-Sign Least
Mean Square (SSLMS), Sign Regressor Least Mean Fourth (SRLMF), and Sign Regressor Least Mean Mixed-Norm
(SRLMMN) in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement for removing the aforementioned four artifacts
from the ECG signal. We employed the LMMN, LMF, LMMN, LMF algorithms in the proposed cascaded 4-stage
adaptive noise canceller to remove the respective ECG artifacts as mentioned above. We succeeded in achieving
an SNR improvement of 12.7319 dBs. The proposed cascaded 4-stage adaptive noise canceller employing the
LMMN, LMF, LMMN, LMF algorithms outperforms those that employ the same algorithm in the four stages.
One unique and powerful feature of our proposed cascaded 4-stage adaptive noise canceller is that it employs
only those adaptive algorithms in the four stages, which are shown to be effective in removing the respective
ECG artifacts as mentioned above. Such a scheme has not been investigated before in the literature.
1. Introduction
Adaptive noise cancellation is a method of estimating signals, which
are corrupted by additive noise or interference. This method employs
a primary input, which is the corrupted signal, and a secondary or
reference input, which is the noise correlated with the noise present in
the primary input. The reference input is adaptively filtered and sub-
tracted from the primary input in order to obtain the signal estimate.
The adaptive noise cancellation method can be employed whenever an
appropriate reference input is available [1,2].
Thakor and Zhu [3] proposed several adaptive filter structures for
noise cancellation and arrhythmia detection in ECG signals. The diverse
forms of noise like baseline wander, 60 Hz PLI, muscle artifacts, and
motion artifacts were eliminated from the ECG signal [3]. Hamilton [4]
investigated the relative performance of an adaptive and nonadaptive
60-Hz notch filters for the reduction of PLI in the ECG signal. Ziarani
and Konrad [5] proposed a nonlinear adaptive method of elimination
of PLI from the ECG signal. The proposed method offered a robust
structure and is shown to have a high degree of immunity with respect
to external noise [5]. Raya and Sison [6] proposed an adaptive noise

cancellation method to remove motion artifacts in stress ECG signals by
using an accelerometer. The adaptive noise cancellers in [6] are imple-
mented using the two of the most widely employed adaptive filtering
algorithms, viz. LMS and Recursive Least Squares (RLS). Martens et al.
[7] proposed an improved adaptive noise canceller for the reduction
of the fundamental PLI component and harmonics in the ECG signal.
Behbahani [8] simulated and tested an adaptive noise cancellation
method using the LMS algorithm for removing the 60 Hz PLI. Lin
and Hu [9] developed an efficient RLS adaptive notch filter for the
suppression of PLI in the ECG signal. They also proposed a PLI detector
that employed an optimal linear discriminant analysis algorithm for the
detection of PLI in the ECG signal [9].
Rahman et al. [10–12, range] employed Normalized Sign Regressor
Least Mean Square (NSRLMS), Normalized Sign Error Least Mean
Square (NSELMS), and Normalized Sign-Sign Least Mean Square
(NSSLMS) algorithms for canceling various artifacts such as base-
line wander, 60 Hz PLI, muscle artifacts, and motion artifacts from
the ECG signal. Rahman et al. [13] employed LMS, SRLMS, SELMS,
and SSLMS algorithms for canceling various artifacts as mentioned

above from the ECG signal. In [13], it is shown that the performance
of the SRLMS algorithm is superior to the LMS algorithm in terms
of SNR improvement. Rahman et al. [14] expanded the work in
[10–12, range] by employing Block-Based Normalized Sign Regressor
Least Mean Square (BBNSRLMS), Block-Based Normalized Sign Error
Least Mean Square (BBNSELMS), and Block-Based Normalized Sign-
Sign Least Mean Square (BBNSSLMS) algorithms for canceling various
artifacts as mentioned above from the ECG signal.
Islam et al. [15] added the four types of Alternating Current (AC)
and Direct Current (DC) interference/noise with ECG signals and nul-
lified these noises using the LMS and RLS algorithms. Vullings et al.
[16] developed an adaptive Kalman filter to enhance the quality of
the ECG signal. Dhubkarya et al. [17] implemented an adaptive noise
canceller for denoising an ECG signal and tested the performance of the
system using various algorithms such as LMS, Normalized Least Mean
Square (NLMS), and RLS. Chandrakar and Kowar [18] employed the
RLS algorithm for the removal of different kinds of noises from the
ECG signal. Kim et al. [19] proposed a motion artifact removal method
using a cascaded 2-stage LMS adaptive filter for an ambulatory ECG
monitoring system. Mugdha et al. [20] conducted a study of the RLS
algorithm in noise removal from ECG signals and concluded that the
RLS algorithm is more efficient in removing noises from ECG signals
than the LMS algorithm.
Ebrahimzadeh et al. [21] compared various kinds of ECG noise
reduction algorithms such as LMS, Block-Based Least Mean Square
(BBLMS), NLMS, Unbiased and Normalized Adaptive Noise Reduction
(UNANR), and RLS. Sharma et al. [22] used an adaptive noise canceller
that employs LMS algorithm for ECG noise removal and concluded
that an increase in the step-size increases the noise as well as the
rate of convergence. Satheeskumaran and Sabrigiriraj [23] proposed
a Variable Step Size Delayed Least Mean Square (VSSDLMS) adaptive
filter to remove the artifacts from the ECG signal. Sehamby and Singh
[24] used an LMS-based adaptive noise canceller to derive a noise-
free fetal ECG signal. Haritha et al. [25] surveyed different filters and
denoising techniques used for ECG signals. Qureshi et al. [26] proposed
a cascaded 3-stage adaptive noise canceller to eliminate three types of
artifacts from the ECG signal, viz. baseline wander, 60 Hz PLI, and
motion artifacts. The same algorithm was used in all three stages of
the cascaded adaptive noise canceller. The results of a cascaded 3-
stage LMS-based adaptive noise canceller were compared with those
of a cascaded 3-stage NLMS-based adaptive noise canceller, a cascaded
3-stage Log LMS-based adaptive noise canceller, and a cascaded 3-
stage SRLMS-based adaptive noise canceller. Warmerdam et al. [27]
proposed a fixed-lag Kalman smoother to filter PLI from ECG recordings
with minimal distortion of the ECG waveform.
Sutha and Jayanthi [28] discuss prototype hardware developed to
monitor and record the raw mother ECG signal containing the fetal
ECG and a signal processing algorithm to extract the fetal ECG. The
adaptive noise canceller employed in their work uses the SSLMS algo-
rithm [28]. Gilani et al. [29] employed an LMS-based adaptive noise
canceller to remove the 50 Hz PLI from the ECG signal. Venkatesan
et al. [30] studied a Delayed Error Normalized Least Mean Square
(DENLMS) adaptive filter with pipelined architecture to remove the
white Gaussian noise from the ECG signal. Srinivasa and Pandian
[31] eliminate the 50 Hz PLI from ECG signal using an LMS-based
adaptive noise canceller. Xiong et al. [32] have shown that the cosine-
based adaptive algorithm is superior to the standard LMS algorithm
in reducing the high amplitude motion artifact noise from the ECG
signal. Saxena et al. [33] remove the 50 Hz PLI from the ECG signal
using an NLMS-based adaptive noise canceller. Manju and Sneha [34]
performed ECG denoising using Weiner filter and Kalman filter. Their
results have shown that the Wiener filter performs better than the
Kalman filter for ECG noise removal. Khiter et al. [35] proposed a novel
adaptive denoising method called self correcting leaky normalized least
mean square algorithm with varied step size and leakage coefficient for
reducing the muscle artifacts from the ECG signal. Yadav et al. [36]
applied the symbiotic organisms search algorithm for estimating the
weight vectors of an optimized adaptive noise canceller for reducing
the artifacts from the ECG signal.
In this paper, we will employ a cascaded 4-stage adaptive noise
canceller to remove the four types of artifacts from the ECG signal,
viz. baseline wander, motion artifacts, muscle artifacts, and 60 Hz
PLI. The contributions of this paper are: (1) We first determine the
best performing adaptive algorithms in terms of SNR improvement
among the eight adaptive algorithms studied in this paper, viz. Least
Mean Square (LMS), Least Mean Fourth (LMF), Least Mean Mixed-Norm
(LMMN), Sign Regressor Least Mean Square (SRLMS), Sign Error Least
Mean Square (SELMS), Sign-Sign Least Mean Square (SSLMS), Sign
Regressor Least Mean Fourth (SRLMF), and Sign Regressor Least Mean
Mixed-Norm (SRLMMN) for removing the aforementioned four artifacts
from the ECG signal, (2) We then employ the four shortlisted algo-
rithms, viz. LMMN, LMF, LMMN, LMF in the proposed cascaded 4-stage
adaptive noise canceller for removing the aforementioned four artifacts
from the ECG signal, and (3) We then compare the performance of
the proposed cascaded 4-stage adaptive noise canceller employing the
LMMN, LMF, LMMN, LMF algorithms with those that employ the LMS,
LMS, LMS, LMS algorithms, the LMF, LMF, LMF, LMF algorithms, the
LMMN, LMMN, LMMN, LMMN algorithms, and the SRLMMN, SRLMF,
SRLMMN, SRLMF algorithms. We were able to achieve a significant
improvement in the SNR of the filtered ECG signal after the application
of our proposed scheme over other schemes. The remainder of this
paper is organized as follows. Various adaptive algorithms studied in
this paper are discussed in Section 2. The proposed cascaded 4-stage
adaptive noise canceller is discussed in Section 3. Simulation results
are discussed in Section 4. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 5.
2. Adaptive algorithms
In this work, we have studied eight adaptive algorithms, viz. LMS,
LMF, LMMN, SRLMS, SELMS, SSLMS, SRLMF, and SRLMMN for the
removal of multiple artifacts present in the ECG signal. The weight
update equations of these eight adaptive algorithms are given in Table 1
wherein 𝐰𝑖 ∈ R𝑀×1 is the updated weight vector at iteration 𝑖 ≥ 0, 𝑀 is
the adaptive filter length, 𝜇 is the step-size, 𝐮𝑖 ∈ R1×𝑀 is the regressor
or input vector with variance 𝜎2
𝑢, 𝛿 is the mixing parameter ranging
between 0 ≤ 𝛿 ≤ 1, 𝑒𝑖 is the estimation error given by
𝑒𝑖 = 𝑑𝑖 − 𝐮𝑖𝐰𝑖−1,

where 𝑑𝑖 is the desired value, and

⎪⎩
−1,
if 𝑥 < 0,
0,
if 𝑥 = 0,
1,
if 𝑥 > 0.
(2)
The LMMN algorithm is a combination of the LMS and LMF algorithms
as long as the mixing parameter is ranging between 0 < 𝛿 < 1. The
LMMN algorithm reduces to LMF and LMS algorithms when the mixing
parameter becomes zero and one, respectively.
The sign adaptive filters are used for the processing and analysis
of ECG signals as they are computationally less complex. However, the
performance of a sign adaptive filter is compromised because of the
clipping effect due to the application of signum function to either the
regressor vector, estimation error, or both. The SRLMS, SELMS, and
SSLMS algorithms are also known in the literature as the Sign Regressor
Algorithm (SRA), Sign Algorithm (SA), and Sign-Sign Algorithm (SSA),
respectively. The SRLMMN algorithm is a combination of the SRLMS
and SRLMF algorithms as long as the mixing parameter is ranging
between 0 < 𝛿 < 1. The SRLMMN algorithm reduces to SRLMF and
SRLMS algorithms when the mixing parameter becomes zero and one,
respectively. Note that the SRLMF [37] and SRLMMN [38] algorithms
were developed by us and are being employed in this work for the
removal of multiple artifacts present in the ECG signal.

3. Proposed cascaded 4-stage adaptive noise canceller
A single-stage adaptive noise canceller for removing a single artifact
from the ECG signal is shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen from this figure 𝑑𝑖
forms the primary input of the adaptive noise canceller, 𝑑𝑖 contains the
ECG signal with an additive artifact, 𝐮𝑖 forms the secondary or reference
input of the adaptive noise canceller, 𝐮𝑖 contains the reference artifact
that is correlated only with the artifact present in the corrupted ECG
signal 𝑑𝑖, 𝐰𝑖 are the adaptive filter coefficients, 𝑦𝑖 is the adaptive filter
output, and 𝑒𝑖 is the filtered ECG signal free from the artifact.
A proposed cascaded 4-stage adaptive noise canceller for removing
the four artifacts from the ECG signal is shown in Fig. 2. As can be
seen from this figure 𝑑𝑖1 forms the primary input of the first adaptive
noise canceller, 𝑑𝑖1 contains the ECG signal with four additive artifacts,
viz. baseline wander, motion artifacts, muscle artifacts, and 60 Hz PLI,
𝐮𝑖1 forms the secondary or reference input of the first adaptive noise
canceller, 𝐮𝑖1 contains the reference baseline wander that is correlated
only with the baseline wander present in the corrupted ECG signal 𝑑𝑖1,
𝐮𝑖2 forms the secondary or reference input of the second adaptive noise
canceller, 𝐮𝑖2 contains the reference motion artifacts that is correlated
only with the motion artifacts present in the corrupted ECG signal 𝑑𝑖1,
𝐮𝑖3 forms the secondary or reference input of the third adaptive noise
canceller, 𝐮𝑖3 contains the reference muscle artifacts that is correlated
only with the muscle artifacts present in the corrupted ECG signal 𝑑𝑖1,
𝐮𝑖4 forms the secondary or reference input of the fourth adaptive noise
canceller, 𝐮𝑖4 contains the reference 60 Hz PLI that is correlated only
with the 60 Hz PLI present in the corrupted ECG signal 𝑑𝑖1, 𝐰𝑖1 to
𝐰𝑖4 are the respective adaptive filter coefficients, 𝑦𝑖1 to 𝑦𝑖4 are the
respective adaptive filter outputs, 𝑒𝑖1 is the partially corrupted ECG
signal free from baseline wander, 𝑒𝑖1 will act as the primary input 𝑑𝑖2
to the second adaptive noise canceller, 𝑒𝑖2 is the partially corrupted
ECG signal free from baseline wander and motion artifacts, 𝑒𝑖2 will act
as the primary input 𝑑𝑖3 to the third adaptive noise canceller, 𝑒𝑖3 is
the partially corrupted ECG signal free from baseline wander, motion
artifacts, and muscle artifacts, 𝑒𝑖3 will act as the primary input 𝑑𝑖4 to
the fourth adaptive noise canceller and 𝑒𝑖4 is the filtered ECG signal
free from baseline wander, motion artifacts, muscle artifacts, and 60 Hz
PLI. One unique and powerful feature of our proposed cascaded 4-
stage adaptive noise canceller is that it employs only those adaptive
algorithms in the four stages, which are shown to be effective in the
subsequent section in removing the aforementioned four artifacts from
the ECG signal.

4. Simulation results
4.1. Baseline wander removal
In this experiment, the step-size is fixed at 𝜇 = 0.01, the adaptive
filter length is fixed at 𝑀 = 5, the noise variance is fixed at 𝜎2
𝑣 = 0.1,
and the number of iterations is fixed at 𝐿 = 10 for all the eight
adaptive algorithms studied. In addition to the above settings, the
mixing parameter is fixed at 𝛿 = 0.5 for the LMMN and SRLMMN
algorithms.
In this case, 3600 samples of the clean ECG signal are taken from
the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MITDB) Record: 105 [46], and they
are later added with the 3600 samples of baseline wander taken from
the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database (NSTDB) Record: bw [46].
All eight adaptive algorithms studied in this paper, viz. LMS, LMF,
LMMN, SRLMS, SELMS, SSLMS, SRLMF, and SRLMMN are tested sep-
arately by plugging them in a single-stage adaptive noise canceller as
described in Fig. 1 for baseline wander removal. The SNR before and
after adaptive filtering is recorded in Table 2. The SNR is calculated
by using the built-in MATLAB function, viz. 𝑠𝑛𝑟(𝑥, 𝑦). The SNR before
and after adaptive filtering in Table 2 is calculated as described by the
MATLAB code fragment in Appendix A. Here, 𝑦 is the adaptive filter
output. Note that the ECG signal and baseline wander have a gain of
200 each. Therefore, we divide these signals by 200 as shown in the
MATLAB code fragment in Appendix A.
As can be seen from Table 2 the LMMN algorithm outperforms the
other seven algorithms in terms of SNR improvement. The Mean Square
Error (MSE) plot after baseline wander removal using a single-stage
adaptive noise canceller employing the SSLMS adaptive algorithm,
which is the worst-case scenario among the eight algorithms studied
is shown in Fig. 3.
4.2. Motion artifacts removal
In this experiment, the step-size is fixed at 𝜇 = 0.01, the adaptive
filter length is fixed at 𝑀 = 5, the noise variance is fixed at 𝜎2
𝑣 = 0.1,
and the number of iterations is fixed at 𝐿 = 10 for all the eight
adaptive algorithms studied. In addition to the above settings, the
mixing parameter is fixed at 𝛿 = 0.5 for the LMMN and SRLMMN
algorithms.

adaptive noise canceller as described in Fig. 2 for removing base-
line wander, motion artifacts, muscle artifacts, and 60 Hz PLI from
the ECG signal, respectively. We then compare the performance of
the proposed cascaded 4-stage adaptive noise canceller employing the
LMMN, LMF, LMMN, LMF algorithms with that employing the LMS,
LMS, LMS, LMS algorithms, the LMF, LMF, LMF, LMF algorithms, the
LMMN, LMMN, LMMN, LMMN algorithms, and the SRLMMN, SRLMF,
SRLMMN, SRLMF algorithms. The SNR before and after adaptive fil-
tering is recorded in Table 6. As can be seen from this table, we
have achieved a significant improvement in the SNR by employing the
LMMN, LMF, LMMN, LMF algorithms in the proposed cascaded 4-stage
adaptive noise canceller. The SNR before and after adaptive filtering
in Table 6 is calculated as described by the MATLAB code fragment in
Appendix C. Here, 𝑦 is the adaptive filter output. Note that the ECG
signal, baseline wander, motion artifacts, and muscle artifacts have a
gain of 200 each. Therefore as before, we divide these signals by 200
as shown in the MATLAB code fragment in Appendix C.
As an example, in row 2 of Table 6, the LMMN algorithm is used
in adaptive noise cancellers 1 and 3 in Fig. 2 for removing baseline
wander and muscle artifacts, respectively. The LMF algorithm in row
2 of Table 6 is used in adaptive noise cancellers 2 and 4 in Fig. 2 for
removing motion artifacts and 60 Hz PLI, respectively. The MSE plot
after multiple artifacts removal using the proposed cascaded 4-stage
adaptive noise canceller employing the SRLMMN, SRLMF, SRLMMN,
SRLMF algorithms, which is the worst-case scenario among the al-
gorithms studied in Table 6 is shown in Fig. 7. The MSE plot after
multiple artifacts removal using the proposed cascaded 4-stage adaptive
noise canceller employing the LMMN, LMF, LMMN, LMF algorithms,
which is the best-case scenario among the algorithms studied in Ta-
ble 6 is shown in Fig. 8. Figs. 9(a) and 10(d) show the clean ECG
signal free from artifacts, Figs. 9(b) and 10(e) show the ECG signal
with additive baseline wander, motion artifacts, muscle artifacts, and
60 Hz PLI, Fig. 9(c) shows the filtered ECG signal from the proposed
cascaded 4-stage adaptive noise canceller employing the SRLMMN,
SRLMF, SRLMMN, SRLMF algorithms for multiple artifacts removal,
which is the worst-case scenario among the algorithms studied in
Table 6, and Fig. 10(f) shows the filtered ECG signal from the proposed
cascaded 4-stage adaptive noise canceller employing the LMMN, LMF,
LMMN, LMF algorithms for multiple artifacts removal, which is the
best-case scenario among the algorithms studied in Table 6. As can be
seen from Fig. 10(f) the LMMN, LMF, LMMN, LMF algorithms are found
to be effective in removing the respective multiple artifacts from the
ECG signal demonstrating our proposed scheme outperforms those in
the open literature, which primarily concentrate on LMS. It is worth
noting that the last three schemes in Table 6, viz. the LMF, LMF, LMF,
LMF algorithms, the LMMN, LMMN, LMMN, LMMN algorithms, and
the SRLMMN, SRLMF, SRLMMN, SRLMF algorithms have also not been
tested before in the literature.
5. Conclusions
From our experiments, we have found that the LMMN algorithm
is best suited for removing the baseline wander and muscle artifacts
and the LMF algorithm is best suited for removing the motion ar-
tifacts and 60 Hz PLI. We employed the LMMN, LMF, LMMN, LMF

to remove the respective ECG artifacts as mentioned above. We suc-
ceeded in achieving an SNR improvement of 12.7319 dBs, which is
better than the other compared methods. It is found that the pro-
posed cascaded 4-stage adaptive noise canceller employing the LMMN,
LMF, LMMN, LMF algorithms outperforms those that employ the LMS,
LMS, LMS, LMS algorithms, the LMF, LMF, LMF, LMF algorithms, the
LMMN, LMMN, LMMN, LMMN algorithms, and the SRLMMN, SRLMF,
SRLMMN, SRLMF algorithms in terms of SNR improvement. It is also
found that the performance of a single-stage adaptive noise canceller
employing the SSLMS algorithm is comparatively poor in terms of
SNR improvement as compared to the other seven algorithms studied
in this work, viz. LMS, LMF, LMMN, SRLMS, SELMS, SRLMF, and
SRLMMN. The different types of normalized adaptive algorithms and
their respective sign counterparts in identifying the best candidates for
the removal of multiple artifacts from the ECG signal using adaptive
filters in cascade as discussed in this work will be the subject of our
future studies.
