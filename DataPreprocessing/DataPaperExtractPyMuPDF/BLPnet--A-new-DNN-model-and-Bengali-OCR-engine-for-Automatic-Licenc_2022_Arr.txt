The development of the Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system has received much attention for
the English license plate. However, despite being the sixth-largest population around the world, no significant
progress can be tracked in the Bengali language countries or states for the ALPR system addressing their
more alarming traffic management with inadequate road-safety measures. This paper reports a computationally
efficient and reasonably accurate Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system for Bengali characters
with a new end-to-end DNN model that we call Bengali License Plate Network (BLPnet). The cascaded
architecture for detecting vehicle regions before vehicle license plate (VLP) is proposed to eliminate false
positives, resulting in higher detection accuracy of VLP. Besides, a lower set of trainable parameters is
considered for reducing the computational cost, making the system faster and more compatible for a real-time
application. With a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based new Bengali OCR engine and word-mapping
process, the model is characters-rotation invariant, and can readily extract, detect and output the complete
license plate number of a vehicle. The model feeding with 17 frames per second (fps) of real-time video
footage can detect a vehicle with the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0152, and the mean license-plate-
character recognition accuracy of 95%. While compared to the other models, an improvement of 5% and
20% were recorded for the BLPnet over the prominent YOLO-based ALPR model and the Tesseract model for
the number-plate detection accuracy and time requirement, respectively.
1. Introduction
Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) systems have received
much attention in modern transportation services mainly for automatic
management of traffic, parking, toll-station, and other road operations
including surveillance and recognition of potential threats [1]. An
ALPR system consists of three main phases: frame-selection, character-
segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR). The first phase
verifies the existence of any Vehicle License Plate (VLP) in the in-
put frame by extracting any possible character’s features from the
frame. The second phase separates the characters from the background,
followed by their recognition in the last phase. Such a system has
more potential for the developing countries or states requiring higher
road-safety measures and better traffic management.
One such potential group of the developing regions is the Bengali-
speaking countries and states that still requires a promising ALPR
system for the Bengali VLP application. Unlike English characters,

(T.B. Ovi).
Bengali has more complex features, leaving its accurate recognition
from a VLP more challenging. Despite being the six largest population
around the world [2], no significant progress can be tracked in the
Bengali language countries or states for the ALPR system, addressing
their inadequate road-safety measures and poor traffic management.
Besides, the performance of the prominent ALPR models developed
for the English VLP is also unknown for the Bengali VLP recognition
application.
Recent ALPR systems for English VLP captures the employment of
promising machine learning models. Such models mainly detects the
VLP in the given image (or a video frame) followed by the recognition
of the text information on the plate. A variety of models is stemmed
from the need for improving the classification accuracy, robustness
to environmental artifacts, and computational efficiency. For exam-
ple, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based bounding box
detectors were developed with regression algorithms [3–7], manual

annotation [8], and transfer learning [9]. Other development with
recurrent neural network (RNN) based architectures include the Bidi-
rectional Long short-term memory (BiLSTM) based models [10], and
real-time object detection algorithm, YOLO (You Only Look Once) and
its variants-based models [11–13]. The end-to-end cascaded and unified
architectures of the neural networks were also studied for the ALPR
systems [14–17].
However, Unlike the English VLP, the effort in developing the
ALPR systems for the Bengali VLP is particularly limited. Despite
much interest in developing Bengali handwriting, scripts and character
recognition in general, it has not captured the ALPR system yet. A few
notable developments of the ALPR systems for the Bengali VLP include
the feature extraction based on the digital curvelet transform [18],
Tesseract OCR [19], and CNN with Adam optimizer [20].
In summary, no Deep Neural Networks (DNN) model can be tracked
in the literature that can detect the Bengali VLP and recognize its
characters simultaneously. A few models only focused on the Bengali
character recognition [19,20], but their performance is unknown for
ALPR system. Although Tesseract and BornoNet have relatively high
character-recognition accuracy, they are not suitable for real-time ap-
plications like ALPR due to higher processing time. Unlike the above
models, Onim et al. [17] recently combined YoloV4 for detection of
VLP, and Tesseract as OCR engine. However, the model requires reason-
ably higher time for number plate detection and character recognition.
All these mean that the models developed for either Bengali VLP
detection or Bengali character recognition are generally limited with
low detection and recognition accuracy, and high computational complexity,
making them unsuitable for a real-time application.
In this paper, we, therefore, report an ALPR system with a new DNN
model that we call Bengali License Plate Network (BLPnet) (Section 3).
BLPnet is constructed to have three primary phases to significantly
reduce the computational cost and false-positives making the system
faster and more accurate by defining vehicle regions detection (in the
first phase) before VLP recognition (in the second phase). Particularly,
the contributions with the proposed three-phase ALPR system can be
summarized as follows:
• The NASNet-Mobile backbone architecture is redefined in the first
phase with more dense and pulling layers on the network-head
to identify the vehicles more efficiently with a region of interest
bounding-box (Section 3.1).
• An InceptionV3 architecture is customized in the second phase
with new dense and pulling layers for a more accurate and faster
detection of the VLP in the bounding-box region (Section 3.2).
• Finally, a new Bengali-OCR engine (Section 3.3) is introduced in
the third phase. Unlike the existing ALPR systems that cannot
adequately tackle the artefacts like motion-blur and non-uniform
shadow, the proposed engine employs de-blurring and Region
Scalable Fitting (RSF) based segmentation, which are optionally
invoked (i.e., when characters are not recognized) to better tackle
the intensity inhomogeneity.
2. Related ALPR systems
Development of several prominent ALPR systems for English VLP
can be tracked in the literature so far. Getting the VLP information
requires the localization and detection of the VLP. In CNN-based ap-
proach, features are extracted for VLP and then object localization is
done with bounding box detectors and regression algorithms [4,6].
Silva et al. [7] and Laroca et al. [5] used bounding box regression
to localize the object of interest with image coordinates using YOLO.
These are One-stage detection networks and relatively faster than other
detectors. But this approach is computationally inefficient as it requires
training darknet backbone of over 27𝑀 parameters.
Alternatively, VLP can also be semantically segmented using either
a CNN or deep segmentation network. Bulan et al. [3] proposed a real-
time complete CNN model having higher adaptability to tackle the
scene-variations requiring minimum possible human-intervention. An
image-based classification was proposed with weak-Snow and strong-
CNN classifiers. The first classifier was initially used for the region-
tagging of the possible number-plates, and the strong-CNN refined the
classification outputs for the actual number-plates Zhuang et al. [8]
proposed such a method where they segmented the VLP and the char-
acters in it. This approach also needs a manual annotation of characters
and LP. Besides these segmentation-based networks, segmentation-free
Networks have also been proposed. Wang et al. [6] proposed a Convolu-
tional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) and a multitask-license-plate
detection and recognition (MTLPR) model. Zou et al. [10] used Bi-LSTM
and directly localized characters without segmentation.
Both end-to-end cascaded and unified architectures have been used
for the ALPR system. Li et al. [16] used end-to-end trainable LP detec-
tion model that remains error-prone to challenging conditions and also
depends heavily on architectural design. On the other hand, cascaded
architectures have the flexibility of tuning and testing. Hsu et al. [14]
and Montazzolli et al. [15] proposed a cascaded architecture for real
time VLP detection and recognition. Huang et al. [9] introduced Trans-
fer learning into their CNN model to tackle the limited labeled data
for a high detection accuracy of VLP of 93%. Later, with a modified
YOLOv3 model with 10 CNNs, Chen et al. [11] attempted to detect
and recognize the VLP with an accuracy of about 98% and 78%,
respectively in a variety of conditions (i.e., rainy backgrounds, darkness
and dimness, and varied colors and saturation of photos).
In addressing several other environmental artefacts like poor-con-
trast and noisy images resulting from foggy, distortion and dusty con-
ditions, Al-Shemarry et al. [12] improved the accuracy of VLP detection
using a binary descriptor with contrast enhancement, leaving their
proposed system limited to real-time application with poor frame-rate
and higher computational cost. To tackle the motion artefacts (i.e.,
blurry input images), Zou et al. [10] recently proposed a Bi-LSTM
model with robust blur-kernel estimation that offered a reasonably
lower accuracy of 79.55%. Another recent development with object
bounding-box detection for ALPR system is YOLOv4 model [13], which
is a deep convolutional network that can localize VLPs with immense
frame rate and high accuracy.
Besides, on Bengali character detection and recognition, Majum-
dar et al. [18] proposed a feature extraction based on the digital
curvelet
transform.
Separate
𝑘-nearest
neighbor
classifiers
were
trained using the curvelet coefficients of an original image and its
morphologically changed copies. The overall recognition accuracy of
96.8% was reported while trained for twenty popular Bengali fonts
and tested for different font sizes. Later, Hasnat et al. [19] attempted
to introduce Bengali script in Tesseract OCR. Tesseract can learn new
languages or alphabets with training, along with existing languages for
character recognition.
Recently, Rabby et al. [20] presented a new 13-layer CNN model
called BornoNet for Bengali character recognition. The model was
designed with two sub-layers optimized using the Adam optimizer
Despite having relatively higher accuracy in the models for Bengali
character recognition, their applications to an ALPR system is not yet
studied. In addressing the potential gap of having a promising ALPR
system for Bengali VLP, we, therefore, develop and present a real-time
End-to-End DNN based model that we call BLPnet.
3. A new ALPR system with BLPnet
This section presents a newly developed BLPnet model for the ALPR
system. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the model consists of three main phases
that are cascaded together to detect the vehicle, VLP and recognize the
characters in it. It takes real-time video frames as input consisting of
vehicles and their surroundings. In the first phase, the vehicle region
is detected and distinguished using a bounding-box as the smallest
possible rectangle with vertical and horizontal sides that surround the
vehicle captured in a frame. The frames containing the bounding boxes

are fed to the VLP detection model along with the coordinates of
the bounding-box. Later, the second phase detects and extracts the
VLP contour, followed by the character localization and recognition in
the final phase. Consideration of intensity-inhomogeneity resilient seg-
mentation and effective deployment of these cascaded modules would
reduce the computational cost and false-positive predictions, improving
the accuracy and reliability of the system for a real-time application.
These phases are defined in the Algorithm 1 and discussed below, with
necessary mathematical modeling and more technical details.
3.1. An extended vehicle bounding-box detector
A NASNet-Mobile is extended and used as the backbone of our
DNN, followed by six hidden layers to improve the accuracy of vehicle
detection (see Fig. 2). The NASNet-Mobile is more computationally effi-
cient than its counterpart like the ResNet-based architecture that needs
higher hardware configuration, making it unsuitable for large-scale
deployment [21]. Thus, our model can be implemented on Field-
Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and other embedded devices to
balance hardware resources and processing speed. The TensorFlow (TF)
v2.4 framework was used for the overall construction of our CNN
model.
Unlike the YOLO algorithm [22] which calculates both class prob-
ability and bounding box coordinates, the final layer of our proposed
model only calculates the bounding box coordinates. The softmax acti-
vation function defined in Eq. (1) helps find the normalized coordinates
as an offset of the current grid cell.

detection. The number of times P𝑜𝑏𝑗
𝑖𝑗 equals 0 is the number of false

of bounding box detector are now briefly discussed below.
3.1.1. Dataset collection
For the training of the vehicle bounding-box detection model, we
used the Cars dataset [24] of Stanford AI Lab. There are 16,185 images
in the dataset, representing 196 different car classifications. The data is
divided into 8144 training images and 8041 testing images, with about
a 50-50 ratio between the two classes. Typically, classes are organized
by Make, Model, and Year, such as 2012-Tesla-Model-S or 2012-BMW-
M3-coupe. Each image in the dataset has also a bounding-box output
value as an ideal reference that suits our requirement.
3.1.2. Pre-processing
We considered a total of 8041 training images and passed them
through two preprocessing stages. At first, label-encoding and training-
validation split are done with 𝚝𝚛𝚊𝚒𝚗_𝚝𝚎𝚜𝚝_𝚜𝚙𝚕𝚒𝚝 (⋅) in Step 4 of Algo-
rithm 1. In this case, we made an 80–20 split. After the splitting, image
augmentation was done to simulate challenging conditions which the
real-time traffic video might face. The applied augmentations include:
rotate, shift, flip, varying contrast and blur with 𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚖_𝚛𝚘𝚝𝚊𝚝𝚎 (⋅),
𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚖_𝚜𝚑𝚒𝚏𝚝 (⋅),
𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚖_𝚏𝚕𝚒𝚙 (⋅),
𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚖_𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚝𝚛𝚊𝚜𝚝 (⋅)
and
𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚖_𝚋𝚕𝚞𝚛 (⋅). These augmentation processes are mentioned in
Step 5–Step 12 of Algorithm 1. After augmentation, the model is trained
and tuned.
3.1.3. Transfer learning (TL)
A pre-trained model (NASNet-Mobile) as the backbone architecture
of the proposed model ensures optimized training. Unlike the isolated
learning paradigm, transfer learning allows extending the pre-learned
features to adequately address the new related challenges. Particularly,
an average pooling layer usually can extract the pre-trained model’s
edge detection capability. From the final layer of shape (10×10×1056),
an average pooling layer is thus added, followed by a group of fully
connected dense layers and dropout layers. Finally, the output layers
identify the object and generate the bounding box coordinates. Thus,
our model was pre-trained with over fourteen million images from the
ImageNet dataset, which is now capable of categorizing images into
over 1000 different classes with transfer learning ability. As a result,
it has accumulated a library of rich feature sets for a wide variety of
classes.
3.1.4. Hyper-parameters and tuning
The training hyperparameters are given in Table 1. Finally, the
parameters with the best accuracy have been chosen after several
trials and errors. The optimizer that suits best for the VLP detection
is Stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We have also tweaked several
parameters of the optimizer for our dataset and defined early stop-
ping to reduce the training time. Additionally, Reduced Learning Rate
functionality has been used to further expedite the training process.
3.2. VLP detection with Inception-v3
We have also extended the Inception-v3 DNN architecture and em-
ployed it as the backbone of the second phase process of BLPnet for VLP
detection, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Inception-v3 is a CNN designed from
the Inception family that transports label-information to a lower level
of the network using label-smoothing, factorized 7 × 7 convolutions,
an auxiliary classifier, and batch-normalization for layers in the side
head. Inception architecture being 42 layers deep has 2.5 times lower
computational cost than that of GoogLeNet and can function well even
when memory and computational budgets were limited [26].
Forward propagation of training the neural network follows Eq. (3),
where 𝜎 is the activation function, 𝑋, 𝑊 , and 𝑏 are the inputs, weights,

We have used an annotated dataset of 1500 training and 300 validation
images to train our model. From real-world video footage taken on
roadways in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with varying road conditions, includ-
ing high traffic congestion, the VLP were detected with reasonably
higher accuracy (see Section 4). The training began with some itera-
tions set at 6000. The average loss did not diminish significantly after
2000 iterations, and after every 1000 cycles, the training was capable
of taking the weight back up. To reduce training duration, we thus used
early stopping.
3.3. A new Bengali-OCR engine
This step recognized characters in the extracted VLP from the
previous step. Similar to [27], we considered the character-recognition
as an object-recognition problem. By treating characters as objects, the
character segmentation and recognition steps are integrated and consist
of a total of 5 convolutional 2D layers with 16, 32, 64, 128 and 512
nodes. Each of them includes a preceding max-pooling layer with a pool
size of 2 and a dropout layer with a drop rate of 20%. The dropout
layers were used to prevent the model from over-fitting. The kernel size
of 2 is considered with necessary padding. Relu activation function is
used for all the backbone layers. Finally, a global-average pooling layer
is included before the output layer, followed by two dense layers. Two
important considerations of this model are the conditional use of de-
blurring filter and intensity inhomogeneity invariant segmentation of
the character.
Blurring is known to be a key challenge in VLP recognition resulting
from wrong focusing or vehicle motion that requires restoration of the
blurred images for higher accuracy in character recognition. A set of
filters like Wiener filter, Total Variation (TV) deblurring, Haar deblur-
ring and a combination of both is considered for restoring any blurred
image to its estimated original version. For an input image, 𝐼𝑚[𝑛], let
the output of the filter is 𝑥[𝑛] as in (6a), where 𝐺(𝑧) is the filter function,
𝑁 is the number of past taps with coefficient 𝑎, 𝑠[𝑛] is the reference
signal, and 𝑒[𝑛] is the residual error. The criteria to minimize the mean
squared error (MSE) for the coefficient is defined in (6b), where 𝐸[.]
is the expectation operator. On the other hand, Haar deblurring [28]
uses a deconvolution filter and reduce the MSE as in (7), where 𝐼(𝑖, 𝑗) is
the expected and 𝐺(𝑖, 𝑗) is the desired deblurred images. In our model,
we have designed a conditional deblurring process invoked when not
enough characters are detected in the OCR. An iterative approach is
employed for this process with a varying threshold based on the Fast-
Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) [29] in the VLP
image.

Additionally, we have considered the intensity inhomogeneity in-
variant segmentation of the characters. Thus, we extracted the char-
acters from the VLP with two segmentation models: the Chan & Vese
(CV) model and the Region-Scalable Fitting (RSF) model (see Table 5
in Section 4). As most of the images for VLP have very high con-
trast, CV model performed well in approximating the intensities of
the foreground or object and background. In the case of intensity
inhomogeneity, the CV model used the RSF model and failed to segment
the characters.
The complete architecture is illustrated in Fig. 4. The output layer
contains 60 classes to capture the total number of Bengali alphabets
and digits. The output layer uses Softmax as an activation function. We
have also used CMATERdb version 3.1.2 for training the alphabets for
the digits. A total alphabet-images of 15000 and digits of 500 have been
split as follows: 9900 images for training, 2600 images for validation,
and 3000 images for testing.
The images are then augmented so that the model can identify
images under non-ideal conditions. The following augmentations are
considered: (i) 10% shift in left and 10% shift in right; (ii) 10% shift in
vertical and 10% shift in horizontal; (iii) 7.5◦ rotation in left and 7.5◦
in right; (iv) zoom range 20%; and, (v) Shear range 20%. Besides, each
character illustrated in Fig. 5 is resized to 16 × 16 after segmentation
before passing through the network. As a result, this network can work
with variable size characters.

models: Li et al. [25], Hendry & Chen [11], Zou et al. [10], and
Onim et al. [17]. This section starts with the analysis of the model
complexity followed by the results are discussed in three main parts,
namely, for vehicle detection, VLP detection and finally, for the OCR
and word-mapping.
4.1. Model complexity: Trainable parameters
The complexity of a model is measured by the number of trainable
parameters, i.e., the number of neurons and the number and weights
of connections between neurons from layer to layer. A dense layer
with m input-nodes and n output-nodes will have a total of (𝑛 + 1) × 𝑚
learnable parameters. The pooling layers and dropout layers do not
learn anything. For convolutional layers with p feature maps in input
and q feature maps as output, having a filter size of 𝑖×𝑗 will have total
learnable parameters of (𝑖 × 𝑗 × 𝑝 + 1) × 𝑞.
The distribution of trainable parameters for the bounding box detec-
tor across the network is noted in Table 2. The total number of trainable
parameters is calculated using Eq. (8). Similarly, Table 3 shows the
trainable parameters for our OCR engine. Here Layers denotes the name
and operation of added layers, Shape denotes the input shape of tensors
for that particular layer and finally the trainable parameter for that
layer.

Fig. 6. Loss vs Epoch curve for the first 50 epochs.
Fig. 6, we observe that the model can quickly converge to a lower
loss value. After a while, the improvement gets very slow. The best
training loss and MSE of the bounding-box were 0.0130 and 0.0155,
respectively, and the validation loss and MSE were 0.0148 and 0.0152,
respectively. Overall training parameters with their respective epochs
are presented in Table 4. We observe in this table that after 300
epochs, the rate of change in loss and accuracy is becoming saturated
which indicates the completion of model fitting. Compared to the
YOLO model, the hyper-parameters were kept similar as shown earlier
in Table 1. All these observations suggest that our proposed model
would effectively detect the vehicles in the input video clips. The final
predicted output of the model applied in random vehicles is shown in
Fig. 7(a) with the successful demarcation of green boxes.
4.3. VLP detection
Our model was evaluated using both real-time and pre-recorded
video clips. Table 1 shows the hyper-parameters used to train the
network. Our model did not over-fit due to the use of adequate dropout
and pooling layers, and thus, it took little time to train and converge to
an optimum detection level. During the evaluation, the performance of
the model was monitored in real-time.
Our algorithm successfully detected VLP as a few examples are
illustrated in Fig. 7(b), where VLP is marked with a blue bounding
box that was generated from the x-y coordinates and height-width
values. A VLP was detected from the varying orientation of the detected
vehicle and at that time, 17 frames per second processing speed were
maintained on average. Such accurate detection was observed for all
the testing video clips with resolution 1920 × 1080 and frames per
second (fps) of 15 and 20.
Similar to the vehicle detection with the bounding box (Section 3.1),
the VLP detection training loss and MSE of the bounding-box were
0.013 and 0.016, respectively and the validation loss and MSE were
0.015 and 0.015, respectively. No false-positive detection was recorded
during the process, which justifies the effectiveness of the previous
phase.

4.4. Character recognition
The overall procedure can be broken down into three steps. First
is the preprocessing step, where the image is filtered based on the
sharpness. Later, in character segmentation, the fast active contour
model segments the characters as objects. Finally, a word mapping
follows the character recognition. Here, for each group of key char-
acters recognized, a predefined word is mapped for them. Our model’s
generated character output is shown in Fig. 8.
Our proposed OCR engine demonstrated reasonably better accuracy,
as it treated the characters as objects. The accuracy varies from 80%
to 95% based on the number of characters extracted. The time it takes
to extract a character varies between 0.302 to 0.502 seconds. Initially,
the model was weak against some vowels. This weakness was tackled
successfully with word mapping (see Fig. 8). Here, detected letters
are turned into words with predefined symbols. It is seen that similar
license plate reading is captured after the segmentation of both RSF
and CV models. Detailed performance analysis is given in Table 5. The
accuracy decreases with the increase in the number of characters.
The performance of the proposed model is compared with the other
prominent models in Table 6. Considering the nullified False-Positives,
lower computational complexity, reduced trainable parameters, and
reasonably higher accuracy, the proposed model has demonstrated a
higher potential for a real-time ALPR application.
5. Conclusion
The development of an ALPR system is a timely requirement for
modern transportation services. However, despite being the sixth-
largest population around the world, no significant progress can be
tracked in the Bengali language countries or states for the ALPR system
addressing their inadequate road-safety measures and poor traffic man-
agement. To this end, we have presented a computationally efficient
and reasonably accurate BLPnet model for a new ALPR system. The
model is designed to efficiently and correctly return the VLP number
by considering a three-phase top-to-bottom approach. This means, the
model starts by detecting the vehicle first, and then any possible VLP
followed by the recognition of characters in the VLP. This consideration

is observed to be more effective with lower-computational time and
accuracy than the prominent ALPR systems.
Moreover, the model generates the actual license number of the
vehicle from the recognized characters using our simple, yet effective
mapping algorithm with a set of predefined cases of registration area-
codes. The model also performed well without compromising accuracy
to tackle challenging conditions that cause rotated, blurry or noisy
frames at the input. The preliminary results with the reasonably faster
and accurate performance of the model suggest that it would be promis-
ing for the real-time ALPR application, with a continuing development
in the future.
