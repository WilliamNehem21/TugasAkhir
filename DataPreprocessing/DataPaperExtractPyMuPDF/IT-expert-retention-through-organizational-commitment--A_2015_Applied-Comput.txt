Abstract
Organizational commitment has been studied extensively world over
and hundreds of research articles are available however a few studies address
organizational commitment in IT sector high technology employees. In Pakistan
insufﬁcient research is available speciﬁc to IT sector employees. The present
study is an attempt to better describe these factors which can induce organiza-
tional commitment in Pakistani IT sector high technology employees.
Previous studies in different countries validate that compensation; training and
development and supervisor support induce organizational commitment in high
technology employees, which increases employee retention. These factors were
tested in IT sector organizations in Pakistan, ﬁndings of present study estab-
lished that in Pakistan for IT professional’s compensation, training and develop-
ment and supervisor support is signiﬁcantly correlated with organizational
commitment.

1. Introduction
Managing turn over is a increasing challenge especially for companies employing
high technology professionals (Dockel, 2001). Managers have to bolster IT profes-
sionals’ sense of self-worth by treating them as intellectual assets, not operating
expenses, and by helping them shape and direct their careers, so they can gain
experience within the enterprise rather than outside it (Pare´ and Tremblay, 2000).
The above ﬁndings of some researches conducted on of high technology IT pro-
fessionals validate that their retention is becoming difﬁcult for business managers
and organizations are interested in ﬁnding out ways which can induce organiza-
tional commitment in IT sector high technology employees and reduce turn over.
The studies conducted in this regard found signiﬁcant relationships between orga-
nizational commitment and employee retention factors like compensation, train-
ing and development and supervisor support. Dockel (2001) conducted a
research in this regard however this research was speciﬁc to telecom industry
and South African working environment. Hence it cannot be applied globally
or in any other country like Pakistan.
Pakistan is a developing country with less opportunities due to which high tech-
nology employees always try to avail a better opportunity that makes retention of
high technology employees more complex and difﬁcult job for a manager. Hence
present study explains relationship of some signiﬁcant factors in Pakistani public
sector IT professionals, which can induce organizational commitment.
2. Review of literature
A number of articles were reviewed to study the importance of employee retention,
organizational commitment with speciﬁc reference to high technology employees
IT sector. The literature review clearly establishes relation ship between factors
like Compensation, training and Development and Supervisor Support on Orga-
nizational Commitment.
2.1. Compensation
Compensation has a strong and signiﬁcant relationship to organizational commit-
ment (Dockel, 2001). Indeed, more an employee perceives a high level of internal
equity (in comparison with other employees of the same department and/or the
same company) and external equity (in comparison with individuals occupying
IT-expert retention through organizational commitment
61
a similar job in other organizations) in regard to issues such as compensation and
beneﬁts, performance evaluation, promotions, and mandates, the less they will
intend to leave current employer (Pare´ and Tremblay, 2000). Because of the high
technology employees commitment to their team, group based pay may result in
more commitment to organization (Dockel, 2001). Earning was found to be not
signiﬁcant though it is positively related to continuance commitment (Johns,
2005). Employees constantly review if their salary is still competitive (Dockel,
2001). Those in the highest ranks calculate costs and beneﬁts, which may impact
their thoughts of leaving (Moynihan et al., 2000).
In addition to above there are researches which suggest that one should not
organizations should not solely rely on compensation, e.g., A retention strategy
that solely focuses on compensation conditions and beneﬁts is not likely to favor
commitment and loyalty of employees and offer any guarantee in satisfaction and
retention. Further, such a strategy is not likely to compensate for the lack of pro-
fessional recognition and chances of advancement and for a little stimulating IT
job (Pare´ and Tremblay, 2000). While a focus on competitive pay packages to
attract and retain talented cadres is clearly effective in manifesting job motivation,
complimentary strategic HR practices are profoundly important in reducing staff
turnover (Chew, 2005). Commitment stemming from economic and pragmatic
considerations
may
actually
lead
to
poor
performance
and
leadership
(Moynihan et al., 2000). Merely increasing wages will increase individual’s percep-
tion of low alternatives but has no impact on improving the alignment of employee
goals with the organization (Iverson and Buttigieg, 1999).
These diverse ﬁndings highlight importance of compensation. It needs to be
tested whether organizational commitment in Pakistani IT professionals can solely
be induced through compensation or there are some other factors in addition to
compensation. However literature review strongly establishes relationship between
organizational commitment and compensation. Hence in present study Compen-
sation is one of the independent variable and its relationship with Organizational
commitment will be seen in the ﬁndings.
H1: Compensation is signiﬁcantly and positively related to Organizational
Commitment
2.2. Training and development
Employee development programs play a signiﬁcant role in job satisfaction which
helps lead to retention (Shelton, 2001). Training, development opportunities and
career opportunities were not found to have direct impact of organizational com-
mitment in high technology industry This ﬁnding is contrary to many other ﬁnd-
ings in high technology industry (Dockel, 2001). Training is too often seen as a
perk when it should be seen as essential investment in the intellectual capital of
62
S.M.M.R. Naqvi, S. Bashir
the organization. This is true in every professional ﬁeld, but is perhaps more acute
in IT (Pare´ and Tremblay, 2000). Proper training of managers and supervisors to
recognize proﬁle of each individual coupled with training in how to turn around
perception that the organization controls can considerably improve retention
efforts (Rossi, 2000). Organizations should have a process for encouraging, plan-
ning and investing in high technology employee’s professional development
(Dockel, 2001). Training, support for training and motivation to learn were signif-
icantly and positively associated with overall commitment and its types, i.e., affec-
tive commitment and normative commitment (Ahmad and Bakar, 2003).
Thus Training and Development has emerged as one of important independent
variable having relationship with organizational commitment. Hence it is taken in
the present research and its impact on organizational commitment in Pakistani IT
professionals will be tested.
H2: Training & Development is signiﬁcantly and positively related to Organiza-
tional Commitment
2.3. Supervisor support
Indeed, it seems that a successful employee whose work performance is recognized
by his superiors and his peers will tend to do more than what is formally required
of him (Pare´ and Tremblay, 2000). For high technology employees supervisor sup-
port gives them a chance to make difference on job, try out new skills and receive
feed back on performance (Dockel, 2001). Employees emotional attachment to,
identiﬁcation with, and involvement in the organization is positively related to
supervisor care and concerns about their employees, opinion, values and general
well being (Soulen, 2003). The perception of the employees that the organization
does support them is with strongest positive correlation with affective commitment
(Mayer et al., 2002) where as supervisor relationships had a more and stronger
relationship to turnover intention (Raabe and Beehr, 2003). These ﬁndings are suf-
ﬁcient to argue that supervisor support is strongly related with organizational
commitment and due to its relationship it is one of the independent variables
and its relationship with organizational commitment will be tested in Pakistani
IT professionals.
H3: Supervisor Support is signiﬁcantly and positively related to Organizational
Commitment
But while seeing the relationship of these factors it is important to note that
retention is not for every one. For example one research suggests that would be
a mistake to believe that organizations should attempt to retain each and every
employee-especially in today’s economic turmoil. The challenges that confront
mangers are therefore not only how to minimize the possibility of loosing good
IT-expert retention through organizational commitment
63
employees, but also how to identify the employees and organization needs and
wants to keep (Kreisman, 2002).
All the above literature review identiﬁed three important independent variables
and all of them have relationship with the dependent variable Organizational com-
mitment. It is the employee’s emotional attachment, identiﬁcation with, and
involvement in a particular organization. The major contribution in deﬁning orga-
nizational commitment and its components is by Allen and Meyer (1990) who
have described three types of Organizational commitment as affective, normative
and continuance. All three forms of organizational commitment are negatively
correlated with withdrawl cognition, turnover intention and turn over (Mayer
et al., 2002). Managers must keep in mind that IT specialists who identify them-
selves and feel emotionally attached to their organization and/or work unit are
those who risk least to leave (Pare´ and Tremblay, 2000). Organizational commit-
ment was revealed to be negatively related to turnover intentions (Lee, 2000).
Affective commitment constitutes the primary predictor of turnover intentions.
IT specialists grant a lot of importance for the alignment between their own values
and those conveyed by management and they look for a work environment or
milieu which will allow them to develop a strong feeling of belonging (Pare´ and
Tremblay, 2000). Job involvement, Organizational commitment are negatively
related to turn over intention (Sjoberg and Sverke, 2000). Organizations that focus
on different retention strategies that tap into different mind sets of commitment
might have a better chance of retaining key employees (Irving et al., 2002). The
organizational commitment has also macro level implications. Organizations with
weak commitment are often less productive and if this occurs broadly throughout
a number of organizations then quality of products and services may decline
(Johns, 2005). Thus research on organizational commitment can also specify
causes of low quality products in Pakistan (Fig. 1).

naire was based on well tested questionnaire like Allen and Myers Organizational
commitment questionnaire (OCQ). Dockel (2001) used similar questionnaire to
ﬁnd out the Organizational Commitment in high technology employees in South
Africa. The questionnaire with some modiﬁcations as per local requirements of
Pakistan was used. Since the questionnaire was successfully used in previous stud-
ies and well tested by researchers on internal consistency and other measures hence
in the present study the same questionnaire was used to test the level of organiza-
tional commitment in Pakistani IT sector professionals. Participants had to indi-
cate their agreement with each item on ﬁve point Likert scales (endpoints:
1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree).
Questionnaires were printed and given to the heads of the respective human
resources departments of each organization. Participation was anonymous to have
an impartial opinion. The questionnaires were accompanied by a covering letter
explaining the conﬁdentiality and importance of this research.
3.2. Participants
There are a number of public sector IT organizations in Pakistan out of which
nine IT organizations were selected in this study.

4. Results
4.1. Characteristics of target population
Although these selected organizations employed thousands of employees but the
professional Information Technology employees were in limited numbers. A total
of 85 IT professionals were serving in these organizations and due to their limited
number whole population was taken as sample. Out of these respondents 77
responded making response rate 90%. Keeping in view the limited number of
IT professionals in public sector organizations the sample is sufﬁcient for analysis
of various results.
4.2. Discussion and ﬁndings
4.2.1. Discussion and ﬁndings (Table 1)
Most of the respondents were male and they constituted 82% of the total popula-
tion. Being a relatively new ﬁeld in Pakistan the number of female IT professionals
is low in Pakistani organizations.

4.2.2. Discussion and ﬁndings (Table 2)
Most of the respondents were young and more than 60% were between the age of
25–35 years.
4.2.3. Discussion and ﬁndings (Table 3)
The frequencies of qualiﬁcation show that 77% of the respondents possess masters
or higher qualiﬁcation. The reason for this percentage is that only High Technol-
ogy IT professionals were included in this study. This is also a reason why total
sample size was 77 out of thousands of employees. Many respondents also possess
professional IT certiﬁcations (not shown in this table).
4.2.4. Discussion and ﬁndings (Table 4)
Majority of respondents (64%) are married. Thus majority of the respondents
have spouse and children responsibilities as well.
4.2.5. Discussion and ﬁndings (Table 5)
The ﬁndings in Table 5 indicate that 44.2% of the respondents have shown their
native language as Urdu which is also the national language of Pakistan. Punjab is
the biggest province of Pakistan and 27.3% respondents have shown their native
language as Punjabi. Some foreign nationals are also working in these IT organi-
zations showing their native language as English.
4.2.6. Discussion and ﬁndings (Table 6)
As already highlighted at Table 2 most of the respondents are young. Table 7
regarding tenure indicate that 61% respondents have a tenure up to four years
in their respective organizations. Thus study gives a better understanding of level
of organizational commitment of young IT professionals in Pakistan.
4.2.7. Discussion and ﬁndings (Table 7)
The purpose of Table 7 is to have an idea about involvement of IT professionals in
important issues like salary. The results indicate that level of IT professionals
involvement is just 13% and the organizations are taking important decisions
about IT professionals without involving them.
4.3. Inter correlation of the variables
The Pearson correlation ﬁndings show that all the Independent variables, i.e., Pay,
Supervisor support and Training and Development are positively and signiﬁcantly
related to Organizational Commitment.

4.3.1. Discussion and ﬁndings (Table 8)
Out of different demographics age and tenure were used to ﬁnd out if they have any
impact on the level of organizational commitment of IT professionals in Pakistan.
The discussion for Tables 2 and 6 indicate that, majority of the respondents were
young having up to four years tenure in their respective organizations. According
to correlation analysis age has no signiﬁcant relationship with Organizational com-
mitment in IT professionals that shows that the age has no effect because the
behavior pattern regarding commitment is the same because all of the equally wait
for better opportunities in a developing country like Pakistan (0.105). This argu-
ment is further strengthened by the correlation value of organizational tenure
(0.021) which is insigniﬁcant and shows no matter how long a professional is with
the organization when ever a better opportunity is around it will be availed. These
values indicate that IT professional’s organizational commitment in Pakistan has
weak link with age and tenure, i.e., with more experience within the organizations
and increase in age organizational commitment remains un-affected. Dockel (2001)
argues age and tenure are not correlated with any form of commitment. Similarly
these ﬁndings are also supported by Mathebula (2004) who found no correlation
between organizational commitment and demographics like age and tenure.
According to Correlation Analysis Compensation has a signiﬁcant relationship
with organizational commitment (0.30**, **p < 0.01). Dockel (2001) also found a
signiﬁcant relationship between Compensation and overall Organizational Com-
mitment (0.37**,
**p < 0.01). Thus results are supported by Dockel (2001).
Johns (2005) also found positive relationship between earning and continuance
commitment, however it was not signiﬁcant. However the response from the IT
professionals in the questionnaires indicated that majority IT professionals were
not satisﬁed with their salary structure. As highlighted in Table 7 about 87% of
IT professionals feel that they are not involved in salary related issues. Thus the
Public sector organizations make decisions about different salary related issued
of IT professionals without involving them which can be a major cause for their
dissatisfaction with salary. Being the backbones of public sector IT organizations
they must be involved in incentive schemes to increase their level of Organizational
Commitment and retention in these organizations.
The relationship between Supervisor support and organizational commitment is
also signiﬁcant (0.340**, **p < 0.01). Dockel (2001) also found a relationship
between Supervisor Support and overall Organizational Commitment (0.36**,
**p < 0.01). The IT professional feel that they are praised on positive performance
by their boss. They are provided with a feed back on their performance. The ﬁnd-
ings are supported by Dockel (2001) and Soulen (2003). Raabe and Beehr (2003)
also found a negative relationship between supervisor support and turnover inten-
tion. Recognition on job well done intrinsically motivates individuals so the orga-
nizations should take such steps that IT professionals are not under valued.
Moreover organizations should devise a mechanism so that efforts of IT
IT-expert retention through organizational commitment
69
professionals towards organizational objectives are acknowledged and seen posi-
tively by the supervisors.
The relationship between Training and development and organizational com-
mitment is also signiﬁcant (0.349**, **p < 0.01). These ﬁndings are supported by
Shelton (2001) but Dockel (2001) did not found a signiﬁcant relationship though
it was positive. The response from questionnaire indicate that the IT professionals
feel they are not being provided the job related training and sufﬁcient time is not
allocated for this training. These professionals are working in an industry where
new technology is replacing the existing technology quite swiftly and training is
the only way through which these professionals can update their knowledge about
the new technologies. Hence the organizations should devise a detailed training
program after necessary need assessment and allocate sufﬁcient time for training
of these professionals.
5. Conclusion
Majority of the studies were conducted measuring the relationship of three com-
ponents of organizational commitment, i.e., Normative, Continuance and affec-
tive components with different variables such as pay, Job characteristics,
Supervisor support etc. and some also found the relationship between organiza-
tional commitment and these factors as a whole. Since no such study was con-
ducted on Information Technology (IT) professional in Pakistan the study
found the relationship of three variables, i.e., Pay, Supervisor support and Train-
ing and Development on Organizational commitment as whole.
The ﬁrst hypothesis of present study was that compensation is signiﬁcantly and
positively related to organizational commitment. From the above discussions and
signiﬁcant correlation values it is established that among high technology IT pro-
fessionals in Pakistan compensation is signiﬁcantly and positively related to orga-
nizational commitment. Thus hypothesis one is established.
The second hypothesis intended to ﬁnd out positive and signiﬁcant relation ship
between organizational commitment and training and development. The ﬁndings
clearly indicate that training is signiﬁcantly and positively related to organiza-
tional commitment. Hence hypothesis two is also established.
The third hypothesis of the study was that supervisor support is signiﬁcantly
and positively related to Organizational Commitment. The results obtained by
correlation analysis clearly establishes the hypothesis that supervisor support is
signiﬁcantly and positively related to Organizational Commitment.
In their conclusion, Pare´ and Tremblay (2000) argued that IT specialists should
not be managed as disposable productive resources but considered as humans with
speciﬁc needs and interests such as equity and justice, opportunity to learn and
innovate, recognition of peers and managers, attainment of new levels of respon-
sibility, and empowerment. We support this statement with the view that the role
of IT professionals is becoming increasingly important for organizations through
70
S.M.M.R. Naqvi, S. Bashir
out the world and in Pakistan as well. The business mangers should devise such
HR policies that these professionals ﬁnd them at a place where they have a com-
pensation package which is competitive to any other organization. IT profession-
als must be provided trainings frequently not only for their personal development
but also to gain the competitive advantage through latest technologies. The super-
visors of these IT professionals should recognize that managing IT professionals is
different than other professionals; they should be involved in decision making to
increase level of organizational commitment.
It is also important to note that many developed countries are offering attrac-
tive immigrations to IT professionals at priority which is causing a brain drain
from Pakistan. Based on above ﬁndings immediate measures are required at the
Government level for retention of this intellectual capital not only in the organi-
zations but also in Pakistan.
6. Future studies
The literature review indicated that there a number of other factors which affect
Organizational Commitment of IT professionals. The following future studies
are recommended:
(i) Factors like Job characteristics, Career opportunities and Work life Polices
etc can also be used to see their relationship with organizational commitment.
(ii) A larger sample from different cities of Pakistan can also be collected for
same study.
(iii) A large number of IT professionals are working in Private sector. Their
response on similar variables can be obtained to have a comparison of level
of organizational commitment of Public sector and private sector IT profes-
sionals in Pakistan.
