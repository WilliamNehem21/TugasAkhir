The widespread availability of affordable head-mounted displays and easy access to virtual reality (VR) appli-
cations and games has signiﬁcantly increased the use of such technology by the general public. Thus there is
increasing interest in determining any risks of using such technology and any aftereffect from exposure. Head-
mounted display manufacturers provide general usage guidance but this is ad hoc and there is limited recent
evidence comparing early virtual environment studies with experiences from modern head-mounted displays. The
primary objective of this study was to explore response activation and inhibition after participants experienced a
typical virtual environment in a head-mounted display. Reaction times were collected with a robust cued go/nogo
test as pre- and post-tests. Participants (n ¼ 22, female ¼ 11) played Minecraft VR for 15 minutes using an Oculus
Rift headset. In contrast to other studies, the results showed no signiﬁcant impact on reaction times across
response activation or inhibition. However, evidence of participant fatigue in the reaction time tests was found.
This work conﬁrms safe use of virtual reality experiences in modern head-mounted displays for short duration
exposures and identiﬁes issues with reaction time testing that are in need of further investigation.
1. Introduction
There is increasing use of virtual reality technology and the immer-
sive experiences that such technology can provide. Much of this has been
driven by the advent of affordable, commercially available virtual reality
(VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) [1]. HMDs encapsulate the visual
senses and provide the user with altered, i.e. virtual, experiences. These
experiences can be very realistic and many users experience states of
presence and immersion [2]. However, a signiﬁcant portion of the pop-
ulation suffer negative effects from VR technology use, commonly
referred to as cybersickness [3]. This can happen in situ and linger post
usage. Cybersickness is associated with feelings of illness, discomfort,
dizziness and unease [4]. With the widespread availability of VR tech-
nology there is a need to quantify any negative impacts and consider
health and safety implications [5,6], even for short exposures. Although
there is considerable research on cybersickness, there has been less
attention paid to the impact on behavioural control, inhibitory effects [7]
and reaction time, or “speed of action” [8]. Our concern is the impact on
post VR exposure activities that rely on such activation mechanisms for
information processing, for example driving vehicles or cycling.
Inhibitory effects have been researched over numerous substance
exposures, for example alcohol [7], cocaine [9] and energy drinks with
and without alcohol [10]. The current work explores HMD usage for
immersive virtual environments as the exposure condition. Our research
follows Fillmore’s protocol [7] with two primary measures of interest
being participant’s failures to inhibit responses (failures of response in-
hibition) and their speed of responding (response activation) after
experiencing a short exposure (15 min) to an immersive virtual envi-
ronment. The aim is not to deﬁne new HMD guidelines but to provide an
evidence-based approach to measuring the impact of short duration HMD
usage. Contributions of this work include (i) measuring HMD impact in a
realistic real-world use of VR technology, in this case use of commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software, and duration of use within
VR manufacturers’ guidelines, and (ii) use of a robust reaction time test
and protocol [7] to determine the impact of VR technology on activation
mechanisms for information processing.
2. Background
2.1. Guidance on the use of virtual reality technology
Currently there are no deﬁnitive recommendations for duration use of
VR technologies and the makers of HMD technology note a variety of
advice. Often recommendations are that users should limit their time in

HMDs and take frequent breaks. However, what constitutes a good
“limit” is unclear as the impact of VR technology can depend on the
technology used, the nature of the environment being experienced [11]
and the physical, cognitive and emotional state of the user [4]. An ad hoc
time guide of 15 minutes for initial exposure to new VR environments is
typically used. Example guidance with common HMD technology
include:
� Oculus Rift: “Ease into the use of the headset to allow your body to
adjust; use for only a few minutes at a time at ﬁrst, and only increase
the amount of time using the headset gradually as you grow accus-
tomed to virtual reality.” “Take at least a 10–15 min break every 30
min, even if you don’t think you need it. Each person is different, so
take more frequent and longer breaks if you feel discomfort. You
should decide what works best for you.” [12].
� HTC VIVE: “Prolonged, uninterrupted use of the product should be
avoided. It may negatively impact hand-eye coordination, balance,
and/or cause other negative effects. While using the product
frequently and for prolonged periods of time, you may experience
tiredness or soreness in your muscles, joints, or other body parts. Take
regular breaks from using the product. The length and frequency of
necessary breaks may vary from person to person.” [13].
� Samsung Gear VR: “Ease into the use of the Gear VR to allow your
body to adjust; use for only a few minutes at a time at ﬁrst, and only
increase the amount of time using the Gear VR gradually as you grow
accustomed to virtual reality.” “Take at least a 10–15 min break every
30 min, even if you don’t think you need it. Each person is different,
so take more frequent and longer breaks if you feel discomfort. You
should decide what works best” [14].
� Google Daydream: “Take the time to get adjusted to the virtual reality
experience before using Daydream View extensively. Begin by using
Daydream View for only a few minutes at a time. Use that time to get
adjusted to how the device reacts to your movements. As you become
accustomed to the virtual reality experience, you can begin increasing
the amount of time you use Daydream View. Take frequent breaks
while using Daydream View. If you experience nausea, discomfort,
eye
strain,
or
disorientation,
immediately
discontinue
using
Daydream View. Each person reacts differently to virtual reality so
you should base the frequency and length of breaks on what is right
for you.” [15].
� Sony PlayStationVR: “Avoid prolonged use of PS VR. Take frequent
breaks.” “Avoid prolonged use of PS VR. Take a 15-min break during
each hour of play.” [16].
2.2. Virtual reality exposure impact
The negative impact of VR use has received the most attention in
areas which traditionally had high use of the technology, for example
virtual environment ﬂight simulators and early VR entertainment cen-
tres. In the former, many air force bases have mandatory grounding
policies for pilots after virtual environment simulation use from 12 to 24
hours. In the later, VR entertainment centres often require users not to
drive for at least 30–45 minutes after exposure [17]. However, the dif-
ference between these two environments is the length of exposure time
with entertainment users only spending minutes in the VR experience
compared to potentially hours for pilots. However, the recent widespread
availability of affordable HMD technology has increased public use and
exposure to VR experiences.
The negative impact of engagement with virtual reality technology
and virtual environments is typically considered in the context of
cybersickness, which include symptoms of nausea, eye strain, pale skin,
cold sweats, vomiting, disorientation, headache, increased salivation and
fatigue [3,11,17].
Cybersickness as a result of HMD use has been an ongoing research
topic (recent reviews on cybersickness include Davis et al. [11] and
Rebenitsch and Owen [3]). Early work in this area also noted aftereffects
[18–20]. Stanney et al. [20] explored HMD-based VR exposure durations
of 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes and found that if a 95% HMD-based solution
was required, virtual environment duration would need to be limited to
less than 15 minutes. So and Lo [18] found that “In the absence of scene
oscillation, viewing a stationary virtual environment for up to 15 minutes
is not likely to cause a signiﬁcant increase in the nausea level.” Although
using signiﬁcantly different technology, Virtual Research V6 with Virtual
iO! Tracker [20] and VR4 LCD HMD with Polhemus FastTrack head
tracking [18], these thresholds are similar to those promoted by current
VR technology manufacturers.
Most cybersickness research measures the effect by use of question-
naires, e.g. the simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) [21], postural
instability [22], or more recently biometric and physiological states [23,
24]. Recent work has also explored impacts on cognitive performance [4,
24,25].
Nalivaiko et al. [24] and Nesbitt et al. [25] found a signiﬁcant relation
between reaction time and cybersickness. They found prolongation of
simple reaction time of 20–50 ms after up to 14 minutes in a virtual re-
ality roller-coaster (the 14 minutes was an upper limit on exposure as
subjects could terminate the experience early due to nausea sensations).
However, both these studies used intentionally provocative VR envi-
ronments, i.e. roller-coaster simulations, to elicit cybersickness symp-
toms;
used
environments
that
had
limited
interaction,
e.g.
the
roller-coaster experience was “on rails” with only head tracking; used a
relatively old HMD, in this case an Oculus Rift Development Kit 1 (DK1);
and applied a simple 40 trial/2 minute reaction time test, i.e. the
Deary-Liewald reaction time task [26].
Mittelstaedt, Wacker and Stelling [1] also found simple reaction times
and choice reaction times deteriorated after VR exposure. They used the
most recent Oculus Rift Commercial Version 1 (CV1) HMD and interac-
tion was closer to realistic use with participants using either a physical
bike ergometer (bike/HMD) or an Xbox One Controller (gamepad/HMD)
for HMD conditions. The Deary-Liewald reaction time task [26] was used
to collect reaction time data. Participants completed three 90 second
biking tasks followed by a simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ)
symptom rating task. The participants spent a total of “about 10 minute
in VR” [1].
In the work reported here, we have explored a more real-world, or
ecological valid [27], use of VR HMD through the use of COTS hardware
and software. This is representative of the more widespread use of VR
HMD technology as might be found at a trade show, gaming convention,
shop demonstration or causal home use. Our interest is in short duration
(15 minutes) HMD use and exploring any inhibition impact or delayed
response activation in this context. Thus the aim is to pair a real-world VR
HMD interactive experience, across travel, selection and manipulation
interactions, with a robust reaction time test.
3. Method
3.1. Participants
Participants were recruited until 22 volunteers (11 female) completed
the HMD task. Three additional male volunteers could not complete 15
minutes in the HMD and were excluded from the study (see the Results
section). The 22 volunteers that completed the HMD task had a mean age
of 24.59 years (SD ¼ 5.05). All participants had normal or corrected to
normal vision with contact lenses. Participants with glasses were
excluded as some glasses frames do not ﬁt under the HMD. The study was
approved by the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Com-
mittee (HREC #H-2017-0170).
3.2. Apparatus
3.2.1. Hardware
The virtual environment was presented on an Oculus Rift CV1 HMD.
The CV1 has two separately rendered displays with a screen resolution of

1080 � 1200 pixels for each eye and a refresh rate of 90 Hz. It allows
stereoscopic vision with a 110� horizontal ﬁeld of view. Head tracking is
integrated into CV1 use as the device includes an accelerometer, a gy-
roscope, and a magnetometer, and is tracked with a constellation
tracking camera.
The Oculus Rift and all software in the experiment was run on an
Alienware 15 R3 laptop (Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.60Ghz, 32 GB RAM, 64-
bit Windows10, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card). The laptop’s
Wi-Fi was disabled for the duration of all the experiments so that there
were no software updates (for example for Windows10 or Oculus prod-
ucts) across the duration of all the experiments.
3.3. Virtual reality task
Minecraft VR version 1.1.5 (Mojang, www.minecraft.net) was used as
the base environment for the VR task. The aim was to provide a virtual
environment that (i) had a low entry level for the participants, so they
could spend more time doing the task rather than learning the environ-
ment; (ii) was an environment with active interaction [28], rather than
passive, e.g. travel “on rails” or just 360� viewing, but (iii) was not overly
provocative to cybersickness effects, i.e. not a VR roller-coaster [25].
Minecraft is an open-world 3D video game that can be played in ﬁrst-
person perspective where players can travel over a 3D cartoon like
landscape and utilise tools to both create and destroy environmental
components and thus modify the virtual environment. Interaction in the
experiments described here was via a wired Xbox controller (gamepad).
Minecraft was run in single player Creative mode (i.e. no mobs/monsters
or falling damage), on easy difﬁculty and with “always day” mode. The
other primary Minecraft mode is Survival where there is a day/night
cycle and at night enemy computer-controlled mobs, or monsters, spawn
and can attack players.
A template Minecraft world was cloned for each participant so they all
started in the same environment and consisted of an island environment
and an example house (see Fig. 1). The VR task was for participants to
build their own version of a house. They were given a time limit of 15
minutes. The house construction process required participants to utilise
travel, selection and manipulation interaction techniques while using the
HMD and gamepad.
Participants had a pre-populated building material interface with all
the necessary building components in the standard Minecraft tool menu
(see bottom of Fig. 1) and were encouraged to verbally discuss their
design and progress while in the virtual environment. The conversation
during the VR session allowed the evaluator to subtly monitor the com-
fort level of participants and consider terminating the session if signs of
distress, e.g. cybersickness, occurred [6].
3.4. Reaction time measurement
A cued go/no-go task was used to measure failures of response inhi-
bition and response activation as pre and post VR exposure tests. Inquisit
5 Lab (Millisecond Software, www.millisecond.com) was run on the
Alienware laptop with a script implementing the cued go/no-go task
described in Fillmore et al. [9]. Participants were asked to press the
laptop spacebar when they saw a green rectangle (¼go) but refrain from
pressing the spacebar when they saw a blue rectangle (¼nogo). The blue
and green rectangles were vertical or horizontal. The vertical rectangle
had a high probability of being green (a go trial) and the horizontal
rectangle had a high probability of being blue (a nogo trial). Participants
got information about the orientation of the rectangle (¼cue) shortly
before the colour of the rectangle was revealed. The default Inquisit 5 Lab
script was used for pre and post reaction time measures and provides a
factorial design with:
� 5 x Stimulus-Onset Asynchrony (SOA) (100 ms, 200 ms, 300 ms, 400
ms, 500 ms)
� 2 x Cue (1 ¼ vertical, 2 ¼ horizontal)
� 2 x Target (Go, No-Go)
The vertical cue go/nogo ratio is 4:1 (80% go trials, 20% no-go trials)
with a higher probability of go trials after a vertical cue and the hori-
zontal cue go/no-go ratio is 1:4 (20% go trials, 80% no-go trials) with a
higher probability of nogo trials after a horizontal cue. The minimum
number of trials required to fulﬁl the above conditions is 50 and the
default script runs 250 trials, i.e. each factor combination is repeated 5
times.
� 100 vertical cue-go targets (20 for each SOA); 25 vertical cue-nogo
targets (5 for each SOA)
� 100 horizontal cue-nogo targets (20 for each SOA); 25 horizontal cue-
go targets (5 for each SOA)
For each trial, Inquisit 5 Lab logs raw data across date, time, subject,
blocknum, blockcode, trialcount, trialcode, cuetype, targettype, target-
condition, SOA, cuepic, targetpic, response, latency, correct, and error

data. Each pre- and post-test of 250 cued go/no-go trials took approxi-
mately 12 minutes.
3.5. Procedure
Each session took approximately 90 minutes and were held individ-
ually. Firstly, the research team collected signed consent forms. Secondly,
the participant was given a short tutorial on the use of the Xbox gamepad
which was to be used to interact with the Minecraft environment. Par-
ticipants used the gamepad controller to brieﬂy move around the laptop
(non-VR) version of Minecraft. All participants showed aptitude in
navigating and using the gamepad in less than 5 minutes.
To conﬁrm that participants could easily determine the stimulus
colours of the cued go/no-go task, they performed a colour vision test
that required them to pick out the stimulus colours (green and blue) from
an array of 12 colours. All participants successfully identiﬁed green and
blue coloured rectangles.
Participants were then seated at the laptop and performed a practice
test on the cued go/no-go task of 15 sample trials. Participants were
instructed to press the space key as fast as possible when the green target
appeared and not to respond to the blue target. Participants were given
no information on the relation between the rectangle orientation and the
target colours. After the 15 trials, participants verbally conﬁrmed that
they understood the task and then competed a full 250 trial test.
The participants were then shown a picture of the target house to be
built (Fig. 1). Minecraft VR was then run on the Alienware laptop and the
participants ﬁtted with the Oculus Rift HMD and the ﬁrst-person mode of
Minecraft VR activated (see Fig. 2). A 15 minute countdown timer was set
and participants then had 15 minutes to build in Minecraft VR. Partici-
pants sat in a swivel chair and the evaluator ensured free movement by
managing the Oculus Rift and gamepad controller cables during the
session.
After playing Minecraft VR, the participants removed the HMD and
repeated the full 250 trial cued go/no-go task with the Inquisit 5 Lab
script. Finally, they completed a demographic survey and a questionnaire
to determine their susceptibility to motion sickness, i.e use of the revised
motion sickness susceptibility questionnaire (MSSQ) [29]. At the end of
the session, each participant waited while their pre and post VR experi-
ence reaction times were compared. If the raw reaction times between
tests were signiﬁcantly different, i.e. a percentage change of greater than
5% from baseline reaction time [7], the participants were advised not to
drive or cycle for the next 30 min. Participants were given A$60 in su-
permarket vouchers to compensate them for their time.
3.6. Analysis
Fillmore’s [7] protocol had two primary measures of interest being
participant’s failures to inhibit responses to no-go targets (failures of
response inhibition) and their speed of responding to go targets (response
activation).
Failure of response inhibition: This was measured as the proportion of
no-go targets in which a participant failed to inhibit a response during a
reaction time trial, i.e. the participant reacted to a no-go target as if it was
a go-target. Also no-go cues should support response inhibition of no-go
targets. The p-inhibition failure scores were calculated for each cue
condition (go and no-go) on each test.
Response activation: This was measured by the reaction time to go
targets. The reaction time was collected as latency (ms) from the Inquisit
5 Lab raw data logs of each trial.
Response times of < 100 ms and > 900 ms were excluded from the
raw data as the former indicates pre-emptive activation and the latter
indicates loss of concentration/boredom and neither are indicative of
accurate reaction times. Only 5 trials < 100 (0.09%) and 9 trials > 900
(0.16%) were removed across the 5500 go trials analysed. Data was
cleaned and graphs produced in Excel (Ofﬁce Professional Plus 2016) and
all statistical analysis performed in SPSS (version 24.0.0.1). As reaction
times are not normally distributed, non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-
ranks test was used to analyse the pre- and post-test data pairs.
In comparison to previous work with reaction time measures [4,24,
25], the cued go/no-go task used here is signiﬁcantly longer in duration
and trials, i.e. the 40 trial/2 min Deary-Liewald reaction time task versus
250 trial/12 min cued go/no-go task. Also as previous work [19] has
shown duration effects of VR exposure, in addition to full duration re-
sults, we have split the pre-test and post-test results into four time pe-
riods, namely pre-ﬁrst (trials 1–126), pre-second (trials 127–250),
post-ﬁrst (trials 1–126) and post-second (trials 127–250).
3.7. Hypotheses
Our hypotheses consider response activation and inhibition scores
across both the general pre- and post-tests and the two time periods, ﬁrst
126 trails and second 126 trials, within each test.

� H1: Pre-Post scores will show response activation impact. We expect
decreased response activation after HMD exposure.
� H2: Pre-Post scores will show failure of response inhibition impact.
We expect increased failure of response inhibition after HMD
exposure.
� Pre-ﬁrst and pre-second trials will show no difference. We expect
response activation (H3a) and response inhibition (H3b) to be
consistent across the pre-test trials.
� Post-ﬁrst and post-second trials will show a difference. We expect the
response activation (H4a) to increase, i.e. improve, and response in-
hibition to decrease (H4b) across the post-test trials. The HMD
exposure should decrease over time out of the VR experience and
return to normal.
4. Results
Twenty-two participants (female ¼ 11) completed the VR task and
completed the house building task in Minecraft VR with 15 minutes in
the Oculus Rift CV1 HMD. An additional three participants (male ¼ 3)
did not complete the VR task and exited the virtual environment at 4, 7.3
and 11.5 minutes into the experience.
4.1. Motion sickness susceptibility questionnaire (MSSQ)
The mean MSSQ score across the participants (n ¼ 22) was 21.63 (SD
¼ 17.03). Golding [29] noted a mean MSSQ score of 45.5 (SD ¼ 37.6, n
¼ 147) as an adult reference norm. The results reported here may indi-
cate that the participants are less susceptible to motion sickness than a
general population. However, this could be due to selection bias as par-
ticipants self-selected their participation based on the study description
that mentioned virtual reality and computer games. Also an exclusion
criterion was for conditions that may be aggravated by use of a HMD,
including vertigo, claustrophobia or epilepsy. The mean MSSQ scores of
the participants (n ¼ 3) who did not complete the VR task were calcu-
lated at 21.67 (SD ¼ 17.40) and thus not indicative of difference from the
other participants.
4.2. Response activation
For the pre-test and post-test analysis (n ¼ 22) there was no signiﬁ-
cant difference between Go cue (p ¼ 0.36) or the NoGo cue (p ¼ 0.57) in
terms of response activation. Also reaction time activation was reduced
(i.e. faster reaction times) in the post-tests than in the pre-tests (See Fig. 3
and Table 1). Therefore, H1 is refuted.
In the pre-test (n ¼ 22) for the Go cue, the second half trials (Mean ¼
325.96) were signiﬁcantly higher (i.e. slower response activation) than
in the ﬁrst half trials (Mean ¼ 316.84), T ¼ 6, p ¼ 0.013, r ¼ �0.37. This
was also true for the NoGo cue with the second half trials (Mean ¼
337.45) signiﬁcantly higher than in the ﬁrst half trials (Mean ¼ 323.88),
T ¼ 6, p ¼ 0.022, r ¼ �0.35 (see Fig. 4). Therefore, H3a is refuted.
In the post-test (n ¼ 22) only the NoGo cue was signiﬁcantly different
between the second half trials (Mean ¼ 331.99) and the ﬁrst half trials
(Mean ¼ 319.83), T ¼ 5, p ¼ 0.24,r ¼ �0.34 (see Fig. 5). Therefore H4a is
refuted for NoGo cues.
4.3. Response inhibition
For the pre-test and post-test analysis (n ¼ 22) there was no signiﬁ-
cant difference between Go cue (p ¼ 1) or the NoGo cue (p ¼ 0.80) in
terms of response inhibition (also see Table 1). Therefore, H2 is refuted.
There was also no signiﬁcant difference across the ﬁrst trials, [Go cue
(p ¼ 0.71), NoGo cue (p ¼ 1)] or second trials [Go cue (p ¼ 0.26), NoGo
cue (p ¼ 0.76)] in terms of response inhibition. Therefore, H3b is
conﬁrmed and H4b is refuted.
5. Discussion
The full group results (pre-test to post-test) showed no signiﬁcant
differences in response activation or response inhibition of the partici-
pants after brief exposure to the Minecraft VR environment using an
Oculus Rift CV1 HMD. From one perspective this validates the health and
safety advice from VR hardware companies that there should be no ill
effects after short duration use of VR technology (see Section 2.1). Our
results are evidence that this is valid for response activation and inhibi-
tion in a participant population that is not generally susceptible to motion
sickness. However, this conclusion does need to be contextualised with
the small participant group (n ¼ 22), although the participant group was
balanced for gender (female ¼ 11) which contributes to it being repre-
sentative of general users. A statistical power analysis was conducted

using G*Power (v3.1.9.4) [30] to deﬁne the sample size requirements for
the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test as used in the analysis reported here. With
a standard signiﬁcance level (α error probability, p � 0:05) and level of
power (1 � β ¼ 0:8) [31], to demonstrate a large effect (r � 0:50) the
suggested sample size ranges from n ¼ 23 (Laplace parent distribution) to
n ¼ 35 (normal parent distribution). The results presented here fall just
outside this range but only by one participant pair (i.e. one female/male
pair). However, follow-on work should explore female/male balanced
sample sizes within this range.
Also it should be noted that 3 participants (all male) did not complete
the HMD component of the study. Although we were not explicitly
measuring cybersickness, all three participants verbally indicated
increased head temperature, which is indicative of cybersickness [24],
and were unwilling to continue with the Minecraft VR task. Their
removal was part of the study protocol but this did bias the reaction time
results to only participants that could complete the 15 minute VR task.
However, self-exclusion like this is what typically happens with HMD
usage. Users who encounter obvious negative effects stop using, and
typically avoid future use of, the technology. It is interesting to note that
these participants did self-select to participate and did not have indica-
tive MSSQ scores. Nevertheless, our interest here was in exploring
potentially hidden negative HMD impacts, i.e. on activation mechanisms
for information processing, that might come from brief VR use.
Measuring the reaction time impact on participants that had experienced
explicit cybersickness symptoms was out of the scope of the current
research but would be a useful avenue for further work.
In contrast to previous research [4,24,25], the results here showed an
improvement in reaction times (although not statistically signiﬁcant, see
Section 4). There were a number of differences in our study where the
aim was to provide a more ecologically valid VR usage experience. Other
studies with reaction time impact had more provocative cybersickness
invoking environments [24,25], more limited interaction and used a
much shorter duration reaction time task [4,24,25]. However, our results
did show that the longer cued go/no-go test had evidence of participant
fatigue during the test. This was evident in both the pre- and post-tests.
As this was present in the pre-test, this indicates that the longer dura-
tion of the reaction test could be the cause.
Increases in test length times can result in cognitive fatigue [32],
where the length of the test is taxing the participants’ mental functions to
the point that is causing a decrease in their performance. This can be
mental fatigue, boredom, and reduced attention over time [33,34].
Cognitive fatigue is a topic of continued importance in applied psy-
chology [35] and speciﬁcally how individual differences in personality or
other traits can impact cognitively fatiguing conditions. Cognitive fatigue
is commonly measured through changes in test performance and sub-
jective reports via questionnaires [35] or course/test evaluations [32].
Duration of testing and any physical conditions of the test environment
are also relevant, for example movement time [33]. In our reaction time
trials the participants were seated for the test duration and any physical
duress was limited to concentrating on the reaction time trials. Also the
go/no-go trials are very repetitive and it is possible that boredom and/or
reduced attention is what we have detected as fatigue. Adding a
post-session question to capture subjective experiences of the reaction
time task, in the context of reported fatigue, would be useful for future
work in this area. However, to mitigate potential cognitive fatigue,
repeated short tests with rest times between may be better than single
short (as in previous work [4,24,25]) or single long (as reported here)
reaction time tests.
Given the use of reaction time measures in VR experience and
cybersickness research and the results from the work described here,
there may be considerable beneﬁt in factoring in cognitive fatigue and
the measures that contribute to this, i.e. personality or other traits [35],
in order to increase the relevance of the reaction time data for aftereffect
analysis. This is a focus for future work.
6. Conclusion
The widespread availability of COTS HMD and easy access to VR
applications and games has signiﬁcantly increased the use of such tech-
nology by the general public. With more users, risk exposure from this
technology is increasing. VR technology manufacturers provide guide-
lines for usage but this guidance can be overly general and there is a
limited evidence base for these recommendations.
Explicit negative effects of HMD use, such as cybersickness, often lead
to self-selection as users who experience negative effect stop using or
avoid the technology. However, activation mechanisms for information
processing, such as response activation and inhibition, are more difﬁcult
to determine ad hoc and can have signiﬁcant impact on response critical
activities, such are driving vehicles or cycling.
The research reported here has explored response activation and in-
hibition in pre- and post-tests after participants experienced a typically
VR experience, in this case Minecraft VR using an Oculus Rift CV1 HMD,
for 15 minutes. Participants (n ¼ 22) experienced no signiﬁcant reaction-
based negative effects. This provides evidence in support of current VR
technology use approaches, at least for response activation and inhibition
impact. Participants did however demonstrate trial fatigue during the
reaction test process and this should be factored into future studies
involving reaction time measures.
