The intelligent transportation system (ITS) offers a wide range of applications related to trafﬁc management,
which often require high data rate and low latency. The ubiquitous coverage and advancements of the Long Term
Evolution (LTE) technology have made it possible to achieve these requirements and to enable broadband ap-
plications for vehicular users. In this paper, we perform ﬁeld trial measurements in various different commercial
LTE networks using software deﬁned radios (SDRs) and report our ﬁndings. First, we provide a detailed tutorial
overview on how to post-process SDR measurements for decoding broadcast channels and reference signal
measurements from LTE networks. We subsequently describe the details of our measurement campaigns in urban,
sub-urban, and rural environments. Based on these measurements, we report joint distributions of base station
density, cellular coverage, link strength, disconnected vehicle duration, and vehicle velocity in these environ-
ments, and compare the LTE coverage in different settings. Our experimental results quantify the stronger
coverage, shorter link distances, and shorter duration of disconnectivity in urban environments when compared to
sub-urban and rural settings.
1. Introduction
The rapid advancement in information and communication technol-
ogies stimulated a connectivity solution for vehicles to improve trafﬁc
safety and management. Such a solution is a key aspect of the intelligent
transportation system (ITS), which is said to transform the way we travel
today. The vehicles communicate not only with each other but also with
nearby road-side unit (RSU) infrastructures to warn drivers against a
potential accident or other unsafe events. In order to improve safety and
mobility of the road travelers, there are various ongoing work on the
connected vehicle pilot deployment programs in New York City, Tampa,
and Wyoming [1]. The US Department of Transportation (USDOT) claims
that the connected vehicle technology has the potential to eliminate up to
80% of the non-impaired crashes [2].
Potential incident warnings should be instantly indicated to drivers in
the rapidly varying vehicular channel. Therefore, reliability and timeli-
ness are of utmost importance in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) commu-
nication where wireless connective framework plays a crucial role. The
US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allocated separate 75
MHz bandwidth in the 5.850–5.925 GHz band to implement ITS appli-
cations
based
on
dedicated
short-range
communication
(DSRC)
framework [3]. The DSRC framework uses IEEE 802.11p, which is a
modiﬁed version of the Wi-Fi standard and designed for wireless access
in vehicular environments (WAVE). It ensures interoperability between
devices from different manufacturers and provides fast network estab-
lishment in the rapidly changing mobile environment [4]. In DSRC
network, the onboard unit (OBU) in a vehicle receives disseminated
safety messages either from neighboring vehicles or the RSU infrastruc-
ture to determine emergency events, and the warning is sent to drivers in
case of emergency. However, there are some concerns over its
contention-based scheduling mechanism where it is difﬁcult to achieve
critical latency requirements in high-density trafﬁc scenarios. Therefore,
congestion controlling schemes need to be implemented in DSRC [5].
Alternatively, the cellular-based V2X communication (C-V2X) started
by the third generation partnership project (3GPP) is working on
leveraging the long term evolution (LTE) framework for vehicular com-
munications [6]. As a result, the present deployed LTE infrastructure can
be conﬁgured to support vehicular connectivity, thereby reducing the
number of RSU installation. Further, large coverage scope and high ca-
pacity of the LTE make it a suitable ﬁt to support low-latency safe-
ty-critical
services
for
high-speed
vehicles.
Moreover,
its
higher
penetration rate facilitates reliable packet delivery at road intersections,

unlike DSRC technology, which suffers due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
conditions and shorter coverage. These advantages have sparked interest
recently among leading automotive and cellular companies, e.g., Qual-
comm and Ford, to deploy C-V2X in Colorado [7].
The architecture enhancements to enable LTE-based V2X applications
are given in Ref. [8]. The vehicles may receive V2X messages either via
unicast or broadcast setup called multimedia broadcast/multicast service
(MBMS) [9] over LTE-Uu interface for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)
communication. In addition, many additional modes have been intro-
duced for direct vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication in Ref. [10]. In
one of the modes, V2V resource allocation is managed by the base station
(BS); thus the availability of coverage is crucial to ensure collision-free
transmission which is unlikely in the case of the contention-based
approach
employed
in
DSRC
technology.
Therefore,
ubiquitous
coverage is desirable for efﬁcient V2X communication.
Usually, the propagation losses and interference are the major
limiting factors for vehicular communication, and their evaluation re-
quires BS location information. Recently, BS location data are publicly
available, e.g., in OpencellID [11] and CellID ﬁnder [12], through esti-
mation techniques. OpenCellID in particular incorporated crowd-sourced
data collection scheme to estimate the location of the BSs and developed
a database consisting of GPS coordinates of all the BS. The location es-
timates in the OpenCellID database are accessed using the global identity,
which is periodically disseminated by the BS, and it is known as
E-UTRAN Cell Global Identiﬁer (ECGI) in LTE.
In this paper, we study the vehicular connectivity performance of the
LTE networks based on the drive test measurements carried out using a
universal software deﬁned radio (USRP). The measurements are post-
processed to decode identity information of the BSs and to evaluate
their coverage strength. Primarily, we aim to decode unique identiﬁca-
tion of BSs speciﬁed by the ECGI and to extract their locations from
OpenCellID. The results from the rural, semi-urban, and urban areas of
the drive test campaign are obtained to investigate the coverage per-
formance and its impact on the temporal connectivity of vehicular users.
Our results show that V2I communication is better supported by LTE
network deployments in semi-urban and urban compared to rural areas.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the literature
review. Section 3 describes the drive test measurement setup and the
recording process. The post-processing steps performed in MATLAB to
evaluate the BS information are given in Section 4. In Section 5, drive test
results assessing the performance of the LTE infrastructure are presented,
followed by concluding remarks in the last section.
2. Literature review
The vehicular connectivity performance of Wi-Fi networks for
Internet access is studied in Refs. [13–15] using drive test measurements.
In Refs. [13,14], active scanning is analyzed, where moving users send
probe requests to access points (APs) within their vicinity for the
connection attempt. The distribution of APs discovered during active
scan were examined in geographical areas with different population
distribution in Ref. [13], while temporal connectivity information for
different vehicular speeds is investigated in Ref. [14]. Alternatively,
connection requests can be sent by users in the coverage range of AP after
successfully receiving the beacon. The connection performance of this
approach of passively scanning the APs is studied in Ref. [15]. The
intermittent connectivity was observed at several locations during the
motion of the vehicle, and the possibility of poor link period is estimated
using the knowledge of past connection measurements. As a result, the
connection framework in
Wi-Fi networks is suitable to support
delay-tolerant applications like web browsing, messaging, etc., in
vehicular scenarios.
On the other hand, the DSRC designed to support vehicular safety
applications employ amended version of IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standard,
called IEEE 802.11p, to address the safety-critical communication re-
quirements mentioned in Refs. [16,17]. The ﬁeld test campaigns were
performed in IEEE 802.11p-based vehicular network to examine the
impact of vehicular speed on latency and throughput of the V2I
communication, respectively in Refs. [18,19]. The reported results
conﬁrm that normal range vehicular speeds do not have a direct inﬂu-
ence on the performance of V2I communication. The works in Refs.
[20–25] evaluate packet delivery ratio (PDR) to determine the connec-
tivity performance of V2I communication, and it is studied in various test
environment and system settings of IEEE 802.11p standard.
Initially, the results in Ref. [20] show that the NLOS conditions
characterized by obstacles like trees, heavy trafﬁc conditions, etc.,
degrade the connectivity range. The height of the antenna and changes in
terrain elevation are also known to affect the visibility between vehicles
and RSU. Usually, the vehicular channels are highly time varying and as a
result, increasing either the throughput or packet size settings of the RSU
have a negative inﬂuence on the link connectivity as reported in Refs.
[21,22]. Further, the results in Ref. [23] show that high-beam antennas
improve the coverage range; however, its precise positioning, which can
be easily inﬂuenced by environmental conditions, becomes more critical.
Lastly, the connectivity performance is estimated using the Gilbert model
in Refs. [21,24], while artiﬁcial neural and Bayesian networks are
employed in Ref. [25] to estimate the connectivity range considering
different context information from drive test measurements for training
the networks.
The DSRC technology is usually suitable for short transmission ad hoc
type communication because serving users with V2X applications in a
large coverage area requires a centralized approach of allocating radio
resources for handling the channel congestion, which is a problem in
DSRC. Therefore, the DSRC is not ideal for use in V2I applications for
long-range communications. Alternatively, the LTE-V2X standard is
capable of catering reliable safety services to many vehicular users due to
its wider coverage and high capacity. In Refs. [26,27], V2V communi-
cation performance is evaluated using packet reception rate (PRR), and
the simulation results show that V2V in coverage perform better
compared to out of coverage where users autonomously select their radio
resources without the assistance from BS. Further, drive test experiment
results in Ref. [28] conﬁrm that the PDR performance of LTE
cellular-based vehicular services is better than DSRC in V2I connectivity
situation at the road intersections. The LTE-V2X standard is still in trial
stages, and currently, there are no real-world deployments which offer
vehicular safety services. Therefore, studying vehicular connectivity with
the existing LTE deployments will help to determine the important fac-
tors inﬂuencing the vehicular communication performance.
An experimental testbed is developed in [29,30] to obtain the link
statistics of DSRC and LTE frameworks in vehicular safety applications.
The results show that the link performance of LTE is better compared to
DSRC even in NLOS conditions, at the expense of compromise in latency.
The measurement campaigns were performed in [31,35–37] to study
various performance indicators of LTE networks such as latency,
throughput, and coverage in urban and rural areas. In [35], the core and
the access network delays are evaluated, and the results reveal that the
network enhancements are required to obtain latency performance,
which can support vehicular safety use cases. The download speed is
analyzed in [31], and results show that its variability with distance is
more signiﬁcant in urban compared to rural areas. The results also
indicate that parameters like signal quality and bandwidth inﬂuence the
throughput. Further, the maximum coupling loss between the user and
the base station determined in [35] show that LTE provides 99%
coverage to outdoor and road users. The signal strength results in [36,37]
indicate higher penetration loss in sub-urban/rural compared to urban
areas since channel propagation characteristics differ in these radio
environments.
The pathloss characteristics of V2I channel were evaluated in Refs.
[32,38,39] (see also [40,41] for millimeter wave vehicular channels). It
is shown that the path loss is affected by the antenna height, and its
behavior can be described using the two-ray ground reﬂection model. In

compared to urban areas as depicted by the average power delay proﬁle
results in Ref. [38]. This is because of the lesser obstacles in the ﬂat
terrain of rural/suburban areas, and scattering mostly occurs in the close
area around the mobile user [33]. Further, in the NLOS scenario
obstruction from neighboring vehicles case, measurements in Ref. [34]
are quite in agreement with the knife-edge model in Ref. [42], which
accounts for additional attenuation produced by diffraction. Simulations
are performed in Ref. [33] to evaluate bit error rate (BER) performance in
NLOS for V2I channel. The results show that the channel estimation
performance of the IEEE 802.11p pilot pattern is degraded, and BER does
not improve with increasing SNR. The measurement campaign works
speciﬁed in the literature review and their differences with the proposed
study have been summarized in the Table 1.
3. Drive test measurement setup and data collection process
The drive test measurements are obtained using a USRP N210 with an
integrated GPS disciplined oscillator (GPSDO) module, which offers a
ﬂexible programmable platform to implement custom functions using
onboard FPGA [43–46]. The GPSDO module is connected to a 3 V active
antenna for faster acquisition of location information. The measurement
setup is shown in Fig. 1. The active antenna improves the signal reception
performance and thereby yielding faster locking on to GPS satellites. The
measurements are collected using a laptop through a Gigabit Ethernet
connection, and both the USRP and the laptop are powered through an
uninterruptible power supply (UPS) during the drive test.
The measurement collection is performed in LabVIEW running on the
laptop, and the process is shown in the ﬂowchart in Fig. 2. The GPS and
IQ data samples from the USRP are continuously recorded in respective
ﬁles in CSV format, while total elapsed time is monitored. If the elapsed
duration exceeds a threshold, then new ﬁles are created, and recordings
are carried over to the new ﬁles. This avoids the difﬁculty in handling
large ﬁles during post-processing of the measurement data. The GPS in-
formation is obtained using the USRP driver, which returns the standard
National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) sentences from the
GPSDO module. Fig. 3 shows the generated recommended minimum data
(RMC) format type where each data segment is separated by a comma.
The segments are described in Table 2. The latitude and longitude ﬁeld
values are converted to decimal format, and sign convention is applied as

indicated by the N/S, E/W data ﬁelds. The latitude and longitude values
are considered negative for south and west, respectively, which are then
recorded along with the speed value.
Further, the USRP parameters, like sampling rate, carrier frequency,
and number of samples per fetch, are initially conﬁgured before starting
the I/Q signal acquisition. It is crucial to set the ideal parameters to
accomplish successful decoding of primary system information and ECGI,
which are speciﬁed in the master information block (MIB) and system
information block type 1 (SIB1), respectively. The BS broadcasts this
information periodically, and it is important to study their scheduling
information in time and frequency. First, we study the scheduling pattern
of MIB and SIB1 in frequency to determine the sampling rate of the USRP.
The MIB is carried by the physical broadcast channel (PBCH) transmitted
in central six OFDM resource blocks (RBs), and therefore corresponding
sampling rate of 1.92 MHz is required, regardless of the system band-
width at the BS. The USRP N210 does not support this sampling rate since
it allows only integer decimation factor N of the master clock rate given
by 100e6
N . Thus, the nearest sampling rate of 2 MHz is set during the
measurement recording in a drive test. In contrast, SIB1 is transmitted
using physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) over the entire system
bandwidth indicated by the MIB. After a few preliminary drive tests, we
observe base station’s bandwidth to be 10 MHz. Therefore, we set the
sampling rate to 16.67 MHz.
Next, we determine the total capture duration using the standard
transmission time pattern of MIB and SIB1 in LTE for their successful
extraction. The MIB transmission pattern in time is shown in Fig. 4. For
instance, let us consider two different MIB-1 and MIB-2, and that each of
them is transmitted every 40 ms. Within this period, each radio frame
carries respective repetitions of MIB-1 & 2 as depicted in Fig. 4. The
repetitions allow soft combining for decoding the PBCH in low signal
strength conditions. We perform soft combining by taking four sequential
radio frames and advancing this window until successful decoding is
attained [47]. Therefore, the capture duration of the USRP is ﬁxed to 80
ms for successful MIB extraction. Unlike MIB, transmission periodicity of
SIB1 is 80 ms and within this period, each of the respective repetitions of
SIB1-1 and SIB1-2 are transmitted every 20 ms as shown in Fig. 4. It is
important to note that each of the repetitive copies have different
redundancy version (RV) aiding in soft decoding of PDSCH data.
Following the similar approach used for MIB extraction, the USRP is
conﬁgured to record 160 ms of I/Q signal data since SIB1 is transmitted
with a periodicity of 80 ms. To sum up, two sets of I/Q signal measure-
ments are recorded for extracting MIB and SIB1. The I/Q data for MIB
extraction contain 80 ms sampled at 2 MHz, whereas for SIB1 contain
160 ms sampled at 16.67 MHz. In the next section, processing steps to
decode MIB and SIB1 from the corresponding measurements are
provided.
4. Post processing of drive test measurements
The primary goal of the post processing is to unambiguously identify
the BSs and analyze vehicular communication performance from the
measurement data. The ECGI information enables unambiguous identi-
ﬁcation, and it is extracted from the measurements performed for
decoding the SIB1 as mentioned in Section 3. Further, the vehicular
communication performance is determined based on the achievable
coverage from the measurement data by decoding the MIB as explained
in the following section.
4.1. Decoding the MIB
The primary system information required for the initial access to the
cell is speciﬁed in the MIB. Therefore, successful decoding of the MIB is
checked to determine BS coverage from the measurement data. The
standard LTE procedure is followed for MIB decoding using the MATLAB
LTE toolbox [48] as shown in Fig. 5.
Initially, the recorded measurements dedicated to MIB extraction are
resampled to 1.92 MHz due to sampling rate restrictions of the USRP, as
explained in Section 3. Then the cell search procedure is performed to
evaluate the physical cell identity (PCI) and timing offset. The PCI in LTE
is determined using a combination of Primary Synchronization Signal
(PSS) and Secondary Synchronization Signal (SSS). There are three var-
iations of PSS signals, and depending on the variation, there are 168 SSS
signals resulting in 504 unique combinations. The signal data are
correlated with all the 504 combinations of PSS and SSS, and the one
which yields the peak in correlation gives the PCI. Unlike PSS, the SSS
signals transmitted in subframe 0 and 5 differ in the cyclic shifts. This
enables to determine the timing offset of the LTE frame in the receiver.
For instance, the correlation peaks for a particular PSS and SSS combi-
nation occurring in subframe 0 and 5 of a frame length equal to 19200
samples is shown in Fig. 6. We can observe that the highest correlation
peak is achieved within subframe 0, and the corresponding peak location
gives the direct estimate of timing offset. Otherwise, the peak location
would have delayed to the subframe 5 of the next frame for calculating
the timing offset.
Further, the frequency offset is performed to compensate for oscillator
errors and doppler shift in the vehicular scenarios. It is evaluated based
on correlating the cyclic preﬁxes. Suppose xðnÞ is the resampled signal
and the sample at n ¼ n1 is part of the CP, then ignoring channel and
AWGN,
xðn1 þ 128Þ ¼ xðn1Þejφ128
(1)
where φ is the angle created in one sample due to the frequency offset
between the transmitter and the receiver. Note that,

For instance, Fig. 7 shows the plot of yðnÞ ¼ xðnÞx*ðn þ128Þ inte-
grated over all CPs in a slot and then averaged over all available slots in
the received data whose length is equal to 960 samples. It clearly depicts
the peaks of all CPs corresponding to seven OFDM symbols in a slot. The
frequency synchronization is achieved by performing xðnÞej2πbf offsetnTs. In
this approach, frequency synchronization is possible when j128φj � π ⇒

Next, OFDM demodulation is carried out by removing CP and per-
forming 128 point IFFT. The unused subcarriers are discarded resulting
in a grid consisting of 72 subcarrier rows and columns indicating the
signal duration. The channel estimates are then obtained for the resource
grid to compensate for the imperfections in the channel. Furthermore,
the PBCH extraction procedure is carried out, where PBCH REs are
extracted from the resource grid and subsequently PBCH decoding is
performed as shown in Fig. 5. First, the REs undergo deprecoding, layer
demapping and descrambling procedure to obtain broadcast channel
(BCH) codewords. This is equivalent to the inverse of PBCH processing
speciﬁed in Ref. [49]. Then these codewords are decoded by performing
inverse of BCH processing mentioned in Ref. [50] to obtain MIB bits. A
total of 24 bits are obtained, out of which 10 bits are spare, and the
remaining 14 bits actually signify three essential system information,
namely.
� System bandwidth
� System Frame Number (SFN)
� Physical Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request Indicator
Channel
(PHICH) Conﬁguration.
The system bandwidth information is carried in ﬁrst 3 bits and its
decimal equivalent, 0 to 5, corresponds to the RB set NRB ¼
f6; 15; 25; 50; 75; 100g. The forth bit conveys whether the duration of
PHICH is normal or extended, while the ﬁfth and sixth bits indicate its
multiplexing conﬁguration, and the last eight bits are used to determine
the SFN. Apart from the system information, the transmit antenna
number data are scrambled in CRC using an antenna speciﬁc mask [50].
In order to obtain its data, CRC check is attempted for the standard values
equal to 1, 2 and 4, and the corresponding true value is returned when
the decoding is successful [51]. The pseudo code of the overall MIB
decoding procedure is summarized in the Algorithm 1.

Next, the BS coverage strength given by the reference signal received
power (RSRP) is evaluated from the resource elements (REs) in the grid

that carry cell-speciﬁc reference signals [47]. It is relatively measured in
dB scale and all the results were obtained by keeping the same USRP gain
setting. The V2I connectivity performance of the LTE is studied from the
results explained in Section 5. However, unique identiﬁcation of BSs is
necessary to determine the impact of actual network deployments on the
V2I connectivity performance. It is achieved by decoding ECGI infor-
mation from the measurement data.
4.2. Decoding the PDSCH for ECGI extraction
The range of cell identiﬁcation using the PCI is limited to 504, and it
might be reused to identify the small cells in dense deployments scenario.
This creates ambiguity and therefore BS broadcast ECGI contained within
the system information indicated in the SIB1 for unique identiﬁcation.
The SIB1 is transmitted on PDSCH, and the decoding procedure given in
Ref. [48] is performed for its extraction from the recorded set of mea-
surements speciﬁed in Section 3.
Initially, the measurements are resampled according to the system
bandwidth given in Table 3, and the resource grid is obtained by
repeating a sequence of processing steps for OFDM demodulation as
speciﬁed in Section 4.1. The overview of PDSCH decoding procedure to
acquire SIB1 is shown in Fig. 8. First, we extract the Physical Control
Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH) REs, which are usually mapped into
groups called as Resource Element Groups (REGs) [47]. There are four
such groups, and each group contains four REs distributed across the
frequency domain and their location indices are pre-deﬁned with an
offset related to PCI. Therefore prior knowledge of PCI is required for
PCFICH symbols extraction. Next, inverse of PCFICH processing is per-
formed,
which
includes
deprecoding,
symbol
demodulation,
and
descrambling to obtain codeword sequences. Lastly, the codewords are
decoded to determine the CFI value, and it usually has three standard
values, i.e., 1, 2 or 3, which indicates the number of OFDM symbols
transmitted in the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) [47].
Next, we acquire downlink control information (DCI) which is carried
on the PDCCH to determine the scheduling information of the data
transmitted on PDSCH. The DCI REs in the resource grid is mapped on to
Control Channel Elements (CCEs) and their possible locations are
checked in search space which comprises of user speciﬁc and common as
deﬁned in LTE [47]. Typically, the common search space carries DCI
messages specifying the resource assignments of broadcast system in-
formation on the PDSCH. We perform blind decoding to check for all
possible standard DCI formats using a broadcast identity called as System
Information Radio Network Temporary Identiﬁer (SI-RNTI) [47]. In
order to perform blind decoding, we initially extract all the possible
PDCCH REs from the resource grid across the entire subcarrier rows and
the time span speciﬁed by the CFI [52]. Next, the inverse of PDCCH
processing is performed consisting of deinterleaving, cyclic shifting,
deprecoding, symbol demodulation and descrambling to obtain code-
word sequences. Finally, blind decoding is performed to ﬁnd all the
possible DCI message format across each PDCCH candidate in common
search space. If the CRC of the successful decoded PDCCH bits matches
with the SI-RNTI identity then the corresponding returned DCI message
indicates the resource assignments along with necessary decoding in-
formation for SIB1.
Further, in order to decode the SIB1 message we ﬁrst extract the
PDSCH REs where their locations are provided by the DCI. Then decoding
procedure is carried out by performing PDSCH channel inverse pro-
cessing to obtain codeword sequences. It includes inverting the channel
precoding, layer demapping and codeword separation, soft demodula-
tion, and descrambling operations [53]. Lastly, the codewords undergo
decoding procedure consisting of rate recovery, turbo decoding, block
concatenation, and CRC calculations [54] to obtain SIB1 bits. In addition,
decoding status is gathered for each codeword to check for error indi-
cated by CRC check. This helps in error correction of incorrect codewords
through soft combining with other repeated SIB1 messages captured in
the other radio frames.
Finally, we extract ECGI information by parsing SIB1 bits using ASN.1
compiler. The compiler is installed on linux platform by following the
steps given in Ref. [55]. Initially, the SIB1 bits are stored in a ﬁle with.per
format and decoding is performed to obtain BCCH-DL-SCH-Message. It
contains ECGI information consisting of mobile country code (MCC),
mobile network code (MNC), tracking area code (TAC) and cell identity
(CID) to identify the cell within the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN)
[47].
Using the ECGI information, we obtain BS location from the Open-
CellID database and CellID ﬁnder [12] and it is important to note that
locations provided by database are approximate. Then we incorporate BS
location results to analyze the effect of LTE network deployments on the
performance of V2I communication shown in the following section.
5. Results and analysis
The drive test results are provided to investigate the impact of pa-
rameters such as frequency and mobility on V2I link performance in a
small scale shown in Section 5.1. Further, we present results of the large
scale drive test measurements to study how LTE network deployments in
rural, semi-urban and urban counties inﬂuence the V2I link performance
explained in Section 5.2. Next, results analyzing the handover for various

parameter settings is provided in Section 5.3. Lastly, the impact of RSRP
and RSRQ parameters on the performance metrics namely throughput
and latency is studied in Section 5.4.
5.1. Impact of LTE frequencies on V2I link performance
The drive test measurements are performed around the North Car-
olina State University campus, and at each location the USRP carrier
frequency is changed alternatively to have one of the two frequencies f ¼
½739; 2132� MHz. The user locations shown in Fig. 9 are plotted using
different colors indicating the RSRP value of the strongest decoded BS,
while red and blue triangles represent the BS location. First, we inves-
tigate the V2I link performance for the frequency measurements at 739
MHz, as shown in Fig. 9. At the start of the drive test, RSRP for the cell
with PCI ¼ 493 is stronger and gradually decreases until the MIB
decoding is no longer possible indicating out of coverage. Further, the
RSRP values from the cells with PCI ¼ 132/134 appear, and we experi-
ence stronger coverage from 493 cell majority of the time compared to
rest of the cells. Next, the RSRP value of the strongest BS for the fre-
quencies 739 MHz and 2.132 GHz is shown in Fig. 9 to compare the V2I
link performance. We can see that RSRP values are lower for the fre-
quency 2.132 GHz, and this may be due to increased pathloss for higher
frequency or BS might be transmitting with lower power.
Further, the distribution of BSs is examined by obtaining their loca-
tions from the measurements performed in the drive test scenario shown
in Fig. 10. The USRP carrier frequency is hopped sequentially between
frequencies
f ¼ ½739; 751; 866:3; 874:4; 882:2; 1967:5; 1992:5; 1982:5�
MHz at each user location, and the obtained BS locations from these
frequency measurements are shown as black triangles. We observe more
BS deployments near the Raleigh downtown compared to countryside
areas.
5.2. V2I connectivity analysis in different LTE deployment scenarios
The drive test measurement campaign is conducted from Miami to
Raleigh covering four states, namely Florida, Georgia, South Carolina,
and North Carolina as shown in Fig. 11.
The central frequency of the measurements were ﬁxed at 739 MHz,
and the results are acquired on a county level, which are then categorized
in to urban, semi-urban and rural types based on population census.
First, cumulative distribution of RSRP results is shown in Fig. 12 to
investigate the V2I connectivity performance of LTE networks. We
observe that the RSRP values tend to be greater in urban areas indicating
stronger V2I connectivity compared to semi urban and rural counties.
This is because of the shorter distances between a BS and a user which is
veriﬁed from the cumulative distribution plots shown in Fig. 12. Next,
the velocity statistics of all the counties is examined from the cumulative
distribution shown in Fig. 12. We observe higher possibility of larger
velocities in semi-urban compared to rural and urban counties. This is
because of lower semi-urban counties in the drive test campaign and
therefore sparse result data are obtained for semi-urban counties.
Further, joint distribution of RSRP and BS distance plots for urban,
semi-urban and rural counties are shown in Fig. 13. In rural counties, we
observe higher possibility of BS distance around 3000 m and over this
distance, there is a higher chance of RSRP variation between �40 dB and
�20 dB. On the other hand in urban counties, it is more likely to observe
smaller BS distance around 2000 m with higher chance of observing
stronger RSRP values ranging from �20 dB to �10 dB.
Further, impact of the user velocity on V2I link performance is studied
from the joint distribution of RSRP, and results are shown in Fig. 14. We
observe greater likelihood of lower velocities in rural and urban
compared to semi-urban counties. In addition, RSRP tends to ﬂuctuate
with wider range for user velocities in semi-urban and rural compared to
urban counties.
Lastly, the joint distribution of velocity and BS distance is shown in
Fig. 15. We observe a higher likelihood of BS distance close to 5000 m in
urban counties while in rural counties the chance of BS distances are
greater than 5000 m.
Next, the time duration statistics of RSRP from BSs is extracted to
study the disconnected duration proﬁle. In the following we explain how
disconnected duration is evaluated from the results of measurement
campaign. Let us examine individual time instants of captured mea-
surements in the drive test campaign shown as dots in Fig. 16. For
instance, let there be two obtained RSRP results at time instant t½n1�
namely, R1;RSRP½1� and R2;RSRP½1� indicated from BS 1 and 2 respectively.
Fig. 9. Drive test results around NCSU campus.
K. Vasudeva et al.

In general, let R n represent a set containing Bn number of RSRP results
obtained at t½n� given by
R n ¼
�
Ri;RSRP½n� : i 2 ΓBS; i ¼ 1; …; Bn
�
;
(5)
where ΓBS is the set containing all BSs obtained in the drive test
campaign. Further, let us consider the condition where obtained RSRP
results in R n falls below the threshold γth given by
D n ¼
�
Rj;RSRP½n� : Ri;RSRP½n� < γth; j 2 ΓD
�
;
(6)
where ΓD⊆ΓBS is the set containing all BSs satisfying the condition in (6).
Next, we obtain D n over all time instants of the measurement campaign
expressed as
D ¼ fD n : n ¼ 0; …; Tg ;
(7)
where T is the last time instant of captured measurements in the drive test
campaign. Further, we examine the consecutive intervals in D for a BS in
ΓD. Let us suppose R1;RSRP from BS 1 falls below the threshold γth at each
consecutive time instant starting from t½np� and ending with t½np þnq� as
shown in Fig. 16. Then, the disconnected duration is computed as
τd ¼
�
t
�
np þ nq
�
� t
�
np
�
;
np; np þ 1; …; np þ nq
0;
np ¼ nq
:
(8)
In a similar way, we evaluate for each BS in ΓD to obtain overall set of
disconnected duration values represented as τD. The cumulative distri-
bution of τD for rural, semi-urban and urban counties considering
different RSRP threshold γth are shown in Fig. 17. We observe higher

chance of disconnected duration with increase in RSRP threshold, since
there are more possibilities of satisfying the condition (6) in result data
set. Additionally, the possibility of disconnected duration in urban
counties is lower compared to rural and semi-urban counties. This is
because there is a greater chance of observing higher RSRP values as
shown in Fig. 12.
5.3. Handover analysis in different LTE deployment scenarios
In LTE, the handover decisions are usually based on RSRP measure-
ments, and are triggered when the user moves out of the coverage areas
of its BS. In one of the common handover trigger conditions (referred as
the A3 condition [56]), the RSRP from a neighboring BS becomes greater
than the serving BS by an offset. Then, time to trigger (TTT) duration is
awaited and if the condition is still satisﬁed then handover is initiated
[47]. In order to analyze handover, we consider RSRP results from the
strongest and other BS’s as target and serving BS, respectively. Let t½na�
indicate a time instant where the handover condition is satisﬁed given as
Rt;RSRP > Rs;RSRP þ ν
(9)
where Rt;RSRP and Rs;RSRP represent the RSRP from target and serving BS,
respectively, while the offset is denoted as ν. Further, let us consider a
later instant where duration between t½na þnb� and t½na� is greater than
the TTT duration Tm; at that time instant, if (9) is still satisﬁed then a
handover is initiated by the serving BS.
We use the measurement results of one county from rural, suburban
and urban settings to study the number of handovers. In particular, the
Fig. 13. Joint distribution of RSRP and BS-distance in different counties.

Array 8 (2020) 100045

number of handovers is computed for different offset ν where TTT is ﬁxed
to 0.5 s and the results for Colleton, Florence, and Broward counties are
shown in Fig. 18. The results show that the number of handovers de-
creases when offset is increased, since (9) is satisﬁed for fewer cases. We
also observe a larger number of handovers in Broward county compared
to other counties due to larger network deployments in the urban area.
5.4. Implication on application performance metrics based on the signal
strength of V2I links
In the drive test measurements, connection establishment with the
BSs was not achieved and therefore performance indicators such as
throughput and latency could not be directly deduced from the captured
measurements. However, it is apparent that these performance indicators
are inﬂuenced by the associated BS’s signal strength indicated by the
RSRP. The results in Ref. [57] show the throughput dependence on RSRP
based on the ﬁeld measurements. They show that interference, which is
one of the important factors driving the throughput, depends on the
RSRP. For the sake of completeness, we provide an example that maps
RSRP to throughput for different network load scenarios in Fig. 19, taken
from Ref. [57]. Generally, the results show improvement in throughput
with the increase in the RSRP.
Theoretically, the relation between interference and RSRP is shown
using the reference signal received quality (RSRQ) parameter given by
Ref. [58].
RSRQ ¼ NRB � RSRP
RSSI
(10)
where reference signal strength indicator (RSSI) is computed as total
average received power of all the REs carrying reference signals in a
measurement bandwidth of NRB which includes interference from all the
sources [47]. Further, the RSRQ is expressed in terms of signal to inter-
ference ratio (SINR), which is usually an indicative of throughput given
by Ref. [59].
RSRQ ¼
1
NRB
�
12β þ
1
SINR
�
(11)
where β is the subcarrier activity factor expressed as a total number of
subcarriers carrying reference signal of all the antenna ports during
PDSCH transmission over number of subcarriers in a RB which is 12. β
term is usually used in network load calculations. Then, SINR determined
from (11) is used in Shannon’s capacity equation to obtain theoretical
throughput based on different network load conditions.
The errors in packet transmission can be caused due to low signal
strength condition. As a result, packet retransmissions occur, increasing
the round trip latency between the users and the BSs. In Ref. [60], the
impact of RSRP and RSRQ parameters on packet error rate and jitter
based on real time transport protocol (RTP) is investigated for voice
trafﬁc. The jitter is computed as consecutive differences of packet latency
and the results are based on measurements in a network load �50%.
Overall, higher jitter and error rate is observed for lower RSRP ranges.

The maximum impact is observed with RSRQ where error rate and jitter
degrades signiﬁcantly at lower RSRQ conditions.
6. Conclusion
In this paper, we examined the V2I connectivity performance of LTE
deployments in rural, semi-urban and urban scenarios using extensive
drive-test measurement campaign. The joint distributions of the link
quality metrics are obtained, which indicate stronger coverage and
higher BS density in urban and semi-urban compared to rural scenarios.
In addition, shorter duration of disconnectivity and more handovers are
observed in urban scenarios when compared to semi-urban and rural
scenarios. Lastly, we noted that higher operating frequencies of LTE
networks yield lower coverage. We provide our developed SDR codes for
other researchers’ use in Ref. [61]. In our future work, the drive test
campaign results will be incorporated into an LTE system level simulator
to assess the mobility performance of LTE networks [62–64]. We plan to
evaluate key mobility performance indicators and investigate the impact
of channel congestion on V2I connectivity in road safety applications.
