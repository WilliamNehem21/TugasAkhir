The purpose of this work is to assess the soil fertility for Tulaipanji rice cultivation in Kaliyaganj C.D. Block using
the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Machine learning algorithms along with the ﬁeld survey data and GIS.
A total of 40 soil samples from Tulaipanji rice ﬁelds (from 0 to 40 cm depth) have been randomly collected for the
analysis of the soil health condition. For the purpose of assigning ratings to the parameters, ten experts' opinions
were taken into account. The ﬁnal soil fertility map indicates that 18.01% of the land is in excellent health
condition to support Tulaipanji cultivation. The artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM),
and Bagging models-based suitability analysis was also done using geo-spatial and soil data for Tulaipanji
cultivation. Nevertheless, the ANN is the more appropriate model for locational analysis of Tulaipanji cultivation.
The ANN-based ﬁndings show that areas of 25.8% (77.89 sq. km) are excellent for growing Tulaipanji rice, about
22.01% (66.45 sq. km) are highly suitable, 19.84% (59.90 sq. km) are moderately suitable, 21.19% (63.97 sq. km)
are low suitable and 11.16% (33.69 sq. km) are not suitable for Tulaipanji rice cultivation. The receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve depicts that the applied models have a high degree of accuracy. This endeavour will
aid much in the soil fertility and site suitability assessment that will aid local government ofﬁcials, academics, and
the framers, to utilize the lands in a scientiﬁc way.
1. Introduction
According to FAO's deﬁnition, in agriculture, the fertility of soil
refers to the capacity of a soil to support crop growth by supplying
required soil nutrients as well as suitable biochemical, and physical
properties as a growing environment for plants. The essential macro-
nutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), as well as
magnesium (Mg), sulphur (S), and calcium (Ca) are all found in plants
as micronutrients and by consuming these foods, humans fulﬁll their
nutritional demands. Micronutrients are mostly composed of the ele-
ments iron (Fe), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), chlorine (Cl), sele-
nium (Se), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and boron (B). Water is required
for plant growth! Plants comprise roughly 80%–95% water, and they
need water for a variety of purposes as they develop, including
photosynthesis, cooling, and transporting minerals and nutrients from
the soil into the plant. Soil fertility implications are represented in the
majority of the Sustainable Development Goals since they include
economic, social, and environmental dimensions. The principal facility
supplied by soil fertility is agricultural production, which is critical for
achieving the FAO's planned goal of zero hunger. Fertile soil produces
healthy crops that meet the human body's nutritional requirements.
Whereas a soil deﬁcit in some critical elements would be unable to
produce nutritional foods, ultimately resulting in a nutritional deﬁ-
ciency in the human body. Before the worst-case scenario comes where
all humans are facing nutrition deﬁcit health issues, we should conserve
and maintain good soil health by implementing different management
and conservational strategies such as demarcating speciﬁc crops for
speciﬁc land is very essentials.
Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is among the most essential cereal crops on the
planet, contributing signiﬁcantly to global food security by providing food
for more than half of the global population (Chauhan et al., 2017). Today,
around one-third of the world population, while about 1.7 billion people in
South Asia, including more than 50 million families, subsist entirely on rice
(Manzanilla et al., 2011; Nayak et al., 2019). Rice may become extremely

important in the future as the demographics of developing nations, which
are heavily reliant on rice, rise at a signiﬁcant rate.
Agriculture contributes nearly 40% of India's Gross National Product
(GNP) and ensures subsistence for approximately 70% of its total popu-
lation. Almost 67% (two-thirds) of the country's cropland is covered by
rain-fed farming (Rath et al., 2018). In India, rice cultivation not only
feeds the majority of the people but also helps to ﬂourish associated in-
dustries, such as approximately 32% of the country's fertilizer (FAO,
2005) and 22% of pesticides are used in rice cultivation. The government
of India in 2016 estimates that around 43.4 million hectares of land and
around 60% of water are used each year to produce rice (Reddy et al.,
2005). In India, especially on the eastern side of the country's
land-intensive used for rice cultivation. Tulaipanji is the indigenous most
ﬂavored rice cultivated in the Kaliyaganj block of Uttar Dinajpur District,
West Bengal, Eastern India. It is one of the softest rice, which have very
much popularity in the market for its unique features. Tulaipanji is tasty,
bright, non-sticky, and friable aromatic rice. Tulaipanji is mainly culti-
vated in the Kharif season. It grows between the months of August to
November. On October 24, 2017, Tulaipanji gets a Geographical Indi-
cation (GI TAG) certiﬁcate from the Department for promotion of In-
dustry and Internal Trade, Govt. of India. Its market price is much higher
than the other rice varieties. As this variety returns more proﬁts in
comparison to the same quantity of other varieties and cultivation of this
rice may have the capacity to improve the economic condition of the
farmers if they get proper help to produce and export this rice variety.
The ability to prefer the appropriate areas for farming based on the
intended usage and crop practices will help to mitigate adverse natural
effects while increasing agricultural productivity and ﬁnancial advan-
tages (Mahmood and Ahmad, 2001; Ashraf and Normohammadan,
2011). Land suitability assessment, described as an appraisal of the “ef-
ﬁciency” of land for speciﬁc land uses and crops (Bagheri Bodaghabadi
et al., 2015; Saleh et al., 2015), is a critical phase in sustainable devel-
opment and land use management. Not only can land suitability assess-
ments aid in the betterment of crop production systems and expansion of
land efﬁciency (Prudat et al., 2018; El Baroudy, 2016), but they can often
offer insight into the key contributing factors to crop shortages (Halder,
2013). To optimize agricultural land management, taking into account
environmental factors and comprehending the primary constraints
imposed by local biophysical conditions can aid in crop selection (Kazemi
et al., 2016; Mendas and Delali, 2012).
Suitability assessment involves a variety of parameters; thus, expert
opinions integrating analytic hierarchy process (AHP), as well as the
collection of numerous criteria, are expected to comprehend crop pro-
duction on suitable lands. AHP based on remote sensing and GIS is a
popularly adopted tool for geographical decision-making processes.
Importantly, the AHP introduced by Saaty (1980) has been combined
with GIS (Akinci et al., 2013) as the optimal approach for managing
numerous and diverse entities like soil suitability. AHP is a technique for
organizing various variables into a hierarchy and deciding their
perceived value (Saaty, 2000). This technique has been used in a number
of research for analyzing site suitability (Mishra et al., 2016; Bozdag
et al., 2016; Amini et al., 2020; Ostovari et al., 2019; Pilevar et al., 2020).
Additionally, the GIS techniques facilitate an effective way to analyze site
suitability. Nevertheless, in recent times, different machine learning
models, such as artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine
(SVM), random forest (RF), bagging, and decision tree-based site suit-
ability analysis have gained signiﬁcant importance. Nowadays, re-
searchers frequently use different machine learning techniques for site
suitability analysis (Sarmadian et al., 2014; Rodriguez-Galiano et al.,
2015; Mishra et al., 2016; Hengl et al., 2017; Senagi et al., 2017a, b;
Thanh Noi and Kappas, 2018; Mekonnen et al., 2019; Mohsenzadeh
Karimi et al., 2020; Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi et al., 2020; Moller et al.,
2021).
Numerous scientists worldwide have applied remote sensing (RS) and
GIS-based strategies for assessing site suitability for rice production as
well as for other crops (Gumma et al., 2009; Samanta et al., 2011; Kuria
et al., 2011; Kihoro et al., 2013; Dengiz, 2013). RS and Geographical
information systems (GIS) are well-deﬁned, precise, and adaptable
methodologies for investigating spatial information in land suitability
assessment (Mokarram et al.,
2011;
Mendas and
Delali, 2012).
Satellite-based digital information has arisen as a critical resource for
producing physical and biological details (e.g., topography and slope)
that aid in the evolution of a region's optimum land use strategy for
sustainable growth. Thus, the use of RS and GIS for land suitability
analysis for rice cultivation seems very compelling. Additionally, over the
last quarter-century, remote sensing and GIS techniques have grown in
popularity for a wide range of uses, which include land capability
assessment (Hamzeh et al., 2014; El Baroudy and Moghanm, 2014;
El-Zeiny and Effat, 2019). RS and GIS assessment at a lower cost facilitate
a large spatial extent and the outcome is more reliable than conventional
analysis (Zhou et al., 2017; Demarez et al., 2019). For analyzing land
suitability, high-resolution satellite images such as LISS-III, Sentinel-2,
Landsat-8, and Gaofeng-1 are far more acceptable data sources than
others (Dong et al., 2015; Kussul et al., 2016). A multi-criteria deci-
sion-making (MCDM) framework along with GIS is used to evaluate
different conditioning factors and make appropriate land-use decisions
(Malczewski, 2006; Cengiz and Akbulak, 2009; Mendas and Delali,
2012). Land Use/Land Cover is a broad term that describes the classiﬁ-
cation natural features and human activities on the landscape across time
using recognised statistical and scientiﬁc techniques. The main objective
of the present study is to assess the site suitability for Tulaipanji rice
cultivation by combining AHP, machine learning ANN, SVM, and
Bagging models and GIS techniques for the Kaliyaganj block of Uttar
Dinajpur district, Eastern India. In the ﬁrst section, the AHP method was
used to measure the soil health condition of the study area. In the second
phase, soil properties and other physio-climatic variables were used to
assess suitable sites for Tulaipanji rice cultivation.
1.1. Description of the study area
The present research was conducted at Kaliyaganj block (Fig. 1),
situated on the south-eastern side of North Dinajpur in West Bengal,
India, with an area of 301.90 sq. km. This region is under fertile mature
ﬂat land topography with gentle sloping toward the south. The selected
study area comes under the subtropical humid region where the average
highest temperature is recorded in June and a minimum temperature of
15 �C is recorded in January (Fig. 2). The average annual rainfall in the
study area is 1540.2 mm and the highest rainfall occurred in July fol-
lowed by August. During the ﬁeld survey, the calculated average hu-
midity, 2 m from the soil surface, was 58.59%. The land use land cover
scenario depicts intensive farming with 50% of total LULC coming under
agricultural land and farming serves as a major source of income in the
study block. The loamy-dominated soil with the existing climatic con-
ditions created an ideal environment for rice cultivation. Farmers pre-
dominantly cultivated a wide variety of rice such as miniket, fourty-
ninety four, sorno, joyonti, ranjit, IR-8, tulaipanji, etc. in the study
area. Based on the climatic conditions, the soil in this area keeps enough
moisture to support plant growth under controlled conditions. Growers
mostly use electric and diesel-based pumping machines to extract
groundwater to irrigate agricultural crops. River Srimati is an abundant
channel of the Tangan river ﬂowing north to east and divides this block
into two halves. This river is ephemeral in nature and remains dry for
most of the year, which facilities framers for intensive indigenous rice
production in the river bed along with other crops, though this leads to an
economic debate about whether this practice is appropriate for river
ecosystem sustainability or not. The produced aromatic rice is exported
all over the country. Farmers' responses reveal that though they face a
variety of problems producing these speciﬁc types of indigenous rice, the
ﬁnished product gives a good return in comparison to the other culti-
vated crops.

2. Database and adopted methods
2.1. Data sources
2.1.1. Soil sample collection and laboratory testing
A total of 40 soil samples were collected from different study sites
using hand-held GPS and thermometer instruments in the month of
November to December 2020 and from May to June 2021. Firstly, we
identiﬁed the Tulaipanji rice ﬁeld in the study area during a pre-ﬁeld
survey considering the local people's perceptions. To collect soil sam-
ples, we selected 5 soil sampling sites from 8-g panchayats using a
stratiﬁed random sampling method. The soil samples were collected at a
40 cm zig-zag depth from the surface. At each soil sample site, ﬁve soil
samples, with an average distance of 20 m, of about 500 gm were
collected and mixed for laboratory analysis. After collecting the soil
samples, the soil is dried up and made into a ﬁne grain size for laboratory
purposes. All the soil samples are then tested by the authors with a proper
laboratory assistant in the soil laboratory at Raiganj. Some of the
glimpses of soil sample collection to laboratory analysis are given in
Fig. 3. To analyze the different soil properties such as Nitrogen (N), Po-
tassium (K), Phosphate (PO4), Sulphate (SO4), Boron (B), Potential of
Hydrogen (pH), Organic carbon (OC), Zinc (Zn), Manganese (Mn),
Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Soluble Salt (SS), Bulk density (BD), Cation ex-
change capacity (CEC) and Moisture Index (MI) (Table 1) of the sampled
soil the guidelines proposed by the ministry of agriculture and cooper-
ation, the government of India has been followed.
2.1.2. Construction of the selected data layers
As mentioned earlier, the soil samples were collected from 40 places
randomly distributed in the study area using hand handling GPS (GPS

properties of the sampled soil and the information on respected points or

2.2. The method of assigning ratings to soil fertility analysis parameters
2.2.1. Multi criteria decision making method: Analytic hierarchy method
(AHP)
The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is a multi-criteria decision-
making (MCDM) process introduced by Saaty (1980). In the study area,
this AHP model is used for assessing soil fertility status that could help in
decision making in Tulaipanji cultivation. Saaty developed a nine-point
scale using a pair-wise comparison matrix that can assist in extracting
the relative weights of the individual inﬂuencing parameters (Table 3)
(Saaty, 1980). The fundamental pair-wise matrix categorization (Eq. (1))
in AHP is premised on a 1 to 9 reciprocal pertinence rating, with 1 denoting
‘equally important and 9 denoting ‘very important. In an appropriateness
assessment, variables were given relative importance based on their
respective inﬂuence capacity in the decision-making process.

Akinci et al. (2013) mentioned reciprocity as a feature of matrices
that is formally stated as contrast is implemented for n components in
pairwise comparison. After the pairwise comparison matrix table is built,
the eigenvectors and relative weights of the parameters are estimated. In
this AHP model (Saaty, 1980), the incongruities and errors of the model
builder are also taken into consideration, which is also one of the
strengths of this adopted model. Equation (3) shows the Consistency ratio
(CR) which is used to deﬁne the effectiveness requirements for the
analytical hierarchy process.
CI ¼ λmax � n
n � 1

Equation (2) is used to calculate the consistency index. Where
λmaxrepresent the principal or highest Eigenvalue from the constructed
pair-wise matrix table and n is the total number of inﬂuencing variables.
CR ¼ CI
RI
(3)
The consistency index (CI) and random index (RI) are used to
calculate the CR value. CR is the quantiﬁcation of the policy or decision
builder's mistakes or an indication of the magnitude of coherence and or
irregularity (Sarkar and Pal, 2018). It represents the probability that the
pair-wise matric evaluations were formed arbitrarily. If the calculated CR
value is 10% or more, then we need to reconsider the parameters' relative
importance judgments to reconstruct the pairwise matrix, but if the
calculated CR value is below 10%, then the decision makers accurately
judge the importance of the variables towards acceptable results with
high precision.
2.3. Machine learning algorithms and applied methods
For the present study, three machine learning models, namely, arti-
ﬁcial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and Bagging
were employed to construct the ﬁnal Tulaipanji farming suitability maps
using data mining software namely WEKA. This software is a New
Zealand-based Javascript using software developed by Waikato Univer-
sity. The produced information is then imported into the Arc GIS plat-
form for spatial mapping. The Arc GIS environment offers a wide range of
classiﬁer techniques, such as manual, equal interval, deﬁned interval,
quantile, natural breaks (Jenks), geometrical interval, standard devia-
tion, etc. to classify the produced Tulaipanji farming suitability maps.
The natural break is a widely used and accepted method for classifying
suitability zones (Sarkar and Mondal, 2020; Saha et al., 2021).

2.4. Multilayer Perceptron-ANN model
A neural network (ANN) is a numerical model of human perception
(Kim et al., 2014) that may be taught to perform a speciﬁc task (Chak-
raborty et al., 1992), based on the data set that is currently available
(Valencia Ortiz and Martínez-Gra~na, 2018). The three-layer ANN
approach (input, hidden, and output layers) was established and suc-
cessfully (Zhao et al., 2020) used for suitability modelling. In the output
layer, however, a node was employed that was coded as 1 for cultivated
and 0 for non-cultivated regions. The discrepancy between the computed
and observed values is characterized as an error. To examine it, a variety
of error measuring techniques have been utilized (Falah et al., 2019). The
customization of initial weights is carried out using a generalized delta
rule to disperse the entire error across the network's neurons (Kazmier-
kowski 2002).
2.5. Support vector machine (SVM) model
A common machine learning model is the SVM, which uses a set of
linear indicator functions. This was introduced by Vapnik (2013) and has
been used in the determination of function concerns. The optimum linear
hyper-plane has been selected to separate the actual output space. The
array was also divided into two categories, such as the area of suitable
Tulaipanji cultivation and the region not suitable for Tulaipanji cultiva-
tion {1, 0}. Because of the radial basis kernel's ﬂexibility in dealing with
different dataset dimensionalities and its high generalization ability, it
has mostly been used to simulate ﬂood susceptibility (Yang et al., 2019).
One of the most fundamental disadvantages of modelling using SVM is
the difﬁculty of acquiring important characteristics (Choubin et al.,
2019).
2.6. Bagging model
One of the simplest yet efﬁcient machine learning ensemble ap-
proaches is Bootstrap Aggregation (also known as bagging) (Prasad et al.,
2006). Bootstrap Aggregation is a fundamental technique that may be
used to decrease variance in algorithms that have a high number of it-
erations (Breiman 1996). The goal of bagging is to decrease variance
while retaining the bias of a decision tree and avoiding over ﬁtting
(Shahabi et al., 2020). The Bagging Tree generates several sets of input
data at random by replacing training samples (Maclin and Opitz 1997).
The chosen subset of data was analyzed to train the assigned trees and
generate models. The average of all forecasts from these trees is then used
to create the ﬁnal conclusion, which is more resilient. Using several
replicas of the trained data subset improves the precision of a single tree
(Talukdar and Pal, 2019).
2.7. Constructing suitability maps
2.7.1. Weighted linear combination method (WLCM)
A wide variety of MCDM techniques have been used by researchers
for allocating weights and integrating inﬂuencing variables of a speciﬁc
event towards decision making. Several prominent approaches in this
respect include AHP, Weighted linear combination method (Eastman,
1997), weighting and integrating parameters based on a correlation
matrix (Khatun and Pal, 2016), etc. The GIS environment provides a
fascinating environment where we can successfully achieve the required
outcomes. For soil fertility status analysis of the study block, the WLC
method has been used (Eq. (6)).

where aij demotes the ith ranking of the jth element and wj demotes the

2.7.2. Machine learning algorithms
The soil properties, and climatic information related to Tulaipanji are
taken into consideration to perform the ﬁnal site suitability maps for
Tulaipanji rice cultivation. In this process, machine learning algorithms
such as artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM),
and Bagging models come into play. The descriptions of these three
methods were previously discussed. The detailed procedure adopted for
preparing ﬁnal site suitability maps for the study area is given in Fig. 5.
3. Results and analysis
A number of ﬁfteen variables were analyzed using various statistical
techniques. Boron (B), Zinc (Zn), Nitrogen (N), Phosphate, Potassium,
and Manganese (Mn) are the major variables that are considered as prime
variables. The standard deviation (SD) of the dataset represents the
average level of variability. It informs users how far each score deviates
from the mean on average. The SD of N is 70.931, followed by K
(36.289), and PO4 (35.415) (Table 2). The kurtosis is a measure of
heaviness or the density of distribution tails, whereas skewness is a
measure of symmetry in distribution. The skewness of PH, K, PO4, Zn, Fe,
SS, CEC indicates the highly skewed distribution in the soil sample data.
The Kurtosis of MI (�0.625), Fe (�0.216), Cu (�0.844), OC (�1.057), B
(�0.297), K (�0.738), N (�0.908) represents a negative which indicates
the Platykurtic kurtosis. The negative kurtosis depicts the lower number
of outliers in the distribution.

3.1. Soil fertility mapping (SFM) using AHP and WLC
Table 3 AHP rating Scale and Random Index (RI) to the formation of
the Pair-wise comparison matrix.
From the AHP estimation (Tables 3 and 4, Fig. 6) it is found that the
Boron (Br) is the most prominent variable with a 9.19 per cent rating in
Soil Fertility Mapping followed by Zinc (Zn) with 8.81 per cent, Potas-
sium with 8.39 per cent respectively. A soluble salt is a least inﬂuencing
variable with a 3.79 per cent of AHP rating.
It is considered that not all the selected parameters have the same
inﬂuence on soil fertility. As a result, the MCDM-AHP based weighting
procedure is used to determine the weights of the selected variables.
From Fig. 7, out of the total spatial extension of the study area, 54.38 sq.
km of the land seemed to have very high soil fertility for agricultural
farming, primarily covering the NE and SW parts of the block. According
to the produced SFM, about 41.04 sq. km. (13.60%) is highly fertile and
86.96 sq. km. (28.80%) comes under the moderately fertile zone of the
total respectively. About 52.98 sq. km. of the total area, mainly in the
South, South-west, and Northern parts of the block, appeared as unsuit-
able sites as the soil fertility is very poor (Table 5). Equation (7)
demonstrated the performed WLC for soil fertility mapping.

3.2. Site suitability mapping using machines learning techniques
In this present study, the ANN, SVM and Bagging method was used to
construct site suitability map for Tulaipanji rice cultivation and classify
the produced maps into ﬁve categories, such as very high, high, moder-
ate, low, and least suitable (Fig. 8). The ANN, SVM, and Bagging-based
site suitability models have ﬁve suitability categories that are repre-
sented in Fig. 8. The ﬁndings reveal that 77.89 sq. km (ANN model),
52.62 sq. km (SVM model), and 80.97 sq. km (Bagging model) areas are
the most favorable for Tulaipanji rice cultivation. In the case of ANN
suitability analysis, the percentages are 25.8, 22.01, 19.84, 21.84, and
11.16 for very high, high, moderate, low, and least suitable zones
respectively. Whereas about 17.43%, 27.91%, 22.06%, 22.25%, and
10.35% of the total area is very high, high, moderate, low, and least
suitable zone respectively, in the case of the SVM model. The Bagging
estimation shows that only 26.82% of the area is most suitable, followed
by 21.39% of high suitable, 22.65% of moderate suitable, 19.41% of low
suitable, and 9.73% of least suitable respectively (Table 6). It is observed
from the models that the very high and high suitability zones were
mainly located in the S, W, SE, and NE parts of the block. The least
suitable sites for Tulaipanji rice cultivation are found in the N and SW
segments of the study region.

produced model (Sarkar and Pal, 2018; Sarkar and Mondal, 2020). The
validation of the ANN, SVM and Bagging models has been analyzed using
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is generated by
utilizing the training and validation points. The training and validation
points are given in Fig. 9. The area under the curve (AUC) shows the
accuracy level of the performed models. The AUC can be categorized into
excellent (0.9–1), very good (0.8–0.9), good (0.7–0.8), average (0.6–0.7),
and poor (0.5–0.6). The ROC curve of the training datasets indicates an
AUC of 0.936 for ANN, 0.918 for SVM, and an AUC of 0.895 for the
Bagging model. The ROC curve indicates the high precision of the pro-
duction models. The ANN is the best suitable model for locational anal-
ysis of Tulaipanji rice cultivation in the study region.
4. Discussion of the result
According to the SFM, approximately 41.04 sq. km. (13.60 percent) of
the total is highly fertile, while 86.96 sq. km. (28.80 percent) is
moderately fertile. Because the soil fertility is quite low, around 52.98 sq.
km. of the total area looked to be inappropriate sites, notably in the
block's south, south-west, and northern regions. Based on the ﬁndings,
the areas with the best potential for Tulaipanji rice farming are 77.89 sq.
km (ANN model), 52.62 sq. km (SVM model), and 80.97 sq. km (Bagging
model). North-eastern part of Dhankoil G.P., North-western of Anantapur
G.P., Southern portion of Radhikapur G.P., Maximum portion of Mostafa
Nagar G.P. are has high potentiality to Tulaipanji farming. Least part of
the study area experienced a very low to moderate potentiality to
Tulaipanji cultivation.
People who live in alkaline soils are more likely to have zinc shortages
because of the inverse pH of the soil available. Some other things that
affect soil fertility are how much sulphur there is in it. Crops that grow
quickly can take in a lot of sulphur. Potassium treatments to rice ﬁeld
soils keep the redox potential of the soil from dropping. They also lower
the levels of active reducing chemicals and Fe2þ in the soil. Phosphorus
(P) is a big problem for tropical rice production because it's hard to ﬁnd.

Soil PH has a huge effect on the soil and its biological, chemical, and
physical properties. Because of the amount of Organic Carbon (SOC) in
the soil, these properties, as well as many others, can be affected. Rice N
took up more space in the soil when N energy (fertiliser) was injected at a

depth of 45 cm, which made it more clear (on average 74 per cent).
Having too little iron (Fe) makes it hard for plants to do their job of
photosynthesis, which lowers the amount of dry matter they make. Rice
plants' metabolic processes, such as photosynthesis and respiration, are
affected by a lack of copper (Cu). There are 132 crops that can't be grown
because of a lack of boron in more than 80 countries. The “Bulk Density”
of soil is a good way to tell if the soil has been compacted. The bulk
density of any soil is affected by its texture and the amount of SOC it has

in it. Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) controls how much nutrients the
soil can hold, as well as how often nitrogen (N) and potassium fertilisers
are applied. In a satellite image, the Normalized Difference Water Index
(NDWI) is used to emphasise open water features, enabling them to
“stand out” against the land and vegetation. The NDWI is quick enough to
get information on soil moisture in any area, and it has a reliable method
for mapping dry land and water. Elevation is very important to the
growth of Tulaipanji. For Tulaipanji farming, areas with high elevations
(33 m–38 m) are better. The highland crops may not be as affected by the
ﬂood. The slope of the land is an important part of farming. It's best to
have a slope of 3� for Tulaipanji farming. When Tulaipanji was grown
after the Monsoon season, it was done. When there is too much rain,
Tulaipanji can't grow.
Monoculture and short rotations increase crop species-specific weed,
pest, and disease pressure, increasing the need for synthetic chemical
pesticides, pesticide residues in crops. Consumers believe organic
farming is more sustainable, and that it beneﬁts the environment,
biodiversity, and food quality and safety. The combined application of
fertilisers and growth regulators can provide another option for miti-
gating the negative effects of water logging in crops, with the fertilisers
acting as a nutrient supply and the PGRs assisting with physiological
injury repair. Increased speciﬁcity of interactions between different
management strategies and the environment (soil types, intensity of
water logging, etc.) as well as between management practises. In general,
all kharif crops in India are cultivated in rainfed circumstances with little
irrigation. To sustain Tulaipanji farming, irrigation systems need be
installed in the Study area.

5. Conclusion
Population growth is exponential, yet land is a limited and precious
resource on our blue planet. Thus, it is critical to utilize that ﬁxed
resource sustainably in order to meet rising food demand without
damaging the land with improper land practices. To reduce the unde-
sirable impact of environmental features on agricultural productivity and
on land, land suitability analysis is the ﬁrst and foremost step for envi-
ronmental management and sustainable agriculture. Land suitability as-
sessments not only aid in increasing crop yields but also in maintaining
healthy soil conditions for bountiful output. The present study employs
AHP, GIS, and machine learning approaches to determine the soil fertility
and suitability of land for Tulaipanji rice cultivation in eastern India's
semi-humid climatic zone. According to the ﬁnal soil fertility map,
18.01% of the land is in excellent condition for agricultural production.
The generated models were validated using the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve. Although the AUC values for the ANN
(0.936), SVM (0.918), and Bagging (0.895) models are satisfactory, the
ANN model is regarded as the best ﬁt for mapping site suitability for
Tulaipanji rice cultivation in the research region. The results of the land
capability assessment using the machine learning SVM model indicated
that 17.43% (52.62 sq. km) of this block is quite excellent for Tulaipanji
cultivation. About 26.82% area is in excellent condition for Tulaipanji
cultivation as per the Bagging model. The ANN-based ﬁndings indicate
that areas with a proportion of 25.8% (77.89 sq. km) are highly suitable,
those with a proportion of 19.84 (59.90 sq. km) are moderately suitable,
and those with a proportion of 11.16% (33.69 sq. km) are least or not
suitable for Tulaipanji rice farming. The study results may add knowl-
edge to our current understanding and provide light on scientiﬁc land use
for sustainable agriculture and environmental management.
