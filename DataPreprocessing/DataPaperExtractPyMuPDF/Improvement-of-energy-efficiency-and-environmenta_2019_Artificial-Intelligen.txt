Combination of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and other management tools can help production units to improve
economic productivity and environmental protection. In this study, a combination of LCA and Data Envelopment
Analysis (DEA) was applied in order to improve the energy efﬁciency and reduce the environmental burdens of
rainbow trout farm in Ardal and Lordegan regions located in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province of Iran. The re-
quired data were collected from 60 rainbow trout farms in Ardal region and 38 rainbow trout farms in Lordegan
region through face-to-face questionnaire method. In Ardal region, total energy inputs, rainbow trout yield and
Energy Ratio (ER) were estimated as 60,483.50 MJ ton−1, 281.78 ton ha−1 and 0.40, respectively, while for
Lordegan region, these estimates were obtained as 77,183.63 MJ ha−1, 210.50 kg ha−1 and 0.33, respectively.
The results of LCA revealed that rainbow trout production in Ardal region had lower environmental burdens
than Lordegan region in all impact categories. Accordingly, Environmental Emissions Final Score (EEFS) in
Ardal and Lordegan regions were 1638.88 and 3484.31 ppt ton−1, respectively. The normalized results also
showed that Marine Aquatic Ecotoxicity (MAE) had the highest value among all impact categories in both re-
gions. The DEA results showed that in Ardal and Lordegan regions about 29.28% and 9.59% of the total energy
can be saved without reducing the yield, respectively. The highest potential for saving energy was related to
feed in both Ardal (24.74%) and Lordegan (9.12%) regions. The results of LCA coupled with DEA also revealed
that there is a higher potential for reduction of environmental impacts in Ardal region compare to Lordegan re-
gion. Accordingly, the EEFS value in Ardal and Lordegan regions were reduced by 27.34% and 8.85%, respectively.
Generally, rainbow trout production in Ardal region had higher energy efﬁciency, lower environmental burdens
and also higher potential to improve energy consumption and reduce the environmental impacts compared to
Lordegan region.

1. Introduction
Globally, aquaculture is an important economic activity which plays
a role in improving feeding and economic development in developing
countries such as Iran (Cacho, 1990). Among aquatic animals, ﬁsh pro-
vides about 20% of total animal protein and has high quality protein,
fat, and high amounts of vitamins and minerals (Bureau et al., 2002). Ac-
cording to reports by FAO (2018), total ﬁsheries and aquaculture pro-
duction was about 171 million tons in 2016. The shares of ﬁsheries
and aquaculture were about 47% (80 million tons) and 53%
(91 million tons), respectively. Additionally, FAO (2018) reported Iran
as the largest producer of trout ﬁsh species, producing 167,830 tons of
rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss). In Iran, about 40% of rainbow
trout ﬁsh has been produced in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari (22,803
tons), Lorestan (22,106 tons) and Kohgiluyeh-o-Boyer-Ahmad (19,500
tons) provinces (Anonymous, 2018).
Limitations in ﬁshing and lack of access to the some potential water
resources resulted in the maximum utilization of available resources in
aquaculture (Aubin et al., 2006). However, higher utilization of non-
renewable resources could reduce energy efﬁciency and lead to further
environmental problems. Any measure for managing and reducing en-
ergy consumption of inputs such as chemical fertilizers, agricultural ma-
chineries, labor, water, electricity and other inputs to improve energy
efﬁciency is the energy saving which is one of the easiest and the

most cost-effective methods to prevent climate change. Also, improve-
ment of the energy efﬁciency by energy saving would lead to a reduc-
tion in production costs which is very important to consumers. For
these reasons, improvement of energy efﬁciency has been included in
the strategy of production (Schnapp, 2012).
Increase in energy efﬁciency could be achieved by using methods
like data envelopment analysis (DEA). The ﬁrst DEA model was intro-
duced by Charnes et al. (1978). DEA is a nonparametric method and is
commonly used to estimate energy efﬁciency and environmental issues
based on decision making units (DMUs) (Zhou et al., 2008). This
method is a data-driven frontier analysis technique that considers a
piecewise linear surface to rest on top of the observations as efﬁcient
frontier (Adler et al., 2002). Unlike the parametric methods, DEA does
not require a function to relate inputs to outputs (Seiford and Thrall,
1990). There is difference between DEA and evolutionary algorithms
such as genetic algorithm. DEA approach is not capable of calculating
global optimum values. In DEA approach, the optimum values are deter-
mined on the basis of production units under consideration and in this
way global optimum values are not calculated. In the other words, the
objective of a DEA study is to select the DMU which is most efﬁcient
DMU compared to all DMUs under consideration (Shamshirband et al.,
2015). However, genetic algorithm does not always ensure that always
an optimal result.
In the other hand, the environmental problems could be assessed by
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. LCA is a standard, organized and
comprehensive method to assess the environmental impacts related
to a product or process throughout its life cycle (ISO 14040, 2006;
Shahvarooghi Farahani and Asoodar, 2017). Recently, LCA has been a
common tool to evaluate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a wide
range of the environmental impacts of agricultural systems (Goglio
et al., 2015). Therefore, combination of LCA and DEA, known as LCA
+ DEA methodology, has been introduced as a valuable method that
avoids concerns related to standard deviation (Iribarren et al., 2010).
In recent years, different researchers have indicated that the LCA+
DEA methodology led to optimal use of the inputs in agricultural sys-
tems in order to reduce energy consumption and environmental im-
pacts without a reduction in output. For instance, Mohseni et al.
(2018) conducted a study in Arak county of Iran, in which 58 grape pro-
ducers were analyzed by LCA + DEA methodology. They reported that a
range of 0.25 to 18% reduction among environmental impact categories
was observed. Mohammadi et al. (2013) used a combination of LCA and
DEA to assess the eco-efﬁciency of 94 soybean producers in Iran. Their
results indicated that LCA + DEA methodology reduced the average
global warming by 11%. Nabavi-Pelesaraei et al. (2017) conducted a
study using LCA + DEA methodology to assess the levels of operational
efﬁciency of 240 paddy farms. They indicated that global warming could
be reduced by 24% only if farmers operate based on the recommended
98 efﬁcient frontier values recommended by LCA + DEA. Increasing en-
ergy efﬁciency and reducing environmental impacts of production sys-
tems in order to achieve sustainable development goals is necessary and
the combined application of LCA and DEA could be a sensible option to
assess production systems and provide suggestions to decrease energy
consumption (Khoshnevisan et al., 2015). In the present study, LCA
was used as a tool for analyzing environmental burdens and DEA
allowed to optimize the inputs and consequently reduce the environ-
mental burdens.
Although, there are several studies in the literature which have in-
vestigated environmental impacts of ﬁsh farms (Aubin et al. (2006);
Bozoglu and Ceyhan (2009); Ayer and Tyedmers (2009); Aubin et al.

On other hand, considering that Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari prov-
ince ranked ﬁrst in trout production in Iran, conducting this study
seemed to be necessary. The main objectives of this study are as
follows:
(1) Energy ﬂow analysis of trout production;
(2) Assessment and analysis of environmental impacts of trout pro-
duction by LCA;
(3) Evaluation of energy efﬁciency and identiﬁcation of inefﬁciency
reasons of the energy in trout farms by DEA;
(4) Provide the improved pattern to reduce energy consumption in
trout farms based on efﬁcient units which are introduced by
DEA;
(5) A coupled LCA + DEA approach to reduce environmental bur-
dens through the improved energy consumption pattern.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Site of study and data collection
Area of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province area has been esti-
mated as 16,421 km2, which is 1% of total Iran's area. This province is
2153 m above the sea level located at 31° 9′ to 32° 38´ North latitude
and 49° 30′ to 51° 26′East longitude and has the largest share of Iran's
water resources (about 10%) (Fig. 1) (Anonymous, 2016). Chaharmahal
and Bakhtiari province has 404 trout farms and known as one of the
most important region of rainbow trout production in the world.
Ardal and Lordegan regions located at Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari prov-
ince have 113 and 72 trout farms, respectively, the highest share of the
province trout farms (45% of total trout breeding of the province)
(Anonymous, 2017).
Considering the number of trout farms in Ardal and Lordegan re-
gions, simple random sampling was used and the size of sample was cal-
culated using Cochran's formula (Eq. (1)) (Cochran, 1977).

where N is the number of trout farms in each region (113 trout farms in
Ardal region and 72 trout farms in Lordegan region), Z is the reliability
coefﬁcient (1.96 which denotes 95% reliability), p is the possibility of
success for an adjective in the population (equal to 0.5), q is the possibil-
ity of failure for an adjective in the population (equal to 0.5), d is the
permitted error from the average population (with a value of 0.05)
and n stands for the sample size of each region.

According to Cochran's formula, the sample size for Ardal and
Lordegan regions were calculated as 60 and 38 farms, respectively.
Thus, 60 and 38 trout farms were selected randomly from Ardal and
Lordegan regions, respectively. The required data were collected based
on one ton rainbow trout using face-to-face questionnaire method.
This method is conducted by an interviewer asking questions of a re-
spondent in person. Also, this tool was found useful to gather contextual
insights, especially when key organization representatives were
interviewed (e.g. farmers union, local authorities and community
groups). The required data includes fry, electricity, diesel fuel, natural
gas, water, ﬁsh feed (ﬁsh meal, ﬁsh oil, wheat gluten, corn gluten, rape-
seed meal, soybean meal, sweat sorghum and bean powder), labor and
transportation. A brief summary of sample questionnaire is provided in
Table 2.
2.2. Energy balance evaluation
To analyze energy ﬂow and optimize energy consumption in a pro-
duction system, it is necessary to calculate the input–output energies
in the ﬁrst step. Then, energy equivalents are used for transforming all
inputs and outputs to their energy equivalent (Mousavi-Avval et al.,
2011a). The average of the consumed inputs (per ton of trout) and the
yield for the two studied regions is shown in Table 3. The input and
output energies were calculated by multiplying the quantities of the in-
puts and output by their energy equivalents. According to the input en-
ergy, the quantity of the yield and the output energy, the energy indices
were calculated using the following equations (Elhami et al., 2016;
Fathollahi et al., 2018):

Energy indices help to assess the status of a system according to the
total energy input and the yield (or energy output). However, it cannot
help to ﬁnd out how the system would be improved. For instance, En-
ergy Ratio (ER) of a system could be improved by 2 times more yield
and 1.5 times more energy input. In spite of more ER, more energy

input would result in lower sustainability. Therefore, it seems to be nec-
essary to use other scientiﬁc methods such as DEA to evaluate the efﬁ-
ciency and sustainability of the systems (Houshyar et al., 2012).
2.3. Life cycle assessment
LCA approach follows the instructions provided by ISO 14040 (2006)
and ISO 14044 (2006). LCA allows identifying all the energy inputs, nat-
ural resources and the environmental burdens related to production,
transportation, utilization and disposal of a product (Guinée et al.,
2011). A LCA study consists of four main stages including deﬁnition of
goal and scope (system boundaries, functional unit, ﬁnal product and
assumptions), inventory analysis, impact assessment and interpretation
(Fig. 2). Combination of different stages of LCA and DEA is explained in
the following sections.
2.3.1. Goal and scope deﬁnition
Generally, in a LCA study, explicit expression of study goals repre-
sents how a study is carried out. LCA must be deﬁned based on desired
applications (ISO 14040, 2006). The aim of this study is to evaluate the
actual and improved environmental impacts of trout farms. In the
study scope deﬁnition, functional unit (FU) and system boundaries
should be clearly deﬁned. In this study, the FU which is deﬁned as a
brief description of the production process (Rebitzer et al., 2004) con-
sidered as one ton of produced trout. LCA is a “cradle to the grave” ap-
proach but it is possible to deﬁne the system boundaries in a way in
which only a part of the production system is considered and the results
are reported based on the system boundaries (Khoshnevisan et al.,
2013). This study focused on the stages from the cradle (production of
the inputs) to the pond gate (trout production) (Fig. 3).
2.3.2. Life cycle inventory (LCI)
The LCI represents a detailed compilation of the inputs (energy and
materials) and outputs (product and emissions to water, soil and air).
Data related to the foreground system (trout farm practices) were col-
lected using face-to-face questionnaire (Table 3) and data from the
background system (production of inputs) were taken from the
Ecoinvent database and the previous studies (Table 4) (EPA, 1998;
Nemecek and Kagi, 2007; Mousavi-Avval et al., 2017; Bureau et al.,
2002). To calculate the emissions from the inputs, the quantities of the
inputs and outputs were entered into SimaPro software. The Ecoinvent
database consists of the emissions (into water, air and soil) from differ-
ent production stages of different products and is deﬁned for most
countries in the world. This database also could be used for LCA studies
in Iran (Khoshnevisan et al., 2014a; Mousavi-Avval et al., 2017). Elec-
tricity was used for water pumps and aeration system. Considering
that N98% of electricity in Iran generated by natural gas (94.4%) and hy-
dropower (4.9%) and other energy resources generate limited and var-
iable amounts of electricity (Anonymous, 2012), it was assumed that
all amounts of electricity is generated by natural gas and hydropower.
Inventory data for the production of electricity from natural gas and hy-
dropower at reservoir were taken from Ecoinvent database. Natural gas

was used as a fuel for heating system. The emission from diesel fuel
combustion, natural gas burning and carbon dioxide emitted during
labor activities considered as the direct emissions and their emissions
coefﬁcients are shown in Table 4.
Emissions from nutrients to local environments associated with ﬁsh
growth were estimated by using nutrient-balance modeling (Cho and
Kaushik, 1990). This method has been adapted and validated for model-
ing rainbow trout (Bureau et al., 2002), and it has been previously used
for establishing an emissions inventory of rainbow trout (Papatryphon
et al., 2004). The N, P and solids emissions was calculated based on
the difference between the amount of nutrients provided to trout and
the amount assimilated as ﬁsh weight-gain. Solid and dissolved frac-
tions of emitted N and P was calculated based on digestibility of the nu-
trients, ﬁsh body-composition, and the non-ingested part of the
provided feed (estimated at 5% based on the expert opinion). The nutri-
ents release and theoretical oxygen demand (calculated using the
chemical oxygen demand of protein, carbohydrates, lipids, ash and
ﬁber emitted) per ton of trout is shown in section of the results.
2.3.3. Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA)
It is impossible to evaluate and compare the emissions from each the
inputs without categorizing the emissions. So, the results from LCI were
categorized in the different environmental impact categories (ISO
14040, 2006). There are different methods to deﬁne the environmental
impact categories. In this study, CML2 baseline 2000 was considered for
categorizing. Ten impact categories based on CML2 baseline 2000 in-
clude Abiotic Depletion (AD), Acidiﬁcation (AC), Global Warming
(GW), Eutrophication (EU), Ozone Layer Depletion (OLD), Human Tox-
icity (HT), Freshwater Aquatic Ecotoxicity (FAE), Marine Aquatic
Ecotoxicity (MAE), Terrestrial Ecotoxicity (TE) and Photochemical Oxi-
dation (PhO). (Anonymous, 2003). These categories have different
units and it is impossible to compare them to each other. Therefore, nor-
malization was used to make the categories non-dimensional
(Mousavi-Avval et al., 2017). For this purpose, SimaPro software
which has the coefﬁcients for normalization was used.
2.3.4. Interpretation of the results
In interpretation phase, the results obtained from the preceding
phases of the LCA are interpreted. Normalization and weighting are
optional steps used to solve the incompatibility of units and to sim-
plify the interpretation of the results. Normalization allows to better
understanding the contributions of impact categories to the global
environmental effects. Therefore, in order to development a rela-
tionship between normalization and weighting, Environmental
Emissions Final Score (EEFS) was introduced as following eq. 5
(Brentrup et al., 2004):
EEFS ¼
X
Ni � Wi
ð5Þ
where Ni stands for the normalized amount of each category and Wi
is the weight of the normalized amounts of each category. The coef-
ﬁcients for weighting were taken from Simapro software V.8.0.3.
2.4. Data envelopment analysis
According to Table 3, the amounts of inputs and output in trout
farms were different from each other in the both regions and a high
standard deviation was observed. This means that there are high po-
tential to improve the inputs, increase the energy efﬁciency and re-
duce the environmental impacts by using combination of LCA and
DEA. Generally, DEA is a data mining method to estimate productiv-
ity of the inputs and rank the production units based on their perfor-
mance. In DEA, each production unit is known as a decision making

unit (DMU). The distance between each DMU and the production
frontier refers to this fact that there is the possibility for improve-
ment of energy efﬁciency in that DMU. In Fig. 4, A, B, and C are
shown as the efﬁcient frontiers, whereas D, E, F and their combina-
tions are inefﬁcient (Stokes et al., 2007).
In DEA model, an inefﬁcient DMU can become efﬁcient through
reducing the quantities of the inputs without a reduction in the out-
put (input-based model), or through increase in the quantity of out-
put while the quantities of the inputs is kept the same as before
(output-based model) (Mousavi-Avval et al., 2011a). Considering
that the quantities of the inputs are controlled by trout producers
and different factors affecting the output, input-based model was se-
lected for this study. DEA based on constant returns to scale (CRS)
and variable returns to scale (VRS) models is expressed by technical
efﬁciency (TEf), pure technical efﬁciency (PTE) and scale efﬁciency
(SEf).
2.4.1. Technical efﬁciency
Technical efﬁciency (TEf) is deﬁned as the ratio between the sum
of weighted outputs to the sum of weighted inputs that is shown in
Eq. (6). The value of TEf varies between zero and one in which the
value of one represents that the DMU is a best performer located
on the production frontier and has no potential for improvement. A
TEf value less than one means that DMU is inefﬁcient (Mousavi-
Avval et al., 2011b).

where k is the DMU being evaluated in the set of j = 1, 2, …, n; x is the
amount of input; y is the output; m and n represent the number of in-
puts and outputs produced by the DMUs, respectively; urk and vik are
the matrix of weights assigned to outputs and inputs, respectively.
Charnes, Cooper & Rhodes introduced a linear program (Eq. (7)) to
solve Eq. (6) (Charnes et al., 1978):

ð8Þ
where θ is the TEf and i represents ith DMU (it will be ﬁxed in Eq. (6);
while j increases in Eq. (8)). The above model is known as the CRS
model which is a linear programming model. This model assumes that
there is no signiﬁcant relationship between the scale of production
units and efﬁciency (Avkiran, 2001). Therefore, the large units are con-
sidered as efﬁcient as small ones in converting inputs to output.
2.4.2. Pure technical efﬁciency
When variable returns to scale (VRS) model introduced by Banker,
Charnes & Cooper is used, PTE is considered to score and rank DMUs
(Banker et al., 1984). In other words, PTE is TEf which is affected by
the variation in scale efﬁciency. PTE compares efﬁcient and inefﬁcient
DMUs in the same environment and geographical conditions and it is
its advantage in comparison with TEf (Barnes, 2006). This model is cal-
culated on the basis of the following equation (Mohammadi et al.,
2013):
Max z ¼ uyj−uj
ð9Þ
Subject to:
vXi ¼ 1; −vX þ uY−u0e≤0
v≥0; u≥0 and u0 is unconstrained in sign
ð10Þ
where z and u0 are scalar and free in sign. u and ‘v’ are output and input
weight matrixes, and Y and X are corresponding output and input ma-
trixes, respectively. The letters xi and yj refer to the inputs and output
of jth DMU.
2.4.3. Scale efﬁciency
The small size of trout farms and improper use of the inputs could be
considered as the main reasons for inefﬁciency of DMUs. CRS model cal-
culates TEf and SEf while VRS model only considers PTE. In this study,
ﬁrst, the values for TEf and PTE were calculated for CRS and VRS models,
respectively. Then, SEf was calculated using the following equation
(Chauhan et al., 2006):
SEf ¼ TE
PTE
ð11Þ
Moreover, PTE is desired efﬁciency and SEf is the ratio between ac-
tual efﬁciency and desired efﬁciency. TEf is a combination of both SEf
and PTE. In brief, it can be said that SEf is the ratio between the efﬁciency
in CRS and VRS models.

In order to detect the most efﬁcient DMUs, they should be ranked ac-
cording to their importance based on the efﬁcient frontier. The bench-
mark ranking method as the most common technique in DEA studies
was used in the present study. The number of times each efﬁcient
DMU is observed in a referent set given by software show how similar
the efﬁcient DMUs are in comparison with inefﬁcient DMUs. Efﬁcient
DMUs that appear more frequently in the referent set are considered su-
perior and achieve a higher rank (Khoshnevisan et al., 2014b).
2.5. LCA+ DEA
In this study, the aim is to improve the inputs to conserve the energy
resources and reduce the environmental burdens of trout farms without
a signiﬁcant reduction in the output. To achieve this goal, ﬁrst, the data
was stored into Excel spreadsheets. EMS V1.3 software was used to
compute the improvements potential for each input. Hence, the PTE
was calculated for each DMU, and all DMUs were benchmarked based
on the Eq. (9). Then, SimaPro software was used to evaluate the envi-
ronmental burdens of the trout farms based on both the actual data
and the data modiﬁed by DEA (According to Fig. 2). Finally, efﬁcient
and inefﬁcient DMUs were speciﬁed and the quantities of the input en-
ergies and the environmental burdens of the two regions were calcu-
lated based on both the actual data and the data modiﬁed by DEA.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Input-output energy analysis
It is necessary in trout farms to know about the importance of each
factor in the production process and their inﬂuence on the output. Al-
though, there are many unpredictable natural and climate factors affect-
ing the production process and the output, but, the factors like the
quantities of the inputs could be controlled by the producers and their
quantities could be decided based on their inﬂuence on the
performance.
The average of the input energies needed for producing one ton of
trout in a 8 to 10 months breeding period are brought in Table 5. It
should be mentioned that the size of the farms was less than a hectare
and differences between the farms size seemed to be negligible.
Therefore, it was decided to consider a ton as the FU for calculations.
According to Table 5, the total energy inputs in Ardal and
Lordegan regions were obtained as 60,438.50 MJ ton−1 and
77,183.63 MJ ton−1, respectively. In a previous study, Bozoglu and
Ceyhan (2009) reported the total energy use per cubic meter was
46.57 MJ in Turkey's trout farms.
To compare the two regions from an energy efﬁciency point of
view, the energy indices were used. The ER and EPr in Ardal region
calculated as 0.40 and 19.72E-06 ton MJ−1, while in Lordegan region,

the ER and EPr were obtained as 0.33 and 16.40E-06 ton MJ−1, re-
spectively. These indices showed that the energy consumption in
Ardal region was more efﬁcient. The SE in Ardal region was
50,721.48 MJ ton−1, while in Lordegan region, the SE was obtained
as 60,749.57 MJ ton−1. According to the results, it is clear that
Lordegan region needs more attention to improve the total energy
needed for trout production. The main reason for difference between
the energy consumption results between two studied regions could
be attributed to the quantities and the shares of feed consumption.
To produce 1 ton trout in Ardal and Lordegan regions, 2727 and
3560 kg of feed were consumed, respectively.
Fig. 5 shows the shares of the inputs from the total energy inputs in
the studied regions. The share of feed in both region was about 74% of
the total energy inputs. In both regions, feed consisted of ﬁsh meal,
ﬁsh oil, rapeseed meal, wheat gluten, soybean meal, corn gluten,
sweet sorghum and bean powders. Fish meal and ﬁsh oil as animal
sources had the highest share among the feed ingredients in both re-
gions as 63% for Ardal region and 79% for Lordegan region. Therefore,
further researches to materialize the use of alternative sources of pro-
tein are necessary to replace the standard ﬁshmeal-based feed. This is
in agreement with the results of Bozoglu and Ceyhan (2009) who re-
ported that the budget of energy for trout farms strongly depends on
the share of consumed feed. Also, electricity had the secondary share
of the total energy inputs in both regions with about 19%. The high
share of electricity used in trout farms in both regions could be attrib-
uted to inefﬁcient aeration systems, worn electro pumps and lack of
the producers awareness of the required ﬂow and volume of water.
So, it is suggested that worn and old aeration systems and electro
pumps be checked and inspected.
3.2. DEA for improving the energy inputs
In DEA, DMU being efﬁcient or inefﬁcient depends on the ratio be-
tween the output and the inputs compared to other DMUs. As it is
shown in Fig. 6, 27 of 60 DMUs in Ardal region were identiﬁed as efﬁ-
cient (PTE value as 1) based on VRS model. Also, based on CRS model,
14 of 60 DMUs were recognized as efﬁcient with TEf and SEf as 1. All
14 efﬁcient DMUs in CRS model are efﬁcient in VRS model, and that is
the reason behind the same number of efﬁcient DMUs in TE and SEf. It
should be mentioned that 13 DMUs difference between TEf and PTE
could be attributed to inappropriate production scale. Also, it worth to
mention that TEf scores of 46 DMUs and PTE scores of 33 DMUs were
in the range of 0.4 to 0.99.
According to Fig. 7, 28 of 38 DMUs in Lordegan region had PTE score
as 1, and 12 DMUs had full TEf and SEf scores. 26 and 10 DMUs had ef-
ﬁciency scores in the ranges of 0.4 to 0.99 for TEf and PTE, respectively. It
should be noticed that full PTE score doesn't assure full TEf score.
The average and standard deviation of TEf, PTE and SEf of the DMUs
(trout farms) in the two regions are shown in Table 6. The average
scores of PTE, TEf and SEf for DMUs in Ardal regions were 0.86, 0.59
and 0.66, respectively. In Lordegan region, the average scores of PTE,
TEf and SEf for DMUs were calculated as 0.98, 0.69 and 0.70, respec-
tively. As it can be seen from Table 6, the maximum and minimum
scores for TEf, PTE and SEf were calculated. The standard deviation of
TEf is higher than PTE which indicates that trout producers have less
awareness of the appropriate breeding methods and the optimal
amounts of the inputs. In other words, it indicated that the breeders
used the energy inputs more that the optimal amounts or applied in
an improper time. The scores of SEf in Ardal (0.66) and Lordegan
(0.70) regions revealed that the inefﬁcient DMUs in Ardal and Lordegan
regions could increase their efﬁciency by following the suggestions
which result in optimal scale efﬁciency, up to 24 and 20%, respectively.
Abedi et al. (2011) conducted a study to optimize the efﬁciency of trout
farms in Fars province, Iran and reported the average of TE, PTE and SEf
as 0.93, 0.97 and 0.95, respectively.
The required energy inputs in the optimal condition, the percentage
of the saved energy for each input, the energy indices in the optimal
condition and the percentage of changes for the energy indices are
shown in Table 5. As it can be seen from Table 4, the total required en-
ergy inputs in the optimal condition in Ardal and Lordegan regions
were obtained as 42,769.71 MJ ton−1 (29.28% saved energy) and
69,777.69 MJ ton−1 (9.59% saved energy), respectively. It was revealed
that DMUs in Ardal region had higher potential to save energy com-
pared to Lordegan region. In Ardal region, electricity (47.16%) and diesel
fuel (43.70%) had highest shares of the saved energy, while in Lordegan
region, diesel fuel (21.25%) and water (19.35%) showed the highest po-
tential for saving energy. According to Table 4, the EPr in Ardal region
after improving the energy inputs increased from 19.72E-06 to
23.38E-06 ton MJ−1 (18.56% increase), while in Lordegan region, the
EPr increased from 16.40E-06 to 18.20E-06 ton MJ−1 (10.61% increase).
In other studies that DEA used to improve the energy inputs of crops in
Iran, an increase in the EPr was reported for alfalfa from 120.00E-06 to
130.00E-06 (10.6%) (Ghasemi Mobtaker et al., 2012), for kiwi from
800.04E-06 to 920.00E-06 (13.86% increase) (Mohammadi et al.,
2011) and for orange from 970.00E-06 to 1110.00E-06 (14.4% increase)

(Nabavi-Pelesaraei et al., 2014). As it is shown in Fig. 8, in both regions,
ﬁsh feed had the highest share of the total saved energy with 44.85%
(Ardal region) and 42.03% (Lordegan region). The suggestions for im-
proving feed were provided in the previous section.
As it was discussed in the previous section, benchmark ranking
method is a valuable method to detect the most appropriate DMUs
in the group. The ranking of the 60 DMUs in Ardal region and 38
DMUs in Lordegan region are presented in Table 7 and Table 8. As it
is shown in Table 7, the DMU 3 with 19 repetitions (see Table 7; Fre-
quency in referent set) was obtained as the top ranking in Ardal re-
gion. It means that this unit in addition to being efﬁcient, is close to
input–output levels of the most inefﬁcient units in the group and it
was followed by DMU 41 and DMU 57 with 18 and 14 repetitions, re-
spectively. The most important conclusion that can be taken from
these results is that, inefﬁcient DMUs can improve their energy use
efﬁciency by following the best practices of the efﬁcient DMUs. It
means an inefﬁcient DMU can be efﬁcient by following the some ef-
ﬁcient DMUs instead of using a single DMU as a benchmark. For ex-
ample, DMU 48 as an inefﬁcient unit that had the lowest PTE with
0.45 should follow the practices of DMU 15, 21 and 29 as composite
DMU which means that DMU 48 is close to the efﬁcient frontier
formed by these efﬁcient DMUs.
As it is shown in Table 8, the DMU 5 with 6 repetitions was obtained
as the top ranking in Lordegan region. To clarify benchmarking, consider
DMU 16 with PTE calculated as 0.935. To improve efﬁciency score of
DMU 16, it should be changed according to a composite DMU. The com-
posite DMU that represents the best practice is formed by the combina-
tion of DMU 5, DMU 7 and DMU 20. The number in the parentheses
known as intensity vector indicate that the inputs and output of inefﬁ-
cient DMU 16 is closer to DMU 7 compared to other two farms (DMU
5 and 20). Using intensity vectors and composite DMU, the optimum
amount of energy for DMU 16 can be worked out.

The PTE, actual and optimum amount of required energy from differ-
ent energy sources, for most efﬁcient and inefﬁcient units in Ardal and
Lordegan regions are shown in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. Using the
obtained information, it is possible to help a producer by providing sug-
gestions regarding the better operating practices by following his target
energy requirement from different inputs to reduce the input energy
levels to the target values without reduction in its output. So, dissemina-
tion of these results would be helpful to improve efﬁciency in rainbow
trout farms in the surveyed regions. For example, in the last column of
Table 7, the Energy Saving Target Ratio (ESTR) percentage for 33 inefﬁ-
cient farms in Ardal region are presented. As it can be seen, for inefﬁ-
cient DMUs, ESTR was varied in the range between 4.59% (DMU 47) to
85.60% (DMU 49), with the average of 44.26% that indicate between
inefﬁcient DMUs, DMU 47 was the best, and DMU 49 was the most inef-
ﬁcient unit.
3.3. LCA results
The contributions of the inputs to each impact category for trout pro-
duction in the regions are shown in Figs. 9 and 10. The emissions from
electricity generation in power plants had a contribution of 29% on the
MAE in both regions. In Ardal region, the ﬁsh meal had the share of
75%, 72%, 72%, 63% and 42% on the AD, AC, GW, Pho and EP, respectively,
while in Lordegan region, the ﬁsh meal had the share of 82%, 81%, 78%,
44% and 55% on the AD, AC, GW, Pho and EP, respectively. Also, ﬁsh oil
in Ardal region had a contribution of 73%, 62% and 60%, on the HT, FAE

and OLD, respectively, while in Lordegan region, ﬁsh oil had the share of
80, 73% and 62% on the HT, FAE and OLD, respectively. Also, in Ardal re-
gion, wheat gluten and rapeseed meal had the share of 37% and 43% of
total contribution to TE, respectively, while in Lordegan region, these
two inputs had the share of 16% and 36% of total contribution to TE, re-
spectively. Finally, In Lordegan region, the direct emissions from feed
consumption, diesel fuel, natural gas and labor had the share of 24% of
total contribution to PhO.
Considering that about 7 million tons ﬁsh meal and 1 million tons
ﬁsh oil are produced per year (International ﬁsh meal and ﬁsh oil orga-
nization (FAO, 2006)), the increase in production of aquaculture prod-
ucts makes an important challenge for diversiﬁcation of protein and
lipid sources. Using feeds containing high levels of wild-ﬁsh protein in
raising carnivorous ﬁsh is greatly under debate in aquaculture, particu-
larly when it comes to comparison of ﬁsh farming with commercial ﬁsh-
ing (Ellingsen and Aanondsen, 2006). In a study conducted in Greece, it
was reported that feed in trout farms had 73% and 68% of total contribu-
tion to GW and AC, respectively (Aubin et al., 2009). Researches focused
on identifying plant-based alternatives to ﬁsh meal and oil (FAO, 2006),
and there is optimistic outlook to ﬁnd high-quality inputs to replace
them. The use of ﬁsh by-products as a complementary the nutritional
inputs to plant-based diets seems an interesting way. In this way, de-
pendence on the stocks which are needed for producing ﬁsh meal and
the environmental burdens associated with the ﬁsh feed can be de-
creased (Papatryphon et al., 2004). However, the availability of these
by-products is a problem and they are available only in certain markets,
which does not make them a global solution. Considering that most of
electricity in Iran is generated from fossil fuels and has a signiﬁcant
emissions, it is clear that using more efﬁcient electro pumps and aware-
ness about the amount of water needed in the different production
phases would cause a considerable reduction in the environmental
burdens.
The values of characterization, normalization and weighting of the
impact categories for a ton produced trout in the regions are shown in
Table 9. These values consist of the direct (the emission during trout
production) and indirect emissions (the inputs production). The GW
as the most important category in Ardal and Lordegan region were cal-
culated as 617.61 and 1379.89 kg CO2 per ton of trout, respectively. The
main reason for this difference is higher direct emissions in Lordegan re-
gion. In similar studies, the value of GW per a ton of trout produced in
Germany, Greece and Canada were reported as 2239 kg CO2 (Samuel-
Fitwi et al., 2013), 2753 kg CO2 (Aubin et al., 2009) and 2073 kg CO2
(Ayer and Tyedmers, 2009), respectively. Samuel-Fitwi et al. (2013)
conducted a LCA study to evaluate different production systems includ-
ing extensive, intensive and recirculating aquaculture systems in rain-
bow trout production and reported that recirculating aquaculture
systems had the largest impact on GW and AC, while its impact on EP
was the lowest compared to two other systems. Also, the emissions
from feed production had the highest contribution to the GW as 96%
and 46% in extensive and intensive system, respectively, while, their
contributions to AC were 97% and 73%, respectively. In another study
in Canada, LCA approach was used to quantify and compare the poten-
tial environmental impacts of culturing salmonids in a conventional ma-
rine net-pen system with those of three reportedly environmentally-
friendly alternatives; a marine ﬂoating bag system; a land-based saltwa-
ter ﬂow through system; and a land-based freshwater recirculating

system. Their results showed that while the use of these closed-
containment systems may reduce the local ecological impacts typically
associated with net-pen salmon farming, the increase in material and
energy demands may result in a signiﬁcantly increase in several envi-
ronmental impacts of global concern, including GW, AD and AC (Ayer
and Tyedmers, 2009).
The normalization values were calculated by SimaPro software
which contains the special coefﬁcients for each category. The normaliza-
tion values of MAE, AC and FAE were higher than other impact catego-
ries. The all normalized impact categories related to Lordegan region
were higher in comparison with Ardal region (Fig. 11). More uses of
the inputs are the main reason for this difference between the regions.
In the ﬁnal section of the environmental impacts analysis, EEFS was
calculated by summing up the values of the weighting column. The EEFS
values for a ton of trout produced in Ardal and Lordegan regions were
calculated as 1683.88 PPt and 3484.31 PPt, respectively. As it was ex-
pected, ﬁsh meal had the highest contribution to EEFS in Ardal and
Lordegan regions with 48% and 57%, respectively.
The direct emissions for a ton of trout are presented in Table 10. The
direct emissions from diesel fuel, natural gas and human labor were cal-
culated based on Table 4. The direct emissions from the feed were esti-
mated using nutrient-balance modeling (Cho and Kaushik, 1990). As it
can be seen from Table 10, diesel fuel had the highest contribution to
the direct emissions into air. Fish feed, although, had no direct emissions
into air but was the only input that had the direct emissions to water.
3.4. LCA + DEA results
Based on the PTE scores for the inefﬁcient DMUs calculated by EMS
software, the improved inputs was obtained and new LCA analysis con-
ducted with the new modiﬁed LCI. The ten impact categories computed
through SimaPro software based on the optimal condition and com-
pared to the impact categories computed based on the actual data
(Table 11). According to the LCA + DEA results, in Ardal region, despite
the lower environmental impacts, there were more potential to reduce
the environmental impacts compared to Lordegan region. Also, there
were more potential to reduce the energy inputs in Ardal region com-
pared to Lordegan region. The optimal uses of the inputs in Ardal region
had the highest potential to reduction of AD and TE as 45.47% and
44.14%, while in Lordegan region, the results showed that TE had the
highest reduction potential as 38.49%. The LCA + DEA results showed
that improvements of ﬁsh meal and wheat gluten had the highest con-
tribution to AD and TE, respectively. Moreover, based on LCA + DEA,
GW was reduced as 26.43% (454.36 kg CO2 eq per ton of trout) in
Ardal region, while in Lordegan region, the reduction of GW was calcu-
lated as 8.78% (1258.65 kg CO2 eq. per ton of trout). Finally, the LCA

+ DEA results showed that the EEFS value in Ardal and Lordegan re-
gions was reduced by 27.34% and 8.85%, respectively. Vázquez-Rowe
et al. (2011) coupled LCA with DEA to evaluate the environmental im-
pacts of coastal ﬁsh production in Spain. Their results showed that
using LCA coupled with DEA led to a reduction in diesel fuel consump-
tion which had the largest contribution to all impact categories. They re-
ported that using LCA coupled with DEA resulted in an increase in
operational efﬁciency, reducing input costs and the environmental
burdens.
4. Conclusions
The main aim of this study was to improve the energy efﬁciency and
consequently reduce the environmental impacts in rainbow trout farms
in Ardal and Lordegan regions located at Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari
Province of Iran. For this purpose, the required data were collected
from rainbow trout farms in Ardal and Lordegan regions. Based on the
DEA results, the total required energy inputs in Ardal and Lordegan re-
gions were calculated as 42,769.71 MJ ton−1 (29.28% saved energy) and
69,777.69 MJ ha−1 (9.59% saved energy), respectively. Also, LCA tool
was used to assess the environmental impacts of rainbow trout farms.
The LCA results revealed that ﬁsh meal, ﬁsh oil and electricity in produc-
tion stage were the major contributors to the impact categories in the
studied regions. Based on LCA + DEA, GW was reduced by 26.43% and
8.78% in Ardal and Lordegan regions, respectively.
Finally, it can be said that DEA is used to show the hot spots in crop
production meaning that the producers are informed that for which
input there is a higher potential for better management in terms of en-
ergy and environmental performance. Then they focus on those inputs
with higher potential. In other words, we were not meant to practically
reduce energy consumption but we were aimed at ﬁnding the sources
of energy with higher energy saving potential. When a system is opti-
mized, we do not force the production system to reduce all application
rates but we are meant to combine different application of inputs in
order to reduction of production costs as direct (reduction in the cost
of the inputs) and indirect (reduction in the environmental cost). Con-
sidering the high feed costs, government could help trout producers
by controlling the feed costs especially through providing alternative
sources of protein that are necessary to replace the standard ﬁshmeal-
based feed and identiﬁcation of plant-based alternatives to ﬁsh meal
and oil. Leveling pond bottom and creating a uniform slope could lead
to a considerable reduction in water use and electricity. The electricity
generation in fossil-based power plants has signiﬁcant environmental
problems. Considering solar potential in Iran, it is suggested that some
study be conducted to evaluate the potentials for developing solar
power plants and generate more environmentally friendly electricity.
Moreover, government measures to use clean energies would also en-
courage farmers to use more clean energy technologies. Consequently,
quantify the environmental impacts associated with the different
production phases using LCA method can help to identify potential im-
provement options that could signiﬁcantly reduce environmental im-
pacts and enhance environmental efﬁciency of a production system or
a product. Also, it could help to identify the underlying problems of
the different impacts which is important in ﬁnding solutions for achiev-
ing sustainability in aquaculture.
