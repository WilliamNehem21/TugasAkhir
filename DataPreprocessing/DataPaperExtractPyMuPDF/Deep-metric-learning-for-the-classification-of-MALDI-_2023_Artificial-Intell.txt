Deep Learning techniques have signiÔ¨Åcant advantages for mass spectral classiÔ¨Åcation, such as parallelized signal 
correction and feature extraction. Deep Metric Learning models combine Metric Learning to determine the degree 
of similarity or diÔ¨Äerence between a set of mass spectra with the generalization power of Deep Learning to 
improve feature extraction even further. The two most popular of these models combine multiple neural networks 
with identical architectures and are commonly called Siamese (SNN) and Triplet Neural Networks (TNN). Herein, 
using both SNNs and TNNs, we intended to taxonomically categorize two sets of previously-validated mass spectra 
that corresponded to 30 species of Neotropical arthropods in the Culicidae and Ixodidae families, some of which 
are disease vectors. The eÔ¨Äectiveness of SNNs and TNNs to correctly classify 826 spectra from 12 mosquito 
species and 310 spectra from 18 species of hard ticks was highly eÔ¨Äective, with both algorithms performing with 
minimal average loss during cross-validation. SNNs produced accuracy rates for ticks and mosquitoes of 91.22% 
and 94.46%, respectively, while accuracy rates of 93% and 99% were obtained with TNNs. Our results indicate 
that Deep Metric Learning is a practical machine learning tool for quickly and precisely classifying MALDI-TOF- 
generated mass spectra of Neotropical and public-health-relevant arthropod species. 
1. Introduction 
At the forefront of public health concerns is the global threat from 
emerging vector-borne zoonotic diseases, which is increasing with the 
continuous geographical expansion of humans and vector species, and 
the spread of novel pathogens [1] . Despite historical eÔ¨Äorts to prevent 
the spillover of pathogens from wildlife into people, the risk of emerging 
vector-borne diseases is still high in many regions around the world, 
particularly in developing countries such as Panama where large socio- 
economically vulnerable indigenous communities reside [2] . 
Several vector-borne pathogens present in Panama, including 
mosquito-transmitted Plasmodium (e.g., malaria) and tick-transmitted 
pathogenic Rickettsia (e.g., Rocky Mountain spotted fever), are only 
mitigated by the elimination and monitoring of vector populations 
[3,4] . However, most studies on arthropod species in Panama have 
concentrated on a few species, and the vast majority of species re-

main unstudied to this day [5,6] . This is in part due to the diÔ¨Écul- 
ties encountered when trying to lab-raise rare species, as well as the 
lack of accurate, reliable, and cost-eÔ¨Äective species identiÔ¨Åcation meth- 
ods other than the traditional morphological identiÔ¨Åcation techniques. 
Moreover, cryptic species complexes are a group of taxa with similar 
morphologies that belong to diÔ¨Äerent evolutionary units and are eas- 
ily confused with one another when recognized using morphological 
characters [2,7] . 
Accordingly, developing novel identiÔ¨Åcation approaches for arthro- 
pods that can accurately and rapidly catalog the large biodiversity of 
arthropods that exist, is a topic of great interest in Panama [8,9] , where 
several vector-borne diseases are still common [10,11] . With the largest 
number of described species of mosquitoes and hard ticks in Central 
America, Panama oÔ¨Äers an unique opportunity to assess the usefulness 
of novel techniques to taxonomically characterize this elevated biodi- 
versity. Previous work in Panama has established the presence of 265

mosquito species and 23 Ixodid tick species that can parasitize wildlife 
and humans [2,7] . 
Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a high-performance analytical tool that 
can be employed to characterize and identify complex biological sam- 
ples. There exist diÔ¨Äerent techniques to acquire spectral signals. One of 
particular interest in this work is known as Matrix-Assisted Laser Des- 
orption/Ionization - Time of Flight or MALDI-TOF, which is considered a 
two-dimensional method geared to understand complex molecular sam- 
ples via ionization and later time-of-Ô¨Çight discrimination [12,13] . Be- 
sides ‚Äútrue ‚Äù proteomics, an exciting and growing application of MALDI- 
TOF MS is the use of protein proÔ¨Åles, or ‚Äúmass Ô¨Ångerprints ‚Äù, to identify 
species of microorganisms [14] , and more recently of arthropod speci- 
mens, from eggs all the way to adults [15‚Äì18] 
A typical MALDI-TOF mass Ô¨Ångerprint experiment generates a large 
number of spectral signals that must be pre-processed before machine 
learning algorithms can automatically classify and identify arthropod 
species [19,20] . Mass spectral features allow for the identiÔ¨Åcation of 
distinct biomarkers that characterize diÔ¨Äerent biological species. For in- 
stance, MALDI-TOF has been previously used in Panama by our team, for 
species identiÔ¨Åcation in two of the most important taxonomic families 
of arthropods that contain vectors of disease: Culicidae (i.e., mosquitoes) 
[2,16,21] and Ixodidae (i.e., hard ticks) [7] . 
Loaiza et al. [2] and Gittens et al. [7] used Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA) [22] and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [23] to 
categorize Panama‚Äôs mosquitoes and ticks mass spectra, respectively, 
acquired from samples stored under various conditions (e.g., dry-frozen 
or in alcohol at room temperature). Both of these algorithms focus on 
transforming the input data unto an orthogonal sub-space in which new 
features allow to discard irrelevant information, improving classiÔ¨Åca- 
tion eÔ¨Éciency. This type of machine learning framework is preceded by 
a pre-processing stage consisting of signal smoothing (Savitzky-Golay 
Ô¨Ålter) and baseline correction to remove noise and improve performance 
classiÔ¨Åcation. Another approach by L√≥pez-Fern√°ndez et al. [24] featured 
a software platform named Mass-Up which implemented unsupervised 
learning algorithms together with PCA to facilitate the pre-processing 
and analysis of MALDI spectra. However, these types of algorithms may 
not be eÔ¨Écient or robust enough to continuously learn and reliably clas- 
sify mass spectra from various arthropod families, collected and stored 
with diÔ¨Äerent techniques and processed and analyzed with diÔ¨Äerent pa- 
rameters and equipment. 
Another branch of machine learning that shows promise for mass 
spectra analysis and classiÔ¨Åcation is Deep Learning, which comprises 
all the techniques and algorithms related to ArtiÔ¨Åcial Neural Networks 
(ANN). The inception of these algorithms was inspired by the function- 
ing of neurons in the human brain. These models carry out an adaptive 
learning process through multiple nonlinear mathematical transforma- 
tions based on multivariable calculus and tensor algebra [25] . 
Deep Metric Learning is a technique that combines Deep Learning 
elements with the concept of Metric Learning (MeL), in which a model 
attempts to learn features from objects (such as signals and images) por- 
trayed as numerical vectors in terms of their distance and location in 
a multidimensional space. This concept implies that two vectors in a 
neighboring space will have similar features, while distances between 
them indicate varying degrees of dissimilarity [26] . A classic example of 
MeL algorithms corresponds to K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) [27] , which 
performs the classiÔ¨Åcation process based on a distance metric (e.g., Eu- 
clidean, angular [cosine], Manhattan) to a reference sample and the ùëò 
neighboring samples that are in the nearby vector space. 
To understand the diÔ¨Äerences between Deep Metric Learning and 
Deep Learning-based methods, one may consider the analogy of a person 
(i.e., an intelligent model) learning to discriminate between diÔ¨Äerent ob- 
jects in a given data set. One approach to this task is for the person to 
carefully study the deÔ¨Åning characteristics of each class of objects (i.e., 
Deep Learning). Alternatively, the person learns to determine the simi- 
larities between objects regardless of their predetermined label. Further- 
more, one can illustrate both methodologies by describing how a ma-

chine learning model learns to classify an object ( Fig. 1 ). For example, 
classical neural networks learn a feature space or representation (a set 
of all possible numerical values of a class), while Deep Metric Learning 
methods seek to generate an embedding , an alternative characterization 
of the original data projected into a latent space (i.e., a low-dimensional 
space generated to preserve the most prominent features) where similar 
objects appear closer [26] . 
Some mass Ô¨Ångerprinting applications related to Deep Learning in- 
clude the work of Rakotonirina et al. [28] , which employed Convolu- 
tional Neural Network (CNN) models to detect the presence of the Wol- 
bachia bacteria in the mosquito Aedes aegypti . The study featured a vot- 
ing scheme in which the MALDI spectra dataset was partitioned into 
15 parts, each of which was modelled by a similar neural network, and 
the Ô¨Ånal inference was computed by considering each model predic- 
tion. Moreover, computer vision has been used to test the eÔ¨Äectiveness 
of Transfer Learning models to improve the identiÔ¨Åcation of triatomine 
bugs that transmit Chagas disease to humans across the Americas [29] . 
In recent years with the advent of machine learning oriented frameworks 
utilizing Deep Learning [30] models, new approaches have been imple- 
mented in the context of arthropod detection and classiÔ¨Åcation using 
CNN [31] . However, to our knowledge no previous studies have applied 
Deep Metric Learning for the rapid identiÔ¨Åcation of arthropods from the 
biodiverse Neotropical region. In the work presented here, advanced 
feature extraction techniques based on Deep Learning and CNN, pur- 
posely designed to work with mass spectra without any pre-processing, 
were used to improve the classiÔ¨Åcation tasks of Neotropical mosquito 
and tick species, some of which are important disease vectors. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. MALDI-TOF MS data sets 
Two previously published data sets of MALDI-TOF spectra from 
Neotropical arthropods were used, belonging to the taxonomic fami- 
lies Culicidae ( i.e. , mosquitoes) [2] and Ixodidae ( i.e. , hard ticks) [7] . All 
the methods for sample collection in the Ô¨Åeld, sample processing ( i.e. , 
protein extraction from arthropod legs), MALDI-TOF analyis and spectra 
selection were described in detail in the cited studies. In brief, we com- 
piled samples from 12 distinct biological species of mosquitoes ( Table 1 ) 
and 18 distinct biological species of ticks ( Table 2 ), each species with a 
diÔ¨Äerent number of specimens and, thus, a diÔ¨Äerent number of spectra 
collected. All the samples were pre-identiÔ¨Åed using morphological keys. 
Mosquitoes were stored dry-frozen before MS analysis, while ticks had 
been stored for several years in 70% ethanol. For spectra selection into 
the database, three technical replicates were collected from each speci- 
men, and each spectra had to meet a minimum criterion of at least one 
peak with an intensity of 3500 arbitrary units (a.u.) for mosquitoes, and 
1000 a.u. for ticks ( Fig. 2 ).

species Amblyomma naponense , collected as in-

2.2. Machine learning architecture: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) 
CNN have been the most commonly employed architectures in recent 
years for image recognition, classiÔ¨Åcation, and detection tasks. This class 
of neural networks has three main types of layers that perform the oper- 
ations of convolution, pooling (for feature extraction) and classiÔ¨Åcation 
by means of an ANN. These architectures are made up of modules or 
blocks that are stacked one after the other depending on the complexity 
of the model [30] . 
The network architecture utilized in this study ( Fig. 3 ) draws inspira- 
tion from the classic convolutional architecture, LeNet [32] . The design 
includes parameters and an activation function called Leaky ReLu [33] , 
which mitigates the vanishing gradient issue that can make the neural 
network struggle to learn new data due to very small changes in param- 
eter optimization during training. 
Additionally, the last layer, which produces embeddings, includes 
Óà∏ 2 normalization [34] , which aims to maximize the distance between 
positive (similar) and negative (diÔ¨Äerent) samples [35] . Additionally, to 
address the challenge of unbalanced classes, we applied the technique 
of class weights [36] . This technique penalizes the misclassiÔ¨Åcation of 
minority classes within the data set. 
The Ô¨Ånal architecture comprises three convolutional blocks, each 
with one-dimensional convolution layers. The Ô¨Årst block has 32 Ô¨Ålters, 
the second has 16 Ô¨Ålters, and the third has 8 Ô¨Ålters. Batch normalization 
[37] is applied to each convolutional block. The dense layers consist of 
32 and 16 neurons and incorporate dropout. Finally, the optimizer al- 
gorithm used is Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) [38] . 
2.2.1. Siamese neural networks (SNN) 
The SNN consist of a pair of interconnected neural networks with 
identical parameters that are trained in parallel, whose uniÔ¨Åed ar- 
chitecture and learning is governed by the contrastive loss function

The contrastive loss function [39] ( Eq. (1) ) aims to optimize the per- 
formance of the classiÔ¨Åcation model by measuring the similarity be- 
tween pairs of samples, denoted by a binary label ùë¶ ,where ùë¶ = 0 denotes 
similarity between samples and ùë¶ = 1 denotes dissimilarity. The func- 
tion takes in two input samples, ùë• 1 and ùë• 2 , and calculates the Euclidean 
distance between their respective embeddings ( i.e. , mapping functions 
ùëî ( ùë• 1 ) and ùëî ( ùë• 2 ) ). Then, the diÔ¨Äerence between embeddings is computed 
and normalized to form the distance measure, ùëë( ùë• 1 , ùë• 2 ) . 
During training, the parameters of ùëî( ùë• ùëõ ) are adjusted to minimize 
the loss (error rate) by reducing the distance measure between similar 
samples while maximizing it between dissimilar samples. This is, the 
function optimizes an embedding space where similar spectra are in the 
same embedding neighborhood while dissimilar ones are distant. This 
is completed by setting a threshold value ( ùõº) such that the distance be- 
tween similar samples is smaller than ùõº, while the distance between 
dissimilar samples is larger than ùõº. 
This structure is similar to that of the binary cross-entropy loss func- 
tion, which is commonly used in binary classiÔ¨Åcation problems [40] . 
The main advantage of this loss function is that it allows for a multi- 
class problem to be translated into a binary classiÔ¨Åcation problem. This 
enables the model to perform Ô¨Çexible comparisons, such as comparing 
one class to many by making pairs consisting of one species and many 
others. This Ô¨Çexibility is particularly useful in problems where there are 
many classes and comparisons between classes are important for the 
analysis, such as in the case of arthropod species. 
2.2.2. Triplet neural networks (TNN) 
The ( TNN ) are considered an extension of SNN because of the uniÔ¨Åed 
architecture with identical parameters and the learning technique that 
attempts to train a model to minimize intra-class distance and maximize 
inter-class distance between classes of objects [41] ( Fig. 5 ). However, 
the Triple Loss function ( Eq. (3) ) is used to learn how to generate an 
embedding space ùëî( ùë• ) by computing the distance between triplets of 
samples. 
ùëá ùêøùëúùë†ùë† =

) + ùõº ‚àí ùëë (ùë• ùëé , ùë• ùëõ 
), 0 }
+ 
(3) 
A triplet is formulated based on an anchor ùë• ùëé , a positive ùë• ùëù and a neg- 
ative ùë• ùëõ sample, each with their respective labels ( ùë¶ ùëé , ùë¶ ùëù , ùë¶ ùëõ ) , under the 
condition that ùë¶ ùëù = ùë¶ ùëé and ùë¶ ùëõ ‚â† ùë¶ ùëé , where the Euclidean distance ( ùëë) is 
calculated based on the embeddings generated by the neural networks 
( Fig. 5 ). 
Unlike SNNs that can be trained directly with random pairs of sam- 
ples generated during the training, TNNs require a stage of triplet selec- 
tion, since training a network with all possible triplets from a data set 
represents a high and ineÔ¨Écient cubic computational complexity Óàª ( ùëõ ) 3 , 
and not all triplets contribute to the eÔ¨Écient learning of the network. 
A way to understand the necessity of selecting the right triplets to 
feed to a neural network is to assume that a model, like a human being, 
learns better to identify diverse objects from studying hard examples 
where the diÔ¨Äerent classes have similar or near identical features. Ac- 
cording to this assumption and the work of SchroÔ¨Ä et al. [41] , one of the 
most eÔ¨Écient methods is to generate triplets during the training cycle 
(epoch) and only employ the hard triplets generated from the mini batch 
of samples at each part of the cycle, also known as Online Triplet Mining

Fig. 6. Description of the types of triplets based on the parameter ùõº. 
[26] . The selection criteria also depends on the threshold parameter ùõº
( Fig. 6 ). 
Moreover, it is necessary to remark that TNNs are used as a method 
of feature extraction, unlike SNNs where both feature extraction and 
classiÔ¨Åcation are performed by the same architecture. The neural net- 
works will have their parameters optimized during training to produce 
a new embedding space where another metric learning model (in this 
case, K-NN) will perform the multi-class classiÔ¨Åcation stage. 
2.3. Data analysis: Experimental settings 
Data sets used in this study are described in Tables 1 and 2 with 
a total of 826 mosquito and 310 tick spectra, respectively. The distri- 
bution of samples for model training and testing was 80%/20% in the 
case of mosquitoes, as had been the case with our previously published 
machine learning algorithms [2,7] , but had to be adjusted for ticks to 
70%/30% as will be described ahead. As explained in Section 2.2 , the 
usage of CNN allowed to train models with input raw spectra without the 
need for signiÔ¨Åcant pre-processing steps. Therefore, the only step before 
training was to take ùëõ Ô¨Årst features of each spectra sample (according 
to the smallest spectrum of the data set), yielding numerical arrays of 
ùëõ = 52906 and ùëõ = 52570 features for ticks and mosquitoes respectively. 
Due to the special training scheme that SNN architectures imply 
( Section 2.2.1 ), pairs of samples were Ô¨Årst generated randomly, main- 
taining a similar distribution of samples between the diÔ¨Äerent classes 
to avoid biases due to sample imbalance ( Table 3 ). After performing

manual parameter experimentation, we selected the threshold value of 
ùõº = 0 . 55 for both ticks and mosquitoes. 
For the TNN, the ùõº was set to 0.4, and it should be noted that the 
best performance for TNN training was achieved using an Online Triplet 
Mining scheme with Hard Negative Triplets ( Fig. 6 ). Furthermore, this 
prompted an adjustment to 70%/30% train/testing data splitting for 
the tick‚Äôs data set, which had more classes with fewer samples per class 
compared to mosquitoes ( Table 4 ). Ultimately, this adjustment was nec- 
essary to avoid computational errors produced during the validation 
stage after each training epoch, where the mining algorithm failed to 
Ô¨Ånd triplets that fulÔ¨Åll the similarity criteria described in Section 2.2.2 . 
Furthermore, in order to avoid over-Ô¨Åtting, the SNN models were 
trained with k-fold cross validations, with ùëò = 5 , for 30 epochs with a 
batch size of 16 samples. The TNN were trained with a batch size of 24 
samples, using a K-ShuÔ¨Ñe Split validation scheme (also known as Monte 
Carlo Cross Validation) for 20 iterations and 32 epochs in each one. This 
validation scheme produces better results when dealing with data sets 
containing limited samples per class [42] . 
2.4. Evaluation metrics 
Error metrics were calculated for each model and data set combi- 
nation. A confusion matrix listing True Negatives (TN), True Positives 
(TP), False Negatives (FN) and False Positives (FP) was also used to rep- 
resent the total number and proportion of samples that were correctly 
or incorrectly predicted ( Table 5 ). 
Moreover, using the items of the confusion matrix, other error met- 
rics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-score ( Eqs. 4‚Äì7 , respec- 
tively) were computed and later compared for each model.

2.5. Software and hardware speciÔ¨Åcations 
The models developed in this work have been implemented using 
the Python programming language, with open-source software libraries 
such as: TensorÔ¨Çow [43] , Scipy [44] and Scikit-learn [45] . Deep Learn- 
ing models were trained on the Google Colab [46] online platform with 
a Tesla T4 GPU with 16GB VRAM. 
Additionally, to illustrate the particular learning process of the mod- 
els based on Deep Metric Learning , embedding visualizations were cre- 
ated using the dimension reduction algorithm called pacmap [47] . 
3. Results 
3.1. ClassiÔ¨Åcation with siamese neural networks (SNN) 
SNN models exhibited good performance to classify mosquitoes 
( Fig. 7 ) and ticks ( Fig. 8 ) mass spectra. The training loss and accuracy 
of SNN with the mosquito data set improved considerably after the Ô¨Årst 
cross-validation ( Fig. 7 A and C, Fold 1 in blue), which was the only 
iteration that clearly separated from the rest. Similarly, the loss and ac- 
curacy average for the validation stage using the remaining 20% of the 
data set also seemed to converge from Fold 2 to 5 ( Fig. 7 B and D) for 
mosquitoes and Fig. 8 -B, D for ticks. The jagged and oscillating curves 
in these validation graphs could be signs of slight over-Ô¨Åtting, with Fold 
3 (green line) exhibiting the greatest instability. However, after Fold 4 
and Fold 5 the model seems to have reached a stable steady state, mean- 
ing that it successfully learned to distinguish from existing species with 
a Ô¨Ånal loss and accuracy average of 0.0392 and 91.22%, respectively. 
The results of the SNN model performance with the tick data set was 
very similar to the mosquitoes, except for the fact that the model seemed 
to require Fold 3 or more to reach peak accuracy in training and vali- 
dation ( Fig. 8 B and C). In addition, training and validation curves im- 
proved ‚Äúslower ‚Äù but had less instability than mosquito curves, although 
Fold 4 and 5 also oÔ¨Äered the best performance, with a Ô¨Ånal loss of 0.0185 
and accuracy average of 94.46%. 
Confusion matrices were computed for each model, and are shown 
in Table 6 for mosquitoes and in Table 7 for ticks. In general, the SNN 
model for mosquitoes had around 95% of True Positives (TP) and 89% 
for True Negatives (TN), while the numbers were reversed for ticks, with 
89% for TP and almost 94% for TN. Error metrics were also calculated 
for the SNN models and are shown in Table 8 . Evaluating all the pa- 
rameters considered in the error metrics, the model was able to achieve 
91% in all of them, varying only on the third decimal.

3.2. ClassiÔ¨Åcation with triplet neural networks (TNN) 
TNN models were very eÔ¨Äective at classifying mass spectra data sets 
and outperformed SNN models. At the end of the entire training and 
validation cycle, the minimum validation loss reached by the TNN mod- 
els was 0.00001 for mosquitoes and 0.0160 for ticks. Furthermore, the 
error metrics of accuracy and F1-Score obtained for both knn models 
with their respective test sets reached up to 99.7% for both parameters 
in the mosquito data set, and 93.2% and 91.4%, respectively, for ticks 
( Table 9 ). 
The Confusion matrices shown in Fig. 9 , explore which species 
are easier to to predict for both mosquitoes and ticks. In the case of 
mosquitoes, the matrix showed correct predictions for all except one

bimanus ) that was misclassiÔ¨Åed as Anowd ( Anopheles oswaldoi ). For ticks 
the results were similar, but with slightly more misclassiÔ¨Åcations, such 
as a sample from Amb Caj ( Amblyomma cajennense ) species wrongly clas- 
siÔ¨Åed as Amb Obl ( Amblyomma oblongoguttatum ), a sample from Derm Nit 
( Dermacentor nitens ) misclassiÔ¨Åed as Rhi Mic ( Rhipicephalus microplus ) 
species, another sample of Hae Jux ( Haemaphysalis juxtackoch i) misclas- 
siÔ¨Åed as Derm Nit ( Dermacentor nitens ), and Ô¨Ånally a sample of Rhi San 
( Rhipicephalus sanguineus ) classiÔ¨Åed mistakenly within the Amb Gea ( Am- 
blyomma geayi ). 
3.3. Triplet neural networks embedding visualizations 
The embedding generated by TNN was graphed in two dimensions 
for a simple visualization of mosquitoes ( Fig. 10 ) and ticks ( Fig. 11 ) data

sets. These graphs provide a visual representation of how the model 
learns to separate and/or join samples depending on their degree of 
similarity. 
For example, the embedding prior to TNN training clearly demon- 
strates that samples of one species of mosquito ( Fig. 10 A) or ticks 
( Fig. 11 A) can be found anywhere on the map, whereas after the network 
is trained, samples of the same species are closely clustered together and 
species with similar spectral characteristics form neighborhoods or clus- 
ters where each point represents one spectrum ( Figs. 10 B and 11 B). 
4. Discussion 
In our previous work establishing these self-curated data sets and an- 
alyzing them with PCA and LDA machine learning algorithms [2,7] , we 
compared the smoothed and baseline-corrected spectra generated from 
unidentiÔ¨Åed Ô¨Åeld-collected arthropod samples with the mean spectra 
from a subset of the same Ô¨Åeld-collected samples that had already been 
identiÔ¨Åed using conventional morphological methods. The main con- 
tribution of these studies was to show a way around working without 
a commercial reference library of protein spectra proÔ¨Åles, using what 
we called the ‚Äúself-curated reference library ‚Äù concept. Because we are 
not using high-quality, lab-reared specimens to train the algorithm, this 
methodology required such pre-processing of the spectra to provided an 
accurate, and unbiased method to identify mosquito and tick species, 
with global positive identiÔ¨Åcation rates of 93.3% for mosquitoes and 
94.2.0% for ticks. 
Here, we broadened the scope of data analysis by applying two Deep 
Metric Learning techniques to the same two MALDI-TOF data sets. Our 
idea of using Deep Metric Learning comes from the fact that these net- 
works have a collective architecture that eliminates the need for spec- 
tral pre-processing steps as well as classiÔ¨Åcation algorithms to discrimi- 
nate the taxonomic identity of diÔ¨Äerent arthropod species. The ability to 
rapidly and eÔ¨Äectively classify arthropod species from distantly related 
species is one of the beneÔ¨Åts of using these types of networks, which 
have proven to be highly eÔ¨Écient to analyze complex mass spectrome- 
try data sets from two of the most important arthropod groupings in the 
Neotropics. 
Roughly 1150 MALDI-TOF spectra from 30 arthropod species, some 
of which are vectors of disease ( i.e. , 826 spectra from 12 mosquito 
species and 310 spectra from 18 tick species), were successfully clas- 
siÔ¨Åed using both SNN and TNN networks. For the SNN, the validation 
step at the end of each iteration with a subset of 20% of the spectra 
yielded an average loss and accuracy of 0.0392 and 91.22% for ticks 
and an average loss and accuracy of 0.0185 and 94.46% for mosquitoes, 
respectively. In comparison, the TNN validation step at the end of each 
iteration with 20% of the spectra yielded an average loss and accuracy 
of 0.00001 and 99% for mosquitoes, and an average loss and accuracy of 
0.0160 and 93% for ticks, respectively. Even if the TNN model only im- 
proved the identiÔ¨Åcation success rate for mosquitoes ( i.e. , from 93.3%

to 99%), and it actually reduced the success rate for ticks ( i.e. , from 
94.2% to 93%), the improvements in lack of manual prep, speed and 
computing availability more than justify its implementation. 
Our results show that both SNNs and TNNs were capable of rec- 
ognizing and classifying MALDI spectra from roughly 50% of all hard 
tick taxa and 70% of all anopheline taxa (e.g., both ecologically dom- 
inant and rare species) reported for Panama. These results are equiva- 
lent and sometimes even superior to those from Loaiza et al. [2] and 
Gittens et al. [7] . Still, the pacmap visualization of the embedding con- 
Ô¨Årmed that these algorithms are not perfect. Future research will need 
to look into what caused some samples in Ana_bm, Amb_Caj, Derm_Nit, 
Hae_Jux , and Rhi_San species to be misclassiÔ¨Åed. We can only specu- 
late that some of these misclassiÔ¨Åcations may be related to poor quality 
spectra or degraded samples, and not necessarily to biologically-relevant 
inferences. 
There are some additional limitations to this work that need to be 
discussed. The data sets used in this work come from biological sam- 
ples that were gathered from the Ô¨Åeld as opposed to being reared in 
the laboratory. Besides foreign contaminants that are hard to control 
in Ô¨Åeld-collected specimens ( i.e. , host blood, sap, pathogens), which al- 
ready present an important challenge to the classiÔ¨Åcation, the data sets 
also allowed us to test the reliability of the algorithms regarding sam- 
ple storage. Fresh mosquito specimens had been stored dry-frozen as 
opposed to ticks that had been stored in ethanol and frozen for several 
years prior to protein extraction and sample processing with the MALDI- 
TOF. Ethanol is a well-known protein denaturing agent and we know

now that protein mass spectra quality of arthropod specimens stored in 
70% ethanol is considerably reduced [7,48,49] . 
Sample degradation, lower quality spectra and lower number of spec- 
imens/spectra per species in the tick data set forced us to adjust the 
training and testing data split for the TNN model. Although the ini- 
tial experimental plan was to work with the same ratio of 80%/20% 
training/testing sets for mosquitoes and ticks, we had to adjust the tick 
data split to 70%/30% to allow the TNN model to Ô¨Ånd the appropriate 
triplets for validation and avoid computational errors. Still, 70%/30% 
or 80%/20% are both typical data splits considered ‚Äúadequate ‚Äù for ma- 
chine learning algorithms, especially when using cross-validation strate- 
gies [50‚Äì52] . 
According to Liu et al. [53] , the classiÔ¨Åcation of Deep Learning spec- 
trometry signals presents signiÔ¨Åcant beneÔ¨Åts, because the CNN training 
process acts as a parallel mechanism for pre-processing ( e.g. , correction 
of the signal base, curve smoothing) and feature extraction ( e.g. , peak 
detection, non-linear features) from the raw spectra. Therefore, a uni- 
Ô¨Åed architecture would eliminate the need to apply the pre-processing 
scheme required with the implementation of classical methods like PCA 
and LDA [2,7] . Additionally, the eÔ¨Äectiveness of one-dimensional CNN 
with a Deep Metric Learning-based schema was demonstrated to mini- 
mize the diÔ¨Éculties in training a model with a reduced or unbalanced 
data set [54] . That is, a model with variable availability of samples for 
multiple classes, a case that is common in applications where there are 
several classes of elements to be analyzed and there is not enough infor- 
mation available to model each class uniformly. This situation generates 
in most of the implemented models either overÔ¨Åtting or underÔ¨Åtting , caus- 
ing erroneous predictions and decreased performance [55] . An example 
would be the case of the mining of precious minerals [53] or the collec- 
tion of tick specimens [7] where some species ( i.e. , ‚Äúclasses ‚Äù) are very 
rare or diÔ¨Écult to obtain and therefore few samples are available for 
the data analysis. 
ArtiÔ¨Åcial neural networks (ANN) coupled to MALDI-TOF mass spec- 
trometry have been recently used to predict drivers of malaria transmis- 
sion using lab-reared Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. ANN accurately 
recognized spectral patterns associated with mosquito age (0‚Äì10 days, 
11‚Äì20 days, and 21‚Äì28 days), blood feeding, and Plamodium berghei in- 
fection, with the best prediction accuracy of 73%, 89%, and 78%, re- 
spectively [56] . Moreover, MALDI-TOF, coupled with CNN was used 
to detect Wolbachia bacteria in laboratory reared and Ô¨Åeld samples of 
the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti . Findings showed that CNN recognized 
Aedes aegypti spectral patterns associated with Wolbachia -infection with 
extremely high sensitivity (i.e., 93%), speciÔ¨Åcity (i.e., 99%), and accu- 
racy (97%), being as eÔ¨Écient as qPCR, but surpassing the eÔ¨Éciency of 
traditional detection methods such as loop-mediated isothermal ampliÔ¨Å- 
cation (LAMP) [57] . Together, these studies illustrate the potential that

MALDI-TOF MS coupled with artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence has to predict ento- 
mological drivers of disease transmission, providing potential new tools 
for vector control. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the Ô¨Årst attempt to classify 
MALDI-TOF data from arthropods from the Neotropics using Deep Met- 
ric Learning techniques that employ Metric Learning techniques with 
neural networks as a feature extraction method, including models that 
combine multiple neural networks with identical architectures com- 
monly known as Siamese and Triplet Neural Networks. Our results indi- 
cate that Deep Metric Learning is yet another practical machine learning 
tool for quickly and precisely classifying MALDI-TOF-generated mass 
spectra of public-health-relevant arthropod species. 
5. Conclusion 
Rapid identiÔ¨Åcation of arthropod species using mass spectra Ô¨Ånger- 
printing continues to oÔ¨Äer a promising tool for entomologist and public- 
health specialist, specially in biodiverse regions such as the Neotropics. 
One of the long term goals of our group is to develop an online, crowd- 
sourced and open-source database, based on novel machine learning 
algorithms that can continuously grow and learn across arthropod fam- 
ilies, and can improve the eÔ¨Éciency and accuracy of species identiÔ¨Åca- 
tion regardless of sample preparation and analysis parameters. Our re- 
sults here presented, where we successfully applied Deep Metric Learn- 
ing techniques to two relevant and distinct data sets from the Culicidae 
and Ixodidae arthropod families, bring us one step closer to that goal. 
We developed an analytical method for the evaluation of MALDI-TOF 
spectra utilizing SNN and TNN networks to quickly identify mosquito 
and tick species based on their protein mass spectra without the use 
of spectral pre-processing techniques or classiÔ¨Åcation algorithms. Our 
results show that both SNN and TNN networks were capable of accu- 
rately classifying spectra from up to 30 diÔ¨Äerent Ô¨Åeld-collected arthro- 
pod species, some of which are important disease vectors in Panama and 
more broadly in the Neotropics. Future studies should look into how well 
this approach can diÔ¨Äerentiate between other important Neotropical 
arthropod assemblages, including the triatomine bugs and Phlebotom- 
inae sand Ô¨Çies that transmit Leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. Simply 
put, our approach is adaptable and can be applied more broadly in other 
tropical regions of the world with high species diversity of arthropods 
and cryptic species complexes.
