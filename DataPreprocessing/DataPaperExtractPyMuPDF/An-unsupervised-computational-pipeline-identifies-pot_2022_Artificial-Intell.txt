Drug repurposing consists in identifying additional uses for known drugs and, since these new ﬁndings are built 
on previous knowledge, it reduces both the length and the costs of the drug development. In this work, we 
assembled an automated computational pipeline for drug repurposing, integrating also a network-based analysis 
for screening the possible drug combinations. The selection of drugs relies both on their proximity to the disease 
on the protein-protein interactome and on their inﬂuence on the expression of disease-related genes. Combined 
therapies are then prioritized on the basis of the drugs’ separation on the human interactome and the known 
drug-drug interactions. We eventually collected a number of molecules, and their plausible combinations, that 
could be proposed for the treatment of Huntington’s disease and multiple sclerosis. Finally, this pipeline could 
potentially provide new suggestions also for other complex disorders. 
Introduction 
Discovering a new drug and bringing it to the market is a process 
both money and time consuming. Instead, relying on established drugs, 
computational drug repositioning oﬀers a valuable alternative approach 
for providing promising treatments for disorders without a cure [ 1 , 2 ]. 
In recent years, a plethora of computational approaches to drug repur- 
posing have been proposed and applied to a wide variety of therapeu- 
tic areas [3] . Most of such approaches rely either on machine learn- 
ing or on the traditional methods of computational drug design, even 
though some conceptually innovative ideas have brought to the light 
the possibility of taking new paths towards the prediction of potentially 
repurposable drugs. One of such ideas is based on a system view and 
takes the human protein-protein interactome as a reference network to 
quantify the relatedness between drugs and diseases by calculating the 
distance between drug targets and disease-associated proteins. This dis- 
tance has been proposed as a suitable metrics to measure the "proximity" 
between drugs and diseases [4] . Recently, leveraging on the concept of 
drug-disease proximity [5] , novel drug indications for the treatment of 
cardiovascular diseases [ 5 , 6 ], cancers [7] , COVID-19 [8] , Alzheimer’s 
disease [9] have been proposed, demonstrating how a network-based 
approach could successfully assist the selection of drugs to be repur- 
posed. 
In this work, we assembled an automated computational pipeline by 
integrating a recently developed scheme to screen repurposable drugs 
that combines a network-based technique with an analysis of biologi-

cal and experimental data [ 10 , 11 ], with a strategy for ﬁltering all the 
possible drug combinations [6] . Initially, the procedure estimates the 
proximity between the disease-related proteins and the drug targets on 
the protein-protein interactome, performing a ﬁrst selection of candi- 
dates. Then, only those drugs that signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the expression 
of disease-related genes are considered plausible for repurposing. Fi- 
nally, evaluating the separation of these drugs’ targets on the human 
interactome and taking into consideration the known drug-drug inter- 
actions, combined therapies are prioritized. The workﬂow of the pro- 
cedure is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 . The entire process is au- 
tomated in order to reduce human intervention, thus accelerating the 
whole procedure and limiting execution errors. 
We applied this pipeline to Huntington’s disease (HD) and multiple 
sclerosis (MS) because, despite the fact that they are both neurologi- 
cal disorders, their diﬀerent nature could represent a challenge for our 
strategy, and the outcomes could give us insights into its methodolog- 
ical strengths and limitations. HD, is reported as a typical monogenic 
disease, even though many other genes are known to inﬂuence its pro- 
gression [12] , while for MS a single genetic cause has not been found 
yet, probably because many factors play an important role in the etiol- 
ogy. Indeed, MS ﬁts well the deﬁnition of complex disease to be consid- 
ered in the framework of network medicine. On the other hand, HD was 
included in our study in order to test the capabilities of the proposed 
method in a case where diﬀerent clinical phenotypes might be related 
to a disease module eventually inﬂuenced by genetic modiﬁers leading 
to diﬀerent pathophysiological states [12–14] .

combinations. 
HD is the most common monogenic neurological disorder. The on- 
set is typically in the early stage of adult life, and it is characterized 
by motor dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and neuropsychiatric fea- 
tures [ 12 , 15 ]. The autosomal dominant mutation that causes HD is lo- 
cated in the HTT gene, and it consists in a cytosine-adenosine-guanine 
trinucleotide repetition (CAG, encoding glutamine) leading to an over- 
expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) tail in the huntingtin protein. 
The mutated protein tends to aggregate and accumulate, forming inclu- 
sion bodies that have deleterious consequences for the neural cell. Both 
the inclusion bodies and the length of the CAG expansion are proven 
to play an important role in the development of the disease. The clear- 
ance of the ﬁrst ones slows the HD progression, while the longer the 
CAG expansion, the earlier the disease may manifest [15] . The remain- 
ing uncertainty on the course of HD can be ascribed to other genetic 
diﬀerences in the genome of the patients [ 12 , 14 ]. 
MS is both the most frequent non-traumatic disabling disease in 
young adults [16] and the commonest demyelinating disease [17] . The 
etiology and the mechanism causing its worsening progression are still 
unclear, nevertheless it has been proven that a complex interplay of ge- 
netic and environmental factors is important [ 18 , 19 ]. The main known 
risk factors are smoking, childhood obesity, infection with the Epstein- 
Barr virus, and low vitamin D levels [19] . MS is generally viewed as a 
two-phases autoimmune disease, in which initially focal inﬂammatory 
processes cause a relapsing-remitting form of the disease, and subse- 
quently demyelinating plaques (lesions resulted by the previous immune 
response) and oligodendrocyte damage lead to neurodegeneration and 
non-relapsing progressive course [ 17 , 19 ]. MS is commonly character- 
ized by progressive spastic paraparesis, cognitive impairment, and sen- 
sory and cerebellar dysfunctions[19]. 
Both HD and MS are still lacking resolutive treatments [ 20 , 21 ], 
whose development needs a deeper knowledge of the underlying mech- 
anisms [22] . To this aim, network-based models, as the ones we utilized 
in this study, could be adequate theoretical tools for investigating such 
multifactorial disorders. They would allow us to take into account the 
latent complex structure of these diseases without losing a comprehen- 
sive view [23] . Through the methodology presented here, we were able 
to collect a number of approved drugs and their plausible combinations 
that could be proposed for the treatment of HD and MS. 
Materials and methods 
The workﬂow of this study can be outlined in the following steps 
( Fig. 1 ): (1) collection of disease-related genes; (2) gene sets validation 
through enrichment analysis; (3) collection of drugs, targets, protein 
interaction data, and construction of protein-protein interactome; (4) 
computation of drug-disease proximity on the human protein-protein 
interactome; (5) estimation of drug-induced gene expression signature 
enrichment; (6) calculation of drug-drug separation on the human in- 
teractome. Except for the collection of the disease-related genes, each 
operation is performed by a Python 3 script, and the entire procedure is 
brought together and coordinated by a main ﬁle in the same program- 
ming language. 
Collection of disease-related genes 
For each of the two considered diseases, a set of related genes 
was retrieved from KEGG [24] ( https://www.genome.jp/kegg/ ), OMIM 
[25] ( https://www.omim.org/ ), PheGenI [26] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm. 
nih.gov/gap/phegeni ), DISEASES [27] ( https://diseases.jensenlab.org/ 
search ), and DisGeNET [28] ( https://www.disgenet.org/ ). 
Brieﬂy, for HD, 306 genes were retrieved from the KEGG Hunting- 
ton Disease pathway “hsa05016 ”; 152 querying OMIM for “Huntington 
Disease ”; 1 from the DISEASES database and 17 were those associated 
to “Huntington Disease ” on DisGeNET and having an Evidence Index 
( https://www.disgenet.org/dbinfo#section36 ) of at least 0.95. 
On the other hand, for MS, 160 genes were the result of querying 
OMIM for “Multiple Sclerosis ”; 89 were collected from PheGenI with 
NHGRI (National Human Genome Research Institute) genome-wide as- 
sociation study as source and a p-value < 1 × 10 − 8 ; 5 were retrieved 
from the DISEASES database; 30 gathered from DisGeNET with the same 
conditions applied to HD. 
The genes were mapped to oﬃcial gene symbols taking advantage 
of the NCBI database and then combined. 
Ontology (GO, HPO) enrichment analysis 
Functional enrichment analysis is often employed to perform a pre- 
liminary analysis on an investigated gene set. Examining the Gene Ontol- 
ogy [29] (GO, http://geneontology.org/ ) and the Human Phenotype On- 
tology [30] (HPO, https://hpo.jax.org/ ) associations, we gained insights 
on biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components and 
phenotypes most frequently associated to those genes. We conducted 
the functional enrichment analysis using the Python library GOATOOLS 
[31] and considered signiﬁcantly enriched only those terms with a false 
discovery rate (FDR, p-value corrected for multiple comparisons using 
the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [32] ) lower than 1 × 10 − 4 . We then 
looked at the ﬁrst 20 terms ranked on the basis of their fold enrichment 
(computed as the ratio of the percentage of genes in the study set re- 
lated to a speciﬁc term, divided by the corresponding percentage in the 
background, i.e., the entire human proteome).

Drugs and targets collection, gene expression proﬁles retrieval and 
protein-protein interactome construction 
Drugs information was collected from DrugBank [33] (version 
5.1.9). Only those molecules having at least one human protein as target 
are considered, obtaining 5 798 drugs and 2 755 corresponding targets. 
Drug-induced gene expression proﬁles were retrieved from the Li- 
brary of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures [34] (LINCS, pro- 
ﬁles “GSE70138 ” and “GSE92742 ”), downloaded from Gene Expres- 
sion Omnibus [35] (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo ). Due to 
the fact that we are inspecting neurological disorders, those signatures 
tested on neural cell lines (NEU, NPC, SHSY5Y) were examined for both 
diseases. Additionally, in order to consider disease-speciﬁc features, also 
muscular cell lines (SKB, SKL) were included for HD, and haematopoi- 
etic and lymphoid tissue cell lines (L60, JURKAT, NOMO1, PL21, SKM1, 
THP1, U937, WSUDLCL2) for MS. Furthermore, to guarantee maximum 
reliability of the results, only the data about the Best Inferred Genes 
(BING) in every dataset (drug signature) in these proﬁles was kept. The 
BING subset includes 978 landmark genes and 9 196 inferred genes, 
which are identiﬁed among the 12 328 genes in the L1000 assay by 
Subramanian et al. [36] evaluating the most reliable inference predic- 
tions. 
Extensive interactions among proteins are a key factor in accom- 
plishing many biological processes and functions. For this reason, 
we opted for a network-based approach to evaluate the correlation 
between drugs and diseases or drugs and other drugs. We built a human 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network combining data from eight 
publicly available resources: Agile Protein Interactomes DataServer 
[37] 
(APID, 
http://cicblade.dep.usal.es:8080/APID/init.action ), 
Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets [38] (Bi- 
oGRID, https://thebiogrid.org/ ), The Human Reference Interac- 
tome [39] (HuRI, http://www.interactome-atlas.org/ ), InnateDB 
[40] ( https://www.innatedb.com/ ), INstruct [41] ( http://instruct. 
yulab.org/ ), IntAct [42] ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/home ), Sig- 
naLink [43] ( http://signalink.org/ ), and Search Tool for the Retrieval 
of Interacting Genes/Proteins [44] (STRING, https://string-db.org/ ). 
Supplementary Table 1 gives additional info about the interactions 
reported in the databases and the applied ﬁlters. 
The retrieved interactions were then combined, obtaining a net- 
work (available in the Supplementary Information) consisting of 20 445 
nodes (genes/proteins) and 1 125 173 edges (interactions). Consistency 
is granted by the fact that all listed proteins are mapped to oﬃcial 
gene symbols taking advantage of the NCBI database. Since the protein- 
protein interactome is the supporting pillar of the whole procedure, we 
assessed its validity comparing the results of the entire analyses based 
on two other interactomes. The ﬁrst rerun was carried out on the widely 
recognized interactome from Cheng et al. [5] (16 677 unique proteins 
and 243 603 experimentally conﬁrmed protein–protein interactions). 
The second one was performed on a drastically restricted version of our 
own interactome (16 954 proteins and 246 080 interactions), in which 
only interactions from low throughput studies (listing less than 20 in- 
teractions) were included. 
Network proximity 
Proteins related to a speciﬁc disease are unlikely to be scattered 
throughout the interactome, rather, they tend to group together forming 
the so-called disease module [45] . The relationship between a drug and 
a disease could be estimated by means of an unsupervised and unbiased 
network-based approach [4] , which quantiﬁes the interplay of drug tar- 
gets and disease-related genes measuring a network proximity. Here we 
used a recently modiﬁed version of such method [10] that includes a 
term ( 𝑤 ) for taking into account the degree of the drug targets directly 
into the distance calculation. Given 𝐺, the set of disease-related genes; 
𝑇 , the set of drug targets; and 𝑑( 𝑔, 𝑡 ) , the shortest path length between 
nodes 𝑔 ( 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺) and 𝑡 ( 𝑡 ∈ 𝑇 ) in the human protein-protein interactome; 
the distance 𝑑( 𝐺, 𝑇 ) between each drug and the disease was calculated 
as: 
𝑑 ( 𝐺, 𝑇 ) = 1 
|𝑇 |
∑
t∈𝑇 
min 
𝑔∈𝐺 ( 𝑑 ( 𝑔, 𝑡 ) + 𝑤 ) 
(1) 
where 𝑤 weights the targets based on their node degree in the interac- 
tome ( 𝑤 = − ln ( 𝐷 + 1 ) if the target is related to the disease, 𝑤 = 0 oth- 
erwise). 𝐷 is the degree of the target in the PPI network. 
Then, for each drug, the signiﬁcance of its association to the inves- 
tigated disease was assessed comparing the measured distance to that 
of a dummy reference distribution. This reference was obtained com- 
puting 10 000 times the distance ( 𝑑( 𝐺, 𝑅 ) , deﬁned by Eq. (1) ) between 
the disease-related genes and randomly selected (from the human inter- 
actome) sets of proteins ( 𝑅 ) matching the number of the drug targets. 
Since the degree of the drug targets is already taken into consideration 
in the distance calculation, the sampling of the randomly selected pro- 
teins is facilitated having to match only the number and not also the 
degree distribution of the drug targets. The mean 𝜇𝑑( 𝐺,𝑅 ) and standard 
deviation 𝜎𝑑( 𝐺,𝑅 ) of the reference distribution were used to normalize 
the observed distance into a proximity value (z-score): 
𝑧 ( 𝐺, 𝑇 ) = 
𝑑 ( 𝐺, 𝑇 ) − 𝜇𝑑 ( 𝐺,𝑅 ) 
𝜎𝑑 ( 𝐺,𝑅 ) 
(2) 
Inverted gene set enrichment analysis 
Starting from the hypothesis that eﬀective drugs should be able to 
restore the healthy expression of genes deregulated by a disease, the 
drugs with signatures most enriched in disease-related genes should also 
be the most promising ones in treating such disease. In order to gain this 
knowledge, an Inverted Gene Set Enrichment Analysis [10] (IGSEA) on 
the datasets (drug signatures) of LINCS was performed, looking for the 
disease-related genes under study. For each analyzed dataset, the nor- 
malized enrichment score and the p-value (estimated comparing the en- 
richment score with those of a null distribution generated from 100 000 
permutations) were computed for measuring the enrichment magnitude 
and its statistical signiﬁcance, respectively. The resulted p-values were 
then corrected for multiple comparison using the Benjamini-Hochberg 
procedure [32] , obtaining the FDR. If the dataset was signiﬁcantly en- 
riched (FDR < 0.25), the corresponding drug was considered a potential 
drug candidate. 
Network separation 
An important aspect in investigating drug combinations is to eval- 
uate whether the two drug-target modules are overlapped (overlap- 
ping exposure) or separated (complementary exposure) on the human 
protein-protein interactome [6] . In the case of overlapping exposure, 
there is a higher similarity in chemical, biological, functional, and clin- 
ical proﬁles. The desired combinations, instead, are those with comple- 
mentary exposure, both drugs being topologically and pharmacologi- 
cally distinct. In the latter case, the two drugs synergistically cooperate 
in treating the disease, yet each one in its own way. 
As we did for computing the drug-disease proximity, also for mea- 
suring drug-drug separation 𝑠 𝐴𝐵 in drug combinations, we employed a 
network-based approach [ 6 , 45 ]: 
𝑠 AB = ⟨𝑑 AB ⟩ − ⟨𝑑 AA ⟩ + ⟨𝑑 BB ⟩
2 
(3) 
where 𝐴 is the target module of one drug and 𝐵 that of the other. Here, 
the mean shortest distances (calculated with Eq. (1) with the weight 𝑤 
ﬁxed to 0) between the target modules of each drug ( ⟨𝑑 𝐴𝐴 ⟩ and ⟨𝑑 𝐵𝐵 ⟩, 
computable only for drugs with at least two targets) are compared to 
the mean shortest distance between all possible A-B target pairs ( ⟨𝑑 𝐴𝐵 ⟩). 
When computing the distances between A-B target pairs, if a protein is 
targeted by both drugs, its distance is zero by deﬁnition. A drug combi- 
nation exposure is deemed complementary if 𝑠 𝐴𝐵 ≥ 0 , overlapping oth- 
erwise.

Results 
Computational framework 
In this study, we automated the pipeline shown in Fig. 1 for screening 
repurposable drug candidates and prioritizing their combinations. In or- 
der to run, the script only requires the disease name, the disease-related 
genes, and the cell lines of interest as inputs. This procedure consists 
of: collecting, cleaning and organizing the source data (disease-related 
genes, drugs, targets, protein interactions, drug-induced gene expres- 
sion signatures); identifying repurposable drug candidates evaluating 
both their proximity to the disease and their eﬀect on the expression of 
the disease-related genes; screening the possible drug combinations on 
the basis of their relative exposure and known interactions. The output 
of the routine is a collection of tables (tab-separated values ﬁles) and 
plots, recording both intermediate and ﬁnal results. 
Compared to previous related works [ 10 , 11 ], such a systematic strat- 
egy should be more eﬃcient and have an improved reproducibility 
thanks to the organization and standardization of both the overall study 
and results. Additionally, it takes a step forward since it evaluates also 
possible combined therapies. 
The single steps and the outcomes of the application of the frame- 
work to HD and MS are presented and discussed in the follow- 
ing. 
Disease-related genes collection and validation 
We gathered the disease-related genes as described in the Methods 
section: this resulted in 451 and 217 genes associated to HD and MS, 
respectively. In order to evaluate whether these genes were representa- 
tive of the investigated diseases, we performed an enrichment analysis 
on GO and HPO terms. This allowed us to check if the most enriched 
biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components and phe- 
notypes were in accordance with previous knowledge. 
Prior studies relate HD to dysfunctions in transcription, intracellular 
signaling, intracellular transport, endocytic recycling, and mitochondria 
[12] . This knowledge is consistent with the biological processes, cellu- 
lar components and molecular functions that we found to be enriched 
( Fig. 2 A and Supplementary Figure 1 A, B). The same holds for the phe- 
notypes, which are associated to negativism, social and occupational 
deterioration, mitochondrial and nervous issues (Supplementary Figure 
1 C) [ 12 , 15 ]. 
MS is an autoimmune disorder whose inﬂammatory inﬁltrates con- 
tain T-lymphocytes and B-cells, and leads to oligodendrocyte damage 
and demyelination [19] . This is coherent with the enriched terms in our 
analysis ( Fig. 2 B and Supplementary Figure 2). 
The fact that the obtained results were conﬁrmed by the literature 
suggested that the gathered genes were representative of the diseases 
under study. 
Furthermore, as in Menche et al. [45] , the disease modules were 
tested to be nonrandom gene aggregates. The size of the largest con- 
nected component of the disease module was compared to the size of 
the one obtained by randomly picking the proteins (matching the num- 
ber of the disease-related genes) from the interactome (the comparison 
is shown in Supplementary Figure 3). For both diseases, the disease mod- 
ule resulted to be signiﬁcantly larger than the random counterpart, al- 
lowing us to state that they cannot be attributed to a casual aggregation 
of genes.

collection (dashed orange line), for Huntington’s disease (A) and multiple sclerosis (B). On the vertical axis, the kernel density estimation of the distribution is shown. 
The plot is divided into two parts by the chosen distance threshold (green line, see Methods). 
Repurposable drugs selection 
The network-based proximity analysis, leveraging on the potential 
of a system view, could suggest valuable drugs able to interfere with 
the disease molecular determinants in a non-trivial way (i.e., not only 
directly targeting disease-related genes). The idea behind this method 
is that drugs proximal to the disease module should be more eﬀec- 
tive than distant ones, as shown by Guney et al. in an extensive anal- 
ysis that considered known diseases and disease-associated genes, as 
well as drugs and their targets [4] . Following Peng’s protocol [10] , 
the procedure compares the distribution of the distances between drug 
targets and disease-related proteins to that of a reference collection 
(see Methods and Fig. 3 ). For both diseases, it was possible to iden- 
tify a distance value below which the two density curves (drugs and 
reference) drop dramatically. In particular, the reference density as- 
sumes negligible values for distances below this point ( Fig. 3 , green 
part of the plot). We elected such distance value ( Fig. 3 , vertical 
green line) as the threshold to discriminate drugs associated to the dis- 
eases. These distances are 0.68 and 0.71 (corresponding to proximity: 
− 0.53 and –0.98) for HD and MS, respectively. From this analysis, 685 
(11.8%) out of the 5798 drugs collected from DrugBank were consid- 
ered signiﬁcantly proximal medicaments for HD, and 475 (8.2%) for 
MS. 
In order to evaluate the impact of a drug on the disease, we examined 
the eﬀect of its administration on the expression of the disease-related 
genes in relevant cell lines (see Methods). We pursued this objective 
by performing an Inverted Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (IGSEA) on 
896 drugs, observed in 6 212 LINCS expression datasets for HD and 960 
drugs in 5 579 datasets for MS. This analysis resulted in 843 and 600 
signiﬁcantly enriched drugs, for HD and MS respectively. 
The drugs that were both signiﬁcantly enriched and proximal to 
the disease were deemed to be repurposable drug candidates: 138 for 
HD and 38 for MS (Supplementary Tables 2, 3). The interactions be- 
tween the MS-related-genes, the drug targets, and the repurposable drug 
candidates are visualized in Fig. 4 (and Supplementary Figure 4 for 
HD), showing how drugs can be related to the disease through their 
targets. 
Unfortunately, only a small portion of the proximal drugs has data 
in the LINCS database (21.9% for HD and 13.7% for MS). Even though 
the IGSEA analysis increases the reliability of the results, it dramatically 
reduces the number of molecules that can be investigated and possibly 
proposed. This has to be taken into account when evaluating the out- 
comes of the study. 
To be more conﬁdent on the pool of predicted repurposable drugs, 
we replicated the entire procedure using three diﬀerent interactomes. 
Our original one and the two networks used to validate it diﬀer both in 
size and in listed interactions (see Methods). Despite these diﬀerences, 
the repurposable drug sets suggested for both investigated diseases re- 
sulted fairly consistent. In the case of HD, 138 drugs were prioritized 
based on the original interactome, 110 on Cheng’s one, 133 on our re- 
stricted interactome. It is noteworthy that all the molecules retrieved 
from the two smaller interactomes are included among those of the ﬁrst 
one. A very similar conclusion could be drawn for MS, for which the pro- 
cedure predicted 39 drugs with the large interactome, 26 with Cheng’s 
one, and 29 with the severely constrained version of our interactome. 
Drug combinations 
Combined therapies and multi-targeted agents have proven to oﬀer 
signiﬁcant advantages over monotherapy, presenting higher eﬃcacies 
and less adverse reactions [ 6 , 46 ]. Due to combinatorial explosion, how- 
ever, it is generally not feasible to test all theoretically possible asso- 
ciations. For this reason, we adopted a recent methodology proposed 
by Cheng et al. [6] , which is based on the estimation of target neigh- 
borhoods separation on the human protein-protein interactome. Taking 
advantage of that, the investigated combinations may be screened on 
the basis of the pharmacological relationship between drugs (see Meth- 
ods). Additionally, we looked in DrugBank for approved associations 
and interactions that increase the risk or severity of adverse eﬀects. In 
this way, we ended up having an assortment of plausible combinations 
listed in Supplementary Tables 4, 5 and identiﬁable in the annotated 
heatmaps of Fig. 5 for HD and of Supplementary Figure 5 for MS. 
Discussion 
Protein-Protein interactomes 
For both diseases, the repurposable drug pools predicted using the 
three interactomes are in reasonable concordance. However, it is signif- 
icant that the execution of the pipeline on our interactome, compared 
to the same procedure on Cheng’s interactome, improves the prediction 
adding 7 drugs with evidence from clinical trials, 9 from in vivo studies, 
1 from in vitro experiments for HD, and 5 clinically tested drugs and 1 
investigated in an animal model for MS. 
This outcome seems to suggest that injecting more input data in 
the procedure (still maintaining high reliability standards) leads to in-

Each drug (right column) is connected to its reported targets (middle column), which, in turn, are proximal on the human interactome to some of the disease-associated 
proteins (left column). Drugs are colored by the respective ATC code, and the FDR of the IGSEA analysis (see Methods) is reported in the label. 
creased performance, which is perfectly in line with the Big Data per- 
spective [47] . 
Repurposable drugs 
Among the drugs selected to tackle HD (138), several (17) have been 
clinically tested and suggested, many show strong evidence from in vivo 
tests (35) or promising results from in vitro assays (9). All the references 
are reported in the Supplementary Table 2, the most noticeable exam- 
ples being selisistat [48] , lisuride [49] , valproic acid [50] , and risperi- 
done [20] . 
Selisistat was found to be safe, well tolerated, and capable of reach- 
ing a plasma concentration compatible with the SirT1 inhibition, which 
has been shown to restore transcriptional dysregulation in models of HD 
[48] . Lisuride is able to induce a temporary yet signiﬁcant improvement 
in the motor performance of patients with hyperkinesia caused by HD 
[49] . Valproic acid was shown to be a possible alternative treatment for 
HD patients suﬀering from myoclonic hyperkinesia [50] . Risperidone

with × if an interaction is reported in DrugBank, and with ○ if it is present in an approved formulation. The lower-left part of the heatmap shows the separation 
of the inspected drugs, color coded from blue (no separation) to red (strongly separated). The upper-right portion, instead, displays the kind of exposure: violet if 
overlapping and green if complementary. At the leftmost part, the ATC codes of the drugs are reported along with a dendrogram of their hierarchical clustering. 
has beneﬁcial eﬀects in the treatment of psychiatric manifestations and 
stabilization of motor symptoms in patients with HD [20] . 
Inspecting the drugs screened for MS (38), we obtained a comparable 
outcome: 7 of them are clinically studied and 9 experimented on animal 
models. All the evidence is listed in the Supplementary Table 3. Most 
of the drugs in clinical trials aim to alleviate the symptoms, while the 
only one we found to be capable of reducing relapses is Escitalopram 
[51] for which there is evidence suggesting it may be an eﬀective and 
well-tolerated treatment for preventing stress-related relapses in women 
with MS [51] .

Examining the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes of the 
repurposable drugs, the ﬁrst thing to notice is the predictable preva- 
lence of drugs associated to the ATC code N (Nervous System) for both 
diseases. Apart from this, the most common codes for HD repurposable 
drugs are C (Cardiovascular) and L (Antineoplastic and Immunomodu- 
lating Agents). The ﬁrst group is mainly represented by statins, used to 
cope with the cholesterol impairment typical of HD patients [52] . The 
immunomodulating agents are principally immunosuppressants and hi- 
stone deacetylases inhibitors, the last ones aimed at recovering from the 
histone hypoacetylation common in neurological disorders [53] . 
For MS, instead, the second most frequent code is L (Antineoplastic 
and Immunomodulating Agents). Some relevant examples are ruxoli- 
tinib, paclitaxel, tamoxifen, and thalidomide, which are capable of at- 
tenuating experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and of inducing 
remyelination [54–58] . 
Drug combinations 
Observing the obtained results (depicted as annotated heatmaps in 
Fig. 5 for HD and Supplementary Figure 5 for MS) it is interesting to 
highlight that drugs that do not have ATC codes associated to them are 
also those with few (or nothing at all) reported interactions. This sug- 
gests that they are not suﬃciently characterized and additional studies 
on them are needed before further consideration. 
The collected plausible combinations are numerous, but the associ- 
ation of orphenadrine (DB01173) and caﬀeine (DB00201) for HD de- 
serves to be highlighted. These molecules are present along with acetyl- 
salicylic acid (ASA) in an FDA approved formulation for muscular pain 
relief. This medication is noteworthy for many reasons. First of all, 
pain is a known issue in HD and could be an important non-motor 
symptom [ 59 , 60 ] thus, its treatment should not be neglected. Further- 
more, orphenadrine showed to be eﬀective in preventing neurotoxicity 
in rats with a chemically-induced condition that mimics the histologi- 
cal and neurochemical features of HD [61] . Additionally, low dosages 
of caﬀeine showed to be beneﬁcial in HD animal models [62] . Finally, 
ASA was included in the formulation for relieving pain and decreasing 
swelling. Even though ASA was proximal to HD, it was not included in 
our results because its data was not available in LINCS for the investi- 
gated cell lines. However, it is actually proﬁtable for the present aim, 
since it showed to prevent protein aggregation in several neurodegen-

mentary Exposure. The network displays the 
proteins associated to MS (circles) and high- 
lights those targeted by escitalopram and tofac- 
itinib (dark green and dark blue, respectively). 
Targets that are not related to MS are indicated 
as triangles. In order to better illustrate the in- 
ﬂuence of these two molecules given by the 
tight interconnection of the proteome, the ﬁrst 
neighbors of the drug targets are depicted in 
a lighter color (light green for neighbors of tar- 
gets of escitalopram, and light blue tofacitinib’s 
ones).

erative diseases [63] . Further assessments are needed, but this could be 
an interesting point where to start. 
A reasonable hypothesis for treating MS might be an association 
of two drugs suﬃciently separated from each other as escitalopram 
(DB01175) and tofacitinib (DB08895) or ruxolitinib (DB08877), capa- 
ble of aﬀecting complementary parts of the disease module. Fig. 6 shows 
the network of the interactions among proteins associated to MS (all cir- 
cles) and highlights those targeted by escitalopram and tofacitinib (dark 
green and dark blue, respectively). Among these targets, two of them, 
namely HRH1 for escitalopram (dark green circle) and TYK2 for tofac- 
itinib (dark blue circle), belong to the MS disease module, while those 
that are not directly related to MS are depicted as triangles (maintain- 
ing the same color coding). In order to better illustrate the inﬂuence on 
the disease module of the two drugs in terms of protein-protein inter- 
actions, the ﬁrst neighbors of the drug targets are colored lighter (light 
green for neighbors of targets of escitalopram, and light blue for tofaci- 
tinib’s ones). It can be seen that overall the targets of both escitalopram 
and tofacitinib or their ﬁrst neighbors can inﬂuence a reasonable part of 
the disease module without redundantly interfering with the same MS 
proteins. In fact, our analysis showed that these drugs are proximal to 
MS and signiﬁcantly inﬂuence proteins associated to this disease. Addi- 
tionally, no interactions between them have been reported in DrugBank. 
Moreover, we found experimental evidence supporting this inference. 
Escitalopram is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (ATC code: N, 
Nervous) that in humans proved to prevent stress-related relapses [51] . 
Tofacitinib and ruxolitinib showed promising eﬀects in animal models: 
the ﬁrst one enhancing remyelination and improving myelin integrity 
[64] , and the second one ameliorating the severity of the disease [54] . 
Furthermore, they are Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (ATC code: L, Anti- 
neoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents) and the JAK/STAT pathway 
is aberrantly activated in MS [ 21 , 65 ]. 
In the other drug combinations, which are suﬃciently separated (see 
Methods, green on the heatmaps) and for which no adverse interactions 
are reported (not annotated with an × in the heatmaps), valuable clues 
for polypharmacological interventions could be found. A working hy- 
pothesis might be to choose two drugs tackling diﬀerent aspects of a 
disease, for instance featuring distinct ATC codes. 
Limitations 
Despite our best eﬀorts, this study is not exempt from some short- 
comings that are common in data analysis, and regard mainly the data 
availability and quality. This could have led us to miss some promis- 
ing compounds and, at the same time, it may compromise some of the 
analyses. 
A complete characterization of all available drugs and human pro- 
teins is surely not at hand, and this has repercussions on many aspects 
of the study, like, e.g., the human protein-protein interactome con- 
struction, drug association to biological processes, cellular components, 
molecular functions and phenotypes, and drug induced gene expression 
proﬁles retrieval. Only sometimes, this issue could be partially mitigated 
by an extensive integration of data from a wider variety of databases. 
Noteworthy, puzzling examples could be the drug-target association and 
the availability of expression data in LINCS. The number of targets as- 
sociated to a speciﬁc drug could considerably depend on the amount 
of research carried out on that medicine rather than on the actual bi- 
ological interactions it has. This inﬂuences the drug-disease proximity 
evaluation. Additionally, as stated above, the LINCS database does not 
provide expression proﬁles for all the drugs selected by network prox- 
imity, limiting by far the choice space for drug repurposing. 
Furthermore, if the knowledge we have about drugs is incomplete, 
the one we have on their combination is even sparser. This, obviously, 
aﬀects our ability to screen and judge plausible associations. 
Moreover, it could be argued that, even though the drug-disease 
proximity is evaluated with a rigorous geometrical approach, the choice 
of the distance threshold we use for discriminating drug eﬃcacy is quite 
discretionary. 
Conclusions 
Here, we extended an unsupervised computational framework for 
drug repurposing with a network-based analysis for screening the pos- 
sible drug combination therapies. Applying this pipeline to HD and MS, 
we identiﬁed several repurposable drug candidates, some of which have 
already been studied in humans. Eventually, we ended up with 138 po- 
tential drugs for HD and 38 for MS. Their plausible combinations are 
numerous, but this work can help to prioritize them. While these re- 
sults are exploratory and should be experimentally veriﬁed before fur- 
ther consideration, they could provide valuable clues for improving the 
management of HD and MS. 
Finally, this pipeline demonstrated to be eﬀective on both investi- 
gated diseases, even though they have a diﬀerent nature. For this rea- 
son, it could potentially provide new suggestions also for other complex 
disorders.
