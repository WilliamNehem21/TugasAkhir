complexity of constraints. Hospital management policies, government regulations, minimum area allocation, 
different required nurse skills, as well as the fairness among nurses define the constraints of the problem. 
Different commercial and generic solutions have been proposed to tackle this problem. However they usually 
fail to satisfy the given requirements due to the wide variety of constraints from one scenario to another. 
Health centers therefore try to design tailored solutions in order to satisfy their specific policies and operation 
mechanisms.  
Nurse rostering has been largely studied from the seventies. Classic and exact methods from the 
mathematical programming area were early used to tackle such a problem [4]. From the nineties, 
metaheuristics have taken an important place in the rostering research. Different solutions have been proposed, 
some examples use tabu search [2], simulated annealing [13], genetic algorithms [8], variable neighborhood 
search [7], electromagnetic metaheuristics [9]. In the context of complete search, constraint programming has 
been also strongly involved in nurse rostering, some examples can be seen in [1, 6, 11, 10, 14]. However, 
most work is focused on the efficient solving of well-known instances; and the work devoted to real cases of 
nurse rostering is quite limited.  
This paper presents the study of a real case of nurse rostering in mid-size Chilean health care centers. We 
take as sample three clinics and four hospitals that collect the main features of those health centers (similar 
size, organization and amount of nurses). The problem is represented as a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction 
Problem) involving soft and hard constraints, and solved with CP (Constraint Programming) algorithms via 
the JaCoP solver. We believe that this work will be useful to increase the experience in real cases of nurse 
rostering as well as to future NRP researchers. 
2. CP 
CP is a relatively modern software technology devoted to the efficient solving of problems subjected to 
constraints. The main features of this paradigm are inherited from different and relevant domains of computer 
science such as operational research, programming languages, and artificial intelligence. In CP, a problem is 
formally stated as a CSP, which is composed of a finite sequence of variables
; the associated set of 
domains, that is,
, and a set of constraints
. A solution to a CSP is an 
assignment 
 such that 
; and the set C is satisfied [3]. 
3. The NRP model 
Mid-size health care centers in Chile employs a particular type of shift assignment called the ``fourth shift'' 
system. This system is quite uncommon do not fitting with the common 8 hours-shift system used in most 
hospital and research papers. The ``fourth shift'' system considers two shifts of 12 hours per day: D and N.  D 
corresponds to a day shift (from 08:00 until 20:00); and N corresponds to a night shift (from 20:00 until 8:00 
of the next day). 
3.1. Constraints for nurses 
The “fourth shift” considers 12 hours shifts sequentially ordered as shown below: 
 
Day 1 
Day 2
Day 3
Day 4
D 
N

Off
We consider a 28 days-planning to cover the 28 possible combinations of 4 (the number of shifts within a 
cycle) x 7 (the number of week days). Then, taking into account the set of nurses 
, the set of 
204

days 
, and the set of variables 
, where 0=day off, 1=D, and 2=N, the constraints are 
modeled as follows: 
 
 A D shift precedes a N shift which in turn precedes a day off, 
: 
 
 
 A N shift precedes two day off, which in turn precedes a D shift, 
: 
 
 
Now, in order to guarantee the required nurse allocation and off nurses per day, the occurrences global 
constraint is included. 
 guarantees that Val occurs Num times in the list named 
Vars. Let  denote the set of variables 
. Then, the required constraints 
are: 
, 
, and 
. 
3.2. Soft Constraints 
Soft constraints allows one to model preferences. For instance, in the studied health-care centers, there 
exist nurses holding a senior position able to suggest some preferences on the schedule. As common CP 
solvers do not provide primitives to directly handle soft constraints, we model the soft constraints by using 
reified constraints. A reified constraint reified(ck,Bk) assigns 1 (true) to the variable Bk if the constraint ck is 
satisfied; and it assigns 0 (false) otherwise. Then, the idea is to maximize the summation of Bk variables as 
follows, assuming 
, where p is the number of preferences: maximize 
 
Then, the constraint satisfaction problem is naturally transformed into an optimization problem. As an 
example, let us consider three preferences: c1: Nurse 5 prefers not to be off on day 1; c2: nurses 2 and 4 prefer 
to start with a day shift. c3: nurse 11 prefers to be off the third weekend of the cycle. Those constraints can be 
modeled as follows: c1: V5,1 
0; c2: V2,1 = 1 
 V4,1 = 1; c3: V11,20 = 0 
 V11,21 = 0. Finally, we impose three 
reified constraints and the corresponding objective function in order to obtain a solution: 
reified (c1,B1) 
 reified (c2,B2) 
reified (c3,B3) 
maximize 
 
The implementation in JaCoP is depicted in the following. Firstly, the result of reified constraints is stored 
in an array called B. Then, the summation 
 is stored in the summation variable at line 4, which is then 
imposed in the store of constraints. At line 6, a variable cost with a domain [-INF, 0] is initialized. Then, at 
line 7, the value of summation is multiplied by -1and assigned to the cost variable. This is done since JaCoP 
only minimizes, thus, it is mandatory to invert the value of the summation variable. Finally, the labeling 
method triggers a branch and bound algorithm using as cost function the cost variable.

4.  Conclusions 
This paper addressed a NRP study for a set of chilean mid-size health care centers. We have presented a 
model that handles a very uncommon shift pattern and the nurse preferences via soft constraints. Soft 
constraints have been modeled by using reified constraints in conjunction with an objetive function in order to 
maximize the number of preferences satisfied. In this way, the model becomes an optimization problem that 
has been solved in the JaCoP solver. Rosters are automatically generated in about 20 minutes considering 40 
nurses. The approach presented here can naturally be extended by considering bigger health care centers and 
more complex soft constraints. Using metaheuristics and autonomous search [5, 12] will be an interesting 
research direction to pursue as well.
