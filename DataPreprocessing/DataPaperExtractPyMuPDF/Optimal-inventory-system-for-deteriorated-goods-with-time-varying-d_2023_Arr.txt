This research work presents a depleted demand inventory model with constant deterioration. The rate of change 
of demand is assumed to be a time-dependent function. Initial non-zero demand occurs due to advertisements. 
Advertisement cost is assumed to be constant. Two types of models are considered for two replenishment stra-
tegies viz., without shortages and with shortages. This study aims to obtain a suitable policy for replenishment 
for minimizing the total inventory cost. Four examples about the alterations made in the optimal solutions due to 
different values of independent parameters used in the models are considered and discussed. Sensitivity analysis 
is done and numerical illustrations are provided for validating the approach presented.   
1. Introduction 
To achieve organisational goals, it is desirable to know the norms 
and specifics of resources such as labour, goods, finances, etc. These 
aspects enable decision-makers to frame their objectives for getting 
maximum profit via utilising limited services and resources. One of their 
objectives is inventory. Literature on inventory theory has been 
continuously modified to reflect the most practical characteristics of 
existing inventory systems. 
Two important factors play a major role in inventory. Firstly, the 
supply chain of almost every company faces the problem of holding 
stocks of obsolete or deteriorating goods. For, some goods gradually lose 
their potential usefulness over time; some deteriorate directly as they 
are stored; some experience physical depletion over time through 
desertion; and some deteriorate through direct spoilage. Therefore, the 
best inventory management strategy for this class of products is to 
minimise the loss caused by deterioration. Secondly, the change in de-
mand rates affects their inventory policy. 
In this paper, the demand function has two distinct phases: The de-
mand rate is a function of time that initially increases, and after some 
time, begins to stabilise or becomes constant. This demand rate function 
is referred to as the ramp-type demand function. When a new consumer 
product brand enters the market, retailers initially invest heavily in 
transmitters. And when customers are happy with the item’s price and 
quality and service rendered by the company, sales volume gradually 
increases over a duration, and then, becomes constant. Therefore, the 
ramp type-demand function must have a minimum of one broken point 
between the two-time intervals in which it is non-differentiable [1]. 
Most of the literature available today is on an inventory model with a 
ramped demand rate, accounting for backorders, stockouts, and dete-
rioration. A negative, exponentially deteriorating inventory model was 
presented by Ghare and Schrader [2]. Covert and Philip [3] replaced the 
negative exponential with two-parameter Weibull distributions for 
deterioration rate. Misra [4] and Chakrabarty [5] came up with eco-
nomic order quantity models that concentrated on the above type of 
commodity. Mandal and Pal [6] introduced ramped demand rate for 
items with constant expiration rate inventory. Wu and Ouyang [7] gave 
the most suitable solution for the inventory system introduced by 
Mandal and Pal [6]. Also, they discussed two possible shortage models 
with ramp-type demand rate functions [1]. 
Manna and Chaudhuri [8] developed a model in which the deteri-
oration rate of the ramped demand goods was time-dependent and the 
finite production rate is proportional to the demand rate. Panda, Sen-
apati, and Basu [9] discussed a single-level inventory model for a 
seasonal item since the demand rate of seasonal products corresponds 
to the characteristics of a ramped demand rate. Skouri, Konstantaras, 
Papachristos, and Ganas [10] developed the model introduced by 
Covert and Philip, with the ramped demand rate and the Weibull dis-
tribution deterioration rate, partial backlog. Skouri, Manna, Kon-
stantaras, and Chaudhuri [11] supplemented the work discussed in

Ref. [8] by taking into account the demand rate without bottlenecks, 
which stabilizes after the production stop time; and the demand rate 
with bottlenecks, which stabilizes after the production stop time. 
Moreover, they further modified their model by considering the de-
mand rate as a time function [1]. 
Recently, in contrast to the work above, Ahmed, Al-Khamis, and 
Benkherouf [12], for the first time, considered a general deterioration 
rate. Sanni and Chukwu [13] developed an EOQ inventory model for 
items with a three-parameter Weibull distribution of deterioration [1]. 
Amutha and Chandrasekaran [14] advanced the EOQ model with 
quadratic demand and time-dependent carrying cost of inventory. Sri-
vastava and Singh [15] built on the inventory model with linear demand 
by varying the deterioration rates and partial backlogs. 
Singh, Mishra, and Pattanayak [16] presented a model with a linear 
function of deterioration and a “ramp-type demand function. Uthaya-
kumar and Karruppasamy [17] provided a model with time-varying 
demand for healthcare industries. Shaikh, A.A., and others [18] 
described an inventory model with addition facility for deteriorating 
goods with a ramp-type demand and a trade credit policy. Sharma and 
Kaushik [19] studied the inventory with ramp-type demand and offers 
with delayed payments. Palanivelu and Chandrasekaran [20] delivered 
the replenishment strategy for Giffen goods with time-dependent de-
mand. Supakar, P., and Mahato, S. K. [21], developed the deteriorating 
inventory models with and without an advanced payment scheme, and 
they considered the ramp-type function for the demand rate. 
It can be observed that until now, most of the researchers in this 
ramp-type demand rate have completely ignored the initial demand or 
considered a zero demand for starting the inventory cycle. In some 
particular situations or products, non-zero initial demand will exist. In a 
real-life situation, there is an initial demand for newly launched items 
such as mobile phones, computers, software, automobiles, etc., before 
they enter into the market because of the advertisement or canvassing. It 
moves upward with time when these items are launched, and after some 
time, it begins to stabilise. 
In the healthcare industries too, newly introduced medicines have an 
initial demand before they are available in the market. Nonzero initial 
demand is also possible due to pre-booking or reserving of that product 
[22–24]. This paper contributes to that type of demand and takes into 
consideration the constant deterioration rate and constant holding cost. 
A ramp-type demand rate function is assumed here. The model is first 
discussed under the assumption that there is no inventory shortage, and 
then, extended to account for the shortage [25,26]. 
Here is how the rest of the article is structured: The assumptions and 
symbols as well as the description and formulation of Model-I, both 
without the shortage and with the shortage are presented in Section 2. It 
also includes some numerical examples to provide further insights. 
Section 3 presents a sensitivity analysis for the model parameters. The 
results thereof are presented in Section 4. Section 5 finally draws a 
conclusion of the study. 
2. Materials and methods 
This part of the paper presents the assumptions made, symbols used, 
and the formulation of the model used in this study. 
2.1. Assumptions  
• Inventory system considers only one item.  
• Demand rate is characterized by a time-dependent function of the 
ramp type.  
• Time horizon is infinite.  
• There is a constant holding cost.  
• There is an unbounded replacement rate.  
• There has been no lead time.  
• There is a constant deterioration rate, and no replacement is required 
during the cycle.  
• Model I does not allow stock outs.  
• Stock outs are allowed in Model II. 
2.2. Notations  
• A1- The ordering cost/order  
• AC-Advertisement cost/cycle  
• D(t)-Deterministic demand,  
• γ – the constant rate of deterioration  
• q1- The economic order quantity (EOQ)  
• h - holding cost per unit item per time  
• I1(t),I2(t)- the inventory at the time duration t;  
• OC1, OC2 - Ordering cost per cycle  
• AC1, AC2 – Advertisement cost per cycle  
• HC1,HC2-carrying cost per cycle  
• DC1,DC2-Total deterioration cost/cycle;  
• TIC1,TIC2-Total Inventory Cost/unit time  
• T1, T2 - Replenishment period of cycle time. 
At the beginning of each period, it is supposed that I is the total 
amount of inventory, and market demand and deterioration induce the 
inventory level to slowly decrease during the duration (0, T1) and 
eventually move to zero at t = T1. Due to the backlog, shortages occur 
during the time interval T1 ≤ t ≤ T. Therefore, the differential equation 
governing the inventory I(t) has two phases of the cycle time T, which 
are as follows: 
dI(t)
dt =
{
−γI(t) − D(t)0 ≤ t < T1
−D(t)T1 ≤ t ≤ T
(1)  
2.3. Mathematical model 
2.3.1. Model 1 - deterministic model without shortage 
As mentioned earlier, demand for these types follows a ramp-type 
demand rate function. Let us consider this function as- 
D(t) = a + bt + b(μ − t)H(t − μ), where a and b are non − negative
(2)  
Where H(t −μ) is a piecewise continuous ‘Unit Heaviside function’, 
H(t − μ) =
{
1, μ ≤ t
0, μ > t 
The shortages can be avoided if the stock is replenished instantly 
when stock levels become sufficiently low or reach zero (see Fig. 1). 
There are no shortages in Model I, but this assumption is relaxed in

Model- II. A batch of I1 units is ordered at time 0 to raise the initial in-
ventory level from 0 to I1. This process is repeated each time the in-
ventory level falls back to 0. This can be seen in Fig. 2. 
The governing differential equation (1) when the shortage is not 
allowed is given by- 
dI1(t)

+ γI1(t) + D(t) = 0

2.3.2. Model II – inventory model with shortage 
A company policy restricts the shortages of any of their products. 
Shortage costs occur when the required quantity of the good (demand) 
exceeds the available inventory. The company that has a supply shortage 
with its customers has to bear the shortage cost. This can be interpreted 
as the loss of goodwill with customers and the resulting unwillingness to 
do business with the company. That is, it includes the cost of belated 
revenue, and the additional administrative expenditure involved. A 
producer experiencing a shortage of materials needed to meet the de-
mand for it has to spend an additional amount to delay the completion of 
the production process. When there is additional demand over available 
inventory, the company won’t wait for the next shipment to meet this 
additional demand. This is shown in Fig. 3. The governing equation 
corresponding to shortages is given below- 
Fig. 2. The inventory model that excludes shortage.

2.4. Methodology 
To attain the minimum total cost C1 , the function TIC1 given by (12) 
is differentiated with respect to T1 and the equation given by the 
necessary condition dTIC1
dT1 = 0 is solved. This helps in obtaining a tran-
scendental equation in T1. MATLAB software is used to perform the 
sensitivity for the inventory function on the minimum total cost TIC1,
and optimal ordering quantity (q1*) caused by any incremental changes 
in the parameter. 
The following necessary requirement for TIC2 is applied. 
∂TIC2
∂T2
= 0, ∂TIC2
∂t1
= 0
(29)  
By differentiating equation (28) with respect to t1andT2 and applying 
the necessary condition (29), the simultaneous equations in transcen-
dental function of t1andT2 are obtained. MATLAB software is used to 
calculate the effects of the decision variables by variations given to the 
system parameters of the inventory model function such as a, b, , h and s. 
Tables 1 and 2 present the results thereof (see Table 3). 
2.4.1. Numerical example 
To utilize and to check the above models, four cases are discussed 
with various parameter values. 
2.4.2. Model I- without shortage 
Example 1. 
Setting the values of parameters in (13) as a = 150, b = 2, A1 = 500/ 
order, A3 = 500/cycle, d = 50/unit, μ = 1.5, h = 2 and γ = 0.01, the 
optimal point T∗
1 = 2.1257 is obtained. This optimal point T∗
1 is 
substituted in equations (12) and (7) to obtain the optimal cost TIC∗

Example 2. 
Considering the change in demand at the breakthrough point μ as 
2.5, a = 150, b = 2, A = 1000 per order, d = 50 per unit, h = 2, and γ =
0.01, the values T∗
1 = 2.3259, TIC∗
1 = 880 and q∗
1 = 359 are obtained. 
2.4.3. Model II- without shortage 
Example 3. 
With the parameter values a = 180, A2 = 500 per order, A4 = 500/ 
cycle, b = 2, γ = 0.01,d = 50, s = 1.5, h = 2, and μ = 1.5, the optimum 
values t∗
1 = 1.3235, T∗
2 = 3.4594 , TIC∗
2 = 586.30 and q∗
2 = 242 are 
obtained. 
Example 4. 
For identical parameter values like that in example 3, except μ, 
which is considered as 2.5, the model gives the optimum values as t∗
1 =
1.5463, T∗
2 = 3.7348, TIC∗
2 = 607.31 and q∗
2 = 283. 
It is observed from examples 1, 2, 3, and 4 that when the break-
through point μ is greater than the cycle length, a stock-out condition 
occurs. The inventory cost and the initial order quantity of Model-I are 
greater than those of Model II to avoid a stock-out situation. The 
shortage in Model II ushers in the chance of losing the customer’s 
goodwill. 
3. Sensitivity analysis 
3.1. Sensitivity analysis for model I 
A sensitivity analysis is taken for the values as given in Example 1. It 
is observed that the changes in the values of T∗
1, TIC∗
1 andq∗

4.1. Model-I’s effect on T∗
1, TIC∗
1 and q∗
1 caused by a, b, γ, and hare  
• An increase in a, b, γ, and h in Model-1 will cause TIC∗
1 to be 
increased.  
• It is clear that the variations of TIC∗
1 and q∗
1 are in the same direction 
as ‘a’.  
• T∗
1, TIC∗
1 and q∗
1 are perceptive towards the alterations in the scale 
parameter ‘b’.  
• T∗
1, TIC∗
1 and q∗
1 are discreetly penetrative with an increase in the 
parameter γ.  
• T∗
1 and q∗
1 sensibly change with alterations in the parameter h. T∗
1 and 
q∗
1 drop when the carrying cost per unit h increases, but TIC∗
1 upturns 
when ‘h’ rises. 
The sensitivity analysis for Model-I is depicted in the following 
Figs. 4–7. 
From Fig. 4, it clear that the cycle length is inversely proportional to 
the parameter ‘a’ while the total cost and the economic order quantities 
are directly proportional. 
From Fig. 5, it is seen that the cycle length and economic order 
quantities decrease as the parameter ‘b’ increases. However, there is an 
increase in the total cost. 
From Fig. 6, it can be seen that with an increase in the deterioration 
rate, the cycle length and the economic order quantities decrease. 
However, the total cost increases. 
From Fig. 7, it is evident that an increase in the holding cost will lead 
to the increase of total cost. The cycle length and the economic order 
quantities decrease. 
The vital role of the shortages on the impacts of the change in pa-
rameters a, b, c, and h on t∗

shown in Table 4.  
• The changes in TIC∗
2 and q∗
2 are in the same direction as changes in all 
parameters, excluding shape parameter ‘a’  
• As b increases, there is an increase in the values of t∗
1, T∗
2, TIC∗
2, q∗
2.  
• T∗
2, TIC∗
2, and q∗
2 are reasonably sensitive with ɤ.  
• t∗
1, T∗
2 and q∗
2 move in the opposite direction as the carrying cost per 
unit h rises. TIC∗
2 alone does not abide by this condition.  
• t∗
1, T∗
2, TIC∗
2 and q∗
2 are highly perceptive with the changes in the 
parameters. 
In model II, the sensitivity analysis shows that the shortage cost plays 
a vital role on order quantity and total inventory cost.

The graphs in Figs. 8–12 clarify the significance of the sensitivity 
analysis for. 
Model II. 
Fig. 8 clarifies that the change of direction is the same for the total 
cost and the economic order quantity as it is for the direction of 
parameter ‘a’. But the cycle length reflects the opposite direction. 
From Fig. 9, it is observed that the change of the parameter ‘b’ is 
directly proportional to the economic order quantity, total cost, and 
cycle length. 
From Fig. 12, it is clear that to avoid the stock out situation, the 
economic order quantities should be increased. When stock-out situa-
tion occurs, the increase in the total inventory cost cannot be avoided 
due to the shortage cost.

5. Conclusion 
This paper has proposed an inflated model for a time-dependent 
demand of the ramp type with a constant holding cost, constant 
advertisement cost, and expiration rate, taking into consideration two 
conditions viz., with and without shortage. The model provides an 
overall solution for reducing inventory holding costs is provided. So, it is 
also quite feasible for the latest technologies used for goods inventory 
and healthcare industry products under time-dependent demand. This 
approach’s sensitivity was verified by considering the different param-
eters of the system. This replenishment policy can be used for com-
modities such as fashion items, healthcare products, and milk products 
whose expiry rates increase with time. This can help policymakers in 
successfully and effectively managing practical problems. There are 
numerous opportunities to expand the future model. Partial backlogs, 
lost sales, shortage substitution, allowable withholding of payments, 
nonlinear ramped function rates of demand, fuzzy demand rates, etc. are 
some factors to be considered.
