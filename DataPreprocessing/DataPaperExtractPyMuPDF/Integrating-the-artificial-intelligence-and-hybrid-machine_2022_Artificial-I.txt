The aim of the current work is to compare susceptibility maps of landslides produced using machine learning
techniques i.e. multilayer perception neural nets (MLP), kernel logistic regression (KLR), random forest (RF), and
multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS); novel ensemble approaches i.e. MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, RF-
Bagging and MARS-Bagging in the Kurseong-Himalayan region. For the ensemble models the RF, KLR, MLP and
MARS were used as base classiﬁers, and Bagging was used as meta classiﬁer. Another objective of the current
work is to introduce and evaluate the effectiveness of the novel KLR-Bagging and MARS-Bagging ensembles in
susceptibility to landslide. Compiling 303 landslide locations to calibrate and test the models, an inventory map
was created. Eighteen LCFs were chosen using the Relief-F and multi-collinearity tests for mapping the landslide
susceptibility. Applying receiver operating characteristic (ROC), precision, accuracy, incorrectly categorized
proportion, mean-absolute-error (MAE), and root-mean-square-error (RMSE), the LSMs were subsequently veri-
ﬁed. The different validation results showed RF-Bagging (AUC training 88.69% & testing 92.28%) with ensemble
Meta classiﬁer gives better performance than the MLP, KLR, RF, MARS, MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, and MARS-
Bagging based LSMs. RF model showed that the slope, altitude, rainfall, and geomorphology played the most vital
role in landslide occurrence comparing the other LCFs. These results will help to reduce the losses caused by the
landslides in the Kurseong and in other areas where geo-environmental and geological conditions more or less
similar.
1. Introduction
Landslides are more destructive yet frequent natural hazards in the
Himalayan region, causing remarkable harm to buildings, property, and
the human lives (Chawla et al., 2018). In India, mountainous regions
such as Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, the northern
portion of West Bengal, Sikkim, and the northeastern states are heavily
threatened by landslides. According to Froude's work (2018), 75%of
global semi-seismic landslides from 2004 to 2016 were recorded in seven
south-east developing countries (they are India, China, Laos, Bangladesh,
Myanmar, Philippines, and Indonesia) (Chauhan et al., 2018; Aristiz�abal
and S�anchez, 2020). It is believed that around 500 lives and around
Rs.300 Corers (approx. US$ 3 billion) worth of properties have been
damaged annually due to landslides (Koley et al., 2019; Khamkar and
Mhaske, 2019). India's most landslide prone areas has found in Hima-
layan mountain region (Saha and Saha, 2020a).
There is a huge number of techniques and simulations applied for
formulating the reduction or mitigation plans for landslide damage
(Khamkar and Mhaske, 2019; Liao and Liao, 2020; Saha et al., 2020).
Managing the landslide hazard zones (LHZs) needs concerted efforts,
while, landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is a prevailing tool and
most useful technique for reducing the effects of landslides (Pecoraro
et al., 2019). Those mappings assist in the visualization and regional
prediction of landslide hazards in a particular province (Chawla et al.,
2018). LSM is predicated on the presumption that future landslides
would occur under similar conditions to those that produced prior
landslides (Pham et al., 2016; Hirota et al., 2019). Only the LSM shows
the geographical position of landslide threats in a particular mountainous
area that are generated by their local climate and inﬂuencing factors
(Pham et al., 2016). A number of parameters including location, climatic
conditions, landslide types and geo-environment need to be evaluated for
monitoring of landslide sensitivity region (Mahdadi et al., 2018).

Primarily the conﬁguration of underlying geology (lithological compo-
sition, formation, extent of weathering), geomorphology (slope orienta-
tion, relative relief, and appearance), soil type (deepness, composition,
porosity, and permeability), LULC and climatologically properties are
important intrinsic factors for landslides (Reichenbach et al., 2018;
Amato et al., 2019; Ozioko and Igwe, 2020; Saha et al., 2021). Prepa-
ration of LSM and selection of landslide conditioning factors using ML
method can enhance the effectiveness of landslide risk reduction
engineering procedure. Wang et al. (2019) applied a insensitive set hy-
pothesis to less signiﬁcant landslide factors. Saha et al. (2022) utilized a
chi-square-based factor selection technique to screen key factors.
Mapping and identifying the high-risk zone of landslide is a scien-
tiﬁcally accepted practice that aim to provide the scientiﬁc basement for
planning and enhancement of the area (Koley et al., 2019; Juliev et al.,
2019). Modeling with the simulation of landslide susceptibility has
effectively allowed in the last few years to reduce the damages (Juliev

et al., 2019). Researchers have developed many statistical methods to
solve landslide problem (Chawla et al., 2018). Semi-quantitative tech-
niques are depended on weighting and rating of the factors for example
Analytical hierarchy process, combined landslide Frequency ratio, In-
formation value, Weight of evidence, Fuzzy logic approach and weighted
linear combination process (Chen et al., 2016; Mahdadi et al., 2018; Saha
and Saha, 2020a). In recent decades, researchers applied machine
learning techniques (MLT) to identify the LHZs in landslide prone region
in all over the world (Sevgenet al., 2019; Saha et al., 2021) including
Support vector machine (Meng et al., 2016; Saha and Saha, 2020c),
Decision trees (Khosravi et al., 2018; KutlugSahin and Colkesen, 2019);
Kernel logistic regression (Chen and Chen, 2021) Random forest (Kor-
nejady et al., 2019; Saha et al., 2020), Multivariate adaptive regression
splines (Liao and Liao, 2020) and Artiﬁcial neural network (Srivastava
et al., 2019; Saha et al., 2020). The MLT have been given better accuracy
than previous probabilistic models (Mahdadi et al., 2018; Saha et al.,
2022). In the case of landslide study, different MLT play different accu-
racy in different place.
LSM is the main purpose of this research for Kurseong area of
Darjeeling Himalaya, applying the MLP, KLR, RF, MARS, MLP-Bagging,
KRL-Bagging, RF-Bagging and MARS-Bagging models. Ensemble hybrid
machine learning is rare, especially in the Indian Darjeeling Himalayan
region, MLP-Bagging was used in land subsidence susceptibility in Iran
(Arabameri et al., 2020); RF-Bagging was applied in ﬂood susceptibility
modeling in Bangladesh (Talukdar et al., 2020) and KLR-Bagging &
MARS-Bagging are novel ensembles and still not used in landslide
modelling. In this research an ensemble was made between bagging meta
classiﬁer and all the used models (MLP, KLR, RF and MARS) for modeling
landslide susceptibility due to exceptional performance of ensembles of
Meta classiﬁer and AI model. For comparing and evaluating the outcomes
of these models, receiver operating characteristics (ROCs), precision,
accuracy, Kappa coefﬁcient, RMSE, MAE techniques, and seed cell area
index (SCAI) were employed. In the main purpose of the work was to
show whether the accuracy level of benchmark models i.e.MLP, KLR, RF,
and MARS increases or decrease after combining with the hybrid meta
classiﬁer (bagging). Additionally, there is an involvement in checking
how these models in realistic conditions ﬂuctuate in their predictive
effectiveness. A signiﬁcant deluge is observed in the Kurseong range of
Darjeeling Himalayan during the period of the research, where hundreds
of large and minor landslides were recorded. The landslides linked to the

2020 deluge have therefore been obtained and used to evaluate the
accurateness of the used models.
2. Study area
Kurseong region (Fig. 1) is covered 380.34 km2area of Darjeeling-
Himalaya of India (latitudes 26�46ʹ30ʹʹN to 26�57ʹ47ʹʹN and longi-
tudes 88008ʹ25ʹʹ E to 88�27ʹ54ʹʹ E). Kurseong Municipality is at an
elevation of 1458 m and 31.54 km from Darjeeling, a sub-divisional
town. The mean maximum temperature is 23.69 �C, mean moisture
ranges from 68 to 92%, and 323.5 cm is the annual average precipitation
(Municipal weather database from 1982 to 2017) of the study area. The
climate in the region is associated with the CWA (Monsoon-inﬂuenced
subtropical humid climate) group of Koppen. About 85% of the yearly
precipitation takes place between2nd of June to end of august. The slope
is very steep (40� to 69�) and the mean slope for the whole area is 23.76�.
The region is characterized by the sculptured degraded landscape in its
young stage of morphology down-cutting by the stream ﬂows and rivers
together with pre-existing deformities in a geological system including
rocks of Darjeeling gneiss and Daling sequence of Archaean, Gondwana
rocks of Permian, Siwalik rocks and Pleistocene elevated terrace (GSI, the
year 2005-06). Nearly 93% of the total area (355.79 km2) is mountainous
underneath the Himalayan and 50.43% is covered by intense forest and
open forest. The landslide frequently affects the area of the study and
does enormous damage to infrastructure and agriculture (Fig. 2). This
area needs immediate deployment of landslide mitigation planning. For
such management strategies, landslide susceptibility mapping is impor-
tant for identifying the area most prone to landslides.
3. Materials and methods
The study's methodology comprises main six phases: (1) Preliminar-
ily, the previous pieces of literature were studied to select some landslide
conditioning parameters and collect various data from a different source;
(2) The data were obtained through a series of ﬁeld investigation with
the help of handheld GPS after the collection of landslide condition

factors (LCFs); (3)Afterward, these LCFs were tested by the multi-
collinearity analysis and relief-F. In the third step, the thematic layers
of LCFs were prepared; (4) The benchmark models i.e. MLP, KLR, RF, and
MARS simulations were used for the modeling of landslide susceptibility;
(5) hybrid MLT (Bagging) was an ensemble with MLP, KLR, RF and MARS
(Fig. 2); (6) In the next step the produced models were tested applying
AUC-ROC values, MAE, RMSE, proportion incorrectly classiﬁed, preci-
sion and accuracy validation methods. After validation, the LSMs were
judged with the deluge of September 2020.
3.1. Landslide inventory map of Kurseong
For any type of landslide modeling, the relationship between LCFs
and the distribution of earlier landslides must be assessed (Chen et al.,
2016; Saha et al., 2022). So the inventory map with 303 previous
landslides was used in this study. Via ﬁeld surveys with a global
positioning system (GPS) from April 2016 to February, 2020, such
landslide locations were veriﬁed (Fig. 3). In addition, previous infor-
mation on landslides and disaster reports from the National Disaster
Management Authority (NDMA) and the Darjeeling District Ofﬁces
were gathered. The inventory map and LCFs were created at a standard
scale of 30 m *30 m. After collecting the landslide data 70% of
landslides (212 points) were used to run the models and 30%were
used for testing the methods (equivalent to 91 landslide points). The
Geo-statistical analysis feature of ArcGIS version 10.3 was used to
ﬁgure out the training and testing sites (Fig: 1C).
3.2. Factors selection for LSMs modeling
The choice of LCFs among the various factors used by the different
researchers is a challenging process since there are no standardized
criteria. Tien Bui et al. (2019) and Saha and Saha (2020a) used mathe-
matical methods to choose the important LCFs. In all areas, the same
environmental, geological and hydrological variables are not applicable
and cannot be used for mapping all hazards (Arabameri et al., 2020). To
recognize certain geo-environmental factors, Saha et al. (2020) used the
Relief F-test. Different analysis techniques can be used for evaluating
parameters such as correlations, relief-f, IGF, probabilistic techniques,
and machine learning algorithms. The multi-collinearity (MC) test and
relief-F are being used to identify the LCFs.
3.2.1. Testing multi-collinearity (MC) problem
The MC technique is a procedure for assessing the variables. Due to
higher associations between LCFs, the estimation of land susceptibility
area may be inaccurate (Dang et al., 2020; Saha and Saha, 2020c). MC
decides the independence of the LCFs. Pearson coefﬁcients of correlation,
percentages of variances, variance inﬂation factors (VIF) with condi-
tional index, and tolerance levels can be utilized to measure the MC
(Cama et al., 2016; Sameen et al., 2020). The VIF and tolerance processes
were applied to estimate MC in this region. The VIF and TOL (tolerance)
threshold values considered to measure the MC are VIF �5 and tolerance
�0.2 (Bui et al., 2016; Saha et al., 2022).
3.2.2. Relief-F method
The Relief-F technique was used as another factor-selection method.
This method synthesizes weights according to factor ability. Assume that
‘S’ is a randomly chosen sample. Next, the Relief-F weight RWifor the i-th
feature is measured by equation (1). One random point could determine
the two closest neighboring points (one of them being of the same class;
another of various classes).

where NH is the nearest hit and NM is the nearest miss
Kononenko (1994) proposed several Relief-F models. Experimental
ﬁndings have also shown that Relief-F works equivalent to the initial
Relief (Wang et al., 2016).
3.3. Landslide conditioning factors (LCFs)
The different type of landslide (LS) happens due to an imbalance in
the local factor's resistance and mechanisms (Pisano et al., 2017). In this
research, some speciﬁed geo-environmental LCFs were selected for
recognizing LS hazard zone and mapping. The most important selected
factors for this study are presented below.
SRTM DEM of 30*30 m resolution was used for evaluating the LS
susceptibility. It was collected from the USGS (www.usgs.org). Four LCFs
(Fig. 4A; 4 B; 4C; and 4D) were obtained from the DEM, including alti-
tude, slope, aspect, and curvature.
For the annual precipitation map (Fig. 4E) 35 years (1982–2017) of
monthly average rainfall data were arranged from the Indian Metrological
Department
(https://mausam.imd.gov.in/imd_latest).
Generally,
in
landslide vulnerability analysis, rainfall in the mountainous areas is
regarded as a signiﬁcant triggering factor for landslide hazards (Lin et al.,
2012). The drainage structures are a natural consequence of the long-
standing slope, geographical features, landscape, and landform in-
teractions. Drainage density was measured by calculating the whole
length of the drainage by the study's total area (Fig. 4F). Similarly, the
lineament density was calculated and classiﬁed into 5 divisions (Fig. 4 G).
The highways, developed on a very steep slope, undermine the land
protection above them. The risk of topographical loss increases as the
slope of the region increases. This research divides the distance from the
roads into ﬁve groups (Fig. 5H). The soil properties are a very powerful
conditioning element for measuring the vulnerability of landslides
(Ozioko and Igwe, 2020). In this area of study, four forms of soil, i.e.
WOO2 (Loamy skeletal, Typic Udorthents, Loamy skeletal, Typic Dys-
trochrepts), WOO4 (Loamy-skeletal, Typic Udorthents, Loamy skeletal,
Typic Haplumbbrepts) and WOO6 (Course loamy, Umbria Dystrochrets)
were founded, depending on the taxonomy. Two factors related to soil
namely, soil types (Fig. 4I) (Table 5) and soil depth (Fig 4L)were pre-
pared. Soil category datasets were obtained from the NBSS & LUP. A ﬁeld
study was done to produce the soil depth map (Fig 4L). The present
geological map (1: 50,000) was resampled to the resolution of 30 m.
From the Survey of India research area's geological map was obtained.
Gneiss, Slate & Schist, Damuda, Limestone, and Alluvial are the
geological segments found in this study area (Fig. 4I). The research re-
gion's geomorphological map (Fig. 4J) is extracted from Bhuvan (http://
bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in) produced by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organi-
zation) and the Ministry of Mines together with 15 collaborator in-
stitutions. The study ﬁeld is divided into various moderate and narrow
spurs; ridges, deep valleys formed by ‘V', and other degradation features.
LS frequency also revealed a connection with seismic activity, fault
dip-ﬂow,
and
mountain
slope
orientation.
The
Medvedev–-
Sponheuer–Karnik method is the macro-seismic strength measure,
popularly known as the MSK scale. It is implemented for an assessment of
the severity of the Earthquake, focusing on the impact of the incident on
the province. In 2011 to 2018 ﬁve earthqueake happed in this region and
it trigged 13 landslides and among them Tista lineament seismic wave
caused more damage (Table 1). Using the supervised classiﬁcation
method the LULC map was prepared. Eight classes of the LULC were
found. These classes are settlement (7.82%), plantation farming
(17.13%), open forest (26.84%),agricultural land (12.83%), fellow land
(4.10%), sandbar (2.86%)and water body (4.02%), respectively.
The stream power index (SPI) (Fig. 4N), sediment transport index
(STI) (Fig. 4O), and the topographic wetness index (TWI) (Fig. 4P) were
regarded as signiﬁcant conditioning factors for the preparation of LSMs
(Nsengiyumva et al., 2019). These maps were built from the DEM in
ArcGIS.

3.4. Machine learning methods
3.4.1. Multilayer perception (MLP)
Users, commonly used for grouping, are familiar with multi-layer
perception (MLP) as ANNs (Haykin, 2009). The training sets are not
dependent on the hypothesis of the statistic distribution of the input
variables, the relative signiﬁcance of those input variables is not deﬁned,
and the factors are chosen based on their weights throughout the test
procedure (Gardner and Dorling, 1998). Input, hidden, and output layers
constitute and construct the MLP. The geo-environmental LCFs are the
input layers and LS or non-LS are the output layers. The hidden layers are
classiﬁed and helped to transfer data into output. MLP development is
divided into two stages (Tien Bui et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018; Pham
et al., 2016): 1) The performance values are transmitted from the hidden
layers and the result values are then incorporated with the preceding
values for the differentiation and 2) the correlation weight is associated
to produce the best results at the lowest distance. where X ¼ Xi ; i ¼
1:::::::18 is the vector of the 18 LCFs, y ¼ 1 or 0, indicating LS or non-LS.
Applying equation (2) the MLP was carried out.

where, F(X) is assumed to be a hidden mechanism that progresses by
modiﬁable weights during the network architecture training process. In
our study, to prevent overﬁtting, 1 hidden layer, 500 epochs, and 20
validation thresholds obtained by trial-and-error were ﬁtted with an
MLP.
3.4.2. Kernel logistic regression (KLR)
KLR is an efﬁcient and scalable discriminative approach that can have
good class prediction (Sugiyama and Simm, 2010). Mercer kernel sug-
gested a traditional logistic regression model built-in high-dimensional
feature space (Mercer, 1909). Given the labeled training information,
need to do the following:
D ¼ fðxi; yiÞg; i ¼ 1; xi 2 X 2 Rd; yi 2 ½0; 1�
(3)
where, the landslide conditioning factor is represented by xi and in the
function space, K : X � X → R computes the kernel function of the values
of the input vectors.
The isotropic radial basis function (RBF) was utilized as the kernel
function in this study:

Then, in the feature space, a standard logistic regression model was
built as follows:

where optimal model parameters are represented by ðω:cÞ.
3.4.3. Random forest (RF)
The RF is an essential machine learning process that produces accu-
rate predictions without the curse of dimensionality (Shahbazi et al.,
2017). RF model works on the concept of classiﬁcation trees. RF reliably
compares, tests, and deals with inconsistency and imprecision in diverse
data sets (Lin et al., 2015). RF models create a range of decision trees
with a mean decrease in the Gini index (Cutler et al., 2007). At each
branching node, RF models take into consideration a random subset of
the input data and allow the tree to grow without limiting the tree's
maximum size (Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2012). RF begins with the
bagging process in which sub-samples of bootstrap are randomly chosen
to be checked and the unused sub-samples for assessment of ‘Out of Bag’
or OOB are taken into consideration. The utility of each OOB error
adjustment pattern is measured ﬁrst. Stability is considered to be
conﬁrmed by the randomized bagging process (Breiman, 1996). BT A log
(N), which includes the number of training samples (training group LS
occurrences), trees, and nodes, respectively, in each division represented
by B, T, and A (Chan and Paelinckx, 2008). Chen et al. (2016) identiﬁed
the advantages of using ‘OOB’ error and assessment process: no over-
ﬁtting errors, low bias and variance, a limited association between in-
dividual trees, rigorous estimates of error, and excellent prediction
performance. Afanador et al. (2016) also prepared functional algorithms
for the RF model. In this analysis, RF modeling was conducted using the
‘random Forest’ package of R studio (Genuer et al., 2010).

3.4.4. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)
Friedman and Roosen (1995) were the ﬁrst to introduce MARS. In a
similar way to least-squares regression, It investigates the connection
between both the variables of the study (Wang et al., 2021). MARS0
beneﬁts
include
its
numerical
effectiveness,
ability
to
produce
simple-to-understand models, and ability to measure the contribution of
predictor variables. However, one of the most notable disadvantages is its
inability to forecast accurately (Nguyen et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021).
To ﬁx this issue, bagging was applied to MARS, resulting in MARS-Bag,
which increased classiﬁcation accuracy.
3.4.5. Ensemble of MLP, KLR, RF, and MARS with Bagging
Bagging, introduced by Breiman (1996), was assigned to forecast LS
sensitivity, one of the appropriate and efﬁcient-ensemble techniques. To
direct individual classiﬁers, the Bagging process utilizes bootstrap sam-
ples. New subsets of MLP, KLR, RF, and MARStraining data were
collected by randomly sampling the training sets with replacements. As
the training base-classiﬁer, certain sub-training sets were included. To
incorporate the result of the base classiﬁer, plurality voting was used
(Breiman 1996). As the base classiﬁer of the Bagging ensemble meta
classiﬁer, MLP, KLR, RF, and MARS MLT was used to compare the results
with the individual MLP and RF models.
3.5. Validation computed process
Validation is important if model reliability is to be calculated
(Groesser and Schwaninger, 2012; Saha et al., 2020). Two statistical
approaches (MAE and RMSE) and three threshold-dependent statistics
(area under of ROC curve, proportion incorrectly classiﬁed, accuracy,
and precision) were used to determine the reliability of the models in this
analysis.
3.5.1. Threshold dependent method ROC
The techniques used to assess the zones of susceptibility need to be
checked (Meng et al., 2016). Here more than one validation process was
applied for judging the prediction capability and it is more acceptable to
all for supporting the models. The pieces of literature ensured that the
AUC of ROC is a useful method for model validation and comparison
(Marjanovi�c, 2013; Gayen et al., 2019). The AUC was calculated applying
equation (7).
AUC ¼ ð P a þ P cÞ
ðP þ NÞ
(7)
where a is ‘a true positive’, b is ‘a true negative’, c is ‘a false positive’ and
d is ‘a false negative’. P is ‘the amount of LSs overall’, and N represents
‘the number of non-LSs overall’.

The AUC values range from 0 to 1 and the value closest to 1.0 implies
a model's higher efﬁciency. The reliability of forecasting analytics and
their reliability were also tested using proportion incorrectly classiﬁed,

accuracy and precision. Higher values of both accuracy and precision
suggest that the model has greater predictability. On the other side, lower
values proportion incorrectly classiﬁed suggest greater precision.
3.5.2. Statistical techniques MAE & RMSE
MAE and RMSE in this analysis were used to test the models. Some of
the discrepancies between predicted and actual values are called MAE.
MAE's square root is expressed by RMSE. For the MAE and RMSE esti-
mates, equations (7) and (8) were used:
MAE ¼ i

where, n is ‘the sample size of the training or testing dataset’; a is ‘the
predicted value’, and bis ‘the actual values’. Willmott and Matsuura
(2005) used this strategy and established a limit value of 0.5. Values
beyond 0.5 suggest poor results of the model. Such two tests were used to
determine the efﬁcacy of landslide susceptibility models (Roy and Saha,
2021; Saha et al., 2021).
3.5.3. SCAI (seed cell area index)
Suzen and Doyuran introduced the SCAI in 2004. It computed the
percent ratio of LS in different LS susceptibility classes. In the case of very
a good model, the SCAI value is the highest in the very high LS suscep-
tibility class (Roy et al., 2019). The SCAI was computed following
equation 12
SCAI ¼ Ar
Atv
(12)
where Ar ¼ areal extend of susceptibility class in percentage and Atv ¼
percentage of training and validation datasets.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Results of multi-collinearity test
The TOL and VIF indicate that there is no multicollinearity difﬁculty
amongst LS conditioning variables (Sameen and Pradhan, 2019; Saha
and Saha, 2020c). According to the multi-collinearity test (Table 2), the
lowest TOL is 0.318 for rainfall. Besides that, the maximum TOL for soil
type is 0.914. The lowest and highest VIF values in this research are
0.982 and 2.869, respectively (Table 2). It is proved that the chosen
eighteen LS conditioning factors in this study ﬁeld are ideal for modeling
the LS susceptibility.
4.2. Analyzing the Relief-F
It is necessary to select appropriate LCFs for better performance and
accurate project susceptibility. Relief-F (RelF) method is acknowledged
as a proﬁcient attribute selection technique (KutlugSahin and Colkesen,
2019; Saha et al., 2020). RelF was used to calculate the average merit
(AM) of different factors. LS affecting factor with positive higher AM is
more important for LS susceptibility modeling. Factors with “0” or
negative AM are less important for LS susceptibility modeling. According
to AM, all the selected factors have a good capability of inducing the
landslide in the study area ( Table 3).
4.3. Landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs)
The eight LSMs were created considering 70% of total landslides
datasets using MLP, KLR, RF, MARS, MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, RF-
Bagging and MARS bagging models in GIS environment (Fig. 5). The
areal distributions of different models are given in Table 4. According to
the outcomes of the models revealed that the areas of very low LS sus-
ceptibility class in MLP, KLR, RF, MARS, MLP-Bagging, KRL-bagging, RF-
Bagging and MARS-Bagging models are 76.64 sq.km (20.05%), 84.31
sq.km (22.05%) 99.70 sq.km (26.08%), 103.54 sq.km (27.08%),99.71
sq.km (26.06%), 84.31sq.km (22.05%), 115.12 sq.km (30.11%), and
99.94 sq.km (26.14%) and moderate LS suspect susceptibility class are
75.74 sq.km (19.81%); 85.91 sq.km (22.47%); 73.91 sq.km (19.33%);
79.93 sq.km (18.83%); 66.95sq.km (17.51%); 91.46 sq.km (23.92%);
73.91
sq.km
(19.33%)
and
71.99
sq.km
(18.83%)
respectively.
Comparatively high LS susceptibility zone covers 49.90 sq.km (13.05%)
in KLR, 46.87 sq.km (12.26%) in MARS-Bagging; 45.57 (11.92%) in RF
and 37.77 sq.km (10.14%) in RF-Bagging respectively (Fig. 5). According
to the landslide susceptibility models developed, the centre and western
sections of the research area are very susceptible to landslides.
4.4. Models performance validation with ROC curve
It is critical to evaluate the legitimacy of the models used for zoning
landslide susceptibility since they have no consequences without vali-
dation (Arabameri et al., 2020); Saha and Saha, 2020a). The ROC, ac-
curacy, precision, proportion incorrectly classify and SCAI index was
used to evaluate the LS susceptible mapping of the Kurseong area.
The outputs of the four MLTapplied for landslide susceptibility were
veriﬁed for this study, incorporating data sets collected from the

ﬁeldwork as indicated above. In addition, the AUC was determined to
compare the effects of models (Fig. 6). The ﬁndings of the ROC curve
showed that all the models have great potential for predicting suscepti-
bility to landslides. The AUC-ROC values of the MLP, MLP-Bagging, KLR,
KLR-Bagging, RF, RF-Bagging, MARS and MARS-Bagging models are
84.57%, 90.37%, 83.76%, 88.05%, 88.10%, 92.28% and 84.17% &
88.46%for validation dataset and for training dataset AUC-ROC values
are 82.95%, 88.75%, 81.98%, 85.53%, 87.89%, 90.85%, and 82.78%, &
86.66% respectively (Table 5). As a consequence, the ﬁndings showed
that the performance of the MLP, KLR, FR, and MARS models after
ensemble with bagging was enhanced by about 2–3% for mapping
landslide susceptibility in the Kurseong-Himalayan range. (Fig. 6). The
RF-Bagging method achieved the highest accuracy followed by MLP-
Bagging, RF, and MLP respectively (Table 5). Contrarily, the RF-
Bagging model achieved the lowest proportion of incorrectly classiﬁed,
MAE and RMSE values followed by the MLP-Bagging, RF, and MLP
respectively. In comparison to other models for landslide susceptibility
modeling with potential confounders, the RF Bagging technique proved
to be the highest.
4.5. Models performance validation by SCAI
Another method applied for the validation of models is SCAI. The
SCAI validation method was implemented in LS modeling precision
calculation in some current LS research (Khari et al., 2019; Saha and
Saha, 2020c). Suzen and Doyuran created this process in 2004. In Table 6
the SCAI values of MLP, MLP-Bagging, RF, and RF-Bagging models are
given. From extremely low to very high class, the SCAI value for a suit-
able model increases. So, SCAI values also proved that the MLP-Bagging
model is better than the MLP model and the RF-Bagging better than the
RF model. It also proved that all models have very good capability to map
the LS susceptibility in this study area.
5. Discussion
5.1. Comparison of models’ predictive performance
Several methods were used for determining risks to the environment.
Modeling mechanisms and methodology, however, are diverse and have
provided speciﬁc outcomes and predictive output. GIS-based geographic
forecasts using various methods are essential instruments for environ-
mental and spatial-environmental studies which can aid in managing
environmental problems (Nasiri et al., 2014; Lombardo et al., 2020).
Accessibility to the range of solutions has considerably improved
decision-makers willingness to ensure continuity in environmental devel-
opment (Liu et al., 2008). Saupe et al. (2012) cautioned that the application
of modeling methods would produce quite different outcomes and very
different outputs in many other domains or with other applications. For this
purpose, simulation results evaluations are critical for model efﬁciency and
accuracy assessments (Briand et al., 2000; Stoyanov et al., 2013).
The predictive efﬁciency of the models for predicting LS susceptibility
was compared in this analysis using AUC-ROC, precision, accuracy,
proportion incorrectly identiﬁed, MAE, RMSE, and SCAI. The eight
models (MLP, KLR, RF, MARS, MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, RF-Bagging,
and MARS-Bagging) have varying performance. All models showed
incredible performance well and the RF-Bagging ensemble model was
proven to be the suitable method for prediction. Pham et al. (2016) also
used MLP as a basis classiﬁer for the LSM ensemble in the Garhwal Hi-
malayan of India. Azhari et al. (2020) used a bagging-based ANN model
in the astrophysical area. Salam and Islam (2020) used RF-bagging to
calculate evapotranspiration prediction study in Bangladesh. Speciﬁc
dependent variables were used to forecast LS susceptibility involving
topography (slope, elevation, shape, and curvature), geomorphology
(drainage density, SPI, TWI), soil (type and depth), landform, and
anthropogenic behavior (LULC, road distance). The main indicator of the
LSMs in this analysis is the slope, rainfall, geomorphology, and elevation.

Ensemble meta-classiﬁers enhanced a single benchmark model's
(MLP, KLR, RF, and MARS) prediction capability. Ensemble MLTs efﬁ-
ciently boost base classiﬁer performance (Roy and Saha, 2021; Pham
et al., 2016; Saha and Saha, 2020c). This whole study provided
outstanding performance by bagging the ensemble with RF, KLR, MLP,
and MARS relative to the individual models (Table 5). Bagging ensembles
signiﬁcantly reduced both ambiguity and biases most efﬁciently relative
to other ensembles. The tree-based approach to artiﬁcial intelligence can
effectively address those bias issues (Silva et al., 2015). More precisely,
the study found, despite the complete lack of proper statistical testing for
ML models may restrict probabilistic testing of the proposition, that the
RF-bagging model is in a position to classify the complex or non-linear
relationships between LS and non-LS. Recent studies have proposed
that ML algorithms are more appropriate for LS research than statistical
approaches (Duro et al., 2012; Saha and Saha, 2020a; Azharietal., 2020;
Saha and Saha, 2020c).
AUC-ROC values > 0.8, in particular, suggest outstanding results as
well. The areal distribution of the four benchmark models (MLP, KLR,
RF,& MARS) and four novel hybrid models (MLP-Bagging, KLR-bagging,
RF-Bagging, and MARS-Bagging) is not the same (Fig. 6). For this study
we ﬁnd that RF-Bagging (testing AUC ¼ 92.28%; training AUC ¼ 90.85%)
output is outstanding while the selected benchmark model KLR (AUC
training ¼ 81.98%; testing ¼ 83.76%), MARS (AUC training ¼ 82.78%;
testing ¼ 84.17%), and MLP (AUC training ¼ 82.95%; testing ¼ 84.57%)
model's consistency is just quite ﬁne. The other methods of validation
(precision, accuracy, MAE, and RMSE) and SCAI give a related perfor-
mance. Across all efﬁciency measures, the RF-Bagging had the best and
KLR alone the lowest precision (Table 6). Previous research (Dunne et al.,
2020; Rahmati et al., 2019) deduced that the LS forecasting of ML models
would enhance in comparison with traditional methods. After all, results
may be different depending on the region where and the variables utilized.
5.2. Contribution of LCFs analyzed by RF
The LCFs' relevance evaluation is critical for environmental resources
management (Sameen et al., 2020). Arabameri et al. (2020) suggested

that a quantitative evaluation of the correlations between LCFs and LS
enable planner and stakeholders to predict the impacts of LCFs. The
conditioning variables which work well in one simulation can therefore
be negligible in other simulations. For this research work, the signiﬁcant
contribution of LCFs in numerous previous studies was assessed using an
RF model (Rahmati et al., 2019). The ﬁndings of the RF model revealed
that slope had the largest weight and soil depth had the least weight
(Table 7). Other high weights were produced by geomorphology,
elevation, the density of runoff, rainfall, and road density.
6. Conclusions
The natural hazards damage the infrastructural facilities and human
lives, however, among these LS is more destructive. Benchmark models
(i.e. MLP, KLR, RF, and MARS) and novel hybrid ensembles (i.e. MLP-
Bagging, KLR-Bagging, RF-Bagging, and MARS-Bagging) models were
applied in this study to evaluate susceptibility to LS in Kurseong region of
Darjeeling Himalaya. The LS inventory map was partitioned into training
(70%) and testing (30%) samples. In this analysis, we implemented four
individual and four ensemble ML approaches (MLP, KLR, RF, MARS,
MLP-Bagging,
KLR-Bagging,
RF-Bagging,
and
MARS-Bagging).
ML
methods were established based on prior LS cases (303) and the models
were trained. These techniques achieved quite better precision, although
the ensemble ML algorithm MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, RF-Bagging, and
MARS-bagging provided much more accurate results. The fallow terrain,
the forest plantations, roadside places, higly sloppy area and natural
denudation mountain regions, are more susceptible to landslides in
comparison with the rest of the Kurseong-Himalayan region. Descriptive
data of LS susceptibility maps can also identify places with the highest
vulnerability, and sites needing more intense attention and study. The
susceptibility maps will signiﬁcantly beneﬁtial to the local people and
government in managing and reducing the losses caused by the
landslides.
