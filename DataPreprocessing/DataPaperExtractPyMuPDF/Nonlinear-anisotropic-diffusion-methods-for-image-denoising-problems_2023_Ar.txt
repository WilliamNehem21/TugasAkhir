Nonlinear anisotropic diffusion has attracted a great deal of attention for its ability to simultaneously remove
noise and preserve semantic image features. This ability favors several image processing and computer
vision applications, including noise removal in medical and scientific images that contain critical features
(textures, edges, and contours). Despite their promising performance, methods based on nonlinear anisotropic
diffusion suffer from practical limitations that have been lightly discussed in the literature. Our work surfaces
these limitations as an attempt to create future research opportunities. In addition, we have proposed a
diffusion-driven method that generates superior results compared with classical methods, including the popular
Perona–Malik formulation. The proposed method embeds a kernel that properly guides the diffusion process
across image regions. Experimental results show that our kernel encourages effective noise removal and ensures
preservation of significant image features. We have provided potential research problems to further expand
the current results.
1. Introduction
Noise, regardless of its source and type, degrades the quality of
images, making them less useful in sensitive applications [1–3]. For
example, noise may corrupt the details of a medical image and cause
doctors to incorrectly interpret results of patients. In computer and
machine vision applications, noisy images may negatively impact the
accuracy and reliability of the object detection and recognition algo-
rithms. Motivated by the quest for quality images in a wide range
of applications, there has been intensive efforts to develop different
methods for suppressing noise in images [4–13].
Noise may be generated during acquisition, processing, and trans-
mission of an image. For instance, if the imaging sensor contains
damaged pixels on its surface, random spots (noises) with varied inten-
sities will be introduced into the acquired image because such locations
cannot register the incident light. Examples of noise in images include
salt & pepper [14], Gaussian [15,16], Poisson [17], shot [18], and
speckle [2,19], typically modeled as either additive (noise added to
the original image) or multiplicative (noise multiplied to the original
image).
Several image denoising methods adapted for a range of noise types
have been proposed in the literature [20–23]. Of the methods, those
based on anisotropic diffusion processes have gained a considerable
attention for the ability of such methods to simultaneously remove
noise and preserve semantically useful image features (textures, edges,

and contours) [24–27]. The seminal work by Perona and Malik [28]
has inspired many scholars to develop advanced anisotropic diffusion
models for suppressing spurious image features, including noise and
undesirable artifacts. These models have demonstrated outstanding
results in delicate image denoising applications (e.g., medical imaging)
that require quality images with critical features well preserved.
Despite the merits of anisotropic diffusion processes in image de-
noising, scholars have not adequately unraveled the possible research
opportunities to advance the field. This work opens scholarly dis-
cussions to address various limitations of the available anisotropic
diffusion models. We highlight recommendations for the possible so-
lutions of some limitations as guidance for scholars. Furthermore, a
superior method based on nonlinear anisotropic diffusion process is
proposed. Compared with classical methods, our method demonstrates
outstanding results by generating images with higher perceptual and
objective qualities. Some recommendations are provided to further
expand the our results.
We have organized our paper as follows: the next section exten-
sively reviews anisotropic diffusion when applied in image denois-
ing; Section 3 gives potential research avenues in anisotropic diffu-
sion, providing researchers with immense opportunities to advance this
growing field; Section 4 describes our anisotropic diffusion method

2. Anisotropic diffusion in image processing
In science and engineering disciplines, diffusion generally means
movement of particles (e.g., atoms, ions, and molecules) between re-
gions of different concentrations until equilibrium conditions are es-
tablished. This physical process may be explained by the Fick’s law
𝑗 = −𝐷 ⋅ ∇𝑢,
(2.1)
which states that the concentration gradient, ∇𝑢, generates flux, 𝑗, with
a goal of compensating for this gradient at the rate governed by the
diffusion tensor (positive definite symmetric matrix), 𝐷 [29] (Figs. 1
and 2). The process dictates particles from the highly concentrated
region to move at the rate determined by 𝐷 towards the region
of low concentration. Diffusion obeys the fundamental laws of mass
conservation, hence the process does not lead to creation or destruction
of mass, 𝑢, as described by the continuity equation
𝜕𝑢
𝜕𝑡 = −div𝑗,
(2.2)
with 𝑡 denoting time. Plugging (2.2) into (2.1) gives the diffusion
equation
𝜕𝑢
𝜕𝑡 = div(𝐷 ⋅ ∇𝑢)
(2.3)
that models several physical processes involving mass transportation
(e.g., carburization and construction of semiconductors through dop-
ing).
In image processing and computer vision, 𝑢 denotes the intensity of
an image. Therefore, applying (2.1) on the image dictates movement of
intensity from high-intensity to low-intensity pixels. This process causes
smoothing where the intensity of image regions with spurious features
(noise) gets reduced.
The directions of 𝑗 and ∇𝑢 determine the type of diffusion: par-
allel, isotropic; and non-parallel, anisotropic. The formulation (2.1)
resembles the heat flow equation (or convolution of 𝑢 with a Gaussian
kernel) when 𝐷 remains constant over all image regions that undergo
isotropic diffusion. Setting 𝐷 constant tends to smudge edges and
other critical image features, a consequence not preferred in many
sensitive applications. In anisotropic diffusion, 𝐷 becomes a function
of 𝑢, allowing it to change spatially across different image regions. For
example, 𝐷 = 𝑓(|∇𝑢|) may be a function of the image gradient to give
the anisotropic diffusion equation
𝜕𝑢
𝜕𝑡 = div(𝑓(|∇𝑢|)∇𝑢).
(2.4)
A well-designed 𝑓 leads to image denoising with edge preservation.
Modeling noise as energy, 𝜌, in the image, we may regard diffusion
as the energy minimization problem with a solution that represents

sequently, (2.4) can be derived from the variational minimization
problem

(2.5)
where 𝛺 denotes the domain of 𝑢. For completeness, and without loss
of generality, (2.5) usually incorporates a fidelity energy functional
(regularization term), 𝜗, as

{
∫𝛺

(2.6)
where 𝜆 represents a fidelity parameter that controls a trade-off be-
tween regularization (noise removal) and data fidelity. Large value of 𝜆
encourages smoother solutions, in which case regularization dominates
over total energy. Furthermore, with a small value of 𝜆, 𝑢 approaches
the observed noisy image, 𝑓.
The Euler–Lagrange equation corresponding to the energy func-
tional (2.6) is

The parameter 𝑇 denotes the maximum evolution time. Considering the
divergence term of (2.9), 𝑓(|∇𝑢|) = 𝜌′(|∇𝑢|)
|∇𝑢|
means diffusivity (diffusion
coefficient) that governs the rate of noise removal as the solution, 𝑢,
evolves.
We have selected [39]
𝜗(𝑢, 𝑓) = log 𝑢 + 𝑓
𝑢
(2.12)
for its superior performance in dealing with both additive and mul-
tiplicative types of noise. Nevertheless, this energy functional of the
fidelity term performs even better in images corrupted by multiplicative
noise. Plugging 𝜗(𝑢, 𝑓) into (2.9) yields

statistics. In the former direction, scholars strive to design effective
energy functionals with better mathematical properties, including con-
vexity and uniqueness. Quality of the optimal solution of (2.9) depends
on the design of 𝜌. The later direction requires a solid understanding
of the noise statistics in the image. Performance of the anisotropic
diffusion model depends upon how well 𝜗 adapts to the noise type
(e.g., additive, multiplicative, and mixed).
3. Potential research avenues in anisotropic diffusion
3.1. Design of energy functionals
Formulation of an effective anisotropic diffusion equation requires a
solid understanding of its corresponding energy functional, 𝜌. Superior
denoising results may be achieved when 𝜌 possesses proper math-
ematical properties, such as convexity and uniqueness. specifically,
the variational problem governing 𝜌 should guarantee existence and
uniqueness of the minimizer, 𝑢 ∈ 𝛺, in (2.6). Despite these important
requirements, no systematic procedures have been established to design
𝜌. Scholars have proposed different energy functionals (Table 1) with-
out clear guidelines on what it takes to derive such functionals. Some
interesting questions for further investigation would be (1) does an
optimal 𝜌 exist for all denoising applications? (2) what are systematic
procedures for designing 𝜌? (3) what specific mathematical proper-
ties should be considered when designing 𝜌 for denoising problems?
(4) how does 𝜌 behave at different scale resolutions of the evolving
solution, 𝑢?
We noted a general practice that most authors design diffusivity
functionals, 𝜙(𝑠) = 𝜌′(𝑠)∕𝑠, directly without considering the properties
of 𝜌. This approach seems straightforward because 𝜙(𝑠) possesses a
well-known mathematical property [28]: non-negative monotonically
decreasing functional with 𝜙(0)
=
1 and 𝜙(∞)
=
0. Perona and
Malik [28] highlight that any well-designed 𝜙(𝑠) with this property may
generate satisfactory results. However, it may not always be possible to
derive 𝜌 from 𝜙(𝑠) to learn the properties of 𝜌—an important functional
to explain why the anisotropic diffusion equation works. For example,
Guo et al. [40] proposed
𝜙(𝑠) =
1
1 +
(
𝑠
𝐾
)𝛼 ,
(3.1)
where 𝐾 denotes the shape-defining tuning constant and 𝛼 ∈ [0, 1]
defines an adaptive variable exponent that changes according to the
local image features. Although 𝜙(𝑠) proposed by Guo et al. generates
convincing practical results, the corresponding formulation for
𝜌(𝑠) = ∫𝛺
𝑠𝜙(𝑠)𝑑𝑥
(3.2)
cannot produce a closed-form solution to associate 𝜌 and quality of
the results. Guo et al. explain that their anisotropic diffusion model
outperforms because 𝛼 changes adaptively to produce different other
models during the diffusion process: linear, 𝛼 = 0; Total Variation,
𝛼 = 1; and Perona–Malik, 𝛼 = 2. This explanation, however, lacks
scientific justification and generalization that changing 𝛼 adaptively
always lead to better results. We cannot state mathematically how the
model behaves when 𝛼 becomes a fraction, linking quality of results
and the diffusion process. In addition, the authors did not provide the
relationship between 𝛼 and local image features: which value of 𝛼—
translating to the anisotropic diffusion model (linear, Total Variation,
or Perona–Malik)—should be applied to an image region for optimal
denoising results?
In this work, we propose two diffusivity functionals, namely
𝜙1(𝑠) = 1 − 𝑎
−
1
( 𝑠
𝐾 )
1 + 𝑎
−
1
( 𝑠
𝐾 )
(3.3)
and
𝜙2(𝑠) =
𝑎
−
( 𝑠
𝐾
)
1 +
(
𝑠
𝐾
)2 ,
(3.4)
where 𝑎 > 0 denotes a constant, which generate promising results.
These functionals, derived empirically through experiments, satisfy the
conditions highlighted by Perona and Malik [28]:
𝜙1(𝑠) = 𝜙2(𝑠) =
{
0 if 𝑠 → ∞ (Edges and contours)
1 if 𝑠 → 0
(Flat regions)
(3.5)
Eq. (3.4), with 𝑎
=
2.7183 (exponential function), reduces to the
functional similar to that proposed by Perona and Malik [28].
There could be several other variations of diffusivity functionals
with outstanding performance. However, studies are yet to provide sys-
tematic mathematical procedures to establish such functionals. There-
fore, although 𝜙1 and 𝜙2 proposed in this work performs well, we
cannot mathematically confirm that they produce optimal results with
respect to all variants of diffusivity functionals. This research direc-
tion may be interesting and worth investigating to advance denoising
methods based on anisotropic diffusion.

3.2. Design of shape-defining constant
The diffusivity Eq. (3.1) contains a shape-defining constant, 𝐾, the
threshold parameter of the gradient magnitude. This tuning constant
controls the sensitivity of diffusion to edges, and is usually determined
experimentally or as a function of the noise statistics in the image [41–
44]. Quality of the denoised image depends, to a greater extent, on
the value of 𝐾. Therefore, effective strategies are needed to optimize
𝐾 for better denoising results. However, the available approaches for
determining 𝐾 are manual, hence time-consuming, inconvenient, and
error-prone. Scholars may need to investigate the relationship between
𝐾 and the structural information in the images. One interesting finding
could be the value of 𝐾 that changes adaptively depending upon the
local image features, and this value should work across all types of
images.
3.3. Design of regularization term
There have been efforts to design regularization (fidelity) terms
for different noise types (e.g., additive and multiplicative) [45–50].
Due to the random nature of noise, designing regularization terms
remains an open-ended research question and a non-trivial task. Given
a noisy image, an interesting question would be to estimate the prob-
ability density function (PDF) that generates noise contained in the
image. Noise models assume specific PDFs [51–53]: Gaussian, Gamma,
Rayleigh, exponential, impulse, uniform, among others. Establishment
of the regularization term requires a comprehensive understanding
and analysis of these PDFs. In some situations, experiments should be
performed to establish the relationship between noise statistics and
structural information in the image.
Another aspect worth considering is the fidelity parameter, 𝜆, of
the regularization term, which is usually determined empirically. The
manual strategy of tuning 𝜆 introduces challenges in the implemen-
tation of anisotropic diffusion models. Some authors have, however,
recommended adaptive approaches for determining 𝜆 as the denoising
image, 𝑢, evolves through iterations [40,54]. Guo et al. [40], for
example, estimates 𝜆 by evaluating its value from (2.9) under steady
conditions (when time tends to infinity). This approach implies that
a more accurate value of 𝜆 may be obtained after convergence of the
solution. Advanced techniques are needed to accurately determine 𝜆
after every iteration. We may investigate structural features and noise
statistics of previous (premature) solutions to estimate 𝜆 iteratively.
3.4. Applications in inverse problems
Given observations from the system under investigation, an inverse
problem involves determination of parameters characterizing the sys-
tem [55–57]. For example, the image denoising problem provides a
noisy image and requires determination of the clean (original) image.
Inverse problems tend to generate multiple undesirable solutions be-
cause of their ill-posed nature: fewer observations than the number
of system parameters under investigation. The solution of an inverse
problem may be unstable, amplifying errors in the intended solution
from the arbitrarily small errors in the measurement data [58].
Anisotropic diffusion has been widely used to address the ill-posed
nature of inverse problems. Despite its effectiveness in image denoising,
a paucity of studies exist to analyze the impact of anisotropic diffusion
in other image processing techniques, such as compression, segmenta-
tion, inpainting, and tomographic image reconstruction [29]. Another
possible research avenue can be the application of anisotropic diffusion
in neural networks for learning a priori information [59].
Fig. 3. One-dimensional signal at different scale resolutions.
3.5. Expansion into high-dimensional space
Most anisotropic diffusion methods focus on two-dimensional gray-
scale images. In recent years, researchers have developed interest in
processing higher-dimensional and vector-valued images because of
the increased computational power and availability of color printers
and scanners. Extending the methods into this direction will mark an
important milestone in sensitive practical applications, including medi-
cal and radar imaging. This scientific inquiry requires computationally
inexpensive methods for denoising higher-dimensional images without
destroying semantic features.
3.6. Convergence criterion setting
The evolving solution, 𝑢, in (2.9) should be tested for optimal-
ity at every iteration. The dynamical system requires an appropriate
stopping criterion to generate an optimal solution after some itera-
tions [60–62]. The fundamental property of a criterion is that it should
approach a specific preset value, upper or lower bound, as the system
advances through iterations. The bound corresponds to the quality
of an image. Upon meeting the criterion conditions, the generated
image becomes of the highest possible quality. For image denoising
problems, the optimal image at the exit point of the criterion contains
minimum error corresponding to acceptable values of quality metrics
(e.g., peak-signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity).
Setting the convergence rules remains a long-standing problem in
iterative methods, including those intended to remove noise in images.
The primary questions are (1) at which specific point in time should
we stop the iterations? (2) what is the lower/upper bound to mark
the exit condition for the iterating dynamical system? how should
we establish a balance between fidelity of results and computational
time? These questions may stimulate scholarly discussions to address
implementation challenges of iterative methods.
3.7. Relationship of features at different scale-space solutions
The denoising (diffusion) process creates a series of solutions at
varied scales. Each solution corresponds to an image with features
smoothed to a specific degree of resolution (Fig. 3). The solution at
an infinity scale contains a constant image characterized by uniform
distribution of gray levels. Image features at the lowest scale have the
highest resolution, presenting well-distinguished and visually appealing
structures. Fig. 2 shows a one-dimensional signal at the bottom con-
volved (smoothed) by a Gaussian kernel with an increasing variance
from bottom to top [28,63].
Despite the well-established knowledge that diffusion leads to scale-
space solutions [28], the fundamental question remains to determine
the mathematical relationship of the signal features at different scales.
In essence, after the convolution by a given kernel (e.g., Gaussian),
how do these features relate mathematically? The relationship may
Array 17 (2023) 100265

enhance our understanding on how the diffusion process works. For
example, we will understand how and why pixels diffuse across image
regions to reduce noise and spurious features. Furthermore, inverse
operations may be established to reconstruct the original (noisy) signal
after diffusion.
3.8. Implementation schemes
For decades, explicit numerical schemes have been widely ap-
plied to realize and implement partial differential equations (PDEs)
for nonlinear diffusion models. These schemes provide simpler and
quicker implementation strategies, but become increasingly inefficient
and ineffective in time-sensitive applications that demand larger time
steps. Explicit (Euler forward) schemes produce better results under
the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) criterion [64] that restricts a time
step between 0 and 0.25 to achieve stable and quality results. This
restriction makes such schemes ineffective in complex computer vision
and image processing tasks.
Given the limitations of explicit schemes, researchers should investi-
gate and establish more advanced and efficient numerical methods for
PDEs [29]: implicit schemes, splitting and multigrid techniques, and
grid adaptation strategies. Weickert [29] argues researchers to develop
advanced software packages that implement different nonlinear diffu-
sion filters. Supporting the open science [65,66], the packages should
be made publicly available across the research community.
3.9. Noise estimation
Development of regularization terms require a comprehensive kno-
wledge of the noise statistics in an image. Effective methods for noise
estimation should be devised as an important milestone to achieve
robust nonlinear anisotropic diffusion models [67–70]. However, es-
tablishment of such methods seems challenging due to the random
nature of noise. This open-ended research problem may be addressed
using machine learning methods that can learn complex and random
relationships of noise variables [71]. Also, compressive sensing and
stochastic techniques [72–74] may be employed to model image noise.
The fundamental question is to derive noise PDF from the corrupted
image.
3.10. Image quality evaluation metrics
Quality of results generated by restoration methods, including the
ones discussed in our work, should be gauged using suitable assess-
ment metrics. Currently, most authors prefer peak-signal-to-noise ratio
(PSNR) [75] and structural similarity (SSIM) [76] metrics for image
quality assessment (IQA). However, PSNR and SSIM require complete
information of the reference image that may not be available in prac-
tical applications [77]. When executing a real denoising problem, the
original (clean) image is unavailable. In some few cases, we may have
a small portion of information from the original image. Researchers
may need to divert their attention to other types of metrics for im-
age quality assessment, including reduced-reference and no-reference
IQA metrics [78–83]. Subjective IQA approaches, while they remain
popularly used, should not be drawn based on the author’s perceptions
and experience. Other people should be engaged in the quality assess-
ment process, and voting statistics employed as the basis for drawing
conclusions.
4. Proposed anisotropic diffusion method
We applied a four-point explicit numerical scheme to implement the
proposed anisotropic diffusion model. The essence of this implemen-
tation is to demonstrate an important research opportunity described
in Section 3.2: design of shape-defining constant. Specifically, the im-
plementation highlights that setting tuning constants (of the diffusion
kernel) to achieve optimal results may be a rather daunting and time-
consuming process. For completeness, our model is compared with the
classical Perona–Malik model.

The parameters were set as follows: △𝑡 = 0.15 (CFL criterion), 𝜆 = 0.05,
𝜖 = 0.000001. We determined the values of 𝑎 and 𝐾 empirically based
on the quality of results. Experiments were conducted and an optimal
set {𝑎, 𝐾} corresponding to higher values of PSNR [75] and SSIM [76]
was selected. The former metric gives the signal strength relative to
the noise content in the image. Higher PSNR values are preferred
for quality images. Despite its wide application, PSNR lacks human
perceptual qualities. SSIM, which ranges between 0 and 1, addresses
this weakness by emulating the human visual system. Quality images
give higher values of SSIM.
Experiments were conducted on four types of images downloaded
from public domains: Pout,1 Mandril, Walkbridge,2 and Cat.3 In the first
experiment, speckle noise of standard deviation 25.50 was added into
original images of Pout, Mandril, and Walkbridge. Next, our method
was applied to remove noise from these images and the results were
compared with those generated by the Perona–Malik method [28]. The
second experiment focused on testing the performance of our method
under heavy noise conditions. Therefore, the original image of Cat was
corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of standard deviations 40, 50, and
60. Next, the methods by Monteil and Beghdadi [84], Tebini et al. [85],
Gupta et al. [86], Rezgui et al. [87], and ours were applied to restore
the original image. In all experiments, we applied PSNR and SSIM to
gauge quality of the denoised images. Implementation codes have been
shared for researchers to reproduce our results.4

5. Results and discussions
The current work demonstrates the capabilities of methods based
on nonlinear anisotropic diffusion in restoring degraded images with-
out destroying important features. Despite their notable advantages,
potential weaknesses of these methods have been discussed to inspire
early career researchers in developing more advanced and effective
nonlinear anisotropic diffusion methods. We have indicated interesting
research avenues in this promising field, the goal being to expand the
application domain of such methods in denoising corrupted images.
Supported by our experimental results, researchers may raise critical
questions leading to improvement of the proposed method or other
classical methods in the literature.
Results justify the capability of our approach to generate images
with higher perceptual and objective qualities (Fig. 4). Compared with
the results generated by the Perona–Malik method, our images contain
visually appealing and attractive features. Specifically, the proposed
approach suppresses noise and reconstructs visual semantic features.
Even for the complex images, such as Baboon (Fig. 4, second row), our
approach generates acceptable results by preserving plausible features
(e.g., fur, edges, and textures). Intuitively, we can observe from the
results (Fig. 4, far-right column) that the current method properly
balances between visual appealingness and noise removal in accor-
dance with the human visual system. This encouraging observation may
be explained from the structure of our diffusion kernel (3.3) that it
provides an effective strategy for steering the diffusion process across
image regions. However, this benefit comes at the expense of tuning the
kernel parameters, 𝑎 and 𝐾. We noted that the image type dictates the
{𝑎, 𝐾} search space, which seems non-intuitive as it requires heuristic
approaches to determine optimal values. Future studies may consider
more efficient algorithms for computing the values of 𝑎 and 𝐾 that
produce optimal results.
The proposed method performs well on objective quality metrics
(Tables 2 and 35). The method gives competitive values of PSNR and
SSIM even for an image with a higher noise density. More importantly,
our method converges faster that other methods, thus making it more
suitable in real-time computing devices. For a Cat image degraded
by Gaussian noise of standard deviation 40, the proposed method
converges with only five iterations—sixfold convergence rate faster
than the classical methods.
Despite its higher computational speed, the tuning parameters,
{𝑎, 𝐾}, of our method needs manual tuning to achieve optimal re-
sults (Table 2). This time-consuming process may give design and

work by Gupta et al. [86].

implementation challenges in practical systems. The challenge may
be addressed by establishing the relationship between parameters and
image structural–statistical information. Machine learning and fitting
techniques may be applied to establish the relationship, which should
then be embedded into the diffusion kernel. As the dynamical system
(4.1) advances, the parameters will be adaptively updated to steer the
system towards quality results.
We observed from empirical experiments that the fractional fidelity
term (2.13) by Lu et al. [39] promotes quality results for both additive
and multiplicative noise. But more efforts are needed to establish
superior fidelity terms that adapt to a variety of noise types, including
the ones with mixed PDFs co-existing in the same image. In this regard,
the proposed diffusion Eq. (2.9) may be modified as

∑
𝑖=1

(5.1)
where 𝑁 denotes the number of fidelity terms dependent upon the
nature and type of noise. The question remains to determine the values
of 𝜆 and expressions defining 𝜗′(𝑢, 𝑓).

6. Conclusion
The current work highlights potential advantages of nonlinear
anisotropic diffusion methods for noise removal in corrupted images.
Given their wide applications in image processing and computer vision,
it seems reasonable to further improve the methods and make them
more useful in theoretical and practical settings. Therefore, limita-
tions of the methods have been extensively discussed as an attempt
to create awareness and establish research opportunities within the
scholarly community. Furthermore, we have proposed a nonlinear
anisotropic diffusion method that generates promising results relative
to the classical Perona–Malik formulation.
