Abstract 
Distributed generation (DG) systems are considered an integral part in future distribution power system. The reactive 
power injections from DG units, are seen as a cost-effective solution for distribution system voltage support, energy 
saving, and reliability improvement. This paper proposes a coordinating control method of reactive power optimization in 
distribution power system with distributed wind energy. The reactive capability limits of doubly fed induction generator 
(DFIG) are included in the optimization model. The problem of reactive power output/absorb of adjustable compensating 
capacitor and wind turbine (WT) is formulated as constrained conditions; differential evolution algorithm (DE) integrating 
depth-first search is developed to effectively obtain optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm is applied to a practical test 
system and results are compared and presented.

1. Introduction 
Distributed generation is the direction of future power industry. Wind energy is the most widely used clean 
renewable energy. Distributed wind turbines(WT) are connected to the grid as distributed power sources and 
have brought significant impact on the system power flow distribution, voltage level and transmission loss.

Adequate voltage stability margin needs to be obtained through the appropriate scheduling of the reactive 
power resources [1].
Asynchronous wind turbines have simple structure and easy interconnection, but need to absorb reactive 
power from system in running state, there is no excitation device and capability of voltage regulation[2].
Currently, the most common technology used is the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), which is able to 
provide reactive power support. A large variety of control strategies can be used in the operation of DFIG 
The author in [3] has proposed a wind turbine control strategy in which the converters of grid side and rotor 
side are reserves of each other. In [4], a method to calculate the reactive power limit of system with DFIG 
considering grid-side converter reactive power limit is proposed, and the DFIG wind farm are used for 
reactive power compensation. [5] focused on including the reactive power capability of the DFIG turbines 
directly in the optimization formulation, and proposed a multiobjective reactive power planning strategy for 
WF and transmission system devices. 
In this paper, we focus on the reactive power optimization of distributed system with distributed wind 
power, asynchronous wind turbines, adjustable compensating capacitor and DFIG technology is considered, 
and the reactive power capability of converter also taking into consideration.

2. Mathematic model of wind turbine generator 
2.1 Mathematic model of Variable Speed Constant Frequency Wind Turbine Generator 
The DFIG has two set of windings including rotor winding and stator winding. The stator winding is 
connected directly to the grid through grid-side converter, GSC. The DC side voltage is controlled by GSC, 
and the power factor is adjusted according to the demand of grid.  
The value is set to positive when rotor and stator generating active power and inductive reactive power into 
grid. Then the power injected to the system by DFIG can be written as:

There are two main operating mode for DFIG: Constant power factor and constant voltage. Where

branch power restriction, the node voltage constraints and upper and lower limits of control variables; u and

3.2 Power flow model of distribution power system based on depth search 
The benefit of the power flow calculation methods based on depth search is that could ignore the specific 
network in radial topology, only need to know the base information of the node structure and the branch 
structure. In this paper, choose the voltage deviation as the termination condition of power flow calculation:
