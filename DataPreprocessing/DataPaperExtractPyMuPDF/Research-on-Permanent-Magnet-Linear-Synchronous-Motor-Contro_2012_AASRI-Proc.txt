mechanisms, such as gear boxes, chains and screw coupling, allowing high precision control to be achieved. It 
is a trance that linear motors are widely used in high performance CNC machine tools [1]. The vector control 
system of permanent magnet synchronous linear motor doesn t have the advantage of high precision control 
and high dynamic performance, but also can change speed more conveniently, as a result, the system attract 
more and more scholars to pay attention home and abroad [2]. The experiment has built the model of vector 
control system of PMSLM based on the environment of MATLAB software, which can provide the design 
and work of actual system with a new measure. 
2. Mathematical model of PMLSM 
The model of linear synchronous motor with permanent magnets is given in the "rotor" coordinates; it is 
derived from the model of rotary PMSM motor, which is based on the general theory of electrical machines.  
The model is valid only under the (simplistic) terms: the windings is three-phase, symmetrical, connected 
in star and with not connected central node, magnetizing characteristic is linear, loss in the magnetic circuit is 
zero, resistances and inductances are constant, air gap is constant, magnetic field in the air gap has a 
sinusoidal distribution and in the longitudinal axis is constant, boundary effects and the influence of the 
grooves is not considered.

Because that three phase permanent magnet synchronous linear motor has the characters of Multi variable, 
nonlinear and strong coupling. Engineers can t control anyone of three phases directly. To control it more 
conveniently, the model should be described in the d-q coordinate system. According to unified theory of 
electric motor, the equation from three-phase static coordinates to rotary two-phase coordinates as follow:

3. Simulation experiment 
3.1. Vector control 
Vector control is based on the principle that to maintain constant magnetic flux in the motor
in the d-q 
axis
the stator current vector is decomposed into two components: a component of the rotor flux vector 
coincides generated magnetic flux, which called the excitation current component; Another one is 
perpendicular to the flux vector, generated torque, which called torque current component. Through regulating 
the position and size of the stator current vector, the component of exciting current and torque current can be 
controlled well. Thus, AC motor can come true decoupling of the magnetic field and torque which is the same 
as DC motors. The frequency control system of motor speed for AC motors has the same advantage like the 
DC motors. According to the third equation building abc-dq module as follow

equilibrium module, which was packaged as a sub-module system, and forming the linear motor simulation 
module, shown in Figure 6 below. Applying the package technology on SIMULINK module and packaged 
module is added to the SIMULINK toolbox, so that the linear motor servo control system can be used directly. 
Linked the SVPWM module and linear motor module which formed a closed loop system, the simulation 
model was shown in Figure 7.

Based on the simulation environment of Matlab/Simulink, the simulation model of speed loop can be 
established in conditions of no-load, which be shown in Figure 7. Among them, the role of the current loop is 
to accept the current deviation signal, and generates a voltage signal which can control the on-off switch of 
electronic devices of SVPWM (center frequency is 10KHZ). Output of SVPWM was linked directly to the 
winding of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Linear Motor so that could achieve the goal of controlling 
s movement. By controlling the extern part of the speed loop, adjust the deviation signal of speed, 
which was looked as output current command. The inner ring is current loop, and it control received current 
of PMSLM by regulating controller in current loop.

3 Simulation results of PMLSM control system 
In order to check whether the simulation model is valid or not, the simulation experiment was completed in 
Matlab7.1 Software. Because of the nonlinear component, the experiment select ode23td algorithm which is a 
variable step way, the relative error and absolute error is 0.001; the parameters of PMLSM are: phase 
resistance R = 3. 2
 axis inductance Ld =8mH, q-axis inductance Lq = 8mH, the flux of permanent magnet 
2mm,the number of pole pairs Np = 2. Try to select a group of PI 
parameters which have been optimized, the parameters of speed loop PI are: Kp = 0.28, Ki = 40. The 
parameters of current loop PI are: Kp = 30, Kpi = 2000. The sampling time of velocity was taken 0.001 
second, and the sampling time of velocity was 0.0001 second. The simulation time is 0.4, given the speed 
command to run the simulation. The waveforms and three-phase current output waveform of PMLSM can be 
observed through the window of the scope. The obtained experimental results are shown in Figure 9 and 
Figure 10.

4 Conclusion 
For AC servo control system, Rapidity, Accuracy and Stability are the main performance indexes to 
estimate whether it is efficient. The simulation result shows, when a speed command is given, the permanent 
magnet linear synchronous motors (PMLSM) can attain the given speed by adjusting the speed loop and 
current loop and the Rate response curves in time domain is more ideal. The speed loop simulation system can 
run smoothly and features excellent dynamic and static performances. The experiment fully illustrated and 
proved the correctness of PMLSM mathematical model and the feasibility of this control algorithm and it 
offered the thinking for the further designing and adjusting of direct drive system.
