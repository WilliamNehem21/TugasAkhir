Abstract
The architecture of a control system can be designed vertically with
the distinction between functional levels. We adopt this layered approach for
the design and implementation of a network-based control and monitoring appli-
cation. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a network-
based management application for controlling and monitoring the input and
output data of remote equipment aiming at performance macro-observation,
alarm detection, handling operation failures, installation security, access control,
collection and recording of statistical data and provisioning of reports. The main
services provided to the user and operating over the public internet and/or
mobile network include control, monitoring, notiﬁcation, reporting and data
export. Our proposed system consists of a front-end for ﬁeld (site-level) control
and monitoring as well as a service back-end which undertakes to collect, store

1. Introduction
Due to the intensifying climate challenge, green growth is expected to be a very
important issue in the next decades. Green growth strategies can help economies
and societies become more resilient as they work to meet demands for food
production, transport, housing, energy and water (Huang and Quibria, 2013;
Ja¨ nique, 2012; Hallegate et al., 2012; Toman, 2012; Brown and Southworth,
2008; Gill et al., 2007; Rycrofta et al., 2000). A photovoltaic system (PV System)
consists of one or more solar panels which convert sunlight into electric power.
PV systems present a rapid growth with the installation of hundreds and thou-
sands MWp (megawatt peak) per year and with a signiﬁcant volume of clean
power contributed to the electrical grid. The research in PV technology and
inverters ﬂourishes (Ekins-Daukes, 2013), while important capital is invested
mainly because of favorable conditions in most markets, such as feed-in tariff,
subsidies etc. (Fthenakis et al., 2009; Bagnall and Boreland, 2008). Combined
with the various initiatives for energy efﬁciency, the installations of photovoltaic
systems are steadily increasing. Photovoltaics are shifting from being a negligible
power generation technology to a mainstream source of power (Woyte et al.,
2013).
Such systems, however, cannot work efﬁciently if operations are not automated.
Moreover, the need for improved performance of power systems in terms of
reliability and higher productivity has necessitated more and more application
of condition monitoring techniques (Wagle et al., 2008; Trovao et al., 2008).
Therefore, the need of integrated facility management systems which control
and monitor the solar park installations is imperative. The development of auto-
mated applications in the energy sector is signiﬁcant, not only in industry but also
for end-users. End-users increasingly demand products that use less energy, which
conﬂicts with the growing demand for expanded functionality. Control and
automation applications are developing solutions to reduce costs in time, money
and effort of procedures aiming to improve the quality of relevant services and
products. Fig. 1 depicts a PV system involving the photovoltaic and electrical
equipment plus the monitoring system. The photovoltaic equipment comprises
the solar panels, the solar panels mounting system, the inverters and the sensor
box, while a controller implements the monitoring system.

Web-based real-time monitoring systems have been heavily used in the health-
care and industrial sectors for many years and can be studied in order to gain sig-
niﬁcant experience in diverse application requirements. A typical ﬁnding is that
several of the applied monitoring principles, concepts and mechanisms can be eas-
ily migrated and adapted to other applications. Numerous efforts employing
diverse software, ﬁeld controller, communication and user interface architectures
have already empowered users by giving them access to real-time energy plant data
and quality observations in a ﬂuid and versatile environment (Lahti et al., 2011;
Sa´ nchez-Pacheco et al., 2011; Irmak et al., 2013; Konieczny et al., 2012;
Dobriceanu et al., 2009, etc.). A PV plant management solution aims at providing
fundamental services and other facilities to business entities in charge of the super-
vision of a number of remote installations. The interaction of the users with the
solution relies on the public internet and the GSM/3G network. In this paper
we present the design and implementation of a network-based solar park/PV plant
management application for controlling and monitoring the input and output data
of the PV equipment aiming at performance macro-observation, alarm detection,
handling operation failures, installation security, access control, collection and
recording of statistical data and provisioning of reports which are stored locally
or sent automatically to the users. The paper deﬁnes a three level architecture
involving the application, equipment, signals, alarms, and implemented services.
The proposed management solution has been designed to provide a number of
services to the end user for all remote installations:

(i) A monitoring service, operating over the public internet (Web). The user is
capable, through an Internet browser, to get information (parameters, events
and status) regarding the installations of interest to him/her.
(ii) A control service, also operating over the public internet (Web). The user is
capable, through an Internet browser, to control certain aspects of the oper-
ation of the remote installations.
(iii) A notiﬁcation service, operating both over the Web and the mobile network
and delivering notiﬁcations to the mobile phones or e-mails of the users who
have subscribed to the service whenever certain events related to the installa-
tions of interest to them occur.
(iv) A report generation and delivery service, operating over the Web and deliv-
ering reports to the e-mails of users who have subscribed to the service in a
periodical manner. These reports include information on the installations
regarding operational, maintenance and ﬁnancial aspects.
(v) A graphing service, creating comprehensive graphs of parameters and events
to be presented through the Web interface of the monitoring service or to be
included in reports, created by the report generation and delivery service.
(vi) An export service, allowing the user to store locally in his/her computer data
retained within the PV system management solution.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The automation system architec-
ture is presented in Section 2. The main control and automation services provided
are described in Section 3. A description of the solar park installation, the moni-
tored signals and implemented alarms follow in Section 4. Section 5 illustrates the
implemented services via the application screenshots, while Section 6 presents the
technology used to build the proposed application and the database schema.
2. Automation system architecture
The architecture of a control system can be designed vertically, with the distinction
between functional levels (Passino, 2005). Our presented architecture shown in
Fig. 2 consists of three levels. Each of them represents an aspect of system function-
ality, presenting the incarnation of the automation pyramid for a solar park automa-
tion system (Kastner et al., 2005). The bottom level or the level of devices interacts
with the real world and is constituted by the basic equipment of an automation sys-
tem. This includes sensors or other measure means according to the ﬁeld of applica-
tion, actuators, data converters (digital to analog data and reversely) and routers
(Dorf and Bishop, 2010). In addition, PLCs or PACs are employing all necessary
interfacing and storage functionality deployed at each installation separately. After
the collection of data through measurement, counting, metering, they are trans-
formed into a representation suitable for transmission and processing (see Fig. 3).
The role of the ﬁeld controllers is very important. They recognize failures and
generate alarms derived either directly from signals I/O or complex algebraic,

combinatorial or sequential functions and processes. Subsequently, they catego-
rize and prioritize, store, generate alerts and reports and communicate the status
of the installation to the management centers. There are important reasons as to
why an integrated facility management solution (IFMS) needs a stand-alone infra-
structure (the site-level control/monitoring system) installed at the ﬁeld:
� Due to the vast variety of equipment that may exist in the installation, it is
expected that the solution has to interface them using an equivalent variety
of physical connection methods and protocols.
� Though occasional loss of communication may occur, the nature of the
application does not leave much room for data loss, so storage in the ﬁeld
is a necessity.
� Scarce bandwidth may be available (e.g. communication with the installa-
tion may be carried out through a GPRS connection), so some form of data
reduction has to be applied.
� There are certain requirements that mandate the existence of logic in the
ﬁeld, which operates irrespective of whether a connection to the outside
world is operational or not.
This infrastructure is essentially a set of programmable networked controllers
employing all necessary interfacing and storage functionality deployed at each
installation separately. Therefore, it undertakes the responsibilities of:
� Interfacing with all equipment installed in the ﬁeld to acquire data, irrespec-
tive of the connection method and/or protocol.
� Reducing the volume of data to something representative, yet less band-
width hungry.

� Conveying events that are generated directly by ﬁeld equipment upon their
occurrence and generating events that are necessary yet not implemented
within the equipment in the ﬁeld.
� Storing all necessary parameters and events in a cyclical manner in the case
of failure of the communication with the outside world.
� Implementing all necessary control loops that have to operate locally and in
an independent manner.
The middle level is the Data Center which communicates through a public and/
or private network with the bottom level. It is also known as automation level. Its
role is to monitor and control all installations in a centralized manner. The main
part of the Data Center is the service back end, which undertakes to collect, store
and manage data from all remote installations. More speciﬁcally, the service back
end has the following responsibilities:
� To collect, store and manage data from a variety of remote sites.
� To transform data and prepare values for vertical access from the manage-
ment level.
� To store and manage information regarding the users accessing the service.
� To allow the users to conﬁgure the service back-end itself or the ﬁeld-
deployed controllers.
� To allow the users to carry out control functions on the installation.
� To carry out any post-acquisition calculations that may be necessary.
The back-end is scalable to accommodate any number of measurement points
merely through the addition of new servers and storage subsystems. The service
back-end can also provide external interfaces to other software entities, depending
on the customer needs. The service back-end has been designed to provide inter-
operation with a variety of third-party controllers and PLCs. For this reason,
an independent module, denoted as the Communications Adapter Module
(CAM) in the ensuing, has been implemented, which undertakes the task of
acquiring data from the remote installation and feeding them to the service
back-end as well as conveying data from the service back-end to the remote site.
Multiple CAMs are supported. The service back-end also incorporates an Appli-
cation Logic Module (the ALM), which calculates the derived parameters. This
module can be extended at will with new calculation functions. Other service
back-end modules include the Notiﬁcation Server Module (NSM), which under-
takes the notiﬁcation of the PV management solution users via SMS or e-mail
as well as the Reporting Server Module (RSM), which handles the generation
and delivery of reports. All necessary data are stored in a database.
The top level is the management level. At this level, information from the entire
system is accessible. The PV management solution includes a front-end, capable of
operation with a standard Web browser (Internet explorer, Mozilla Firefox or
Google Chrome). A uniﬁed interface is presented to the operator and end-users
20
A. Meliones et al.
for manual intervention in the system. It provides vertical access to the values of
the automation level, including the modiﬁcation of parameters such as timetables.
Alarms are generated for exceptional situations such as technical errors or critical
conditions. The long-term storage of historical data with the ability to give com-
mands for reports and statistics is also part of this level.
3. Main control and automation services
The PV management solution models the remote installation as a hierarchical tree
structure. The nodes of the tree can be broadly categorized either as nodes repre-
senting virtual entities, or nodes representing equipment entities. The former do
not contain actual equipment installed in the ﬁeld. Such entities are for example
the installation itself, a room etc. These nodes are denoted as virtual segments
in the ensuing. The latter contain a speciﬁc piece of equipment installed in the
ﬁeld. Such entities are for example the numerous sensors/transducers, speciﬁc
equipment etc. These nodes are denoted as asset segments in the ensuing. Both vir-
tual and asset segments are used in the ensuing as placeholders for the data that
are handled by the PV management solution. It has to be noted that certain parts
of the tree may be absent in certain cases. This model can be arbitrarily extended
to match further customer requirements.
3.1. Installation monitoring basics
The monitoring service of the PV management solution is based on the methodol-
ogy presented in the ﬁgure below. The PV management solution supports the col-
lection, storage, visualization and post-processing of the whole history of a large
variety of types of information for each node of the hierarchical model presented
above. These include:
� Primary parameters: Primary parameters are calculated as the time-series aver-
age of real-time data after a certain set of validations have been applied. The
span of this average (the recording period) has to be an integer sub-multiple
or multiple of an hour. The PV management solution supports any recording
interval, though it has to be the same for the whole of a single installation.
Daily, monthly and yearly averaged values are also supported for each primary
parameter separately. Data acquisition and the calculation of primary parame-
ters are considered to be carried out by ﬁeld-deployed controllers in order to
reduce the data that are conveyed to the service back-end and minimize band-
width requirements.
� Maximum/minimum value parameters: These parameters are assumed to be
calculated in much the same way as primary parameters, except for the opera-
tion applied on the real-time data. Daily, monthly and yearly maximum/
minimum values are also supported. The calculation of maximum/minimum
Integrated facility management of photovoltaic systems
21
value parameters is considered to be carried out by ﬁeld-deployed controllers in
order to reduce the data that are conveyed to the service back-end and minimize
bandwidth requirements.
� Derived parameters: Derived parameters are calculated using a speciﬁc mathe-
matic formula which operates on a speciﬁc set of values or vectors of values
of primary (and/or other derived) parameters. The PV management solution
provides the infrastructure that is necessary to carry out all derived parameter
calculations in the service back-end so as to further minimize the necessary
bandwidth and storage at the remote site. In the case that derived parameters
are calculated in the ﬁeld, they can be considered as primary parameters within
the service back-end. Daily, monthly and yearly values are supported for each
derived parameter separately.
� Raw, real-time data: The service back-end has been designed to store raw, real-
time data sets as they are acquired from the ﬁeld-deployed controllers.
� Real-time monitored data: In certain cases, it is necessary to present to the user
the real-time data as they are recorded by the ﬁeld-deployed controllers, without
any processing or storage. This functionality has to be supported by the equip-
ment deployed at the installation.
� Status, states and state-change events: The concept is presented in detail in the
remaining paragraphs of this section.
Each parameter sample and event are collected, stored and visualized with their
acquisition time-stamp and engineering unit. Primary and derived parameters as
well as raw real-time data are collected from the ﬁeld based on a time schedule,
aligned with the recording period. Status-change events are collected upon their
occurrence and real-time monitored data upon user request.
The PV management solution records and presents to the user the current status
of entities that are either internal or external to the solution. The status is consid-
ered to be a powerful tool in terms of the user getting an immediate grasp on
whether any entity of the installation being monitored or even the PV management
solution itself operate properly or not. Status information actually encodes the
severity of the condition of each entity independently, which is a number on a scale
from 0 (everything normal) to 100 (complete disaster). The status update mecha-
nism shall become apparent in the ensuing.
Apart from status information, the PV management solution also supports an
arbitrary number of state-sets per entity. Each state set encodes a set of states,
which are mutually exclusive, i.e. the entity can be found in only one of them. Each
state of each state set also has a preset severity level associated with it. Changes
among states are triggered by state-change events, which are either directly gener-
ated by sensors and equipment connected to the PV management solution (pri-
mary events), or by the PV management solution itself (derived events). The PV
management solution provides all means necessary for the user to acknowledge
(validate) that he/she has been notiﬁed on any speciﬁc state-change event and
22
A. Meliones et al.
has taken appropriate actions. This acknowledgement is a simple form of book-
keeping of user actions for further investigation. Each state-change event is stored
and presented to the user per state set with a list of data, including the entity gen-
erating the event, the state the event led to in a descriptive form, the event date/
time in the timezone of the installation, the date/time of the reception of the event
in the timezone of the installation, and the event acknowledgment status and
acknowledgment text.
Since all entities are organized in a hierarchical structure, the current status of a
certain entity cannot depend solely on the state (or states) it is into, but the sta-
tuses of all underlying entities within the hierarchy are used as well. This is a basic
concept within the PV management solution, since it enables the efﬁcient notiﬁca-
tion of the user if something calls for his/her attention. Moreover, this hierarchical
status propagation, as it will be denoted in the ensuing, can help the user realize
the effect that an entity being in a certain state of a certain state set has on the
operation of the installation as a whole.
The status of each entity of the installation hierarchy is always equal to the
maximum severity of the states of all underlying entities at any given point in time.
The statuses of all involved entities are presented to the user in an easily under-
standable form (e.g. color encoding, based on a set of severity thresholds) so that
his/her attention is drawn not only to a speciﬁc event but also to the effect it has
on the operation of the whole installation. The approach is further clariﬁed
through Fig. 4, presenting an exemplary hierarchy with the related statuses and
state-sets for each node. The related severities are also depicted, so that the hier-
archical status propagation is apparent.
3.2. Monitoring service
The main duty of the PV management solution is to provide, in a timely and con-
cise manner, information to its user on the operation of a group of remote sites. As
far as the monitoring service is concerned, the ﬂow of data through the solution
architecture is presented in Fig. 5. The CAM retrieves information necessary for
the addressing of data items within the site-level control/monitoring system from
the service back-end. It then connects to the ﬁeld-deployed equipment based on a
schedule, collects the necessary data and submits them to the service back-end,

which caches them in case some other module requests them and writes them to
the database. The ALM retrieves the necessary primary data to calculate the
derived values, also based on a schedule and submits the results to the service
back-end, which again caches and stores them in the database. The remaining
software modules (the Graphical User Interface, the Reporting Server Module
and the Notiﬁcation Server Module) connect to the back-end, either in a scheduled
manner or upon user request and collect data in order to depict them or use them
in reports or notiﬁcations.
3.3. Control service
The PV management solution allows the user to issue commands toward the
equipment within the installation or the solution itself. This functionality is imple-
mented through the notion of settings, whose values are considered constant from
the time they are set until they are reset. Each setting event is stored and visualized
with its timestamp and engineering unit. A user-inserted comment is also stored.
The user is notiﬁed whether his/her action has been successful or not as well as
whether it has been applied yet. As far as the control service is concerned, the ﬂow
of data through the solution architecture is presented in Fig. 6. A control

command is issued via the GUI toward the service back-end. This software mod-
ule stores the command to the database and forwards it to the CAM, which
retrieves information necessary for the addressing of the controls within the
site-level control/monitoring system from the service back-end. It then connects
to the ﬁeld-deployed equipment and propagates the command. At all times, the
user is notiﬁed via the GUI on the progress of the command he/she has issued.
3.4. Notiﬁcation service
The Notiﬁcation service informs the user on the occurrence of critical events.
Notiﬁcation is via emails (internet gateway) or SMS (SMS gateway). The gener-
ation of such notiﬁcations is not triggered by individual state-change events but
rather by the status changes of each node of the hierarchy which is affected by
them. More speciﬁcally, if the severity of the status goes above a certain user con-
ﬁgurable threshold and remains there for a preset period of time, a notiﬁcation is
generated to alert the user. Additionally, if the status falls below the same thresh-
old, another notiﬁcation is generated in order to notify the user on the expiration
of the criticality. The user is capable of subscribing to the status changes of and
conﬁguring the severity thresholds for each hierarchy node separately. It is
understandable that if he/she, depending on the subscription he/she has conﬁg-
ured, may receive multiple notiﬁcations upon occurrence of the same event or
set of events affecting the statuses of a certain set of nodes in the hierarchy.
Moreover, the user is capable of subscribing separately to the positive edge (sta-
tus going above threshold) or the negative edge (status going below threshold)
for each hierarchy node separately. Finally, the PV management solution logs
all notiﬁcations sent.
3.5. Reporting service
A very important function is the automatic generation of reports. This service
uses the Web and delivers reports to e-mails or mobile phones of users who have
subscribed to the service. These reports include information on the operation,
maintenance and ﬁnancial situation of the entire system or speciﬁc facilities.
The timing and scope are determined by the administrator and the choices of
the user.
3.6. Data export service
The Data export service allows the user to store locally data that are stored in the
application. The source of data is primary or derived parameters from any mon-
itored entity. The extracted data are in xml ﬁle format or graphic representations.
The time frequency of data extraction and export is determined by the user.

4. Solar park installation
The operation of solar parks/PV plants is based on the photovoltaic effect. The
photovoltaic effect is the basic physical process in which a photovoltaic cell con-
verts sunlight into electricity. A solar park consists of solar panels. Each panel is a
set of solar cells and numerous other protective and functional coatings installed
onto an aluminum frame as a means of support. They are connected in series until
we get the desired effect on current output and in parallel until they reach the
desired voltage. As a result, solar panel connection is very important during
installation.
A critical equipment of solar parks is battery. The battery stores solar energy to
provide electricity during periods of absence of sun, such as nights and cloudy
days. It must be able to be discharged and recharged. Rechargeable batteries
are a bit more expensive than the reserve batteries. Without batteries, a PVC sys-
tem can provide electricity only with sunlight. Along with the battery there should
be a charge controller. Its role is to provide electricity to the batteries from the
solar panel in a way that prevents the solar panels from overloading the battery.
Lastly, solar parks have power inverters. Solar panels generate electricity to DC
(direct current) power. Some devices are powered directly from the panel. How-
ever, most devices use high voltage AC (alternating current) power. The power
converter performs this procedure. It converts low voltage DC from the battery
to high voltage alternating current AC that is required by most household
appliances.
4.1. Signals
Every control and monitoring application controls a number of signals using the
appropriate sensing elements. Each transducer gives some type of digital (binary
or discrete) or analog (continuous) signal, or more complex signals in the form
of a protocol, e.g. serial. The type of signal depends on the observed physical size
and the transducer used. Controllers inside an automation system can control and
monitor digital, analog and serial data from sensors, actuators and devices (Nof,
2009). Our implementation for controlling and monitoring the power of a solar
park uses the following signals:
� Power signal: It is an analog signal. This paper suggests an implementation
which uses AC power. This consists of three components:
o Real/active power: The amount of energy consumed; measured in Watts.
o Apparent power: The amount of energy delivered from a source to a charger.
It must always be greater than that needed from a device to work; measured
in Volt-Amperes (va).
o Reactive power: The amount of energy that returns to the source in each
cycle because of the stored energy; measured in reactive Volt-Amperes (var).
26
A. Meliones et al.
� Temperature signal: It is an analog signal used for checking the proper function-
ing of the system in extreme environmental conditions. Sensors measure the
temperature of the installation, both internal (module temperature) and external
(air temperature). The ideal temperature for solar power plants is 25 �C (77 �F).
When temperature increases, the current increases slightly, while the voltage is
reduced too quickly. This results in a lower overall energy output. A general
rule is that the performance of a cell drops by 0.5% per 1 �C above the 25 �C.
� Humidity signal: It is an analog signal. A sensor measures the humidity of the
environment which is used for monitoring the proper functioning of the system
especially when the signal value goes over/under a speciﬁed threshold.
� Wind signal: It is an analog signal used for the same reason as humidity signal.
The system has been tested with real data. These were collected during a period
of one year from a real PV installation which collected and monitored the above
signals. Fig. 7 depicts the annual power produced in our monitored park in
relation with air temperature and humidity in the park area. The maximum per-
formance is in May, while the minimum appears in mid-December. The perfor-
mance increases during the summer months due to the favorable climate.
Apparently, performance change is proportional to temperature change. Mini-
mum performance has been recorded during the day of the year with minimum
air temperature. This synchronization between the two plots does not happen
for maximum performance. That means that temperature is not the only factor
Figure 7

Integrated facility management of photovoltaic systems
27
affecting the performance of a solar park. Accurate weather data are essential to
the performance evaluation of the solar plant (inAccess, 2013). The total annual
power produced by the solar park reached 1.82 MW.
Fig. 8 depicts the power and temperature values across a winter and a summer
day. Recordings on 12 August 2010 – a hot summer day with an outside tempera-
ture of an average 30 �C – show a peak of 900 KW. Recordings on 12 December
2010 – a cold winter day with an outside temperature of a mere 5 �C – show that
it is easily and permanently possible to achieve the goal of 70 �C and a thermal
energy of almost 1.5 MWh in the storage units: a very good result for almost the
shortest and coldest day of the year. In both cases, it is observed that the energy
produced (apparent power) by the park is entirely consumed (active power).
4.2. Alarms
Alarms are binary signals which depend on one or more signals and activated by the
changes of their values and situation. In the case of binary digital signals the alarm is
activated by the state change of the signal. In case of analog signals, activation of the
alarm takes place when the signal value exceeds or goes under a threshold. Our solar
park control and monitoring application implements the following alarms:
� Temperature alarm (air and module alarm): The manufacturer or user sets min-
imum and maximum values for air and module temperature in order to control
the environment of a solar plant system in extreme weather conditions, such as
frosts or large heat waves. Temperature alarms are created when values exceed
these thresholds. The ideal temperature for solar power plants is 25 �C (77 �F).

� Power loss alarm: This alarm is activated by a combination of factors. Some of
them are long periods of shadow, battery performance and temperature. As
mentioned before (see temperature signal), the increase in temperature results
in a lower overall energy output.
� Battery alarm: The amount of kW per hour that a solar panel can produce with
battery life depends on temperature and on sun exposure. The manufacturer or
user sets minimum/maximum thresholds and when the temperature value is out
of this range for a long period then a battery alarm is created. The performance
of a battery is reduced below a threshold and battery stops charging over a tem-
perature limit.
� Mold alarm: It is created with the logic of speciﬁed thresholds for valid values,
as described in temperature alarm.
� Security alarm: Allows a user to control the installation of any disasters/
violations, through optical ﬁbers applied to solar panels or used for installa-
tion’s fence.
5. Implemented services
The developed PV management solution for controlling and monitoring solar
parks implements a group of services, as these are speciﬁed at the previous
sections.
5.1. Surveillance
Every installation has cameras in speciﬁed areas according to pairs of coordinates
(south, north, west and east). The user can monitor with live video every plant by
specifying the direction s/he wishes, and even handling PTZ (pan, tilt, zoom) func-
tionality if available (see Fig. 9).
5.2. Performance
This service is very important because it allows the user to monitor very quickly
the total performance of the park. The user can monitor the current performance
as well as deﬁne speciﬁc periods of time to view a graph of the recorded values.
This service allows for macro-observation of the performance of the PV system
in ﬁeld conditions. The user can compare the performance values between days,
months, years or certain time intervals and draw useful conclusions (see
Fig. 10). Performance analysis and evaluation are based on the procedures and
performance indicators deﬁned in the IEC 61724 standard (International
Electrotechnical Commission, 1998; Emery et al., 2013), extended properly to
support state-sets and state-change events. Performance monitoring is signiﬁcantly
affected by the quality and calibration interval of the measurement hardware and

the professionalism of the installation. The dominant error source in determining
the system power is determining the plane-of-array irradiance (Emery and Smith,
2011).
Following the IEC 61724 directives, the PV Management System acquires real
time measurement data from the PV equipment (DC–DC converter or inverter,
sensors like pyranometer, temperature and humidity sensors etc.) on ﬁxed periods
of time. The completeness of real-time data is determined and used for further pro-
cessing. Derived parameters are calculated using mathematic formulas that oper-
ate on speciﬁc sets of values or vectors of values of primary (and/or other derived)
parameters covering a set of speciﬁc time spans (always in multiples of the record-
ing period), called ‘‘reporting periods’’. IEC61724 presents a number of derived
parameters, related to efﬁciency, yields, losses and performance ratio which can
be used to monitor the performance of a PV system. The ones selected for the
PV management system are mean array efﬁciency, array capture losses, and per-
formance ratio.
Mean array efﬁciency represents the mean energy conversion efﬁciency of the
PV array, which is useful for comparison with the array efﬁciency at its nominal
output power. The difference in efﬁciency values represents diode, wiring, and mis-
match losses as well as energy wasted during plant operation. The array capture
losses represent the losses due to array operation and indicate the amount of time
during which the array would be required to operate at its rated power to provide
such losses. The maintenance performance ratio is calculated per PV array, PV
array group and the PV plant as a whole only for values of total irradiance which
are above the standard speciﬁed threshold. This threshold is the same for all per-
formance ratio calculations.
The PV management system must be capable of calculating derived parameters
for a variety of time spans, which extend into the past. It is understandable that
since the values of all primary parameters are stored within the solution for every
recording period, it is possible to post-process that data to produce derived param-
eters for any reporting period.
5.3. Data export
Through the data export page the user can select one monitored signal or a group
of signals, the time period of interest for which a plot shall be produced (‘‘from/
to’’ selection) and the unit (X axis) of representation (days, months, years). The
results are being represented by graphical plots. The user further has the opportu-
nity to store these values locally in an xml ﬁle or send them via email (see Fig. 11).
5.4. Alarm
The alarm service allows the user to check the thresholds and priority for each
supported signal. The administrator can further set these values. Alarm

notiﬁcations are generated based on these values. Two speciﬁc alarms – battery
and performance – are generated automatically by functions inside the service
back-end. For these two alarms the user can only deﬁne their threshold in percent-
age mode, e.g. a notiﬁcation is being generated when battery reaches 15% of max-
imum performance. In addition, this service displays a graphical representation for
the selected alarm in the speciﬁed period allowing the user to easily spot values
exceeding the predeﬁned threshold which is depicted with a blue area (see Fig. 12).
5.5. Notiﬁcation
The user deﬁnes in his/her proﬁle page which type of communication channel will
be used per type of notiﬁcation and alarm. Three channels are provided by the
system: (i) SMS to receive notiﬁcations in a mobile phone. (ii) Email, where the
user receives notiﬁcations in the email address ﬁlled in the registration form.
(iii) Inbox, which is implemented through a web page of the PV management sys-
tem called ‘Notiﬁcations’. This page is accessible through the system environment
of a logged user. It is easy to use and very practical because all the information is
gathered together (see Fig. 13).

6. Technology framework
The proposed PV management system has been implemented in Visual Studio
2010 with Framework .NET 4. The programming language used is the object-
oriented C# language v4.0. The application consists of three projects. The ﬁrst
project is a web site where all .aspx pages are implemented. The aspx pages

Integrated facility management of photovoltaic systems
33
comprise the user interface. Each page has its own ﬁle code behind which imple-
ments functions of the Application Logic Module.
The second one is a Class Library project named DBTier. This project provides
the Database Access Layer of the PV management solution and establishes the
connection to the system database. It contains ﬁles for each database table and
communicates with the Application Logic, Reporting Module and Notiﬁcation
Module by carrying out insertions and updates or returning feedback via query
results for every function they operate.
The last project is a WCF Service Library project, which implements the Web
Service of the PV management application. WCF is an API in the .NET Frame-
work for building connected, service-oriented applications. Our PV management
application has implemented a Mail Sender Web Service, which sends notiﬁcation
emails when an alarm is created. For this purpose we used the System.Net.Mail
library of the .NET framework. This library contains classes in order to send email
to a designated SMTP server for delivery. Notiﬁcation mails include reports as
attachments.
The Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment includes the creation
of WCF Service Library for Web Services implementation. The WCF Service
Library is a compiled component that can be expanded as a Web Service or Win-
dows Service or even as part of a custom application hosting. When the debugger
starts, the WCF Service Host (WcfSvcHost.exe) implements the hosting of the
Web Services projects. Then it opens the WCF Test Client (WcfTestClient.exe)
and displays a list of service endpoints that have been deﬁned in a conﬁguration

ﬁle. Therefore, the Wcf Test Client tool helps experience the implementation of
Web Services and allows the users to test their Web Services without having to exe-
cute the web application, and to implement the WcfSvcHost hosting without the
need for setting up of Web Services using the IIS (Internet Information Services)
Microsoft web server.
The Graphical representations of our application were implemented using
Charting Controls which are embedded in Framework 4.0. With these tools we
can specify the type of graph, the format of the source of data and the ﬁlter of data.
The database on the service back-end was implemented in Microsoft SQL
Server 2008 and consists of twelve tables (see Fig. 14):
� Park: contains all registered parks.
� Panel: contains all registered panels, each connected to a single park.
� User: contains data for registered users who have access to a solar park.
� Panel data: stores signals’ values. These values derive from the CAM, which
acquires data from the remote installation and calculates values’ average of a
time span of 30 s. The values stored are: battery, humidity, wind speed, air
and module temperature, as well as active, reactive and apparent power.
� Contact media: contains all available contact media (email-sms-inbox).
� UserContactMedia: registers the media by which the user is notiﬁed for each
alarm.
� Notiﬁcation: saves all inbox notiﬁcations which are automatically created by the
system.
� Priorities: contains all available priorities for system’s notiﬁcation (low-
medium–high).
� ParkUser: connects users with parks deﬁning a role for each relation.
� Roles: contains the supported user roles of the system.
� Thresholds: provide minimum and maximum value for all measured signals.
� ParkThreshold: relates each park with its active thresholds.
7. Conclusions
We have developed a ﬂexible modular network-based application which supports
all key services for automatic remote control and management of photovoltaic
parks. Our implemented PV management application fully achieved the system
objectives meeting successfully the initial user requirements. We have presented
in detail a three-tier layered architecture and the according design and implemen-
tation of a modular service back-end system including database, notiﬁcation,
reporting and arithmetic logic system components. The presented integrated sys-
tem allows the easy and convenient monitoring of a real operational environment
and helps the executives to administer their solar parks. The service back-end can
provide online customized monitoring of signal groups and system status, energy

production and environmental beneﬁts in real-time. We have tested our system
with real data collected and monitored during a period of one year from a
2MWp PV plant installation. The monitored panel data included several signals:
active, reactive and apparent power, air and module temperature, battery, humid-
ity and wind speed.
The presented system is a successful paradigm of automation technology and
integration of front- and back-end system components which can be easily
migrated to solar buildings and even entire solar cities for solar energy exploita-
tion, as well as other types of renewable energy generation installations and
remote automation applications. The presented remote installation management
solution targets application areas in need of advanced control and monitoring
functionality, including:
� Interfacing with a variety of equipment employing different communication
methods and protocols.
� Support of on-site logic and storage to enable remote control loops and
intelligent data pre-processing (e.g. event generation, algorithmic operations
on real-time data etc.).
� Storage of near real-time historical data (at a deﬁned sampling rate) to a
central location around the clock.
� Calculation and storage of derived parameters (e.g. key performance indica-
tors) on a scheduled basis.
� Hierarchical storage and presentation of data to facilitate post-calculations
and retrieval.
� Access to the stored data over the Web and via an intuitive front-end operat-
ing within the browser with the capability to export data to the operator’s PC.
� Event handling assisted by the concept of status propagation and notiﬁca-
tions in order to readily alert users.
� Scalability to any number of measurement points.
Future extensions of the presented work will study more novel approaches for
monitoring the current produced by arrays (strings) of photovoltaic modules
based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology to let the creation of a
self-conﬁguring wireless network of low-power and low-cost devices (no wires
for data transmission and for supplying power to the devices), in order to dramat-
ically reduce the installation cost and time.
