1. Introduction 
Navel orange is a kind of feature agricultural products in the central mountain area of China. It mainly 
distributes in the Gannan area of Jiangxiprovince. Gannan navel orange is the most special product in Jiangxi 
citrus production and has been an import means in increasing income of peasants. But, the quality safety 
incidents of navel orange in recent years have dealt a blow to navel orange's reputation and cause great

economic loss. For example, the “dyedorange “incident made the navel orange of the 70% of Hong Kong 
market share reduce to zero in 2004;the “Bactrocera” incident in Sichuan Gung Yuan area was a great blow to 
the south citrus production in 2008.Market rate was below production cost. The bid of a part production was 
only 20% of production cost. The peasants suffered heavily loss.Typical of agricultural products of Central 
Mountain Gannan navel orange as the research object, we explore the monitor points of full traceability of 
quality and safety of the typical ofagricultural products in our country, and the retrospective business 
processes, relative standards and key technologies applied to safety and quality of typical of agricultural 
products in our country. 
Because of efficient risk control, food traceability systems receive muchattention by many countries. Food 
traceability systems mainly apply in animal husbandry in developed countries at present, and gradually cover 
into vegetables�fruit and so on.The United States issued the regulation for food safety, demanded all the 
companies which involve in food transportation�food distribution and food import establish and save the 
whole records about the food distribution indecember,2003(2). In 2008, the Canadian federal government 
reached an ambitious goal.The country has achieved tracing back 80 percent of agricultural products to its 
source, supporting the "Brand Canada strategy"(7).The Japanese Government has passed new legislations 
required meat processors to collect and save time in the slaughter of livestock per head DNA samples (9). 
In the past decade, a series of traceability system for quality and safety of agricultural products came into 
being, quality and safety monitored traceable system for chicken safety and quality production (YunfengBai, 
ChanghuaLu, 2005), quality tracking and traceability information system for the entire process of beef 
production in quality and safety (ShusenZan,TongchaoZheng, 2005) , Origin Digital System for Factory Pork 
Production Safety (ChanghuaLu, JufangXie, 2006), the main grain and oil product quality and traceability 
system (ShihongLiu, HuoguoZheng, etc., 2008), are all highly representative of the research results. 
2. Methods And System Design 
2.1. Methods

of software and hardware platform of independent intellectual property rights, and achieve demonstration and 
application in the mountains of central China to explore retrospective method for the quality of the typical of 
agricultural products suitable for China's national conditions.  
2.2. System Design 
Quality and safety of Orange tracking and tracing technology decompose the overall architecture from 
three levels of the information collection, information processingand information services. In the information 
collection layer, through sorting out process from planting to harvesting and the process of production of the 
navel orange product, we investigate their business processes, analysis hazards, explore and determine factors 
which affects the quality and safety of navel orange, and get product processing, quality inspection, logistics 
and marketing and other aspects of quality and safety information which basedon processing and production 
of enterprises, build traceability data center of navel orange, and provide data support to achieve the ultimate 
traceability. In the information processing layer, using HACCP(1)and other quality management methods and 
tools toanalyze and determine key factors of the quality and safety indicators of navel orange. Using the 
encoding information technology, information exchange, management and hardware R & D of digital

technology, we can complete traceable information portal of quality and safety of navel orange and research 
the technologies. In the information services layer, information services of quality and safety of orange could 
be provided to consumers, business managers and regulators through the network platform, supermarket touch 
screen, original mobile terminals and other methods. Overall system framework is shown in Figure 1. The 
traceability data centered original solution is shown in Figure 2.

With navel oranges for object and with navel oranges’ traceability chain for main, we have established a 
multi-level and multi-role traceability system for quality safety of navel oranges by information coding, 
multiple platform sources, hardware development and other technology. System functions include basic 
information management, standard management, orchard information management, processing process 
management, storing, transportation, marketing management and traceability management and so on ,there not 
only realize the information management of quality and safety  on production process, storage, and sales for 
enterprises, but also provide consumers and regulators with services by many kinds of ways such as network, 
supermarket touch screen, mobile traceability terminal and so on. 
4. Discussion 
1. Navel oranges in the central mountainous areas of agricultural production have the most representative 
features, which directly affect the quality and safety of agricultural products quality and safety of the entire 
region as a whole. Therefore, studying the traceability system for quality safety of navel oranges will have far-
reaching social benefits. 
2. The methods of the research, the development and application of the results of product demonstrations, 
will have a positive impact on fruit production quality management. R & D quality, safety traceability system 
and establish tracking and tracing information chain, largely to facilitate to the users of the products which are 
(anti) to the back. 
3. Fruit production traceability system is applied to producing information and collecting real-time quality 
monitoring information, which will be difficult and key points of the tracing process.
