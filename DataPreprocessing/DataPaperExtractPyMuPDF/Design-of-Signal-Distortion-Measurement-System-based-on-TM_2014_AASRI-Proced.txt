1. Introduction 
It is usually used in circuit analysis, production, repair, measurement and other fields that the signal source 
as incentive source. It has high requirements about the quality of provided signal, therefore, it is particularly 
important for the signal distortion measurement, which usually measured by using the distortion measurement 
instrument, but the instrument is expensive and inconvenient to carry. According to the traditional simulation 
method of testing the signal distortion measurement can not adapt to the current situation of the developing

new technology. This paper introduces a digital test method which used simple electronic circuit to measure 
the signal distortion. This method has the characteristics of simple, convenient testing and high precision. 
2. Implementation
It is using the real fast Fourier transform (RFFT) optimization algorithms for the design of digital  signal 
distortion measurement system. The overall block diagram of digital signal distortion measurement system 
shown in Figure 1.The given signal into the analog channel through the test circuit, after being conditioned, 
signal is sampling high speed by the DSP internal ADC. Combined with the FFT algorithm , the sampled data 
are sent to the LCD for display by using the DSP processor.

3. Algorithm Selection of Spectrum Analysis 
Normally, the input sequence is pure real, but the input sequence of the FFT operation is plural, this must 
be form a plural sequence by replaced imaginary part with a zero manually. But the amount of its calculation 
will increase, computation time will be longer , memory space will increase, the system is not conducive to 
real-time processing. In view of this, we made some improvements about the original real number FFT 
algorithm, namely RFFT optimization algorithm. The specific contents are as follows:

Equation ( 1 ) form a N point plural sequence
y(r)
,from equation ( 2 ) we obtained the FFT results 
Y(k)
of 
y(r)
,according formula ( 7 ) , ( 8 ) ,we obtained the real part and imaginary part of the first half of
X (k)
by
using the real part and imaginary part of 
Y(k)
.Since the symmetry of FFT spectrum , we only need to 
calculate the spectrum of the first half of the N point
X (k)
[1][2].
Compared to calculate the real FFT directly, RFFT optimization algorithms reduce nearly half amount of 
the computation, while saving memory space. Obviously, RFFT optimization algorithm is a method of saving 
computation, speed nearly doubled. It is the core algorithms of our design.

4. Hardware Design 
4.1. Bias module 
Using TL431 chip to design The 1.5V DC bias source ,the aim is lift the input voltage to ADC input range. 
Bias module shown in Figure 2. TL431 is a three-terminal programmable shunt regulator diode, whose 
programmable voltage is 36V,output impedance is 0.22 Ohms, and it has low output noise voltage. When it is 
working properly, there is a reverse current between 3-pin and 2-pin, and generate a 2.5V reference voltage at 
the third pin, we will obtain a 1.5V reference voltage by adjusting the variable resistor R41[3].
The output reference voltage is connected to the voltage follower that designed with integrated operational 
amplifier OPA2134, to achieve the function high input impedance, low output impedance. OPA2134 is the 
operational amplifier that applied in the audio range with the superiorities of Ultra-low distortion, low noise , 
unity gain stable, it can be suppled by dual power ,its bandwidth is 8MHz.It provides excellent common-mode 
rejection and maintain low input bias current, and minimizing distortion over a wide input voltage range[4].

4.2. ADC driver module 
ADC driver module schematic diagram shown in Figure 3.If the input signal into the ADC acquisition 
directly, digital signal of DSP will do interference to the input analog signal, even a serious distortion of the 
input signal. Therefore, we added a voltage follower before the signal into the ADC of integrated DSP to 
realize the function of isolate the interference signal .This module uses the integrated operational amplifier 
chip OPA340 on the circuit (ADC circuit) design. OPA340 is a rail to rail amplifier with CMOS technology, 
single power supply, 5.5MHz bandwidth. It is the characteristic of rail to rail input / output and high-speed 
processing that made it be the ideal chip of ADC driver[5].Because the voltage range of DSP internal 
integrated ADC is 0~3V,So we use a resistor divider limits the supplied voltage of operational amplifier for 
0~3V,that is, the output voltage of operational amplifier is0~3V,Thereby protecting the DSP internal 
integrated ADC.

From Figure 4 we know that, firstly, the system initializes, secondly, perform dynamic keyboard was 
scanned, then the waveform of ADC sampling and time-domain were displayed, the sampling frequency of 
frequency domain portion according to the time-domain signal frequency was setted that LCD displayed, 
ADC sample was taken using the previous setted frequency, the sampled data by FFT optimization algorithm

was processed, the corresponding parameters were obtained ,finally, the processed data was displayed on 
LCD.
5.1. ADC Sampling module 
DSP internal integrated ADC is the bridge connected with external analog signal, the clock must be setted 
below 12.5MHz, or the data of ADC conversion would be unstable. In this paper, the ADC clock setted at 
12.5MHz,triggered by software, controlled the sampling rate of ADC with timer 0. ADC acquisition module 
flowchart of Frequency domain shown in Figure 5.  
Fig. 5. ADC acquisition module flowchart of Frequency domain 
5.1.1 Accuracy of ADC sampling  
It is 12 bit that the ADC integrated inside DSP, but the actual sampling number is less than 10,the sampling 
precision is very low. To obtain a higher sampling precision, we need to separate the digital power design and 
analog power design. To avoid the digital signal line we connected the ADCINxx pin, and we use external 
reference.   
5.1.2 Frequency of ADC sampling 
In this design, ADC sampling frequency is divided into the time domain and frequency domain. Time 
domain sampling rate sets as:500Hz,1KHz,5KHz,10KHz,50KHz,100KHz,500KHz and 1MHz. System works 
at 1KHz initially, displayed according to the graphics, adjusted the sampling frequency using the keys of 
instrument. 
In the frequency domain signal analysis, considering the spectral resolution , LCD resolution, spectral 
leakage ,finally we selected the sampling points 1024,the grade of sampling frequency setted according to an 
integer multiple of the sampling points ( or divisibility ).In this way, we can guarantee sampling the general

signal periodically, reducing the spectrum leakage of test signal, getting better spectral waveform. Specifical

Obtained from Table 1,the spectrum minimum resolution of our design is 1Hz, signal bandwidth is 150KHz. 
5.2. RFFT Algorithm module 
This design uses the original library file CCS, sets the sampling points to 1024,Specific steps of using FFT 
library[6] as follows: 
(a)512-point plural sequence is Combined by the 1024-point real sequence, then the reverse sequence 
operations of the plural sequence is completed. 
(b)512-point complex sequence is treated with window (hanning), then the 512-point plural sequence are 
calculated by FFT . 
(c)Splitting and reduction, the result of 1024-point real sequence calculation is obtained  by radix-2 FFT . 
(d)the amplitude spectrum of frequency spectrum is obtained by squared the real and imaginary of real 
sequence that processed with FFT and then prescribing. 
FFT library includes CFFT32 module, it provides 128,512,1024 points FFT calculation module, while 
defined all the used variables and functions to the CFFT32 module, which make the interface of FFT simple, 
and facilitate to call the FFT[7].Module structure of the CFFT32 is: 
typedef  struct {    
        long *ipcbptr; 
        long *tfptr;                
        int size; 
        int nrstage;              
        long *magptr; 
        long *winptr;  
        long peakmag; 
        int peakfrq;

        void (*init)(void *); 
        void (*izero)(void *); 
        void (*calc)(void *); 
        void (*mag)(void *); 
        void (*win)(void *); 
        }CFFT32; 
FFT module initialization procedure is: 
Void  FFT_config(void) 
{
    fft.ipcbptr=ipcb; 
    fft.magptr=ipcb;             //Result is stored in the same area 
    fft.init(&fft);   
}
FFT calculation module program as follows: 
void Compute_FFT(void) 
{
    RFFT32_brev(ipcb,ipcb,N);//Bit reverse 
    fft.calc(&fft);//RFFT calculate 
    fft.split(&fft);//Splitting and reduction 
    fft.mag(&fft);  
}
The format of calculated signal amplitude is Q30 data, it is the true magnitude of the signal that the 
calculated data divided by 2 to the 30th power and converted to a decimal value, while the real signal 
frequency also got by processing the signal frequency further. We can obtained the true frequency of the 
signal by calculated according to the following formula.

6. System Testing 
To test the performance of the measurement system, we need take the steps as follows: 
Firstly, according to the table 1,sampling the test signal in all range of the Frequency bands by ADC. 
Secondly, processing the sampled data by RFFT algorithm. Finally, tabulating the test results. Figure 6 is a 
field test pattern of the system, Table 2 is the specific test results.

From the test results of Table 2 we know that , the calculated signal amplitude of the design is relatively 
stable in the frequency range of 10Hz ~ 150KHz, the maximum error is -0.724dB. The flat of the design is 
better in the entire bandwidth range , the error is bigger when the measuring signal amplitude between 40KHz 
to 150KHz, and the fluctuation is more obvious . From test signal spectrum , we can see some frequency 
spectrum leakage of the signal .Since the design uses a reasonable set of sampling points and frequency, we 
can sampling the general signal periodically in theory and avoid leakage phenomenon as far as possible. After 
a data analysis of the test frequency in the range 40KHz ~ 150KHz, we find the error of test signal amplitude 
mostly comes from the systematic errors of the design.
