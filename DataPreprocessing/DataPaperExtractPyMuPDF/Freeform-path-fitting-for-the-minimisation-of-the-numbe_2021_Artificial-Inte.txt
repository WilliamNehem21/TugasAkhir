Agricultural logistics
Within the context of in-ﬁeld path planning this paper discusses freeform path ﬁtting for the minimisation of the
number of transitions between headland path and interior lanes within agricultural ﬁelds. This topic is motivated
by two observations. Due to crossings of tyre traces such transitions in practice often cause an increase of
compacted area. Furthermore, for very tight angles between headland path and interior lanes undesired hairpin
turns may become necessary due to the limited agility of in-ﬁeld operating tractors. By minimising the number of
interior lanes both detrimental effects can be mitigated. The potential of minimising the number of interior lanes
by freeform path ﬁtting is evaluated on 10 non-convex real-world ﬁelds including obstacle areas, and compared
to the more common technique of ﬁtting straight interior lanes.

1. Introduction
According to Ahumada and Villalobos (2009) there are four main
functional sectors for the agri-food supply chain: production, harvest-
ing, storage and distribution. Optimising logistics and routing play an
important role in all of the four functional areas for improved supply
chain efﬁciency. Furthermore, according to Sorensen and Bochtis
(2010) it can be distinguished between in-ﬁeld, inter-ﬁeld, inter-
sector and inter-regional logistics. This paper relates to the ﬁrst func-
tional area of the agri-food supply chain, i.e., production, and further
to in-ﬁeld logistics. The difﬁculty of in-ﬁeld logistics arises from the
vast variety of ﬁeld shapes encountered in practice. In this perspective
Oksanen (2013) presented eight indices for measuring the complexity
of ﬁeld shapes. For an application, see Janulevicius et al. (2019) who
studied the effect of different ﬁeld width-to-length ratios on tractor per-
formance measures such as fuel consumption and exhaust emissions
when ploughing.
For in-ﬁeld logistics it can be differentiated between three hierarchi-
cal planning layers: (i) the ﬁtting of lanes within ﬁeld contours, (ii)
route planning for the traversal of these lanes, and (iii) trajectory plan-
ning accounting for agility and actuation constraints of the in-ﬁeld oper-
ating vehicle to smooth out ﬁnal paths. This paper focuses on the ﬁrst
hierachical layer and, in particular, how freeform path ﬁtting compares
to the more common method of ﬁtting straights as interior lanes. For
background, the coverage of agricultural ﬁelds growing, e.g., cereals or
rapeseed requires lanes to be ﬁtted within ﬁeld contours such that in-
ﬁeld operating machinery can repeatedly travel along them during the
work cycle after seeding and before harvest. These traversals typically
occur many times throughout the year for multiple spraying and fertil-
izing applications.
Oksanen and Visala (2009) presented two greedy algorithms for
ﬁeld coverage path planning. The ﬁrst algorithm splits a single ﬁeld
using a trapezoidal split-and-merge scheme into multiple smaller con-
vex or near convex subﬁelds that are then simpler to drive or operate
using the best driving direction and best selection of subﬁelds. Straight
driving lanes are assumed. In contrast, in the second algorithm the path
is planned on the basis of the machine's current state and the search
over a limited search horizon is on the next lanes instead of the next
subﬁeld. Lanes are now permitted to be curved. Note that for both algo-
rithms multiple different path patterns may result within the same ﬁeld.
Thus, in general, also multiple new headland paths must be generated
within the ﬁeld in order to bound the different pattern regions, whereby
segments of headland paths coincide for neighbouring regions. Conse-
quently, more transitions between interior lanes and headlands and
more compacted areas result. Thus, while partitioning of a ﬁeld into
multiple subﬁelds may be inevitable for strongly non-convex ﬁeld
shapes that demand very different driving behaviour, it also comes at
a cost.
Hameed et al. (1086) computed optimal driving directions for
straight interior lanes based on the minimization of overlapped area
using a genetic algorithm, before optimal routing is determined based
on the minimization of the non-working distance. Freeform path plan-
ning is not discussed. Results are evaluated on two obstacle-free test
ﬁelds.

Hameed et al. (2010) presented a method for automated generation
of guidance lines for operational ﬁeld planning. A geometrical represen-
tation of the ﬁeld is constructed as a geometrical entity comprising dis-
crete geometric primitives such as points, lines, and polygons. For their
generation of parallel lanes the concept of “longest edge” of the ﬁeld or
partitioned subﬁelds is crucial. It is selected to determine the driving di-
rection. The curved edge is determined as a collection of sequential
straight edges satisfying the criterion that the angle between two suc-
cessive edges is less than or equal to a threshold. Complex ﬁeld shapes
are partitioned into a number of simpler subﬁelds, typically convex
polygons.
Jin and Tang (2011) accounted for 3D terrain topography. Four crit-
ical tasks were therefore addressed: terrain modeling and representa-
tion, coverage cost analysis, terrain decomposition, and determining a
suitable reference path such that by offsetting a lane pattern for full
ﬁeld coverage is obtained. Field boundary segments and topographic
terrain contour lines were considered as the two categories for refer-
ence curve candidates. In Guo (2018) a similar study is discussed,
where soil and water conservation is also considered for the design of
reference curves. In Spekken et al. (2016) 3D terrain topograpgy is
also examined. The objective was soil loss minimisation for sugarcane
production. Therefore, “hybrid” curves were proposed as reference
paths. These are generated by continuously offsetting multiple ﬁeld
contour segments towards each other until the hybrid curve is formed
as their intersection points. While corresponding results were found
to be beneﬁcial, a disadvantage of this method is that the shape of the
hybrid curve does not follow any particular segment of the ﬁeld contour
such that realisation in practice is difﬁcult due to lack of nature-given vi-
sual reference landmarks.
Once lanes are ﬁtted within ﬁeld contours available methods from
the literature can be employed for the two other aforementioned hier-
archical planning layers (routing algorithms for traversal of lanes and
trajectory planning for ﬁnal path smoothing) including, for example,
Jensen et al., 2015, Bochtis et al., 2013, Hameed et al., 2016, Yu et al.,
2015, Spekken et al., 2015, Seyyedhasani and Dvorak, 2018, Plessen,
2018, Paraforos et al., 2018 and Backman et al., 2012. Consider also
Plessen, 2019 for the coupling of crop assignment and and vehicle
routing.
To summarise, given UTM-coordinates of a ﬁeld contour and of all its
in-ﬁeld obstacles, the ﬁrst step is to ﬁt interior lanes. Because of being
the primary step lane ﬁtting presents the foundation for all upstream lo-
gistical optimisation layers on top, including routing, trajectory plan-
ning
and
even
multi-robot
coordination.
This
underlines
the
importance of lane ﬁtting. Furthermore, as satellite pictures show, the
vast majority of ﬁelds in practice is ﬁtted with straight lanes. Obviously,
straights are attractive due to their simplicity and absence of turning. On
the other hand, almost all ﬁelds are irregularly and very often even
(strongly) non-convexly shaped. In view of this discrepancy the re-
search question arises whether freeform path ﬁtting may yet be
underestimated for improved agricultural in-ﬁeld operations and
merit more studying. This argument is supported particularly by the
fact that straights can be considered as just a subset of the more general
class of freeform paths. It is therefore expected that freeform paths can
produce improved or at least equally good solutions for a variety of
optimisation objectives.
Within this context the motivation and contribution of this paper is
to discuss the potential of freeform path ﬁtting for the minimisation of
the number of transitions between headland path and interior lanes
within agricultural ﬁelds. As a proxy therefore, the number of interior
lanes is minimised. This is achieved by optimised freeform ﬁtting of in-
terior lanes to arbitrarily non-convexly shaped ﬁeld areas, that also may
include obstacle areas. While freeform ﬁtting of interior lanes is not new
and sometimes in practice even performed intuitively by farmers,
e.g., on wavy or curvedly shaped ﬁelds, the outcome of a quantitative
comparison with respect to optimal straights ﬁtting and explicit evalu-
ation of the number of interior lanes that can be saved in real-world sce-
narios is not obvious.
The remaining paper is organised as follows: problem modeling and
proposed solution, numerical results and the conclusion are described
in Sections 2–4.
2. Problem modeling and proposed solution
Figs. 1 and 2 introduce basic terminology. See Figs. 3 and 4 for real-
world visualisation on satellite images and problem motivation.
Problem input are location data of the ﬁeld contour and all available
obstacle contours. In a ﬁrst step, the ﬁeld contour is eroded to generate
the headland path. Similarly, obstacle contours are dilated to construct
obstacle headland paths. In a second step, a reference path is selected as
a partial segment of the headland path. In a third step, this reference
is offset to generate a grid of interior lanes ﬁtted within ﬁeld contours
with inter-lane distance selected as the machinery operating width w.
In this paper it is iterated over the selection of the reference path ac-
cording to the criterion of minimising the total number of interior
lanes denoted by Nl.

before it is tested for pruning and constraints. Similarly the headland
path and all obstacle headland paths are constructed, whereby the off-
setting distance is here w=2, i.e., half the operating width.
An implementation detail is discussed. After ﬁtting of any interior
lane its location data points are spatially extended by interpolation
such that the distance between any 2 consecutive locations describing
the interior lane is at most of length d > 0. This is relevant for pruning
and permits to work with circle inclusion checks to determine if a candi-
date location ðxðiþ1Þ
k
, yðiþ1Þ
k
Þ according to Eq. (1b) maintains a distance of
w to all lane segments describing the previous interior lane i. Obviously
this holds by deﬁnition for the lane segment described by ðxðiÞ
k , yðiÞ
k Þ and
ðxðiÞ
kþ1, yðiÞ
kþ1Þ. However, it may in general not hold for all lane segments
and therefore may require pruning. The preferred method for the selec-
tion of d > 0 is discussed next. See also Fig. 5 for visualisation. The fun-
damental idea is to work with circle inclusion checks to determine if
a candidate location point P maintains with desired ε-conﬁdence
(e.g., ε = 99%) distance w>0 from any piecewise lane segment that
concatenatedly describe the previous interior lane. With respect to
Fig. 5, the constraint h > εw can therefore be formulated. Using elemen-
tary geometric arguments this translates to a desired interpolation dis-
tance of

because of their target-distance of half the operating width with
respect to the ﬁeld and obstacle contours, respectively. In ﬁnal evalua-
tion experiments it is set w ¼ 36m and ε = 99%, which implies a spatial
interpolation grid of at least 5 m along headland and obstacle headland
paths and 10m along interior lanes. Note that when collecting ﬁeld
and obstacle contour data points from real-world ﬁelds, these typically
are already recorded to be sufﬁciently well shape-deﬁning. Therefore,
interpolation points along the ﬁeld and obstacle contours are here
added spatially only for improved constraint checking. The ﬁeld and
obstacle shape as deﬁned by originally recorded contour data is not
altered.
A pruned point does not abort interior lanes construction. It merely ﬁl-
ters out some location points. In contrast, any constraint violation results
in the dismissal of the entire corresponding reference path candidate. Be-
fore discussing constraints in detail, two more implementation details are
therefore described. First, the last point of any interior lane is linearly ex-
trapolated (leveraging the penultimate point for the direction) to obtain
the intersection with the headland path. Second, after ﬁtting of any inte-
rior lane its coordinates are extended by above discussed spatial interpo-
lation technique with spacing according to Eq. (2).
Constraints are discussed. First, any crossings of any two interior
lanes are prohibited. Second, too tight turns (expressed as the change
of directions between two adjacent lane segments) are not admitted
such that candidates with
jθðiÞ
kþ1 − θðiÞ
k j > Δθmax;
ð3Þ
for any k ¼ 1, . .. , jfθðiÞ
k gj−1, ∀i ¼ 1, . . . , Nl are dismissed. In experi-
ments the threshold was set to Δθmax = 135°. This somewhat
aggressive choice is here motivated to determine a conservative upper
bound on the saving potential of freeform path ﬁtting. Third, also
interpretable as a tight angle constraint to maintain a minimum w-
distance among coordinates of each lane itself it is set

Fig. 3. Visualisation of real-world transitions between headland path and interior lanes. As illustrated, the transitions between headland path and interior lanes can be “messy” in the sense
that these often cause an increased amount of compacted ﬁeld areas due to crossings of tyre traces. This motivates the minimisation of such transitions, and therefore to minimise the
number of interior lanes as a proxy.

with hyperparameter Δk > 0 denoting a blocking index interval. In ex-
periments it was set Δk = 20.
The operating width w is given by available machinery hardware
setup. For example, for spraying applications on ﬁelds growing cereals
or rapeseed in central Europe it is often w ¼ 36m or w ¼ 24m. To sum
up, for the proposed method three hyperparameters occur: ε ∈ [0, 1],
Δθmax ∈ [0, π] and Δk > 0. For the latter a lower bound can be
determined as Δk > w
d . Then all three hyperparameters are lower
bounded. The choice of ε = 99% as discussed above is reasonable for
an accurate interpolation grid. To account for two operating widths
one may heuristically select
Δk ≍ ⌈ 2w
d ⌉ . Then, only one shaping
hyperparameter, Δθmax ∈ [0, π], remains.
As a proxy for the task of minimising the number of transitions be-
tween headland path and interior lanes the minimisation of the number
of interior lanes, Nl, is selected as the optimisation criterion. This is valid
since for every ﬁeld run every interior lane must typically be covered
exactly once, thus requiring exactly one entrance and one exit
transition from and to the headland path, respectively.
Before discussing data-dependent results for 10 real-world ﬁelds,
the comparative method of ﬁtting straights as interior lanes is
reconsidered.
Remark 1. The method of ﬁtting straights as interior lanes can, in gen-
eral, be regarded as a special case of freeform path ﬁtting. Instead of
selecting a reference path deﬁned by a segment or multiple sequential
location data points along the headland path for the latter scenario, it
is deﬁned by only two points for the former case for the generation of
straight interior lanes. For rectangular ﬁeld shapes this method is opti-
mal. However, for the general case of arbitrarily shaped ﬁelds optimality
of straight interior lanes is not guaranteed. Since the problem class of
straights ﬁtting is included as a subset in the problem class of freeform
path ﬁtting, the latter will always be at least as good as the former for
any objective, including, e.g., minimisation of total accumulated path
length of interior lanes or total travel time along interior lanes. The crit-
ical disadvantage of freeform path ﬁtting is the requirement of at least
one shaping hyperparameter to constrain desired turning or curvatures
of resulting paths. In contrast, for straights ﬁtting no such shaping
hyperparameter is required. Instead, it must solely be accounted for
the physical machine operating width.
3. Numerical results and discussion
The potential of minimising the number of interior lanes by freeform
path ﬁtting is evaluated on a variety of 10 real-world ﬁelds, and com-
pared to the more common technique of ﬁtting straight interior lanes.
For the latter solution, the orientation of straights is also optimised to
minimise the number of interior lanes Nl.
Fig. 4. For very tight angles between headland path and interior lanes undesired hairpin turns may become necessary due to the limited agility of in-ﬁeld operating tractors. The more
transitions between headland path and interior lanes the higher also the probability that such turns may occur, in particular, for complex ﬁelds. This provides the second motivation
for the minimisation of the number of interior lanes by freeform path ﬁtting.

Field data was obtained from satellite images in Google Earth
(http://earth.google.com) by tracking ﬁeld contours and contours of
all in-ﬁeld obstacle areas (such as e.g., tree islands), before exporting
those raw location data points as .kml-ﬁles and feeding it to proposed
algorithm. Fields were selected to emphasize effects of the compared
path ﬁtting methods on a variety of very differently shaped ﬁelds as
well as with and without in-ﬁeld obstacle areas. The latitude and
longitude locations of all ﬁelds are summarized in Table 1, which per-
mits to replicate ﬁeld data. By contacting the author the ,kml-data ﬁles
will also be available upon request.
Field sizes vary between 10.3 ha and 62.9 ha. Results are
summarised in Fig. 6 and Table 2. The following observations are made.
First, savings range from −1 lane to -9 lanes. Percentage-wise, this
implies the number of interior lanes could be reduced by −7% to
Fig. 6. Results for 10 real-world ﬁelds. The assumed operating width is w ¼ 36m. Optimal solutions of ﬁtting straights and freeform paths for the minimisation of Nl are displayed in the left
and right subplot for each ﬁeld, respectively. Axes are denominated in meters. Latitude and longitude of all 10 ﬁelds are summarized in Table 1.

−67% for freeform path ﬁtting in comparison to optimal straights
ﬁtting. Note that for all ﬁelds a large operating width of w ¼ 36 m is con-
sidered. For smaller operating widths savings scale linearly.
Second, while in some scenarios the optimised freeform path plan-
ning is intuitive such as for Field 8, it is surprising in other cases such
as for Field 4. There are also subtle details about the exact optimal length
of reference paths. In general, it therefore seems to be difﬁcult to devise
a reliable rule of thumb to select optimal reference paths. Thus, for gen-
eral ﬁeld shapes it clearly is best to turn to a data-dependent numerical
optimisation method such as the proposed algorithm.
Third, the comparative method of ﬁtting straights as interior lanes is
discussed in more detail. For implementation simplicity it is in general
desired to align straights to an approximately straight and typically
also the longest segment of the ﬁeld contour. For Field 1, Fig. 7 illustrates
the resulting number of interior lanes Nl as a function of the rotation
angle of interior lanes, whereby 0∘ implies a vertical or y-axis aligned in-
terior lane. The minimising solution is obtained for Nl = 14 and is
displayed in Fig. 6. When straight interior lanes were rotated by an
additional 90∘ to obtain alignment with the ﬁeld contour in the north
east, Nl = 17 resulted. Then, savings for freeform path ﬁtting would
amount to −4 lanes and −24%. This underlines the importance of
careful selection of the orientation for straight interior lanes. To stress
this more, when performing the grid search for Field 3 a range of Nl ∈
[13, 33] resulted, i.e., with possible variation of ±20 interior lanes. Fi-
nally, a detail with respect to Fig. 7 is discussed. The lack of exact sym-
metry, for example, visible for rotation angles 40–120∘ and 220–300∘,
is explained by the fact that the ﬁrst interior lane is offset by distance
w from the headland path in the rotated coordinate system. Conse-
quently, a residual distance results at the last othogonal interior lane
with respect to the headland path. Since the ﬁeld shape is not perfectly
symmetric for Field 1, the resulting function in Fig. 7 is also not exactly
repeating with a phase-shift of 180∘.
Fourth, as already pointed out in Remark 1, the strength of freeform
path ﬁtting is its ﬂexibility in that it may (i) be used as a technique to
also optimise alternative objectives besides the number of interior
lanes or to optimise a weighted trade-off among different criteria, and
(ii) that solutions can easily be constrained to limit the desired amount
of steering and to tailor results to the vehicle's agility capabilities. In par-
ticular, for Δθmax = 0 in Eq. (3) the solution of ﬁtting straights as interior
lanes, i.e., the least-steering solution, is recovered.
Ultimately, after having ﬁtted interior lanes within ﬁeld contours
one can on top (i) determine ﬁeld coverage path plans, e.g., according
to the methods in Plessen (2018) and Plessen (2019), before (ii)
smoothing out trajectories by accounting for actuation constraints of
the in-ﬁeld operating vehicle, for example, according to the control
methods in Backman et al. (2012) or Plessen and Bemporad (2017).
The most obvious disadvantage of freeform path ﬁtting is the in-
creased amount of steering that is needed along interior lanes. However,
this is largely relevant only as long as there is a human vehicle driver.
Currrently, such a driver would have to apply signiﬁcantly increased ef-
fort for freeform path tracking. However, for an envisioned future with
fully automated robotic ﬁeld coverage this disadvantage is dismissed.
Because of path-ﬁtting being the foundation for all upstream logisti-
cal optimization layers on top (including routing, trajectory planning
and even multi-robot coordination) the subject of this research is crucial
for the overall optimization of agricultural in-ﬁeld work.
4. Conclusion
This paper contributed to the task of in-ﬁeld path planning within
agricultural ﬁelds by proposing a freeform path ﬁtting method for the
minimisation of the number of transitions between headland path and
interior lanes. Therefore, as a proxy the minimisation of the number of
interior lanes was selected as optimisation criterion. Spatial interpola-
tion distances for pruning during the generation of interior lanes and
constraints for the shaping of freeform paths were discussed. The poten-
tial of minimising the number of interior lanes by freeform path ﬁtting
was evaluated on 10 real-world ﬁelds and compared to the more com-
mon technique of ﬁtting straight interior lanes. Field sizes varied be-
tween 10.3 ha and 62.9 ha with some including in-ﬁeld obstacle areas.
For an operating width of 36 m optimal straights ﬁtting resulted in a
range of between 9 to 39 interior lanes. In comparison, freeform path
ﬁtting resulted in savings in the range of −1 lane to −9 lanes or,
perentage-wise speaking, in a reduction of the number of interior
lanes by −7% to −67%.
This paper focused on the very clear to quantify number of interior
lanes as the optimisation criterion, which served as a proxy for the
minimisation of the number of transitions between headland path and
interior lanes. For future work an alternative objective such as the
total accumulated path length along interior lanes may be considered.
Then, ideally three consecutive layers are evaluated for determining
the optimal grid of interior lanes ﬁtted within ﬁeld contours. These
three layers represent (i) selecting a reference path candidate as partial
segment of the headland path and generating a corresponding grid of
interior lanes as discussed in this paper, (ii) determining a routing solu-
tion for the coverage of all lane segments, before (iii) generating
smoothed out trajectories accounting for agility and actuation con-
straints of the in-ﬁeld operating vehicle, whereby the ﬁnal detailed tra-
jectory must also be planned such as to minimise spraying gaps.
Similarly to as presented in this paper, it must then be iterated over ref-
erence path candidates before the total path length minimising solution
is returned.
