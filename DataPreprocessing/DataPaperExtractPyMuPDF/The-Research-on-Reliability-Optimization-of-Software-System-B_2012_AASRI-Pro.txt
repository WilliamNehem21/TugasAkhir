Abstract 
To deal with the problem of low efficiency and low convergence speed in searching the global optimum, Niche Genetic 
Algorithm was used in reliability optimization of software system. Linear programming works with multi-variable and 
multi-constraint were solved successfully. And also, the searching performance of the genetic algorithms was improved by 
introducing the stochastic tournament model, the uniform schema crossover operator and the non-uniform mutation in the 
genetic algorithm. The simulation results show that the Niche Genetic Algorithm can resolve the multi-module complex 
software system's reliability allocation effectively, which can improve the computing speed and the resolution quality 
effectively.

1.  Introduction 
The original of the Genetic Algorithm is the computer simulation research on biological systems. It was 
put forward by professor J.H.Holland in the university of Michigan in 1960s [1]. Genetic Algorithm is a 
random search technique based on imitating the natural selection, species evolution and population genetics. 
And it is particularly suitable for getting the optimal solution of combinatorial optimization problems [2]. In 
recent years, Genetic algorithm has been applied in many fields and has become an important method of 
researching artificial intelligence and information processing technology [3]. The reliability optimization of

software system, which is also called reliability allocation problem of software system, is to find an optimal 
reliability allocation scheme of software system under the conditions of a certain resource constraints. It 
makes the system obtain the highest reliability. Generally speaking, there are a large number of local extreme 
points. It is difficult to solve the global optimal solution accurately. Many scholars have achieved good results 
in solving the combinatorial optimization problem with intelligent optimization algorithms. But it is still rare 
to see the research on reliability allocation problem of software system with Niche Genetic Algorithm [4]. 
The reliability optimization of software system was researched based on Niche Genetic Algorithm in this 
paper. And it was compared with other heuristic optimization algorithms. The theoretical analysis and 
simulation results show that Niche Genetic Algorithm is suitable for solving reliability allocation problem of 
software system. And also the operating efficiency and the solution quality are improved. 
2.  The analysis of Niche Genetic Algorithm 
In biology, a niche refers to the organizational function or role in a specific environment. Species refer to 
the common features of organization. The organisms tend to live with each other with similar features and 
shapes [5]. The individual process of evolution is put in the same population repeatedly in traditional genetic 
algorithm. With the smoothly genetic exchanging, it is difficult for respective developing of the individual.  
So the diversity of population is reduced. To solve the problem, the individuals in the initial population are 
sorted by fitness value firstly. And the similar individuals evolve independently in the niche. The scale of sub-
population is changing with the parent population. Let N be the scale of parent population, K be the scale of 
sub-population, we must have K=N(D), K is a function of D. It can be set firstly according to the 
characteristics of the problem. D is the variance of the individuals in a population while � is a constant. When 
the diversity decreases, D decreases. When D is less than a threshold �, the sub-population size will reduce to 
the minimum value 2 in order to stimulate the improvement of the diversity of the population.  
3. The reliability allocation model of software system based on the module subsystem 
The reliability can be represented as formula 1 for a software system which has n modules and m 
operations.

In the formula, �  stands for the reliability target of the software system with n modules and m operations. 
That is a combinatorial optimization problem with a linear function and multiple constraints. So Niche 
Genetic Algorithm is imported to solve the engineering problem. 
4. Reliability optimization of software system based on Niche Genetic Algorithm 
The genetic algorithm which simulates biological niche genetic is produced by using the concept of 
niche genetic. The purpose of the algorithm is to form and maintain a variety of sub-populations and do 
parallel search in the search space. It is often used to solve multimodal function, multi-objective optimization 
and simulation of complex systems [6]. Niche Genetic Algorithm simulates the fittest principle of biological 
evolution by maintaining a group of individuals. Repeated selection, crossover and mutation of the individuals 
are carried out until the global optimal solution is obtained. 
4.1. The coding and the generation of initial population 
The primary task of an algorithm is the encoding method. It affects not only the design method of 
crossover operator, mutation operator, but also the convergence speed of the algorithm. The genetic algorithm 
which is based on real-coded is the actual description of the continuous parameter optimization problem. 
There is no binary encoding and decoding process which can greatly increase the efficiency of the algorithm.  
Individual chromosomes are real-coded in genetic algorithm. Each chromosome is represented by 
feasible solution vector

. At the same time, the upper and lower limits can be 
determined by the given constrains. That is the search space. The reliability allocation value can be obtained 
using formula 4 after getting the value of

. And we can calculate the reliability index of the 
whole modules by using formula 4 and formula 5 repeated. 
Cell generation is used in order to make the initial population distribute throughout the solution space. 
First, the whole solution space is divided into N small intervals. M individuals in each small interval are 
generated randomly. Then, an N ×M population is generated. The initial population is evenly distributed 
throughout the solution space by this method. Each individual has a greater probability to participate in the 
algorithm because of the significantly difference between each individual. The system's reliability goals can 
be tested by formula 7. New individuals can be generated until it meets the given constraints. That is to say, 
the cost of the software should be within the specific range and the reliability of the system should achieve the 
given goal.

4.2.  Selection operating 
We use the (� + �) selection strategy in the niche technology. It is considered to be the highest kind of 
selection pressure in evolutionary algorithm between several popular selection mechanisms. The (� + �) 
selection mechanism can produce the fastest local convergence rate when the crossover operator paired in the 
population. The (� + �) selection strategy is to select the � best individuals in the � parent individuals and � 
an individual cross � tall individual. 
Stochastic Tournament Model is selected in this paper. The winners become the next generation of 
individuals by the method of competing. In each generation of groups, K individuals are selected to constitute 
a small group randomly. And then, the fittest individuals are copied to next generation among the K 
individuals. The copy of the individual still returns to the parent groups and participate in the next random 
selection. This kind of selection will repeat M times and produce M next generation of individuals. In the 
method, we usually set K = 2. 
The basic operation is as follows: 
(1) K individuals are selected randomly between the individuals of generation T. 
(2) The fittest individual will enter the generation T+L by comparing the fitness between K individuals. 
And the copy individual will remains in the generation T. 
(3) M individuals can be got by repeating the above two steps M times. 
4.3.  Crossover operating 
The purpose of crossover operating is to do global searching in genetic algorithms. The emergence of 
new excellent genetic model can promote the population and improve the accuracy of reconciliation. 
Uniform Schema Crossover Operator is used in this paper. A random template is produced before the 
crossover operating. The crossover operating will carried out if the gene position of individual is 1. Compared 
to the single point crossover in traditional genetic algorithm, it has greater variation of the area and random 
mutation probability. And thus the search space is more effective and the local search ability is improved.  
The uniform crossover operation is as follows: 
(1) A long and individual encoded string 
L
i
w
�
�
� �
�
1 2 �
�
 is generated randomly. L is the 
individual coding string length. 
(2) Two new offspring A’ and B’ will be produced from A and B generations following the rules.  
If 
�i � 0
, then the gene value in position I of A’ inherits the value of A while the gene value in position 
I of B’ inherits the value of B. 
If 
�i � 1
, then the gene value in position I of A’ inherits the value of B while the gene value in position 
I of B’ inherits the value of A. 
4.4.  The mutation operating 
Mutation operation in genetic algorithm means the gene value of certain genes in the individual is 
replaced by other gene value. The local search ability of genetic algorithm is improved by mutation operation. 
The diversity is maintained and the premature phenomenon is prevented. 
A Nun-Uniform Mutation is used in this paper. It refers to a random perturbation of the original genetic 
value. The new gene value is the result of the disturbance. A slight change in the solution space is made for 
each mutation operation.

It is a combinational optimization problem with one linear objective function and 3n+2 linear constraints. 
N means the number of modules. �i(i=1,2,3) is the failure rate parameter in the modules. That is to say, the 
cost of the software should be minimized in a certain task time. And the reliability of the software should be 
greater than 97.5%. 
The Niche Genetic Algorithm is used in the paper to solve the reliability of the three modules. And it is 
409

compared with the simple genetic algorithm as shown in Table 1. In the simulation, the scale of the population 
is 150. The maximum number of the generations is 500. The crossover probability is 0.98 and the mutation 
rate is 0.01. The approximate optimal solution is: (R1 R2 R3) = (.96879 .98176 0.97965), RS = 0.97642. That 
is the maximum reliability of the software.

6. Conclusions

algorithm in multi-module software system. At the same time, the search ability of genetic algorithm was 
improved by using Stochastic Tournament Model, Uniform Schema Crossover Operator and Non-Uniform 
Mutation. The simulation results show that Niche Genetic Algorithm in solving the multiple modules of 
complex software systems reliability allocation problem was efficient and effective. The next step, we will do 
some research on improving encoding, genetic operators and selection strategies. In short, the reliability of 
software systems based on genetic algorithm optimization problem worthy of further research.
