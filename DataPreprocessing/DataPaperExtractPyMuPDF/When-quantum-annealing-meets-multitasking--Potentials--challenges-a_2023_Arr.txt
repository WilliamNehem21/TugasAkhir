Quantum computers have provided a promising tool for tackling NP hard problems. However, most of the
existing work on quantum annealers assumes exclusive access to all resources available in a quantum annealer.
This is not resource efficient if a task consumes only a small part of an annealer and leaves the rest wasted.
We ask if we can run multiple tasks in parallel or concurrently on an annealer, just like the multitasking
capability of a classical general-purpose processor. By far, multitasking is not natively supported by any of
the existing annealers. In this paper, we explore Multitasking in Quantum Annealer (QAMT) by identifying
the parallelism in a quantum annealer from the aspect of space and time. Based on commercialised quantum
annealers from D-Wave, we propose a realisation scheme for QAMT, which packs multiple tasks into a quantum
machine instruction (QMI) and uses predefined sampling time to emulate task preemption. We enumerate a
few scheduling algorithms that match well with QAMT and discuss the challenges in QAMT. To demonstrate
the potential of QAMT, we simulate a quantum annealing system, implement a demo QAMT scheduling
algorithm, and evaluate the algorithm. Experimental results suggest that there is great potential in multitasking
in quantum annealing.
1. Introduction
In the modern computing era, general-purpose processors, e.g., CPU
and GPU, mostly have multitasking capability. That is, it concurrently
executes multiple tasks over a certain period of time. This can be
realised by either quickly switching between multiple tasks (time-
sharing) or running multiple tasks simultaneously (space-sharing) on a
single processor. Multitasking capability effectively improves processor
resource utilisation.
Quantum annealing is a powerful computing paradigm [1], making
use of adiabatic theory and quantum mechanics to solve combinatorial
optimisation problems. Most of the existing work on existing quantum
annealers assumes that a task occupies the whole annealer exclusively.
If you have multiple tasks, your tasks enter a queue and are executed se-
quentially. A task does not necessarily make good use of all resources in
a quantum annealer. This sequential execution manner causes resource
utilisation problem.
We explore the feasibility of Multitasking in Quantum Annealers
(QAMT). This would improve the resource utilisation of quantum an-
nealers. The capacity of quantum computers has been scaled up several

thousand times in the past two decades. We believe that the need for
QAMT also increases along with the capacity of a quantum annealer.
Time-critical applications such as automation control and autonomous
driving would benefit from QAMT, as the execution time of tasks
is known. Multitasking would also enable virtualisation of quantum
annealers, allowing multiple users to share a quantum annealer without
knowing the existence of other users. The sharing of quantum anneal-
ers would reduce the cost of usage and spark new applications and
opportunities.
Multitasking is not natively supported by existing commercialised
quantum annealing systems. For example, in a D-Wave quantum an-
nealer, an instruction always resets the annealer before executing a
task, such that the task always occupies all resources in the annealer.
There is no scheduling or preemption of tasks according to their priority
in timing. The feasibility of multitasking on existing annealers has not
been explored. To the best of our knowledge, Pelofske et al. [2] is the
only effort that exploits parallelism in quantum annealing. Instantiates
multiple copies of a task so that the annealer can produce multiple

samples at a time and complete the task more quickly. This method
improves resource utilisation but is restricted to a single task.
In this paper, we explore multitasking in Quantum Annealer by
identifying task parallelism in a quantum annealer from the aspect of
space and time. We propose an instruction-based scheme, which emu-
lates multitasking. To our best knowledge, we are the first to explore
the potential of multitasking in quantum annealer. Our contributions
can be summarised as follows.
• We identify task parallelism in a quantum annealer from the as-
pects of space and time. We adapt the concept of task parallelism
and task preemption for use in quantum annealing systems.
• We propose an instruction-based scheme to emulate multitasking.
Several tasks are packed into one instruction to be executed in
parallel. We use predefined sampling periods to emulate task
preemption, which is an integral part of dynamic scheduling.
• To facilitate the research and development of the QAMT schedul-
ing algorithm, we develop a simulator. With the simulator, we
evaluated the performance of a demo scheduling algorithm on a
synthetic dataset. The results suggest great potential of QAMT.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes
the position of this work in the history of the literature. Section 3
defines the model of a task, a processor, and the execution of the
task on the processor. Section 4 defines a multitasking model based on
quantum annealer from a hardware point of view. Section 5 formalises
the QAMT scheduling problem and reviews existing algorithms that
can be adapted for space allocation and time scheduling in QAMT. It
also identifies some possible challenges in QAMT scheduling. Section 6
proposes a simulator and performs experiments to demonstrate the
potential of QAMT. Section 7 draws a conclusion and discusses the
possibility of performing multitasking on other quantum computers.
2. Related work
Classical general-purpose processors, e.g. CPUs, can do multitask-
ing very well. Task parallelism is a well-established research field
based on modern computing architecture design [3,4] and scheduling
algorithms [5,6]. This paper does not propose new classical comput-
ing architectures or new scheduling algorithms for classical comput-
ing architectures. Our focus is on realising task parallelism on an
annealing-based quantum computer.
The typical procedure for solving a problem instance (or a task) on
a quantum annealer is to first represent the instance in the quadratic
unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) [7] format. This is usually
done on the user side. The QUBO problem instance travels through the
local interface or the Internet and reaches the input queue of a quantum
annealer. The quantum annealer processes the task queue sequentially.
When the task is completed, the user fetches the corresponding result.
This exclusive work mode makes sense, since quantum computing
is still in its early research and development stage. Scientists want
full control over the device for experiments and want to make sure
that their experiments are not affected by other users. However, there
are motivations to share resources between multiple tasks. First, as
the manufacturing technique advances, quantum annealers are getting
bigger [8]. A problem instance is less likely to make good use of all
computing resources. Sharing a quantum device to reduce the cost of
usage could be the main motivation of industrial and individual users.
Second, QAMT matches very well with time-critical applications like
automation control and autonomous control, which usually require a
set of tasks with a known execution time.
Parallel quantum annealing [2] addressed the issue of low re-
source utilisation in quantum annealing. The authors instantiate mul-
tiple copies of a problem instance so that an annealer produces more
samples at a time and completes the task faster. Parallel quantum an-
nealing has found its utility in a few applications [9,10]. Niu and Todri-
Sanial [11] is a similar work based on gate-based models, which imple-
ments multiple quantum circuits on one quantum device. Both Pelofske

et al. [2],Niu and Todri-Sanial [11] exploit the parallelism within a
task, but do not cover the switching and scheduling between tasks.
There is also literature [12,13], which sees the quantum computing
system as an accelerator in a modern High-Performance Computing
(HPC) infrastructure. The focus is on the design of architectures and
programming models needed to integrate near-term quantum comput-
ers with supercomputers, and the workflows for potential applications.
In-device task-level parallelism is not their focus.
In this paper, we realise multitasking on a quantum annealer.
We will point out that the existing implementation is not explicitly
designed to share resources among multiple tasks at the same time.
We explore the possibility of carrying out multiple tasks on a quantum
annealer in a time-sharing and space-sharing manner. We demonstrate
the potential of QAMT through simulation-based experiments.
3. Model definition
In this section, we define the task model, processor model, and
execution model for quantum annealing.
3.1. Task model
A quantum annealer solves quadratic unconstrained binary optimi-
sation (QUBO) problems [14]. A task to quantum annealer includes
the problem itself and a few parameters of the annealer. A general
QUBO problem can be expressed as a cost or energy function, as shown
in Eq. (1).
𝙼𝚒𝚗𝚒𝚖𝚒𝚜𝚎 𝑦 = 𝑥𝑡𝑄𝑥
(1)
𝑥 is a binary column vector of length 𝑛. 𝑄 is a 𝑛 × 𝑛 upper triangle
matrix with real value entries. 𝑦 is a scalar that represents the energy
or the cost. 𝑄 is also called the QUBO matrix. The elements on the
diagonal are the weights of the linear terms. The elements off the
diagonal are the weights of the quadratic terms. We can also treat
the QUBO matrix as an adjacency matrix of a graph. Here, we plot a
five-variable QUBO matrix as shown in Fig. 1.
The QUBO matrix is the representation of the problem and is passed
to a quantum annealer to be solved. Apart from the most important
QUBO matrix, a task also includes a few more parameters to solve
the problem on the quantum device. A common but incomplete list
of parameters includes embedding, number of samples, global annealing
control parameters such as annealing time, annealing schedule, and
per-resource annealing control parameters, such as offsets and initial
states.
The ‘‘embedding’’ specifies the mapping between the logical vari-
ables 𝑥 of the QUBO problem and the physical resource units in
the quantum device. Through embedding, we know the number of
resources required for the task. Quantum annealers behave as samplers
that generate independent configurations from Gibbs distributions [15].
The ‘‘number of samples’’ literally means the number of samples re-
quired by the task. According to the extreme value theory, more
samples translate into a better chance of getting promising solutions.
Array 17 (2023) 100282

T. Huang et al.
The amount of time required to generate each sample is determined
by ‘‘Annealing time’’. In addition, there are a few other parameters
that control the annealing process that generate a sample; for example,
the annealing schedule and the delay time (for cooling) are global
settings shared by all resources within a device. Some parameters,
such as annealing offsets and initial states, are on a per-resource basis.
Although the parameters are not designed exclusively for multitasking,
some of them can be revised for our purposes.
Given an annealing task, we know exactly the amount of resources
and the execution time required. This is to be contrasted with a
programming in a classical computing diagram, whose execution path
and memory requirement could vary along with different inputs.
3.2. Processor model
The quantum annealer manufactured by D-Wave is a lattice of
interconnected qubits [16]. Qubit is a quantum version of bit compared
with its classical counterpart that we find in a CMOS circuit, although
its working principle is quite different. Fig. 2(a) shows the topology of
a part of the Chimera architecture that D-Wave released in 2017. Each
node in the figure is a qubit, which is made of a tiny metal coil and
becomes a superconductor and exhibits quantum-mechanical effects
when the temperature is below 9.2 kelvin. A qubit corresponds to a
binary variable in Eq. (1). One can apply a tunable flux bias to each coil.
The strength of a bias to a coil corresponds to a value on the diagonal of
the QUBO matrix. If there is tunable inductive coupling between two
coils, we say that the two qubits are connected. The strength of the
coupling corresponds to the off-diagonal elements of the QUBO matrix.
We refer to the qubits and couplers between them as resources.
If we take a close look at the topology, we would find that the
Chimera architecture consists of unit tiles. Each unit cell is a 𝐾4,4 graph,
i.e., a 4-by-4 complete bipartite graph,1. Chimera has 16 × 16 such
cells. In Fig. 2(a) we only show a 4 × 4 array for simplicity. There are
also connections between cells. Each qubit has two connections to the
qubits of neighbouring cells, except for those on the edge of the array.
Fig. 2(b) shows how a complete graph in Fig. 1 can be embedded
into this sparsely connected topology. Some variables, for example, 𝑥1,
are assigned to two physical qubits. Duplication ensures that all edges
in the original problem can be represented by the device topology. The
resulting QUBO matrix has eight qubits, which have three more qubits
than that of the original problem. Considering that a pair of duplicated
qubits could give different answers, we have to add penalty terms
to the 8 × 8 QUBO matrix so that disagreement between duplicated
qubits is discouraged. The involvement of the duplication is termed as
chain technique by D-Wave. Without the chain technique, the Chimera
architecture cannot even handle a complete graph with three vertices.
Although Chimera has 2048 qubits, the size of a problem that can be
mapped onto the device is usually much smaller than 2048, due to the
limited number of couplers on the device. With the chain technique,
the largest complete graph that can be mapped onto the Chimera
architecture is a 𝐾8 complete graph. One cannot map a 𝐾9 problem
onto Chimera as there are not enough couplers2 to represent all con-
nections in the problem. Given the fact that many permutation-based
combinatorial optimisation problems and machine learning problems
are represented in densely connected graphs or even complete graphs,
a single problem instance is not likely to make full use of all the
computing resources in a quantum annealer.
The mismatch between the task topology and the processor incurs
additional resource consumption. The mismatch is common in real-
world applications. Graph embedding itself is a challenging NP-hard
1 A complete bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into
two subsets, such that no edge has both endpoints in the same subset, and
every pair of vertices in the two subsets are connected with an edge.
2 As we have demonstrated in Fig. 2(a), a qubits only has access to six
couplers, not all 6016 couplers in the whole quantum device.

problem. Not all problems can be mapped onto the quantum device.
The availability of feasible embedding is an integral part of quantum
annealing multitasking.
Due to manufacturing imperfections, not all qubits and couplers are
available to users. For example, Chimera has 2048 qubits and 6016
couplers in its blueprint, but at the time this paper is written, there
are 2041 qubits and 5974 couplers available in the DW_2000Q_6 sys-
tem, which employs the Chimera architecture. The missing qubits and
couplers are distributed throughout the annealing device. We speculate
that some resources are not in working condition and are masked and
hidden from users. Device maintenance could alter the availability of
resources as well. One has to consider defects in graph embedding.
The computing resources in a classical general-purpose processor
are usually quite diversified, such as various arithmetic operators for
integers and floating-point numbers, logic operators, buffers, and data
paths between. But the computing resource in an existing quantum
annealer is just a network of qubits, which provides a premise for
quantum mechanics to play its magic.

QPU) (b) Annealing schedule for the D-Wave 2000Q QPU, showing energy changes as
a function of scaled time. ℏ is the planck constant.
3.3. Execution model
We take the quantum annealers from D-Wave as an example. When
a user submits a task, it reaches the D-Wave system and raises a quan-
tum machine instruction (QMI). Once the execution of the instruction
starts, it cannot be interrupted. Fig. 3(a), shows a series of operations
included in an instruction.
The D-Wave system first pre-processed the QUBO matrix and sent
its values to the Digital Analog Converters (DAC) in the QPU, which
will late drive the tunable bias and couplers in the annealing process.
The blue cycle, called programming, is subdivided into a reset step
that erases the previous data stored in all DACs and a step that
configures some of the DACs. The digital circuit involved generates
heat dissipation, which could affect the subsequent annealing process.
A delay helps the QPU regain the working temperature for annealing.
During the programming cycle, we cannot do annealing due to the heat
dissipation. We refer to the mutual exclusion between programming
cycle and annealing cycle as the blocking feature of programming cycle
in the context of task scheduling.
Next, the QPU repeats the anneal-read cycle and generates samples.
The number of samples to generate is specified by the ‘‘number of
samples’’ in the task. Each cycle consists of an annealing process
(green), a readout (red), and a delay (pink).

The annealing process of a quantum system is where the magic hap-
pens. The operator of the system, or Hamiltonian in Eq. (2), describes
the time evolution of the annealing process. The first term encodes
an equal superposition of all possible answers to the QUBO problem.
The second term encodes the QUBO problem to be solved. In the
annealing process, the quantum system transits slowly from the equal
superposition to a superposition whose state of the lowest possible
energy, a.k.a. the ground state, corresponds to the optimal solution to
the problem. The schedule of the transition, a.k.a annealing schedule, is
controlled by the functions 𝐴(𝑠) and 𝐵(𝑠) of time s, which are illustrated
in Fig. 3(b). According to adiabatic theory, we expect the system to stay
in a low-energy state at the end of the annealing process, allowing it to
read off a low-energy solution to the problem. The readout generates
heat dissipation as well. A subsequent delay helps the quantum system
to regain its working temperature.
Apart from the default geometric annealing schedule demonstrated
in Fig. 3(b), there are other annealing schedules, such as reversing [17,
18], pausing [19], quenching [20], which are all directly applicable to
multitasking, if the tasks share the same annealing schedule.
The annealing schedule is a global setting. The time evolution of
the qubits and couplers follows the same configuration. All anneal-
read cycles in a QMI follow the same configuration. To use a different
annealing schedule, one has to wait until the current QMI completes
and start a new QMI with a different configuration. One can use
annealing time to either squeeze or stretch the annealing schedule,
to make it longer/slower, or shorter/quicker. The annealing time and
delay are also global settings, which is similar to how the annealing
schedule is shared by all the anneal-read cycles. If we want to share
the resources in a device among multiple tasks, these tasks have to
share the same annealing schedule, annealing time, annealing delay
and other global settings. We say that such tasks are compatible with
each other and they belong to a class of tasks.
A user can optionally offset the annealing schedule earlier or later
by using the annealing offset parameter. One can also specify the initial
state of the qubits. Parameters like initial state and annealing offset
are, in their nature, on a per-qubit basis, meaning that qubits can have
a different offset and initial state. The configuration takes effect from
the beginning of a QMI to its end, and cannot be changed halfway.
The length of the programming cycle, indicated by the blue bar in
Fig. 3(a), is problem specific. Empirically we find the length of the
programming cycle is usually capped at about 12 ms. The length of
one annealing process, indicated by a green bar, ranges from 2–2000
μs and is user-specified and independent of the problem. Either the
programming cycle or the annealing cycles could dominate the total
execution time of a QMI,3 depending on the settings of the tasks.
The execution of a program in a classical general-purpose processor
is complicated but under well control. The transition and branching of
digits through various circuit paths are deterministic, observable, and
predictable. But for quantum annealing, the computation is like drop-
ping a ball into an opaque Galton board [21]. Once it enters the board,
the movement of the ball is not observable and non-deterministic. One
can only find the result when the ball hits the button of the board
(corresponding to the readout of a sample).
4. Parallelism
In this section, we describe the potential parallelism in quantum
annealers from the perspective of space sharing and time sharing.

Fig. 4. Space sharing parallelism. These figures are based on the resource map of a
4 × 4 Chimera architecture. Connections between qubits are not shown for simplicity.
We use coloured masks to represent different tasks. If a cell is covered by a mask, it
is occupied by the corresponding task.
4.1. Space sharing
We first discuss parallelism from a space-sharing perspective. The
Quantum Machine Instruction by D-Wave serves well for each task, by
resetting all DACs in an annealer and giving control of all resources
to a task, even if the task only requires a small number of resources.
Fig. 4(a) shows an example. We refer to the array of unit cells as
resource map. The green task only uses one unit cell and leaves the rest
of the resources idle.
Sample Parallelism We can duplicate the green task multiple times
to make full use of the resources, as shown in Fig. 4(b). This can be
achieved by programming all unit cells using the same QUBO matrix
in a single QMI. If the green task requires 256 samples, we can reduce
the anneal-read cycle from 256 down to 16 by using duplication, since
we can generate 16 samples in each cycle. The feasibility of this has
been well discussed in [2]. We refer to this as sample parallelism.
Sample parallelism has its advantages. Since all duplicated instances
come from the same task, these instances share almost the same param-
eters and are mostly compatible with each other. The only non-trivial
effort is to embed multiple instances onto the device. The feasibility of
duplicating a task is based on the assumption that the annealer employs
a homogeneous topology globally so that the embedding can be easily
applied to different parts of the annealer.
Task Parallelism We can also run multiple tasks simultaneously on
a quantum annealer. This can be achieved by fitting the embeddings
of multiple tasks into a resource map and programming the annealing
device accordingly. The fitting of embeddings is a variation of the bin-
packing problem, which will be discussed in Section 5.2. Fig. 4(c) shows
an example of task parallelism. The three tasks are just about right to
fit in the annealer, make full use of the resources, and receive samples
simultaneously. This potentially allows a microsecond-level of real-time
response to multiple tasks. The response is gradually optimised as the
annealer generates more samples.
The hard limitation of task parallelism comes from the compatibility
between tasks. As we have mentioned in Section 3, a configuration is
taking effect across the entire QMI and over the entire QPU. If two
tasks run in parallel, they must use the same annealing parameters
that are shared globally. We observe that default parameter settings
provided by the vendor of annealing systems (e.g. D-Wave) usually
work well on various kinds of problem and thus lead to the chances of
two tasks sharing the same annealing parameters [22–24]. For example,
the annealing schedule is the critical setting of an annealing process.
The geometric annealing schedule in Fig. 3(b) is sophisticated enough
to handle various problems [25]. In addition, instances of the same
problem are more likely to share the same annealing schedule. As the
manufacturing technique advances, we believe that we will have more
independent control over the annealing process for individual tasks.
Task Parallelism + Sample Parallelism We can have task paral-
lelism and sample parallelism at the same time. This is useful twofold.
First, some tasks could have higher priority over others. We can du-
plicate such tasks multiple times for expedition purposes. Second,
sometimes an embedding comes with an irregular shape. Having such
a task in the annealer results in an irregular-shaped idle space. One can
use tasks with small and regular-shaped embedding to fill the irregular
space and improve resource utilisation. Fig. 4(d) shows an example.
The cyan task takes 2 × 3 unit cells and leaves a space of 1 × 2 unit
cells. Neither the yellow nor the blue task fit into this area. We can use
the green task to fill it.
4.2. Time sharing
We also discuss parallelism from the time-sharing perspective. The
current implementation of the D-Wave annealing system does not
support the suspension and resumption of tasks. A series of tasks are
getting sequentially executed. A task has to wait until the ones before
it are all finished, even if it comes with a higher priority. In Fig. 5,
we assumes the length of a programming cycle takes 10 ms and one
annealing cycle takes 2 ms. As shown in Fig. 5(a). Yellow, blue, and
green tasks are available at 0 ms, 20 ms, and 40 ms. The green one has
to wait until the previous tasks are complete.
Non preemptive We can reduce the response time by carrying out
available tasks in parallel, in a non-preemptive manner. Response time
refers to the period between the appearance and the completion of a
task. Fig. 5(b) shows an example of non-preemptive task parallelism.
Since the red and yellow tasks are both available at 0 ms, we can start
the execution of these two tasks at the same time. The blue task is
available at 20 ms but has to wait, since the red and yellow task is
still running. After the first two tasks are complete, the blue and green
tasks start in parallel and run accordingly.
Preemptive We can reduce wait time by starting a task as soon
as it becomes available in the scheduling queue. Fig. 5(c) shows an
example of preemptive task parallelism. The red and yellow tasks start
in parallel, as is usually the case. When the blue task is available at
20 ms, we force a stop to the red and yellow tasks and perform device
programming for the first three tasks. They run in parallel for another
10 ms, and then the green task kicks in and forces a stop. This time only
the red task is affected since the yellow and blue tasks are complete.
Preemptive task parallelism + sample parallelism With the
schedule that incorporates preemptive task parallelism and sample
parallelism, we can bring earlier the finish time of tasks. Fig. 5(d) shows
an example of preemptive task parallelism and sample parallelism. We
start the red and yellow tasks and duplicate them to make full use of
the annealer. The blue and green tasks can start immediately when they
are available. The Average-case Execution Time (ACET) and Worst-case
Execution Time (WCET) are reduced, compared with non-preemptive
and preemptive scheduling.

resources are divided into four equal-sized partitions, parts 1 4. We have four tasks
with equal-sized QUBO matrices. The number of samples required by the tasks is 15,
10, 5, and 5 respectively. The availability of the tasks are at 0 ms, 0 ms, 20 ms and
40 ms, respectively.
5. Scheduling
Section 4 describes the potential parallelism in a quantum an-
nealer. This section discuss how to realise the parallelism given various
constraints/limitations of a quantum annealer, that is a scheduling
problem. The time and space sharing representation in Section 4 de-
picts the parallelism naturally and is widely adopted by literature
related to classical processors. But it fails to capture the important
constraints/limitation that are unique in QAMT scheduling (QAMTS).
For example, Fig. 4 does not emphasise that all space-sharing tasks must
share the same global settings of the annealing process, i.e., the class
constraints that we mentioned in Section 3.3. Fig. 5 does not emphasise
that programming cycle and annealing cycle never go in parallel,
i.e. the blocking feature that we mentioned in Section 3.3. Additionally,
the concept of preemption mentioned in Section 4 is not natively sup-
ported by the quantum annealer. Many of these constraints/limitations
are unique to QAMTS and are not commonly seen in the scheduling
Fig. 6. Quantum Annealing Multitasking Scheduling (QAMTS) problem as a three-
dimensional class constrained rack packing (3DCCRP) problem. This is a side view
of the three-dimensional problem.
problems on classical processors. In this section, we first present the
formal definition of QAMTS. Based on the generalised definition, we
present the challenges raised by the constraints/limitations and name
a few potential ways of tackling the challenges.
5.1. 3D class-constrained rack packing problem
First we want to formalise the QAMT Scheduling (QAMTS) problem.
We see the three-dimensional class-constrained rack packing problem
(3DCCRP) as the best match to QAMTS. It is a variant of strip pack-
ing problem with three dimensional space, class constraint and shelf
divisions [26]. In reality, we can find similar application of 3DCCRP,
e.g., packing as many items as possible onto a rack in a grocery with
the constraint that irrelevant items do not sit on the same division.
This resembles the problem of maximising resource utilisation of a QPU
given a period of time. But in this paper, we have a slightly different
goal, which is to minimise the makespan of a given set of tasks. This is
equivalent to minimising the height of the rack given a set of items.
We are given some cuboid items  = {𝑡1, … , 𝑡𝑖, … , 𝑡| |}. Each item
𝑡𝑖 has a class attribute 𝑐𝑖, and a dimension of length 𝑙𝑖, width 𝑤𝑖 and
height ℎ𝑖. We are also given a cuboid rack with unlimited height.
Shelves (wide and flat boards) are installed horizontally in the rack.
Each shelf has a dimension of length 𝐿, width 𝑊 and height ℎ𝑝. We
pack items into the rack by partitioning all items into subsets  =
{𝐼1, … , 𝐼𝑗, … , 𝐼||}, such that items in the same subset share the same
class. We must ensure that the arrangement of items in any subset 𝐼𝑗 is
not overlapped, not stacked, and is bounded by 𝐿×𝑊 . We add/remove
shelves to ensure a one-to-one mapping between subsets and shelves.
We can also adjust the position of shelves along the height such that
the distance between two adjacent shelves equals the height of the
tallest item in a corresponding subset. The goal is to find an optimised
partition ̃ such that the height of the rack 𝐻 = ∑
𝐼𝑗∈ ̃
(
ℎ𝑝 + max𝑖∈𝐼𝑗 ℎ𝑖
)
is minimised. In a canonical problem setting, we may have the follow-
ing assumptions. The orientation of items is fixed, i.e., they cannot be
flipped or rotated. The edges of the items are parallel to those of the
rack. An atomic property applies to all items so that each individual
cannot be divided into smaller parts.
The above definition corresponds to the non-preemptive task par-
allelism introduced in Section 4. We can find some correspondences
between QAMTS and 3DCCRP. We plot Fig. 6 to facilitate the under-
standing of QAMTS. An item corresponds to an annealing task. 𝑙𝑖 × 𝑤𝑖

describes the shape of the task embedding. ℎ𝑖 represents the time of
sampling. By comparing the class attribute of tasks, we know the com-
patibility between them. Items in a subset are tasks combined in a QMI.
Multiple tasks can be combined in a QMI and share a programming
cycle, as long as they are compatible, and their embeddings can be
fit into a resource map without overlapping. A shelf corresponds to
the programming cycle of a QMI, shared by multiple tasks. Device
programming takes time, which is expressed as the height of a shelf
ℎ𝑝. The execution time of a QMI 𝐼𝑗 is determined by the time for
programming ℎ𝑝 and the longest sampling time max𝑖∈𝐼𝑗 ℎ𝑖. The height of
the rack 𝐻 corresponds to the total execution time of all QMIs, which is
a representative metric that indicates the performance of a scheduling
algorithm.
3DCCRP naturally reflects the mutual exclusion between program-
ming and annealing cycles, as items are never overlapped with shelves.
The class constraint also captures the restriction on the tasks combined
in a QMI. We do not find similar settings in the scheduling problems
on classical processors. 3DCCRP can be seen as a generalised problem
setting for QAMTS, as it is a minimal set of constraints that realise
multitasking on quantum annealing. One can find its variants by adding
more constraints or giving different objectives. In reality, we can have
many opportunities and challenges in optimising the performance of a
QAMTS algorithm. We discuss these opportunities and challenges from
the aspect of space and time.
5.2. Space allocation
We refer to Space Allocation as assigning resources from a resource
map to a task without taking sampling time into account. To embed
a task into an annealing device, a conventional way is to use ‘‘minor
embedding’’ algorithms, such as Yang and Dinneen [27], which finds
a ‘‘minor’’ of an architecture graph that matches the task graph. Minor
embedding itself is an NP-hard combinatorial optimisation problem
and could take hundreds of seconds to embed a graph with a hundred
qubits onto a quantum annealing device. It is impractical for a real-time
QAMTS algorithm to find embedding immediately in the presence of a
new incoming task since the typical sampling time of a task is usually
below a second. Instead, we may ask a user to provide a ready-to-use
embedding along with the task so that we can adapt the embedding
to the target devices. This is possible if the target device employs a
regular structure in its graph topology. Thanks to the unit-tile design in
D-Wave quantum annealing devices [28], we can shift an embedding
along length and width to find a patch of available resources for the
task.
3DCCRP assumes that the orientation of an item is fixed, i.e., one
can only shift the item along length and width. But for QAMTS we
can make other transformations to a task embedding. D-Wave Chimera
architecture, as shown in Fig. 2(a), has a regular structure, that is,
unit tiles of 𝐾4,4 graphs [28]. Given an embedding in this topology,
we can find a few transformations that remain to be an embedding in
the same topology. Transformations include a cell-aligned shift, a flip
along length and width, and a rotation of 90,180,270 degrees along
height. The regular structure in the topology gives us more flexibility
in the arrangement of tasks, such that we can combine more tasks into
a QMI and improves resource utilisation.
We employ alignment of task embedding along the boundary of
unit tiles. This is to avoid cross-talk between tasks. Harris et al. [29],
Zaborniak and de Sousa [30] suggest that several mechanisms con-
tribute to crosstalk with adjacent qubits through couplers, which scale
inversely with the distance in between. There is usually a dense ar-
rangement of qubits and couplers within a unit tile [28], compared with
those between tiles. Aligning embeddings along the border of unit tiles
would eliminate suspectable crosstalk between tasks. Additionally, this
alignment would also simplify the referencing of resources. One can
just use one ID to represent a group of qubits and couplers. In the case
of D-Wave Chimera architecture, this refers to a 𝐾4,4 graph.
Resource utilisation is a typical metric for evaluating the quality
of a space allocation. Within the scope of space allocation, we define
it as the ratio between the unit cells used and the total unit cells
available in the device. The time used to find a space allocation should
also be considered an important metric. Find and reuse embeddings
are at the opposite end of the speed spectrum of space allocation
algorithms. There are a few algorithms that can fit 2D items in a
container, most of which have a focus on resource utilisation. For
example, Next-fit decreasing-height (NFDH), First-fit decreasing-height
(FFDH) Best-fit decreasing-height (BFDH) [31] and meta-heuristic al-
gorithms [32]. As the annealing system becomes larger and more
complicated, we can also borrow ideas and algorithms from memory
management systems [33] to facilitate resource management.
5.2.1. Resource fidelity and availability
Due to the limitations in existing design and manufacturing technol-
ogy, there is a mismatch between an intended problem and one that is
actually implemented on a quantum annealing device [34]. Through
characterisation, verification, and validation tools for quantum anneal-
ing (QAVV) [35], one can find that some resources have higher fidelity
than others in a quantum computer. We would expect better results
from the placement of a task in a high-fidelity area. In a fidelity-aware
QAMTS, we can use QAVV tools to obtain a profile of the fidelity of
resources and allocate tasks accordingly.
Apart from the fidelity issue, manufacturing defect also leads to a
gap between the original architecture design and the actual resource
available in an annealing device, which we have already described in
Section 3.2. A QAMTS algorithm should also be aware of the avail-
ability and handle the manufacturing defect in quantum annealers
accordingly.
5.2.2. Fragmentation
Task embedding sometimes does not come in regular shape, e.g.
rectangular of equal size. If we try to pack these irregular shapes into
a rectangular resource map, we are very likely to find gaps between
task embeddings that are too small to fit an additional task. We refer
to these unusable idle resources as fragmentation for QAMTS. This is
similar to fragmentation in a memory management system [36], where
fragments of free memory space are seen as wasted resources.
Although it is quite challenging to collect and reuse 2D fragments in
QAMTS, we see potential in exploiting fragmentation in the mitigation
of resource availability issues mentioned in Section 5.2.1. Since the
fragments cannot be reused for other tasks anyway, we can provide a
patch of resources in regular shape, which is larger than the embedding.
These additional resources can be seen as ‘‘internal fragmentation’’ in a
memory management system [37]. We ask users to provide a regular-
shaped embedding that includes the additional resources as a reserved
backup. By reserving some qubits and couplers in every unit tile, we
can use the backup as an alternative to the missing qubits and couplers
in the resource map.
In a memory management system, ‘‘External Fragmentation’’ [38]
is observed when the memory is allocated in a large number of non-
sequential blocks with gaps and cannot be used for a new allocation
that requires a large continuous chunk of memory. External fragmen-
tation issue accumulates in a classical computing paradigm, but is so
far not a challenge for existing quantum annealing devices. This is
because a QMI always start with resetting the whole annealer. Partial
device programming is not supported at the moment this paper is
written. One can always re-arrange the layout of task embeddings at
the beginning of each QMI to merge some of the external fragments.
On the other hand, we witness the progress in architecture design
for quantum annealing [28], which is constantly reducing the cost of
programming. Theoretically, partial device programming generates less
heat dissipation than its global counterpart does, and it is a favourable
choice for a superconducting computer that works in extremely low
temperatures. We believe that the external fragmentation issue would
increase along with the availability of partial device programming.

5.3. Time scheduling
Compared with the space allocation mentioned in Section 5.2,
the time scheduling aspect of QAMTS emphasises timely execution of
the tasks. The response time, that is, the time from the start of the
execution of a task to its completion, is one of the most important
performance metrics. Statistics, such as the average-case execution time
(ACET) and the worst-case execution time (WCET) are widely adopted
in the literature [39–41]. For QAMTS, we also value initial waiting
time (IWT) [42], i.e., the time from the appearance to the start of
execution. We can use the average-case initial waiting time (ACIWT)
and the worst-case initial waiting time (WCIWT) to evaluate a QAMTS
algorithm.
Due to differences in the sampling time of tasks, the utilisation of
resources of a QMI could be restricted. Fig. 6 shows an example. Tasks
5–8 are of the same class and can be combined into one QMI. Task
5 requires a longer sampling time (or larger height) than others. The
sampling time of the QMI should be no shorter than that of task 5.
This results in some waste of resources assigned to tasks 6–8, illustrated
as the space between these tasks and the programming cycle after
them. We can mitigate this resource utilisation issue by dividing a
task in sampling time. For example, in Fig. 6 task 10 is divided into
two segments and is scheduled in two QMIs. This is similar to task
scheduling on a classical computer, where a scheduler can suspend a
task and resume the execution later. We can also expedite a task by
instantiating it multiple times in a QMI. For example, we have three
copies of task 9 in the same QMI.
5.3.1. Static and dynamic scheduling
In a static scheduling, a scheduler has the knowledge of tasks, as
well as sufficient time to find an optimal schedule of tasks. If the static
schedules are used in a recurring situation, e.g., periodic tasks, then it
makes sense to use the time-demanding minor embedding algorithms
to find an optimised allocation of the resource to the tasks. Otherwise,
many of the bin packing algorithms mentioned in Section 5.2 can also
be repurposed for static scheduling, if we extend these algorithms to
3D space and treat the third dimension as time.
For dynamic scheduling, a processor does not know about a task
before its presence. This includes the time of arrival, sampling time,
the shape of embedding, other annealing-related parameters, and user-
specified priority. The situation is similar to what a modern OS sched-
uler is facing. Classical scheduling algorithms, such as First-Come First-
Served (FCFS), Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) and Round Robin (RR) [43] are
potential candidates for the time scheduling aspect of QAMTS. The time
consumption of a QAMTS algorithm should be shorter than or at least
comparable to the time of a QMI, which ranges from a few μs to one
second4.
5.3.2. Emulating preemption
We see task preemption (or context switching) as an integral part
of dynamic scheduling. A scheduler on a general-purpose classical
processor can temporarily interrupt an executing task and resume it
at a later time. There is usually dedicated hardware mechanism that
support the switches between tasks [44]. However, a QMI in D-Wave
annealer is, by its nature, non-preemptive. There is no hardware for
switching annealing tasks. A QMI can last a long time. There is no way
for an urgent task to preempt the next time slice occupied by another
task.
We emulate annealing task preemption by breaking a long-running
task into a sequence of short segments, such that other prioritised tasks
can interrupt them. From the QMI point of view, this translates to
imposing a short run-time limit on individual QMIs. For example, a
4 D-Wave limits the run-time of QPU tasks to one second. A QMI longer
than one second will be divided into a few shorter QMIs.
Fig. 7. QAMT Simulator.
scheduler can split a QMI with 1000 annealing cycles into a queue of
10 QMIs with 100 annealing cycles and execute them sequentially. At
the presence of another prioritised task, the scheduler cannot pause the
QMI under execution, but can insert the QMI of the new task to the
head of the queue.
The emulation of task preemption introduces additional costs in the
programming cycles. The choice of the run-time limit plays a trade-off
between timing and resource utilisation. In practise, we can relate the
run-time limit to the sampling time required by the tasks in a QMI to
play a balance between timing and resource utilisation.
6. Simulation
We develop an event-based QAMTS simulator5 in Python that serves
as a platform to evaluate scheduling algorithms for QAMT. Fig. 7 shows
the diagram of the simulator. It takes a series of tasks as input. A
QAMT scheduler combines one or multiple tasks into an instruction.
The scheduler may consider the status of the annealer when translating
tasks into instructions. The instructions are fed into an annealer and
executed sequentially. We will disclose the source code of the simulator
to the public online.
6.1. QAMT scheduling: A demo
To demonstrate the potential of QAMT, we use the simulator to
carry out a few experiments. We simulate a D-Wave Chimera archi-
tecture, which employs 16 × 16 𝐾4,4 graph unit tiles, and assume that
all resources are available and of identical fidelity. For the task dataset,
we randomly generate a set of 100 tasks. We assume that all tasks are
available at the start of the simulation. The size of embedding follows
a uniform distribution between 1 × 1 and 12 × 12, with a maximum
difference of 2 between the number of rows and columns. The number
of samples follows a uniform distribution between 100 and 1000. The
distribution of these random numbers is independent. All tasks use
100 μs annealing time and a default geometric annealing schedule. We
use random seeds to control the generation process of the dataset. All
results presented in this section are statistics on ten different random
seeds.
We implement a demo QAMT scheduling algorithm, which employs
preemptive task parallelism and sample parallelism. The algorithm is
based on Next-fit decreasing size of embedding (NFDE). Given a series
of tasks and a QMI, it sorts tasks according to the size of embeddings
in descending order and fits tasks into the resource map in the QMI
until there is not sufficient room for any additional tasks. The algorithm
then starts with a new QMI and tries to fit the rest of the tasks into the
QMI. The algorithm repeats until all tasks are fitted. To emulate task
preemption, we set the sampling time of each QMI to that required by
the task with the largest embedding in that QMI. We use the demo

2510.000 ms±367.902 ms total execution time,6 with a resource utilisa-
tion of 49.70%±2.43% on our synthetic dataset. This is to be contrasted
with 6857.000ms±193.393 ms and 18.07%±1.73% achieved by a naive
scheduling algorithm, where the resources are assigned to each task
exclusively and executed sequentially. The resource utilisation we use
in this section considers both space and time aspects. It is defined as the
total size of embedding required by all tasks over some time divided
by all resources available in that period. We only see sampling as an
effective use of resources. Resource utilisation can be infinitely close
to, but never reaches, 100%, due to the existence of programming
cycles. In our experimental settings, we assume a fixed cost of 12 ms
for programming time and a sampling time range of 10–100 ms for
all tasks. One can achieve better resource utilisation by increasing the
sampling time if timely executions of tasks are not so critical.
We evaluate the demo scheduling algorithm from the timing of
tasks, which is shown in Fig. 8. We include three kinds of timing,
Initial Waiting Time, Response Time, and Execution Time. We observe
that tasks with larger embeddings have a longer annealing time. This
makes sense because fitting large embeddings into a resource map is
more challenging. We have already assigned higher priority to large
embeddings, which otherwise would suffer a longer initial waiting
time. Tasks with a large embedding have shorter execution times,
which is a manifest of their priority over smaller ones. We set the
sampling time of each QMI to be that of the task with the largest
embedding. This is likely to divide other small-embedding but sample-
demanding tasks into segments, which would be scheduled in later
QMIs. Response time is the sum of the initial wait time and execution
time. In general, response time scales along with the increase in the
size of the embedding.
We also evaluate the speed of the Python implementation of the
demo scheduling algorithm, whose performance is shown in Fig. 9.
The complexity of the demo scheduler scales with the number of tasks
to be scheduled and scales with the amount of resources required
by these tasks. At the beginning of the simulation, all 100 tasks are
available to the scheduler. The total amount of resources required by
the 100 tasks is roughly equivalent to 25-annealers worth of resources,
which corresponds to the upper limit of 𝑥-axis in the figure. As more

in the timing of tasks.

required by tasks and the amount of time to produce a QMI. X axis represents the
total size of embedding of the tasks. Y represents the time in seconds.

tasks are getting fulfilled, the time to produce a QMI decreases. On
average, the scheduler takes 20.160 ms to produce one QMI; this is
to be compared with the running time of a QMI, which ranges from
12+10 to 12+100 ms.
7. Conclusion and discussion
In this paper, we explore the possibility of implementing multitask-
ing in quantum annealing systems. We compare the difference between
quantum annealing systems and classical computing systems. We dis-
cuss the feasibility of task parallelism from the aspect of space and
time and discuss existing algorithms that can be adapted to scheduling
and challenges in scheduling. We also develop a simulator to facil-
itate research on QAMT scheduling and demonstrate the capability
of preemptive task parallelism + sample parallelism on a synthetic
dataset.
While we are taking D-Wave Chimera topology as a case study
and exploring the potential of multitasking, the idea of QAMT can
also be applied to more advanced topologies, such as D-Wave Pegasus
topology [45] and D-Wave Zephyr topology [46]. A Pegasus topology
is consisted of 16 × 16 Pegasus unit cells, each of which contains 24
qubits. Zephyr topology, as the next generation topology, is an array

of (2𝑛 + 1) × (2𝑛 + 1) Zephyr unit cells, each of which has 16 qubits.
𝑛 is a positive integer. The ‘‘array of unit cells’’ design methodology
prevails in D-Wave. As we employ alignment of task embedding along
the boundary of unit cells, QAMT is directly applicable to quantum
computing platforms that adopt this design methodology. We will
demonstrate the utility of QAMT on the advanced architecture in our
future work.
Apart from annealing-based quantum computers, we also see po-
tential in gate-based quantum computing systems as well. Due to the
limitations in existing manufacturing techniques, the probability of de-
coherence increases rapidly as the scale of a quantum circuit increases.
This limits the size of a practical quantum circuit and puts a restriction
on the resource utilisation of universal quantum computers. One way
is to share a quantum computer among multiple quantum circuits [11].

Appendix. Visualisation tools
To facilitate the development and evaluation of various scheduling
algorithms, we implemented a few visualisation tools along with the
simulator. These tools inspect scheduling from a space allocation and
time scheduling point of view.
Fig. 10 shows the allocation of space produced by the demo schedul-
ing algorithm. This space allocation belongs to the first QMI in a
simulation, where the scheduler is faced with 100 tasks. Although tasks
with small embeddings have a lower priority in scheduling, they can
easily fit into the gap between those tasks with large embeddings.
Fig. 11 shows the timing aspect of tasks achieved by the demo
schedule. We observe that resource utilisation is low in the second
half of the scheduling. This is because the remaining tasks have very
large embeddings, such that the demo scheduler cannot find a resource-
efficient combination. Tasks with small embedding stand a better
chance of getting fitted and have already been mostly completed in the
first half of the schedule. As we have a uniform distribution in the size
of embedding, low resource utilisation in the second half is inevitable.
One may argue that some of the bars, for example, the one at 1.7×106,
only take very few amounts of resources and can be combined with
other QMIs for better resource utilisation. This is not feasible as those
short bars represent 2D geometries, which do not necessarily fit into
one resource map.

Y axis is the resource utilisation in percentage. Each vertical bar represents a QMI.
There is always a grey edge to the left of each bar, which represents the programming
stage of it. A long vertical bar splits into a few segments. The vertical length of each
segment represents the percentage of resources occupied by a task in that QMI.
