Physical land suitability assessment is a prerequisite for enhancing yield production and enables the agricultural
communities to use the right place for the right crops. Maize is one of stable one food crops of Ethiopia and cul-
tivated in three agroecological zones: highland, midland and lowlands. Despite these facts, maize yield is very
low due to a lack of knowledge and information gaps on land suitability. Physical land suitability for maize culti-
vation is essential to minimize the problem of food security. The present study aims to identify the potential land
suitability for maize production in the Didessa watershed, Western Ethiopia using Multi-Criteria Evaluation
(MCE) and geospatial technologies. Land use land cover (LULC) change, climate, topography, soil, and infrastruc-
ture facilities were considered for maize land suitability assessment. The MCE based pairwise comparison matrix
was applied to estimate land suitability for maize crop cultivation. The results showed that, about 977.7 km2
(14.1%) is highly suitable, 4794.9 km2(69.1%) is moderately suitable while 1118.8 km2 (16.1%), and 51.5 km2
(0.7%) of the study area were categorized under marginally and not suitable for maize production, respectively.
This research provides crucial information for decision making organs and the farming community to utilize
potential areas for maize cultivation.

1. Introduction
At global level about 1, 162 million tons of maize are produced in
2020 (Solanki et al., 2020). Maize production in the world increased
from 313 million tonnes in 1971 to 1162 million tonnes in 2020,
which indicates an increment by 3.07% per year (Nyagumbo et al.,
2016). Agriculture is the backbone and the major source of income in
Ethiopia (Berhanu and Poulton, 2014; Headey et al., 2014). Maize farm-
ing is widely practiced in many regions of Ethiopia (Kassie et al., 2015).
It is widely cultivated for commercial beneﬁt not only in Ethiopia, but
also at global level (Linda et al., 2015; Habibie et al., 2019). Despite
this, some people are unable to eat because of a lack of food (Regassa
and Stoecker, 2012; Mota et al., 2019). In poor nations such as
Ethiopia, the inability to exploit existing technologies for yield develop-
ment results in low maize yield (Asfaw et al., 2012; Abate et al., 2019).
Low yield harvesting is results in food shortage caused by a lack of tech-
nological access have been reported in the country (Bewket, 2007; Dijk
et al., 2020).
Around the late 17th century, maize crops were introduced in
Ethiopia (Huffnagel, 1961; Abate et al., 2015). In Ethiopia, maize is cul-
tivated in highland, midland, and lowland agro-ecological zones (Elias
et al., 2013; Tessema and Simane, 2019; Dendir and Simane, 2019).
Increasing agricultural output through the use of innovative crop
types and farm inputs in Ethiopia is gaining traction (Tamene et al.,
2017; Sime and Aune, 2018; Silva et al., 2021). Apart from using better
varieties and agricultural inputs, determining the appropriateness of a
given parcel of land before investing in agriculture can help maximize
the use of existing land resources (Ahamed et al., 2016). Land suitability
assessment is very crucial for land use planning (Vasu et al., 2018;
Habibie et al., 2019; Mehrjardi et al., 2020; Al-Taani et al., 2021). Despite
its relevance, land suitability evaluation for maize production has re-
ceived little attention in the country as a whole and in the study area
speciﬁcally. In Ethiopia, some research has been conducted on the phys-
ical suitability of land for maize production (Girma et al., 2015; Alemu
and Worku, 2017; Debesa et al., 2020). Biophysical parameters such as

climate (rainfall and temperature), soil, land use, and elevation were in-
cluded in prior studies. However, the land surface temperature (LST)
was not considered in physical land suitability assessment in the previ-
ous research. Thus, this research intended to incorporate the LST as a
physical land suitability determining criterion.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Descriptions of the study area
This study was conducted in Didessa watershed in western parts of
Ethiopia. Geographically, Didessa watershed is located between 7°49′
30″ to 8°54′30”N and 36°1′00″ to 37°6′00″E (Fig. 1). The topography of
the Didessa watershed ranges from 1354 m to 3154 m above mean
sea level. The watershed covers a total area of 6942.9 km2.
2.1.1. Climate
The study area received maximum amount rainfall during the sum-
mer season (June to September). Study conducted by Wedajo et al.
(2019) in Didessa River sub basin indicates that the average minimum
and maximum temperature is 13 °C, and 26.5 °C, respectively. Other
study by Gemeda et al. (2021) at Bedele station, which is located within
the Didessa River sub-basin found that the mean minimum and maxi-
mum temperature is about 11.9 °C, and 26.2 °C, respectively.
2.1.2. Soil types
The study area has a large variety of soil types. Among the existing
soil types, Haplic Alisols was the most dominat which covers an area
of 4235.7 km2 (61.0%) and the least dominated soil type was Rhodic
Nitisol with an area of 518.6 km2 (7.5%).
2.2. Data sources and descriptions
Landsat images of OLI/TIRS 2020 were downloaded from U.S. Geo-
logical Survey (USGS) website (https://www.usgs.gov/) for Land use
land cover (LULC) classiﬁcation. Climate data was obtained from Na-
tional Meteorological Agencies (NMA) of Ethiopia while soil data was
obtained from Ministry of Water and Irrigation Engineering (MoWIE)
and elevation data was extracted from ASTER DEM (Table 1; Fig. 2).
2.3. Data analysis
2.3.1. Rainfall
Rainfall data of four stations from near and within Didessa water-
shed namely Gimbi, Nekemte, Bedele and Arjo were obtained from
Fig. 1. Location map of the study area.

Ethiopian National Meteorological Agency. We interpolated the climate
data of four stations using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) tech-
niques to obtain annual rainfall data for areas using stations in and
around the study area. This annual rainfall was interpolated with a 30
m resolution and then extracted to the study area.
2.3.2. Land surface temperature
In the present study, the LST was retrieved from the thermal bands
of the Landsat OLI/TIRS of 2020 (Adeola et al., 2017). The mono window
algorithm was applied to retrieve LST from the thermal bands of the OLI/
TIRS images. Accordingly, LST was retrieved from Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS)
with thermal bands of band 10 used by mono-window algorithm fol-
lowing (Guo et al., 2020; Sekertekin and Bonafoni, 2020). Digital num-
ber (DN) was converted to the spectral radiance of thermal bands of
Landsat TIRS (Dener and Alves, 2016; Ziaul and Pal, 2018).
Consequently, LST was estimated using the brightness temperature of
the two bands of thermal infrared, mean and difference in land surface
emissivity (Cheng et al., 2015).
Step 1: Conversion of digital numbers to top of atmosphere (TOA)
spectral radiance
Thermal data in the Landsat sensor and deliver a manner of signify-
ing pixels are stored in a digital number that has not yet been calibrated
and converted into radiance units (Aik et al., 2020; Moisa et al., 2022)
using (Eq. (1)).

Step 3: Land surface emissivity estimation using NDVI
The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was utilized to
classify the distributions of vegetation cover as well as their greenness.
As a result, as a viable basis function, it investigates the transformation
of NDVI into values related to the cover part by utilizing empirical cor-
relations with vegetation indices (Tomar et al., 2013). NDVI calculation
is critical for determining the proportion of vegetation (PV). Further-
more, emissivity (ε), which is linked to PV, should be determined
(Eq. (3)).
NDVI ¼ NIR−R
NIR þ R
ð3Þ
where
NDVI ¼ is the normalized difference vegetation index
NIR ¼ is the near infrared band and R is the red band
Landsat 8 uses Band 5 (Infrared) and 4 (Red) to estimate the NDVI
values. After NDVI estimated, the proportion of vegetation was calcu-
lated, which indicates the land surface emissivity.

2.3.3. Elevation
The ASTER DEM with 30 m resolution downloaded from USGS
website (https://www.usgs.gov/) and used to obtain the altitude
(meter). From this organization we extract the topography of the
study area, which very crucial to understand land suitability for maize
production. Maize crop cultivation was more favorable in lowland
areas and vice versa (Gorfu and Ahmed, 2011; Rashid et al., 2013).
2.3.4. Soil data
Soil data of the study area was obtained from the Ministry of Water
and Irrigation Engineering and clipped to the study area. In addition, the
soil data were converted to raster format by 30 m spatial resolution and
reclassiﬁed according to a previous study Debesa et al. (2020) for over-
lay analysis.
2.3.5. Land use land cover types
Multispectral Landsat OLI/TIRS layer were stacked and extracted to
the Didessa watershed. The LULC of the study area was classiﬁed using
supervised classiﬁcation maximum likelihood algorithm. An image
was classiﬁed into cultivated land, forest, grassland, dense and open
woodlands and urban areas using the ERDAS Imagine 2015 software.
2.4. Pairwise comparison approach for criteria weight estimation
Based on expert opinion weight values from comparison of the
criteria were processed using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP)
model (Saaty, 2004; Abine, 2021). This model was developed by Saaty
(1980) to compare the relative importance of each criterion. Saaty
(1980) provided the scale range to indicate the relative importance of

each factor, which ranges between one and nine. Finally, the weights of
the pairwise comparison matrix priorities were computed (Table 2).
The consistency ratio (CR) was calculated to check the consistency of
comparisons (Yohannes and Soromessa, 2018). The CR was calculated
using (Eq. (7)). The CR values ranges from 0 to 1 (Saaty, 1980;
Malczewski, 2000). A CR <0.1 is a reasonable level of consistency. Calcu-
lating consistency index (CI) is very important for crop land suitability
analysis and calculated using Eq. (7).
CI ¼ λmax−n

and n is the number of classes:
Then, CR is obtained using Eq. (8) as suggested by Saaty (1980).

2.5. Weighted overlay analysis
All reclassiﬁed factors were aggregated and weighted using the
function of overlay analysis in ArcGIS environment. A serious of
pairwise comparison matrices application was performed to analyze
the relative importance of all factors to be considered for land maize
land suitability analysis as used by Debesa et al. (2020). The pairwise
matrix comparison (Rabia and Terribile, 2013) were used using Eq. (9).

out rainfall there is no agriculture speciﬁcally the rain-fed agriculture is
not operational at all. The Didessa watershed's northwestern areas were
unsuitable for maize crop development (Fig. 3). According to Kindu
et al. (2009) stated that rainfall is most important parameter for site
selection of maize crop cultivation.
3.2. Land surface temperature estimation
The LST of the study area was determined using the thermal band of
OLI/TIRS 2020 Landsat image. Warm temperatures are suitable for
maize crop cultivation, while cold temperatures are not. About 1340.3
km2 (19.3%) of the study area is very appropriate for maize production.
The most appropriate areas were concentrated in the central and north-
ern parts of the study area (Fig. 4). However, with an area of 1171.3 km2
(16.9%), the south western areas of the study area were not appropriate
for maize crop production (Table 3). These ﬁndings are consistent with
Habibie et al. (2019), who found that high LST are optimal for maize
crop productivity.

3.3. Agro ecological zones of the study area
The agro-ecological zones of the study area were extracted from
digital elevation model. Previous research Hurni (1998), Gorfu and
Ahmed's (2011) were used to create the Agro ecological zone (AEZ)
Didessa watershed. The ﬁndings of this study revealed that low-
lands dominated core parts of the study area, whereas midlands
dominated substantial portions (Fig. 5). Our results showed that a
total of 1640.8 km2 (23.6%) of the research area was found to be
highly favorable for maize crop cultivation (Table 4). Previous
studies conducted by Gorfu and Ahmed (2011) and Rashid et al.
(2013) conclude that lowland areas are appropriate for maize
farming.
3.4. Soil types
Eutric Vertisols, Haplic Acrisols, Haplic Alisols, Haplic Nitisols, and
Rhodic Nitisols are among the major soil types in the study area
(Fig. 6). Haplic nitisols and rhodic nitisols were found to be highly favor-
able for maize production, with an area of 727.7km2 (10.5%) (Table 5).
However, with a total area of 988.2km2, Eutric vertisols were not

adequate (14.2%). This study's ﬁndings are consistent with earlier re-
search (Sultan, 2013).
3.5. Soil texture
The study area's soil texture was divided into six groups. Sandy clay,
clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, sandy loam, and loamy sand. With an
area of 80.7km2 (1.2%) of the soil texture of the study area is highly ap-
propriate for maize production. With a total area of 10.3km2, sandy clay
is unsuitable (0.8%). The sandy clay loam dominates most of the study
region, which covers 3826.7km2 (55.1%) and is moderately appropriate
for maize agriculture (Table 6; Fig. 7). The study's ﬁndings were more
consistent with those of the prior study (Hussien et al., 2019).
3.6. Soil drainage
Soil drainage map of the study area is presented (Fig. 8). There are
ﬁve categories of drainage in the study area including well, moderate,
somewhat excessive, excessive and imperfect. Study by Al-Mashreki
et al. (2015) prove that well and moderate drainage were suitable for
maize production. Results showed that 6143.1km2 (88.5%) of the entire
area of the Didessa watershed is highly suited for maize agriculture,
whereas 372.7km2 (5.4%) is not suitable (Table 7).
3.7. Soil depth
The most essential soil property for determining viable land for
maize crop development is soil depth (Kindu et al., 2009). Maize crop
productivity beneﬁts greatly from deep soil depth. Based on soil depth
we can classify land suitability for certain crops. The soil depth class of
the study area is presented (Fig. 9). The results revealed that
4209.4km2 (60.6%) is highly favorable for maize production, while
73.2km2 (1.1%) is unsuitable (Table 8).
3.8. Land suitability for maize production
From aggregated eight factors, land suitability for maize production
was produced (Fig. 10). The results showed that 977.7 km2 (14.1%), and

4794.9 km2 (69.1%), were highly, and moderately suitable for maize
production, respectively while 1118.8 km2 (16.1%), and 51.5 km2
(0.7%) were marginally and not suitable for marginally and not suitable
for maize production, respectively (Table 9). This data clearly indicates
that majority of the study area is moderately suitable for maize
production. Similar research ﬁndings were reported by Debesa et al.
(2020) at Dabo Hana district. The lowland area, which is concentrated
in the central part of the study area were highly and moderately suitable
due to warm temperature (High LST) is more favorable for maize pro-
duction. Consequently, western part and some eastern parts were

marginally suitable for maize production. Moreover, northeastern parts
where elevated area and low temperatures were not suitable for maize
production.
4. Conclusion
Understanding land suitability for crop production enhances yields
and contributes towards the achievements of UN Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals such as no poverty and zero hunger. Land suitability evalu-
ation for maize production at watershed scale is crucial to enhance food
security in agriculture-based economy like Ethiopia. Several factors
such as: climate, LULC, LST, soil, topography, and infrastructure's data
were used to evaluate physical land suitability for maize production.
In this study, geospatial techniques were employed to identify physical
land suitability for maize production in the study area. The results of the
study showed that the area with low elevation and high LST are highly
suitable for maize production. Results revealed that about 977.7km2
(14.1%), and 4794.9km2 (69.1%) were highly and moderately suitable
for maize production, respectively. About 1118.8 km2 (16.1%), and
51.5 km2 (0.7%) were marginally and not suitable for maize production,
respectively. The ﬁndings of this research can support decision making
organs to promote intensive maize production in Didessa watershed.
In order to enhance food security, the farming communities in the
study area should cultivated the highly and moderately suitable area
for maize production. Moreover, in order to sustain the life of the farm-
ing communities' similar crop speciﬁc physical land suitability will be
conducted in the study area.
