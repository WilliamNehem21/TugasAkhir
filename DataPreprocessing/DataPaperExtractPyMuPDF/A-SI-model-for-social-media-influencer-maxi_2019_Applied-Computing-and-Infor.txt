Social network mining can be divided into two categories, namely, the study of structural characteristics
and content analysis. One of the most signiﬁcant problem in the context of a social network is ﬁnding the
most inﬂuential entities within the network. This task has signiﬁcance in viral marketing, since the most
inﬂuential entities can be targeted for endorsing new products in the market. However, the problem of
discovering the most persuasive node in a social network has proved to be NP-hard and also the exact
algorithms cannot be designed. This creates a wide scope for developing approximation methods and
algorithms that are able to produce solutions with proven approximation guarantees. Greedy algorithm
serves as a base for most of the existing algorithms designed for dealing with these problems. Greedy
algorithm can achieve a good approximation, but it is found to be computationally expensive.
Therefore, in this paper we propose a two level approach, designed based on Suspected-Infected (SI) epi-
demic model for maximizing the inﬂuence spread. We further propose that, multithreading approach for
implementation of algorithm for the proposed SI model aids to further elevate the performance of pro-
posed algorithm in terms of inﬂuence spread per second.

1. Introduction
Viral marketing has been acknowledged as an effective market-
ing strategy. Eventually a large number of people get connected
through social networks, such as Facebook, Flickr, and Twitter.
The impact of social network on their lives has increased signiﬁ-
cantly. The social inﬂuence acts as a motivating force, governing
the diffusion of the information in the network. Although there
are millions of users on social platforms, the activities of a selected
number of users are acknowledged and spread through the net-
work. These dominant users generate trends and play a signiﬁcant
role to shape or manipulate opinions in social networks. These
opinions are crucial in areas such as marketing or opinion mining.
Many companies have started targeting the key individuals called
inﬂuencers, who are in contextual alignment with their brand and
operate for the companies indirectly for ﬁnding the potential cus-
tomers. This is an indirect form of marketing also called inﬂuencer
marketing.
Social media inﬂuencers are the entities in the social network,
who help potential customers make a buying decision by inﬂuenc-
ing his opinion, through social networking. An inﬂuencer can be
any person who reviews product, posts a blog about a new product,
any industry expert or any person who has a potential to inﬂuence
people. The problem of inﬂuencer identiﬁcation can be presented
as, given a group of individuals which are to be motivated to adopt
a new product or information, ﬁnd the optimum target subset of
individuals (seed set), which can further inﬂuence the nodes. The
ultimate goal is to maximize the spread the information to a large
population.
Recently, there are large advances in the social networks ﬁeld. It
has focused on the study of relationships that includes quantitative
measures of social networks like inﬂuence, authority, centrality,
modularity, connectedness, etc. [1]. Inﬂuence maximization can
be deﬁned as the problem of forming an objective function for
selecting appropriate target nodes in a social network such that
it maximizes the inﬂuence spread. These target nodes in turn will
propagate the inﬂuence to their connected nodes. This will be help-
ful to design marketing strategies or diffuse a new idea in a net-
work related work in inﬂuencer detection in social networks.

The major issue of concern here is: how to improve the diffu-
sion for the given seed selection? Greedy algorithm proposed by
Kemp et al. [2], is a signiﬁcant algorithm for selecting the seed
nodes. This is a NP-Hard problem. Greedy algorithms require opti-
mal local choices. The solutions provided by greedy are subopti-
mal. Hence there is a need to ﬁnd a solution to get a better
algorithm which provides maximum inﬂuence spread. The prob-
lem of ﬁnding the minimal set of activated nodes to spread infor-
mation to the whole network or to optimally immunize a
network against epidemics can be exactly mapped onto optimal
percolation. The most inﬂuential nodes are the ones forming the
minimal set that guarantees a global connection of the network.
At a general level, the optimal inﬂuence problem can be stated as
follows: ﬁnd the minimal set of nodes which, if removed, would
break down the network into many disconnected pieces. The nat-
ural measure of inﬂuence is, therefore, the size of the largest
(giant) connected component as the inﬂuencers are removed from
the network. Hence an epidemic model, Susceptible-Infected (SI) is
used. It is best ﬁtted to deal with the progressive nature of the
model in context.
2. Related work
Kemp et al. [2] proposed a greedy approach for ﬁnding K inﬂu-
ential nodes out of all existing nodes. They provided for the ﬁrst
time an approximation guaranteed solution for the greedy algo-
rithm. They proposed an analysis framework for ﬁnding the seed
nodes. This framework is based on submodular functions. The
framework also showed that a feasible solution can be obtained
using a greedy strategy. They also proposed triggering model and
showed that their proposed approximation algorithm worked bet-
ter as compared to other known node selection strategies in social
networks.
The performance of greedy algorithm for inﬂuence maximiza-
tion can be improved by exploiting the submodularity, by an
approach called Cost-Effective Lazy Forward selection (CELF) [3].
Eventually, an improvised algorithm called CELF++ [4] was pro-
posed, which exploits the property of submodularity of the spread
function.
On the other hand, the social network diffusion was also mod-
elled [5] using various theories like bond percolation, resulting in
the proposal of Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model. Mean-
while, Graph evolution parameters, such as densiﬁcation and
shrinking diameters, were analysed [6] for modelling social net-
works. Based on global social network metrics, such as between-
ness centrality and closeness centrality, a semi-local centrality
measure was proposed to design an effective ranking method. This
design along with the SIR epidemic model was used to evaluate the
performance of the diffusion model by considering the parameters
such as the rate of inﬂuence spread and the number of infected
nodes i.e. inﬂuenced nodes [7,8]. Later a new heuristic and scalable
solution based on maximum inﬂuence path was proposed [9].
Social networks were analysed for quantifying user inﬂuence
and they dealt with web semantics to learn about inﬂuence in
heterogeneous social networks [10–12]. Social inﬂuence was
further exploited for the study of human dynamics and human
behaviour [13–17]. Social networks are evaluated for inﬂuence
maximization [18,19] and a two phase model for information dif-
fusion was employed [20] selecting the seed nodes and further
activating it in multiple levels. Recently, linear-time implementa-
tion of Collective-Inﬂuence (CI) algorithm is used to ﬁnd the min-
imal set of inﬂuencers in networks via optimal percolation [21,22].
Further, scalable algorithms were proposed for massively large
social networks [23].
The bond percolation theory and epidemic models are studied
and utilization of the SI epidemic model [24] for modelling the dif-
fusion in social networks is proposed. There is majority of work
based on bond percolation and on SIR model. The SI model is pre-
ferred since SI model is a progressive model and hence can be bet-
ter exploited in the inﬂuence maximization problem.
3. Problem discussion
Different models and frameworks have been deﬁned by differ-
ent researchers to obtain an optimal solution for the above stated
problem. Some of the approaches are discussed in this section.
Social network can be interpreted as a directed graph G = (V, E)
where V denotes the nodes in the graph, which represent the users
in the social network and E denotes the edges, that represent the
relationship between the users. In this context the relationship
would be that of the inﬂuencer and inﬂuenced node i.e. who
inﬂuences whom. The inﬂuence maximization problem deals with
optimally selecting the seed set of users such that they contribute
to maximize the expected spread of inﬂuence or diffusion in the
given social network, in the context of a given propagation model.
Let St # V be deﬁned as the active set, containing the active
nodes at given time t. The active nodes which participate in
spreading the inﬂuence to the next level of inﬂuence will be ter-
med as seed nodes. Let S0 be the seed set, containing the seed
nodes. In other words, the seed nodes in this set are called the
seeds of inﬂuence diffusion. These seed nodes are the initial nodes
at the root level, which are selected to propagate the inﬂuence
throughout the network. For example, as a marketing strategy,
the initial users selected by the promotional campaign of a new
product, designed as marketing strategy.
In progressive diffusion models, the active sets are monotoni-
cally non-decreasing and hence the superset, V is ﬁnite, for a ﬁnite
number of steps and the set of active nodes, St remains unchanged.
Eventually, the active nodes belonging to the active set leads to the
ﬁnal active set and is denoted as / (S0), where S0 is the initial seed
set.
There exists two classic progressive models, originally proposed
in the mathematical sociology, are described as follows:
3.1. Independent cascade model (IC model)
Independent cascade (or IC) model was the ﬁrst progressive
model [25,26]. The key characteristic of this model is that diffusion
events associated with every edge in the given social graph are
mutually independent.
3.2. Linear threshold model (LT model)
The linear threshold (or LT) model is a progressive, stochastic
information diffusion model, proposed by Granovetter [27].
3.3. Triggering model
Kempe [2] proposed the triggering model, which is mainly
based on two basic propagation models, already discussed above,
namely, the IC and the LT models. In IC and LT propagation models,
this inﬂuence maximization problem is proved to be NP-hard by
Kempe et al. [2]. He also showed that the maximization function
rm(S) follows the properties of monotonicity and submodularity.

103
3.4. Submodularity and monotonicity of a function
The propagation models i.e. IC, LT and triggering models satisfy
two important properties in terms of their inﬂuence spread func-
tion, r. These properties are submodularity and monotonicity.
Submodularity can be interpreted in this context as diminishing
marginal return i.e. when more nodes are added to the seed set,
there is no great effect on the performance of the model. In this
context, monotonicity can be interpreted as if more elements are
added to a seed set, it cannot reduce the size of the ﬁnal set con-
taining the active nodes (inﬂuenced nodes).
3.5. Greedy algorithm proposed by Kempe et al. [2]
Input: G, k, rm(S)
Output: seed set S, h
1. S  /
2. while |S| < k do
3. u  argmax w e V�S (rm(S + w)�rm(S));
4. S  S[{u}
The line 3 of the greedy algorithm is most important. Here, it
selects the node that provides the maximum inﬂuence spread, in
other words, the largest marginal gain rm (S + w) � rm (S) with
respect to the total expected inﬂuence spread of the seed set in
context i.e. S. This step helps to ensure the submodularity and
monotonicity.
Greedy algorithms require the optimal local choices. Greedy
algorithm works only if locally optimal choices have potential to
lead to a global optimum and the sub problems are optimal. But
if it fails, then the greedy algorithm performs poorly. The same
thing is observed here. The greedy algorithm only ﬁnds local min-
imum edge at every iteration and hence it fails to reach more
nodes. There could be a possibility that in a large perception, the
local optima is far weaker than global optima. Hence we tried to
exploit the graphical structure of the graph.
4. Proposed model
This maximization problem can be expressed as a discrete opti-
mization problem. It can be modelled as a graphical model for
learning tree distribution. A discrete approach aims to choose the
optimal set of nodes that constitute an optimal path in a spanning
tree, emerging out of the seed node. In other words, ﬁnding a span-
ning tree of social graph G of best ﬁt for the triggering nodes (seed
nodes), such that when the nodes are traced along the given path
length (also termed as threshold), it provides a subset of the solu-
tion i.e. subset of ﬁnal active set.
4.1. SI epidemic model – (Susceptible infected model)
The SI model [24,28], categorizes the entire population in the
context into two groups, namely, the susceptible individuals who
may get infected by the given disease i.e. who are likely to get
infected and the other group is that of the infected individuals,
who get infected by the disease and further may carry or spread
the disease to the next set of individuals i.e. susceptible group.
Once a susceptible entity becomes infected, he or she gets added
into the infected set, thereby increasing the size of the infected
set and ultimately decreasing the size of the susceptible set of indi-
viduals. We utilize this characteristic of the epidemic model to
model the inﬂuence spread across a social network. Fig. 1 shows
the proposed two phase SI model for the inﬂuence maximization
problem.
4.2. Proposed method
Fig. 2 represents the proposed method. Here, in phase I, we pro-
pose that the initial population of the nodes will be the candidates
i.e. susceptible nodes, represented as {S1}. The nodes which get trig-
gered i.e. the active nodes will now act as seed set and will be cate-
gorized as infected nodes {I}. These infected nodes will now serve as
the inﬂuence carriers. In phase II, the nodes other than the seed
nodes are all susceptible. Once these susceptible nodes are inﬂu-
enced by the seed nodes, they become active nodes. The nodes once
active do not become inactive. This is the progressive behaviour as
stated earlier. Hence it ﬁts in the framework of SI model.
Let G be a graph, with initial population assumed as susceptible
for spread. Let {S} denote the set of seed nodes obtained from the
greedy algorithm, {S1} denote the set of susceptible nodes and {I}
denote the set of infected nodes, i.e., the nodes responsible to spread
the inﬂuence. l represents the threshold, considered as eccentricity,
i.e., the maximum distance (using the spanning tree) from given
node v to any other node in the graph. It is the diameter of sub graph,
used to ﬁnd diffusion for one infected nodee {I}. This is how we actu-
ally compute the reachability of the nodes. We assume that the
nodes which are reachable are more likely to get infected. Hence,
it is a signiﬁcant parameter in the process of inﬂuence spread algo-
rithm. The set {S1} represents graphically all the reachable nodes
which are at a distance � l. The algorithm can be stated as follows:
4.2.1. Algorithm

2. Data preprocessing- Build the social network graph.
3. Assume initial population as susceptible (S) and identify the
seed set from greedy algorithm depending on threshold h
4. Phase I: Identiﬁed nodes become infected i.e. {I}  {S}
5. Phase II: For Each node v e {I}, ﬁnd the set {S1}vi # {S1} such
that vi e {S1} only if vi is at distance � l

6. Total_inﬂuence_spread, W(S1) = P {S1} vi
7. return W(S1)
8. end For
The shortest path is traversed using spanning tree which makes
sure that the vertex with maximum inﬂuence spread is passed to
the next iteration. This leads to an incremental inﬂuence spread.
The nodes returned by the above algorithm represents the set of
nodes inﬂuenced by the source node. It is observed that the spread
is wider than the greedy algorithm.
Theorem 1. In the SI model, the number of susceptible individuals
decreases monotonically, that is Sn+1 � Sn, for all n. We also have that
the number of infected individuals increases monotonically, i.e., In+1 �
In, for all n [28].
Proof. The input for the algorithm is a set of infected nodes {I}
which are derived from the population by using the greedy algo-
rithm. It is clear that the target seed set obtained from the greedy
algorithm is submodular as well as monotonous [2].

Hence, if we are using incremental approach to ﬁnd the inﬂu-
ence spread, then the monotonicity is reserved in this approach.
Further, experimentally, we have proved that the number of nodes
inﬂuenced by a seed set at earlier step n is more than the next step,
i.e., n + 1.
Theorem 2. The number of susceptible individuals is never negative,
Sn � 0, and the number of infected individuals is never more than the
total population size, In � N [28].
Proof. In our approach, the initial population, i.e., a set of infected
nodes is never empty. Hence, even for minimum one seed node, it
is not possible to have susceptible individuals < 0. As we follow
graphical model, we know that at least two nodes and one edge
will be required. Hence, if one node is selected as the seed node,
i.e., infected node, then the other is susceptible (as it is reachable
from infected node). Therefore, the set of susceptible individuals
can never be negative. In the worst case, where all the nodes are
infected, the susceptible node can be 0 but not negative.
On the other hand, the seed nodes, i.e., infected node set {I} can
contain the entire population in the best case. The greedy algo-
rithm terminates when the seed node set contains all the nodes
of the entire population N. In this case, the seed set becomes uni-
versal set. Hence, even if any infected node gets added later, it will
be a subset of universal set and according to set theory, |U| = N, i.e.,
the total number of nodes. Hence, the number of infected nodes
can be a maximum of N.
The computational time can be reduced substantially. Once we
get the target nodes using the greedy algorithm, we can simultane-
ously execute the algorithm on all the seeds. This is the reason why
the computational time gets reduced. For achieving further
improvement
in
time
efﬁciency,
we
propose
to
use
the
Multithreading approach.
5. Dataset description
We consider three datasets, available on Stanford Large Net-
work Dataset Collection (SNAP), published by Stanford University
(Available at: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/com). Table 1 repre-
sents the features of datasets.
6. Working of algorithm
The algorithm will work as follows:
Step 1:
Input: Set of Susceptable nodes
After Processing using greedy Algorithm: Susceptible nodes ?
Infected nodes
P ? {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7} ? seed sets for inﬂuence spread
(assuming threshold as 7)
Step 2: Input: Set of Susceptible nodes (Those found as infected
in previous step) i.e. {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7}
After modelling: Infected nodes
{v1}- {v11, v12. . ., v1n} assuming the threshold as l

dataset
citHepTh,
the
infected
nodes
for
a
seed node 204089, for (l = 7), it inﬂuences 664 nodes (shown in
Fig. 3).
Figs. 3 and 4 illustrates the visualization of the inﬂuence spread
for a node. The central hub (node) is the seed node, selected during
phase I whereas other nodes are the infected nodes during phase II.
The inﬂuence is spread by the set of seed nodes. The set of all active
nodes at this phase represents the ﬁnal active set. It clearly shows
the effect of threshold on the total spread. As the threshold l,
increases, the total spread shrinks.

7. Results discussion
Initially, the seed set is computed using the greedy algorithm.
To ﬁnd the inﬂuence spread, the next cascade is found by con-
sidering that an edge connecting two nodes mean that one is
inﬂuencing the other. Further, by considering the longest among
shortest paths, the given nodes inﬂuenced (which is computed
by cascaded operation) will be restricted by speciﬁed threshold
(which speciﬁes the path length). The SI model is based on the
incremental approach where the spread is cumulative. It exploits
the graph properties. The spanning tree enables the SI approach
to ﬁnd the best possible longest path which helps in increasing
the inﬂuence spread. The greedy approach is restricted to the
local search. CELF++ is based on the submodularity imposed on
greedy algorithm and CI is based on the adaptive bottom up
approach utilizing the ﬁnite radius of sphere of social networks.
The performances of inﬂuence spread with different values of
thresholds h (l = 6 for SI model) are illustrated in Fig. 5a. Linear
(SI) represents the trend of the performance of algorithm as the
threshold varies. The performance elevates linearly with increase
in the threshold.
Fig. 5b show the inﬂuence spread per second for different
algorithms for the dataset CA-AstroPh Dataset. It is clear that the
inﬂuence spread is elevated to a large extent by using SI model
as compared to greedy algorithm. The inﬂuence spread per second
shows the signiﬁcant outperformance when a multithreaded
approach is used. CI gives best inﬂuence spread per second but
the total inﬂuence spread is best achieved by SI model as shown
in following Fig. 5c. In SI based algorithm, spanning tree data struc-
ture is used where in, while pre-processing, the reachability of the
nodes is checked for the seed nodes which are shortlisted by the
greedy algorithm. This enables us to obtain the infected nodes.
However, the time complexity of the CI-algorithm is better than
the proposed algorithm because of use of max-heap data structure
for storing and processing the CI values. The ﬁnite radius ‘ of the CI
sphere, allows to process the CI values in a max-heap data struc-
ture [22,23]. The basic idea is that, after each node removal, there
is a need to recompute CI just for a O(1) number of nodes, and ﬁnd
the new largest value. It follows bottom up approach. Whereas, in
SI based approach, the computations are based on computations of
the longest possible path among all the shortest paths, which is an
incremental approach. Here, the execution time of CI is better than
SI model, but still fails to achieve the inﬂuence spread as good as SI
model. We further propose to use multithreaded approach to
obtain a better performance of SI model in terms of execution time
to some extent.
The comparison of performance gain for inﬂuence spread of dif-
ferent algorithms for dataset CA-AstroPh are as depicted in Fig. 5c.
Table 2 shows the comparison in terms of performance i.e., inﬂu-
ence spread of proposed SI model with other models for different
datasets. Table 3 depicts the performance gain (Inﬂuence spread
per second) by using multithreaded approach for SI model. In
Table 3, the performance of multithreaded approach for SI model
is compared with the basic SI model. It is proved that by multi-
threading though doesn’t provide the best inﬂuence spread per
second, still manages to give a signiﬁcant boost to the speed of
the inﬂuence spread. This performance improvement is reported
in Table 3.

8. Conclusion and future scope
As discussed in the earlier part, greedy algorithms require opti-
mal local choices at each stage with the hope of ﬁnding a global
optimum. If locally optimal choices yield a global optimum and
the sub-problems are optimal, then the algorithm works. If it fails,
then the greedy algorithm performs poorly. This has been con-
ﬁrmed by this study too. The greedy algorithm only ﬁnds local
minimum inﬂuence spread at every iteration, hence it fails to reach
more nodes. It is observed that the inﬂuence spread observed in
the greedy algorithm is limited and generally requires more run
time. The proposed two phase SI based algorithm performs better
than greedy algorithm in terms of time and the overall inﬂuence
spread. Hence, we show that the graphical structure of the social
network can be exploited to improve the reachability and hence
improving the inﬂuence spread.
Here, a novel approach is proposed based on SI epidemic model
for inﬂuence spread, the longest shortest path concept for reacha-
bility and implementation of multithreading for improving the
time efﬁciency which iteratively improves the greedy cascaded
model exponentially. The inﬂuence spread in this model is maxi-
mized as compared to the basic greedy model. The efﬁciency in
terms of speed is an added beneﬁt. In this study, we evaluated
the algorithm for different seed sizes with different datasets
against different approaches proposed earlier. We observed that
our ultimate aim of maximizing the inﬂuence spread is achieved
using SI Model, but at the cost of execution time. Hence we used
multithreading to improve the total number of nodes inﬂuenced
per second, i.e., indirectly decreasing the computational time.
This work provided an overview of the inﬂuencer identiﬁcation
and the inﬂuence maximization. This study concludes that by iden-
tifying the inﬂuential users in social media, different business
strategies can be planned, e.g., efﬁcient launching and marketing
new products, targeting the potential consumers, etc. It is obvious
that the inﬂuence maximization and social inﬂuence mining
together will form the signiﬁcant components to enable extensive
viral marketing through online social networks.
Identifying inﬂuential users may be proposed through different
models, algorithms and statistical techniques. Also parallel prob-
lems like link prediction, social network content analysis, etc.
could be considered as potential problems for social network min-
ing to deal with in future.
