Eye irritation and corrosion are fundamental considerations in developing chemicals to be used in or near the eye, from cleaning products to ophthalmic solutions. 
Unfortunately, animal testing is currently the standard method to identify compounds that cause eye irritation or corrosion. Yet, there is growing pressure on the part 
of regulatory agencies both in the USA and abroad to develop New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) that help reduce the need for animal testing and address unmet 
need to modernize safety evaluation of chemical hazards. In furthering the development and applications of computational NAMs in chemical safety assessment, 
in this study we have collected the largest expertly curated dataset of compounds tested for eye irritation and corrosion, and employed this data to build and 
validate binary and multi-classiﬁcation Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) models that can reliably assess eye irritation/corrosion potential of 
novel untested compounds. QSAR models were generated with Random Forest (RF) and Multi-Descriptor Read Across (MuDRA) machine learning (ML) methods, 
and validated using a 5-fold external cross-validation protocol. These models demonstrated high balanced accuracy (CCR of 0.68–0.88), sensitivity (SE of 0.61–0.84), 
positive predictive value (PPV of 0.65–0.90), speciﬁcity (SP of 0.56–0.91), and negative predictive value (NPV of 0.68–0.85). Overall, MuDRA models outperformed 
RF models and were applied to predict compounds’ irritation/corrosion potential from the Inactive Ingredient Database, which contains components present in 
FDA-approved drug products, and from the Cosmetic Ingredient Database, the European Commission source of information on cosmetic substances. All models built 
and validated in this study are publicly available at the STopTox web portal ( https://stoptox.mml.unc.edu/ ). These models can be employed as reliable tools for 
identifying potential eye irritant/corrosive compounds. 
Introduction 
Chemicals employed in cosmetics, drugs, pesticides, household prod- 
ucts, among others, need to be classiﬁed appropriately according to their 
potential ocular toxicity to ensure safety [1] . Eye irritation or corrosion 
are characterized by cell membrane lysis, coagulation, saponiﬁcation, 
and chemical reactivity [2] . All of these characteristics are mediated by 
contacts between a chemical and the eye surface (cornea and conjunc- 
tiva) [3] . 
The Draize test, published more than 70 years ago [4] , relies on in 
vivo exposure to rabbits’ eyes to classify chemicals according to their ir- 
ritation/corrosion potential based on the damage caused within a well- 
deﬁned timeframe [5] . However, this test relies upon qualitative scor- 
ing metrics of the severity and reversibility of highly subjective lesions, 
demonstrates poor reproducibility, and has questionable relevance to 
human exposure scenarios and human ocular biology [6] . Despite the 
scientiﬁc concern regarding the extrapolation of the observed results in

rabbits to human eyes [7] , the test is still used and recommended by the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
The United Nations Globally Harmonized System (UN GHS) [8] pro- 
poses four categories to classify the chemicals: ( i ) Category 1 are com- 
pounds that cause irreversible eye eﬀects within 21 days; ( ii ) Category 
2A are compounds whose eﬀects are reversible within 21 days; ( iii ) Cat- 
egory 2B are compounds whose eﬀects are reversible within seven days; 
and ( iv ) No-Cat (NC) are compounds unable to cause eye corrosion or 
irritation. 
Since the animal test ban in Europe for cosmetics ingredients in 2013, 
the development of alternative methods to substitute and reduce the 
number of animals in toxicological tests has become imperative [9] . The 
development of eﬀective and eﬃcient NAMs to animal testing [10] has 
been fueled in the last two decades by both public and political pressure 
[11] to employ the “Three Rs principles ” to reduce, reﬁne, and replace 
animal tests [12] , and recent guidelines imposed by regulatory agencies 
create new demand for developing rapid, eﬃcient alternative methods

to animal testing [10] . Within this context, the 2018 ICCVAM strategic 
roadmap [ 13 ]called for the development of ﬁt-for-purpose NAMs and 
the US EPA publicized its commitment to “eliminate all mammal study 
requests and funding by 2035 ” [14] . 
NAMs have been developed and made available for in vitro identiﬁ- 
cation of ocular corrosives/severe irritants using alternative biological 
material including rabbit corneal cells (OECD Test Guideline 491) [15] , 
isolated bovine corneas (OECD Test Guideline 437) [16] , and a mono- 
layer of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (OECD Test Guideline 
460) [ 17 , 18 ]. Other three-dimensional human tissue models such as the 
Reconstructed Human Cornea-like Epithelium (RhCE) test (OECD Test 
Guideline 492) and the Vitrigel-Eye Irritancy test (OECD Test Guide- 
line 494) are approved for use in a bottom-up approach identifying sub- 
stances not classiﬁed for ocular irritation. These tests provide varying 
coverage of the biology relevant to eye irritation and corrosion when 
compared to human ocular anatomy and physiology [19] . 
Computational models provide a fast and low-cost solution to ob- 
tain reliable predictions for the endpoint of concern when generated on 
high-quality curated data and properly validated [10] . A major compu- 
tational approach, named Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship 
(QSAR) modeling, employs various statistical and artiﬁcial intelligence 
(AI) approaches, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) 
to generate models that can accurately predict the outcome of testing 
new compounds in a speciﬁc assay, based on their molecular features. 
In recent years, the growth in publicly available data enabled the devel- 
opment of highly robust and predictive models [ 20 , 21 ]. However, mod- 
eling toxicity is a complex task as the underlying mechanisms are not 
always clear [ 3 , 21 ]. For this reason, QSAR models are highly dependent 
on the quality and volume of the data [12] in the training set, proper 
chemical and biological curation of primary data is critical [ 22 , 23 ], and 
failure to follow these practices question the trustworthiness of models 
[6] . 
Recently, there have been many attempts to model eye irritation end- 
points with varying degrees of success (see Table 1 ). Though many of the 
models showed good overall accuracy, most models were not compliant 
with the OECD’s guidelines for QSAR model development and validation 
[24] , with models lacking the recommended use of an external set or Y- 
randomization [25–41] , or not reporting the model applicability domain 
[28–41] . Many studies lack a rigorous curation and standardization of 
the chemicals used in the modeling, such as the study conducted by 
Verma et al. [25] , resulting ultimately in unreliable predictions [42] . 
Additional problems include using unbalanced datasets, causing mod- 
els to have an intrinsic bias toward the largest class [ 20 , 22 ]; and lack 
of model interpretation [20] . 1 These limitations make it impossible to 
fairly compare those tools with other peer reviewed and public QSAR 
models. 
Our team has extensively worked on the development of QSAR mod- 
els for toxicity endpoints and developed web applications to dissemi- 
nate the use of these models, such as Pred-hERG [43] and Pred-Skin 
[44] . Considering the lack of reliable models for eye irritation and cor- 
rosion, herein, we have collected, curated, and integrated the largest 
publicly available eye irritation and corrosion datasets, used it to build 
predictive and rigorously validated ML and instance-learner models, in- 
tegrated these models into a software package called STopTox (Sys- 
temic and Topical chemical Toxicity), and made it publicly available 
( https://stoptox.mml.unc.edu/ ). We oﬀer these models as reliable com-

models such as ADC/Percepta ( https://www.acdlabs.com/products/percepta/ 
index.php ) and Case Ultra ( http://www.multicase.com/case-ultra ) and 
freely available software tools such as Toxtree ( http://toxtree.sourceforge. 
net/ ) and QSAR toolbox that do not fully disclose their parameters, as well as

putational tools developed under the NAMs paradigm for evaluating 
chemical hazard potential for eye irritation/corrosion. 
Materials and methods 
Dataset overview 
The publicly available data from the European Chemical Agency 
(ECHA) ( https://echa.europa.eu/ ) used in this work was graciously 
provided by Thomas Luetchtefeld [51] . Additional eye irritation- 
related data were also extracted from multiple literature sources 
[ 25 , 29 , 35 , 40 , 45 , 52–55 ], curated (see next section), and integrated. The 
ECHA dataset was initially composed of 18,428 records for 9,801 chemi- 
cals and we compiled 2,769 additional records from the literature. In the 
ECHA dataset, 5,238 records with imputed eye irritation/corrosion data 
from QSAR models, weight-of-evidence or read-across were excluded, 
leaving 7,332 records. Chemicals with inconsistent hazard classiﬁca- 
tion data ( n = 236) were removed. Inorganics ( n = 330) and mixtures 
( n = 860), totalizing 1,190 entries, were also removed from the dataset. 
The data collected from the literature had high overlap with the ECHA 
data presenting 2,438 duplicates. No discordant duplicates in terms of 
hazard characterization were found between the ECHA data and the lit- 
erature. These duplicates were carefully analyzed and only one entry 
per compound was kept. Furthermore, only studies following the OECD 
Test Guideline 405 [56] ( in vivo data) were kept, with 3,547 records 
remaining after the data curation process ( Fig. 1 ). 
The ﬁnal (unbalanced) dataset was composed of 3,547 compounds, 
of which 2,401 were classiﬁed as non-irritant/non-corrosive, 937 were 
classiﬁed as irritant (categories 2A and 2B) of which 209 were classiﬁed 
as corrosive (category 1). The GHS classiﬁcation for irritant/corrosive 
compounds was only available for 1,248 compounds of the dataset, 
where 209 compounds were classiﬁed as category 1 members, 166 were 
classiﬁed as category 2A, and 84 as category 2B, whereas 789 were clas- 
siﬁed as NC. These compounds classiﬁed under GHS system were used 
to generate multiclass models. 
Binary QSAR models using the unbalanced data typically lead to bi- 
ased models. To overcome this, the negative class in the unbalanced 
dataset was under-sampled to balance the data set. We used the smaller 
group of irritant compounds as probes to search for the most struc- 
turally similar non-irritants selecting half of the irritant group (469 com- 
pounds). The remaining 468 compounds were randomly chosen from 
the rest of the initial non-irritant class to maximize the chemical space 
coverage. This similarity-based selection procedure was carried out in 
KNIME using Tanimoto coeﬃcient in two stages: (i) generate a similarity 
matrix of chemical space between all the pairs of compounds; and then 
(ii) choose 469 non-irritants with the largest Tanimoto similarity to the 
nearest irritant and 468 via random selection. Such procedures allowed 
us to create the most challenging training set with structurally similar 
irritants and non-irritants to achieve the most rigorous model capable of 
separating these two classes from each other and including a fraction of 
more diverse non-irritants to provide broader chemical space coverage. 
The ﬁnal dataset consisted of 1,874 compounds (937 irritants and 937 
non-irritants). The same approach was performed to balance the data 
for the generation of QSAR models to predict eye corrosion, i.e. , the NC 
class of compounds was under-sampled using both structural similarity 
and random sampling, leading to a balanced data of 418 compounds 
(209 corrosive and 209 non-corrosive). 
Data curation 
The compiled data was carefully curated and inspected according to 
protocols proposed by Fourches et al. [ 42 , 57 ]. Brieﬂy, counter ions were 
stripped, mixtures and inorganics were removed, and speciﬁc chemo- 
types such as nitro groups and aromatic rings were standardized. Dupli- 
cates were identiﬁed, carefully analyzed, and only one entry was kept if 
biological responses were similar. The curation steps were implemented

in the KNIME analytics platform ( https://www.knime.com/ ) using in- 
house workﬂows. ISIDA Duplicates [58] was used to identify structural 
duplicates and ChemAxon Standardizer (v.16.5.16.0, ChemAxon, Bu- 
dapest, Hungary, http://www.chemaxon.com ) was used to standardize 
the chemical structures. 
Cluster analysis 
A 50 × 50 neuron self-organizing map (SOM) was generated using 
the open-source software Data Warrior ( http://www.openmolecules. 
org/ ) [59] and employing SkelSpheres descriptors ( http://www. 
openmolecules.org/help/similarity.html ) [60] . Data Warrior software 
was used to cluster compounds that were colored according to their 
Global Harmonization System (GHS) [8] class, in order to provide an 
overview of the chemical space. 
Molecular descriptors 
We employed RDKit whole-molecule descriptors, Morgan, MACCS, 
and Dragon to develop QSAR and MuDRA models. SkelSpheres descrip- 
tors were calculated and used to cluster compounds in the SOM cluster 
analysis. 
SkelSpheres 
Skeleton Spheres descriptors [60] were calculated through the Osiris 
Data Warrior software ( http://www.openmolecules.org/ ). SkelSphere is

a 1,024 bin byte-vector descriptor that, despite being time- and memory- 
consuming, is more suitable than the other descriptors to perceive ﬁne 
similarities. It also considers stereoisomers and has fewer hash collisions 
due to its higher resolution. The SkelSphere descriptor was calculated 
prior to the SOM generation to better understand and cluster the com- 
pounds of the modeling dataset and to visualize GHS classiﬁcation la- 
bels. 
RDKit molecular descriptors and ﬁngerprints 
In KNIME, a collection of 117 diﬀerent RDKit molecular descriptors 
were calculated for the dataset followed by the removal of invariant 
descriptors and descriptors with a correlation higher than 0.9. MACCS 
structural keys [61] are implemented in the RDKit module available 
in the KNIME platform, as well as Morgan ﬁngerprints [62] . RDKit pro- 
vides 166 publicly available structural keys to represent molecules, and, 
for the Morgan ﬁngerprint, it is possible to deﬁne the number of bits to 
encode the ﬁngerprints as well as the radius, as the Morgan ﬁngerprint 
is a circular ﬁngerprint similar to ECFP and FCFP ﬁngerprints family. 
For this study, Morgan ﬁngerprints were generated using radius of 2 
and 2048-bits length. 
Dragon descriptors 
Version 5.5 of Dragon software (Talete SRL, Milan, Italy) was used 
to generate all the 0D, 1D, and 2D descriptors provided by the software, 
totaling 2489 descriptors [63] . After the descriptors were calculated, 
invariant descriptors and descriptors with a correlation higher than 0.9 
were also removed prior to the model generation step. 
QSAR modeling 
QSAR models for eye irritation and eye corrosion were generated 
employing a variety of chemical descriptors and algorithms. Binary and 
multiclass models were generated through the following steps: (i) data 
curation, preparation, and analysis; (ii) model generation and valida- 
tion; (iii) model selection. To validate the method, we applied a 5-fold 
external cross-validation, where the curated dataset is divided into ﬁve 
equal-sized parts with an 80%/20% split between the modeling and test 
sets; this process is iteratively repeated until all parts of the dataset are 
used once as a test set. It is important to note that only the modeling set 
is used to generate the model; hence, during the 5-fold cross-validation 
procedure, compounds from the test set are not used in the generation 
of the models whatsoever and are solely reserved for the test set. Best 
models were carefully selected according to acceptable threshold val- 
ues for all statistical metrics (for our purposes, this was set at 0.6). In 
addition, 10 rounds of Y-randomization were conducted to assess if the 
results were obtained by chance via annotating the statistical character- 
istics of the shuﬄed-labels models. Binary models were built for both 
corrosive and irritant classes of chemicals. Compounds classiﬁed as NC 
were used as non-corrosives and non-irritants as well. 
Algorithms 
Both RF [64] and MuDRA [65] algorithms were applied. RF is a well- 
known ensemble decision tree learning algorithm, while MuDRA is an 
instance-based learning process. MuDRA does not build an underlying 
model to make its predictions but performs an instantaneous classiﬁ- 
cation of known irritant/corrosive and non-irritant/non-corrosive com- 
pounds based on their similarity range and nearest neighborhood. An 
in-depth explanation of how the MuDRA method can be applied can be 
found elsewhere [65] . Both methods are implemented in the KNIME an- 
alytics platform; RF is a built-in node provided by diﬀerent developers, 
while MuDRA is implemented through the integration between KNIME 
platform and Python scripting language via built-in nodes for this pur- 
pose. 
Statistical evaluation of models 
The predictive power of both binary and multiclassiﬁcation mod- 
els was performed based on the output of the models during their re-

spective validation processes. As described above, the 5-fold external 
cross-validation procedure was chosen to validate the models in this 
study. Hence, the statistical analysis is based on the collected results of 
predictions made in each fold of the cross-validation approach. For the 
multiclassiﬁcation models, the same metrics were calculated, but con- 
sidering the confusion matrix and comparing each class against all. The 
statistical metrics and the respective formulas are described below.

Here, TP and TN are true positives and negatives, respectively; FP 
and FN are false positives and negatives, respectively. Se stands for the 
sensitivity of the models, which is the correct identiﬁcation of positive 
samples, while Sp is the measure of the speciﬁcity of the models, eval- 
uating the ability of the model to identify negative samples correctly. 
CCR stands for the correct classiﬁcation rate, and are calculated as the 
arithmetic mean of Se and Sp. PPV means positive predicted value, while 
NPV means negative predicted value; these metrics evaluate the proba- 
bility of certainty of a positive or negative prediction, respectively. F 1 
score, the harmonic mean of PPV and Se (aka precision and recall), eval- 
uates the ability of the model to identify each instance correctly within 
the data. MCC encompasses the Mathews Correlation Coeﬃcient and 
has been largely used as a goodness-of-ﬁt in machine learning modeling 
tasks. MCC ranges from − 1 to 1, being 0 equal to a random prediction. 
The Coverage was calculated based on what we deﬁned as reliable 
predictions, which means a prediction of a sample laying inside the ap- 
plicability domain (AD) of the model, calculated through the formula 
below. 
𝐷 𝑇 = ̄𝑦 + 𝑍𝜎
where D T is a distance threshold, ̄y is the average Euclidean distance 
of the k nearest neighbors of each compound of the training set, 𝜎 rep- 
resents the standard deviation of the Euclidean distances and Z is an 
arbitrary parameter to control the level of signiﬁcance. We set the de- 
fault value of 0.5 for Z . 
Multiclass modeling 
To build multiclass models, three classes were considered based on 
GHS classiﬁcation: corrosive, irritant (comprised by classes 2A and 2B), 
and NC. The binary statistical metrics described above were computed 
for each of the three classes and averaged to report overall performance 
for the multiclass models. 
Virtual screening of CosIng and inactive ingredients database 
The best models were applied to virtually screen the Cosmetics & 
Ingredients Substances Database (CosIng) [66] , a European database 
of information about cosmetics and their ingredients. After curation, 
4,780 compounds from CosIng were screened using our best performing 
models to identify compounds with the potential to cause eye irrita- 
tion/corrosion. 
The FDA inactive ingredients database (IID) set of compounds 
is freely available at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and- 
databases/inactive-ingredients-database-download . We also retrieved 
the data and curated it following the protocol described above. We ap- 
plied the best models reported in this study to predict the ocular toxicity 
potential of the ﬁnal IID set, composed of 4,673 inactive ingredients for 
pharmaceutical products.

Results and discussion 
Cluster analysis 
The SOM approach is an unsupervised classiﬁcation technique that 
maps compounds to visualize their structural similarity. The structural 
map ( Fig. 2 ) is colored by the three classes as deﬁned by the GHS haz- 
ard classiﬁcation system used to develop multiclass models. The high- 
lighted compounds show that small structural diﬀerences can be ob- 
served in pairs of compounds belonging to distinct classes. Analyzing 
the background (shown in green in Fig. 2 ), the surrounding compounds 
are similar to each other (Tc = 0.85); major structural changes in the 
scaﬀold can also be observed (shown in yellow in Fig. 2 ), and structures 
with high dissimilarity are highlighted (shown in blue in Fig. 2 ). As seen 
in Fig. 2 , the overall similarity between non-irritant and irritant com- 
pounds can be found across the whole map, sharing regions of the map in 
a non-compartmentalized way. This indicates that there are many activ- 
ity cliﬀs in this dataset (as highlighted in Fig. 2 ). This type of dataset rep- 
resents a challenge and although both RF and MuDRA are used to gener- 
ate predictive models, they predict activity cliﬀs diﬀerently. As a prime 
example, 2,3-dihydro-1,2-benzothiazol-3-one (158 in Fig. 2 ) and 2,3- 
dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,3 ‑dione (1044 in Fig. 2 ) are respectively within 
corrosive and NC categories, but share the same structural region in 
the SOM. Another example is 3-amino-4-chlorobenzene-1-sulfonic acid 
(200 in Fig. 2 ) and 3,4-dimethylbenzene-1-sulfonic acid (1031 in Fig. 2 ) 
pair, both in the same region of the SOM but respectively categorized 
as corrosive and NC. The same can be observed for the aliphatic com- 
pounds 1 ‑chloro-2-[2-(2- chloroethoxy ) ethoxy ]ethane (148 in Fig. 2 ) and 
1 ‑chloro-2-[(2- chloroethoxy ) methoxy ]ethane (800 in Fig. 2 ), grouped to- 
gether within the same region of the structural map and respectively 
classiﬁed as corrosive and NC. However, regions of chemical space are 
clearly enriched for particular categories, lending support to the appli- 
cation of QSAR modeling approaches while highlighting the necessity 
of nonlinear AI methods to identify the complex feature combinations 
that will discriminate categories. 
QSAR modeling 
Binary models 
In this study, we built ﬁve binary models for eye irritation and ﬁve 
binary models for eye corrosion. For each endpoint, we built RF models 
using four molecular descriptors described in the methods section as 
well as one MuDRA model. The AD of each model was calculated, with 
an exception for the MuDRA method as it is an instance-based modeling 
approach. 
As one can see, models generated using the RF method for both end- 
points presented similar metrics. However, they were outperformed by 
Models 5 and 10, generated using the MuDRA method, which was in 
agreement with the advanced performance of MuDRA in comparison

Fig. 2. Graphical representation of a self-organized map for the chemical space covered by modeling set chemicals. Red circles represent corrosives, yellow circles

there are similar compounds belonging to diﬀerent classes, which makes the construction of multiclassiﬁcation models a challenge. 
with other QSAR methods as reported by Alves and colleagues previ- 
ously [65] . The binary models for eye corrosion showed higher pre- 
dictivity. This could be because the eye corrosion dataset is smaller as 
compared to the eye irritation dataset. 
Obtaining high PPV values is crucial when dealing with toxicological 
endpoints as they indicate the ability of models to accurately predict 
toxic compounds. For eye irritation, we can see that PPV values ranged 
from 0.70 to 0.90 (with the lowest value from Model 2 and the highest 
value from Model 5). For eye corrosion, PPV values ranged from 0.65 
to 0.88 (with the lowest value from Model 6 and the highest value from 
Model 9). Overall, PPV values were above acceptable thresholds and 
reached high values (0.9), meaning that a prediction made by the two 
best models generated in this study for both eye irritation and corrosion 
would be correct with more than 85% certainty. 
Likewise, high NPV values are equally important as they provide 
the certainty of the prediction made by the model regarding the non- 
irritant/non-corrosive classes. Classifying a molecule correctly as non- 
irritant/non-corrosive is very important as an incorrect prediction could 
lead to eyes being damaged. NPV values for the models built in our study 
ranged from 0.77 to 0.85 for eye irritation and from 0.68 to 0.83 for 
eye corrosion. This shows that negative predictions made using our best 
models have at least 83% certainty. 
In analyzing sensitivity and speciﬁcity, other studies have reported 
that speciﬁcity values are usually higher than sensitivity values [ 45 , 67 ]. 
Here the sensitivity values’ range was 0.77–0.89 for eye irritation and 
0.61–0.84 for eye corrosion, while speciﬁcity values’ range was 0.56–
0.86 for eye irritation and 0.71–0.91 for eye corrosion. In our study, 
all models for eye irritation showed sensitivity values higher than speci- 
ﬁcity. For the eye corrosion models, the same pattern was observed only 
for Model 7 and Model 8, otherwise speciﬁcity value was higher than 
the sensitivity value. 
An additional cluster analysis was conducted to further investigate 
the better performance of MuDRA when compared to the models gen- 
erated using RF for eye irritation and eye corrosion endpoints. In this 
analysis, it was noticed that all compounds belonging to the biggest 
cluster of compounds of eye irritation dataset (six irritants and 11 non- 
irritants) were correctly predicted by MuDRA. Meanwhile, from those 17 
compounds within eye irritation dataset, the models built with RF algo- 
rithm combined with one type of molecular descriptor (Dragon, MACCS, 
Morgan, or RDKit) mis-predicted on average 7 of them (see Supplemen- 
tary File 9). 
Fig. 3 compares 1,646 correct predictions made by MuDRA, 1,446 
correct predictions made by RF_Dragon (Model 3), 1,436 correct predic- 
tions made by RF_MACCS (Model 4), 1,420 correct predictions made by 
RF_Morgan (Model 2), and 1,440 correct predictions made by RF_RDKit 
(Model 1). It shows that MuDRA was able to correctly predict 198 com- 
pounds that the other models were not. It is important to note that 1,081 
correct predictions were shared by all models. This reinforces the im- 
portance of data curation process as well as the use of best practices for 
QSAR modeling. On the other hand, when the overlap between all mis- 
predicted compounds was checked, it was noticed that 38 compounds 
(25 irritants and 13 non-irritants – see File S9) mis-predicted by all mod- 
els were predicted correctly only by MuDRA ( Fig. 4 ). 
Moreover, we observed that MuDRA was more accurate than RF 
models when making predictions for certain chemical classes, such as 
long chain hydrocarbons and fatty acid derivatives ( Fig. 4 ), such as 
ethyl tetradecanoate, 1,6-dioctyl-hexanedioate, 2-methylpropyl octade- 
cenoate, and 2-[2-( nonanoyloxy ) ethoxy ]ethyl nonanoate. However, as 
this cluster was composed by only 17 compounds, this is not enough 
to assure MuDRA superiority over RF models. Overall, MuDRA uses a 
broader descriptor space, which is able to capture more rigorously the 
structural diﬀerences between compounds, to identify the nearest neigh- 
bor, read-across it, and then return a more accurate prediction. 
Multiclass models 
Using the data and the GHS labeling system, multiclassiﬁcation mod- 
els were generated. We used three classes based on the GHS classiﬁ- 
cation: corrosive, irritant (comprised by classes 2A and 2B), and NC. 
Table 3 shows the overall statistical metrics for all multiclass models 
built in this study, averaged across the binary metrics for each class 
performance. 
Model 15, generated using the MuDRA method, outperformed the 
other RF models in all statistical metrics except sensitivity. Thus, the ma- 
jority of generated models using RF were above the acceptable thresh-

old. It is important to note that all metrics shown in Table 2 were cal- 
culated using each class’s mean. The statistical characteristics showed 
that all models performed poorly when classifying compounds on GHS 
classes 2A and 2B This class has also been shown to have the lowest re- 
producibility when analyzing replicate animal tests, demonstrating the 
potential unreliability of classiﬁcations that are based solely on one re- 
sult. However, the MuDRA method was able to handle the complexity 
of the data better by exploring the neighborhood of each compound and 
classifying them based on the nearest neighbor compound. 
We have shown that MuDRA models were the best performing mod- 
els in this work. As an external evaluation of model performance, we 
have predicted a set of 118 compounds extracted from Yamaguchi and 
colleagues’ study [68] . After dataset curation and preparation to remove 
compounds that were also present in our dataset, 107 compounds could 
be predicted. All 73 corrosive compounds and the 38 irritant compounds 
in the dataset were correctly classiﬁed, as well as the remaining 6 NC 
compounds. To further validate our approach, we made predictions of 
three compounds found in the literature and not included in our mod- 
eling set, that had been reported as capable of triggering moderate to 
serious issues in human eyes [69] . The compounds are glutaraldehyde 
[70] , Paraquat [ 71 , 72 ], and glyphosate [73] . All three were correctly 
predicted as being irritants. This reinforces the predictive power of the 
MuDRA approach and its applicability to important toxicological end- 
points such as eye irritation/corrosion. 
Virtual screening 
As a further application of our models, we have retrieved and care- 
fully curated 4780 compounds from the CosIng database and predicted 
their eﬀects on eye corrosion / irritation using the MuDRA models; com- 
plete details of the results are available in the supplementary material. In 
summary, our prediction identiﬁed 2003 compounds with the potential 
to cause eye irritation. We also predicted the eﬀects on eye irritation and 
corrosion of the Inactive Ingredients Database (IID) containing 4673 in- 
active ingredients using MuDRA based model. The subset of compounds 
used in the ophthalmic route of administration had 181 entries consist- 
ing of 76 unique ingredients. Among them, 24 were predicted as poten- 
tial eye irritants and 12 as corrosive, where most of these are reported

as a component of formulations such as ointments, solutions, suspen- 
sions, and eye drop products. The list of compounds predicted by our 
models as eye irritants and corrosion is available in the Supplementary 
Materials of the paper. 
Conclusions 
Eye irritation and corrosion are important toxicological endpoints for 
assessing chemical safety in humans and animals and respective tests are 
mandated by many regulatory agencies for the approval of a variety of 
products. The standard animal test for the evaluation of this endpoint is 
still the in vivo rabbit Draize test, a method developed decades ago and 
considered cruel, unreliable, and with questionable biological relevance 
to human exposure scenarios. Therefore, we aimed to develop predictive 
computational models using thoroughly curated data that could serve 
as NAMs for predicting eye irritation/corrosion potential of chemicals. 
Data curation is an extremely important factor in the development of 
robust and predictive ML models and a considerable amount of time 
was devoted to curating the ECHA dataset to ensure high quality train- 
ing/test data and to optimize the predictive power of the models gener- 
ated. All the curated data and developed models are available in KNIME 
workﬂows within the Supplementary Materials. These models presented 
high statistical characteristics. We have applied our models to predict 
a large publicly available cosmetics dataset (CosIng) as well as an Inac- 
tive Ingredient Dataset of chemicals commonly found in cosmetics and 
drugs. From CosIng database, 2003 compounds were predicted to cause 
damage to the eyes as corrosive/irritants; on the other hand, among 76 
unique compounds from the Inactive Ingredients Dataset related to the 
ophthalmic route, 12 were predicted as corrosive, and 24 were predicted 
as irritants. The predictions for these chemicals are publicly available in 
the Supplementary Materials that accompanies this publication. More- 
over, the models generated here are publicly available at the STopTox 
web portal ( https://stoptox.mml.unc.edu/ ). These models can be em- 
ployed as reliable alternatives to animal testing for identifying potential 
eye irritant/corrosive compounds.
