Abstract 
To optimize the 3-stages planetary gear reducer (PGR) in the Earth-Pressure-Balance Shield Machine (EPBSM), it is 
necessary to firstly define the EPBSM environment. The needed torque of the cutter-head, therefore, is analyzed when the 
EPBSM cutting the earth body. The load of any PGR is allocated according to the equivalent principle in the size between 
the force and its response one and the distributing uniformity of the PGRs around the main axle gear. Because the 
structure of the main drive system is equal to a huge planet-gear reducer made of 8 planetary gears, for the main axle 
connected with it gear, one side is connected with a bidentate coupling, the other is connected with an elastic shaft to 
realize the dual connection floatability of the main axle gear and support the whole main axle gear so that the relative 
displacement can be compensated to high degree among the PGRs resulting from the uneven force when the cutter-head 
cuts earth body.

excavate and cut soil, ship the residual soil, assemble tunnel lining, measure guidance rectification, and so on. 
It is involved in geology, civil construction, machinery, mechanics, hydraulic pressure, electrical science, 
control, measure, etc, and it is demanded that its design and manufacture are tailoring to the different geology 
so that it makes a very high request of reliability[1]. It is made up of shield body, cutter drive, double ventricle 
airbrake, the machine of piecing up the pipes, the organ of casting soil, post-match device, electrical system 
and other auxiliary equipment. Its operation principle is as follows. The output torque from the hydraulic 
motor is magnified by the planetary gear reducers (PGRs) to dive the cutter-head rotation when the propulsion 
hydro-cylinder of shied machine is opened to propel the shield machine forward. The soil is cut and falls into 
its chamber when the cutter-head continuously rotates. When the chamber is filled out, the screw conveyor is 
started to transport the soil to the belt one that can ship the soil to the boxes. They are transported to appointed 
place so that the soil is brought to earth surface by the shaft. The resistance will increase that the residual soil 
which is cut down from the excavation surface enters the chamber through the cutter groove when the soil in 
the chamber and screw conveyor accumulate to a certain degree, and while the pressure reach balance between 
the chamber, the excavation surface and the ground water, the excavation surface will keep stable so that the 
ground surface corresponding to the excavation one won’t collapse or uplift. If the amount of the soil falling 
into the chamber from the excavation surface is equal to the amount of the soil shipped out of the chamber by 
the screw conveyor, the excavation work will be carried out smoothly[2]. The structure of EPBSM is shown as 
Fig.1[2,3], here, the main drive system is made up of 8 identical PGRs in the structure and the hydraulic motor. 
Because the motive power of the EPBSM cutter-head originates from the output torque of the PGRs, while 
the needed torque of the cutter-head decides on the structures of the PGRs, therefore, besides grasping the 
basic principle of the EPBSM, we still analyze its force to guide the whole optimization for the high power 
and 3-stages PGRs in the EPBSM.

Where, T is the needed torque driving the cutter-head. D  is the outer diameter of shield machine. � is the 
torque coefficient, whose value varies from the outer diameter of shield machine and soil body, for the 
EPBSM, its value region is 1.4�2.3. 
3. Load allocation and equilibrium for PGRs of EPBSM 
In the course of cutting soil body, the needed torque of the cutterhead in the EPBSM directly originates 
from the 8 identical 3-stages PGRs in the structure that uniformly rank around the main axle gear, namely, the 
8 PGRs are the modified motive power equipment of the whole EPBSM, therefore, how to allocate and 
balance the load among them is the large artery that determines on healthy operation of the whole shield 
machine. 
3.1. Load allocation for PGRs of EPBSM 
Because the needed torqueT of the cutterhead comes from the transmission torque of the gear axles of the 
output terminal of the PGRs, if the number of PGRs is n , the output torque of a single PGR is 
0T , the 
graduated circle diameter of the gear in the shaft is 
1d , the graduated circle diameter of the gear in the main 
axle is 
2
d , then for any a pair of engagement force which is normal to gear surface, the following relation 
exists between the force and its response one according to the equal principle in their numerical values.

Here, 
0T  is the output torque of a single PGR. T  is the needed torque of the cutterhead. n  is the number of 
PGRs. �  is the uneven coefficient of load among PGRs. 
1d  and 
2
d  are the graduated circle diameter of the 
gear in the output shaft and the gear in the main axle, respectively. 
3.2. Load equilibrium for PGRs of EPBSM 
As can be seen from Fig.1, the 8 three-stages PGRs are uniformly assembled around the main axle gear, 
which is driven by the gear of output shaft of PGR, its structure, therefore, is equivalent to a large planetary-
type reducer that has 8 planet gears (the difference between them is that it hasn’t planet carrier and inner gear, 
the 8 planetary gears can only rotate around its own axis and can’t do around the main axle), its mechanism 
sketch is seen as Fig.2, so the factors that has an impact on the uneven coefficient Kp of the load among the 
planetary gears also influence the load nonuniformity among PGRs, for example the level of gear 
manufacturing precision, the degree of the load transmission, the stiffness of the component structure, gear 
material and tooth surface hardness, the run extent of the tooth surface, the level of engagement speed, the 
number of planetary gears, the property of the load-sharing device, and so on[6].

Fig.2 the diagram of connection mechanism and uniform load device between the output of PGR and the main axle of EPBSM 
Because the shafting motion of the output gear axles of PGRs and the main axle of the shield machine 
cutter-head is low speed and heavy load, we can assemble a bidentate coupling[7] and an elastic shaft in the 
main axle, as is shown in Fig.2. On one hand, one side of the coupling is connected with the main axle driven 
by the gear of PGRs, the other side is done with the main axle driving the cutter-head so that the relative 
displacement resulting from the uneven force from the cutter-head can be compensated to high degree, on the 
other hand, an elastic shaft is installed in the other side of the main axle, which can not only keep floatability, 
but support the main axle gear. Therefore, the relative displacement among the gear axles of PGRs resulting 
from the uneven force can be compensated to realize the load-sharing, so the uneven coefficient � of the load 
140

can be processed according to the uneven coefficient Kp, of the sun gear floatability in PGR, namely, 
� =1.1�1.15[8]. 
4. Illustrative example 
For some EPBSM, the outer diameter of its cutter-head D =6.4m, the transmission ratio of the 3-stages 
PGR i =51.2,the tooth number of the output axle gear of the PGR 
1z =37, the tooth number of the main axle 
gear
2z =331, gear modulus m =5mm,the number of PGRs n =8, It is demanded to estimate what is the torque 
value when the EPBSM operate in the common working condition, how to select the hydraulic motor to drive 
the PGR. 
If let the torque coefficient� =1.85, the uneven coefficient � =1.125, then during the operation of EPBSM, 
the torque of its cutter-head is 
T =1.85×6.43×104 = 484.9664×104 N�m 
The output torque of a single PGR is

Namely, to make the EPBSM operate normally, only the rated torque of the 8 hydraulic motors is no less 
than 1489 N�m can the 3-stages PGRs be driven. 
Therefore, we can determine on the demanded transmission ratio of PGRs and optimize its structure 
according to the demand of the output torque of PGRs and the hydraulic motors. 
5. Conclusions 
The cutterhead of the shield machine, which is the object driven by the output torque of PGR, is analyzed 
from the torque, then the load is assigned for every PGR, the uneven ones among PGRs are balanced by 
means of the dual connection floatability mechanism and an elastic shaft to define the environment of EPBSM 
for optimizing PGR, therefore, the high-power 3-stages PGR can be optimized and its innovative work can be 
developed.
