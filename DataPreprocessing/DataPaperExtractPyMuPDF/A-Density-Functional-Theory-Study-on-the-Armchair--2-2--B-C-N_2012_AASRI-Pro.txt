Abstract 
The ultra long tube models of single walled armchair (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes with different ratios of B, C and N atoms 
were studied with density functional theory of B3LYP/3-21G* and the periodic boundary conditions. The (2,2) B-C-N 
nanotubes have specially serrated tube structures. The energies were calculated and the band gaps of tubes were within 
0.062 eV to 3.874 eV showing metal, semiconductor or insulator conductivity.

1. Introduction 
The ternary system boron carbide nitride (B-C-N) nanotubes have attracted extraordinary attention in past 
ten years in virtue of  potentially interesting properties. The tubes synthesized by CVD experiment were found 
to be of semiconductor conductivity[1]. Photoluminescence studies revealed that aligned B-C-N nanotubes 
were also semiconductors exhibiting a band gap of 1.0eV[2]. Additionally, BC2N nanotubes might act as blue 
and violet light emitting materials such as an efficient field emitter[3–4].

The thinnest armchair carbon nanotube of (2,2) tubes was supposed in multi-walled carbon nanotubes 
(MWCNTs) preparation[5] and the cluster models of (2,2) tubes was studied by theory method[6]. In present 
work, the (2,2) B-C-N tubes with different atom ratio or the isomers with different atom arrangement were 
studied in the ultra long tube models, it was extended the research to their structure and band structure. 
2. Calculation method 
The density functional theory functional (B3LYP 3-21G*) and periodic boundary conditions (PBC) for 
one-dimensional models were employed by the Gaussian series packages[7] in this paper. All the tube 
structures, model energies and the band gaps were obtained by the theoretical calculation for optimized 
models. 
3. Result 
3.1. Structure parameter 
For the (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes with different atom ratios (the C atom ratios of 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4) and  
different atom arrangements, eight stable models were found and examined as shown in Figure 1(a) to (h). 
The tube structure parameters optimized with B3LYP/3-21G* were listed in Table 1.

As shown in figure 1, the (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes have serrated tubular structures as the pristine (2,2) 
carbon nanotube(CNT)[8]. It was found that there were two different kinds of chemical bond, which were the 
perpendicular (circumferential) bond lengths L1(the subscript 1 denotes the bond being perpendicular to the 
tube axis) and the oblique(axial) bond L2(the subscript 2 denotes the bond being oblique with respect to the 
tube axis), respectively. For most of (2,2) B-C-N models, L1were larger than that of the pristine (2,2) CNT 
where L1=0.1373 nm but  L2 were smaller than that  of the (2,2) CNT where L2=0.1512 nm[8]. 
The cross sections of (2,2) B-C-N tubes were distorted. Tube larger diameter (DL) or smaller diameter (DS) 
of tube models denoted the largest or shortest distance of two atoms in a same cross section. The slightly 
distorted models were with the values of DL/DS being 1.070 for the models BC6N(II) but larger values of 
DL/DS being 1.212 for the models B4C2N2(II).  
The Mülliken atomic charges were obtained. The doped atom B were found to be positive values (about 
0.66~0.85e) and those of the N atom were negative value (about -0.82~-0.59e), respectively. The Mülliken 
charge was negative value for C atom adjacent to B atom but positive value for them adjacent to N atom. The 
results were in accordance with the electrone-gativities of B, C and N atoms (respectively being 2.04, 2.55 
and 3.04 on the Pauling scale) [9].

3.2. Energy 
The doping energy ( Ed) as shown in Eq. (1) denoted the energy change between the doped and the pure 
cells averaged for each atom in the gas phase. 
Ed = [Ed,BxCyNz-NT – ECNT + (natom-y)EC atom – (x EB atom+zEN atom)] / natom                              (1) 
in which, Ed, Ed,BxCyNz-NT and ECNT denoted the energies of the unit cell model of the respective the (2,2) B-
C-N nanotube and the pristine CNT; EC atom, EN atom and EC atom denoted the energies of the single atom B, N 
and C; natom(i.e., natom =x+y+z =8 for (2,2) tube) was the number of the total atoms in a unit model. The doping 
energies Ed for the (2,2) B-C-N nanotube models obtained by Eq.(1) were detailed in Table 2.  
It was obvious that the model (I) where the C atom ratio being  3/4 (i.e., BC6N(I) and BC6N(II)) were the 
more stable conformation due to the lower doping energies Ed. For the same atom ratio models, Ed of (I) 
was lower than (II) and (III), representing that the model (I) was the most stable conformation.

3.3. Energy gap 
The one-dimensional  band structures of armchair (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes in the Brillouin zone for different 
models were shown in Figure 2. The energies of the high occupied crystal orbits (HOCO) (EHOCO), the low 
unoccupied crystal orbits (LUCO) (ELUCO) and the band gap (Eg= ELUCO - EHOCO) were detailed in Table 3. 
The default k point of wave vector was adopted in this work.  point was the centre of the first Brillouin 
zone and  point to X point was a half of Brillouin zone. It was found the models of B2C4N2(I), B4C2N2, 
B3C2N3(I) and B3C2N3 (III) have direct band gaps where the maximum of valence bands (occupied bands 
described by solids curves) and the minimum of conduction bands (unoccupied bands described by dashed 
curves) being in a same k point. For the rest models, the band gaps show indirect gaps where the maximum of 
valence band and the minimum of conduction band being in different k point. The maximum of direct band 
gaps for the most of models were at X point besides of the models of B2C4N2 and C2B3N3(II).

We have found (2,2) carbon nanotube[8] showing semiconductor  whereas BN-NTs[10] being isolator. It 
was interesting that the energy gap values of  (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes were within 0.062 to 3.874 eV showing 
metal, semiconductor or insulator conductivity. However, the band structure values or types depending on 
both the atom ratios and the types of atom arrangement. It was found the B4C2N2 showed the strongest 
metallic with the structure having two adjacent B atoms. The models [BC6N(I), B2C4N2(I) and B3C2N3(I)] 
containing the alternant straight -C-C-C-C and -B-N-B-N- strain were typical semiconductor conductivity 
whereas BC6N(II), B2C4N2(II) and B3C2N3 (II) had larger gap.

4. Summary 
The ultra long model of single walled armchair (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes with different ratios of B, C and 
N atoms were studied with density functional theory of B3LYP/3-21G*. The (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes have 
serrated tubular structures. The band gaps of tubes were within 0.062 to 3.874 eV showing metal, 
semiconductor or insulator conductivity, which depend on both the atom ratios and the types of atoms 
arrangement.
