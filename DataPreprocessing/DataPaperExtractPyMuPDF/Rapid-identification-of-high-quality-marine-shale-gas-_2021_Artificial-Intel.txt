High-quality reservoir identiﬁcation
A B S T R A C T
The identiﬁcation of high-quality marine shale gas reservoirs has always been a key task in the exploration and
development stage. However, due to the serious nonlinear relationship between the logging curve response and
high-quality reservoirs, the rapid identiﬁcation of high-quality reservoirs has always been a problem of low ac-
curacy. This study proposes a combination of the oversampling method and random forest algorithm to improve
the identiﬁcation accuracy of high-quality reservoirs based on logging data. The oversampling method is used to
balance the number of samples of different types and the random forest algorithm is used to establish a high-
precision and high-quality reservoir identiﬁcation model. From the perspective of the prediction effect, the
reservoir identiﬁcation method that combines the oversampling method and the random forest algorithm has
increased the accuracy of reservoir identiﬁcation from the 44% seen in other machine learning algorithms to 78%,
and the effect is signiﬁcant. This research can improve the identiﬁability of high-quality marine shale gas res-
ervoirs, guide the drilling of horizontal wells, and provide tangible help for the precise formulation of marine
shale gas development plans.
1. Introduction
Energy is an eternal necessity, and fossil energy accounts for a huge
proportion of total energy usage (Huang et al., 2018; Pang et al., 2021;
Aldhuhoori et al., 2021). Conventional oil and gas reserves have become
increasingly lower with continuous exploration and development. Un-
conventional reservoirs represented by shale gas have received growing
attention. Countries led by the United States and China have begun to
extract natural gas from shale (Zhu et al., 2021a–c; Pang et al., 2021;
Aldhuhoori et al., 2021). Research on marine shale gas reservoirs has
begun in earnest and the corresponding research understanding has
developed rapidly.
Shale gas reservoirs are too tight, requiring natural gas extraction
based on horizontal well technology (Sheng et al., 2020; Hou et al., 2021;
Wilson et al., 2016). Correspondingly, the efﬁcient and accurate identi-
ﬁcation of high-quality reservoirs has become a critical step. It is difﬁcult
to accurately evaluate the vertical changes of the entire well using only
core data, so it is necessary to use logging data for reservoir
identiﬁcation.
At present, the most common high-quality reservoir identiﬁcation
methods are still biased towards qualitative analysis. For example, Ma
et al. (2020) proposed the use of the T2 geometric mean value to evaluate
Longmaxi shale gas reservoirs. Wang et al. (2016) analysed and clariﬁed
special logging responses such as geochemical logging and nuclear
magnetic resonance logging for high-quality shale gas reservoirs in the
Niutitang Formation. Yan et al. (2014) discussed the possibility of
qualitatively identifying high-quality reservoirs using log response. He
et al. (2016) analysed the logging response characteristics of various
shale facies and distinguished favourable facies. Although there are many
qualitative studies, qualitative identiﬁcation methods obviously cannot
meet the needs of the shale development stage. Quantitative and rapid
reservoir identiﬁcation is more important. Some scholars have proposed
a quantitative identiﬁcation method for linear reservoirs based on maps
(Liu and Sun, 2015; Li et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021a); however, the
relationship between the logging response of most shale reservoirs and
the reservoir type has nonlinear characteristics, and the chart method
obviously does not meet this demand. Tahmasebi et al. (2017) used data
mining and machine learning methods to identify shale dessert layers and
performed purely data-driven shale dessert layer recognition. Zhang et al.
(2021) used the IPSO-SVM algorithm combined with element logging

curves to identify sweet spots in shale formations. Amosu et al. (2021)
used support vector machines to effectively identify high-quality reser-
voirs in the Eagle Ford Shale. Vikara et al. (2020) used the machine
learning-informed ensemble framework to solve the effective classiﬁca-
tion of Marcellus shale reservoirs. Although a variety of high-quality
reservoir identiﬁcation methods for shale have been proposed, there
are still some problems in the identiﬁcation of sweet beds. First, the
biggest problem is that the sample set used for modelling is unbalanced
due to the unavoidable biases of core sampling. This will lead to some
types of reservoirs that are not easy to predict and is worse when
high-quality reservoirs are not easy to identify. Second, the nonlinear
approximation capabilities of different algorithms are also different,
resulting in differences in prediction effects. This paper proposes a rapid
identiﬁcation framework for high-quality marine shale reservoirs that
combines the oversampling method and random forest algorithm to
quickly identify high-quality reservoirs in shale gas wells. This method
signiﬁcantly improves the identiﬁcation effect of high-quality reservoirs
and can provide help for the exploration and development of marine
shale gas reservoirs.
2. Method
In this study, there are two main techniques applied to the task of
reservoir identiﬁcation: oversampling methods (Tao et al., 2020; Sol-
tanzadeh and Hashemzadeh, 2021) to solve unbalanced data and random
forest algorithms (Ao et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2021) to solve classiﬁcation
problems. Combining these can achieve the purpose of quickly identi-
fying high-quality reservoirs and mitigate reservoir identiﬁcation accu-
racy problems due to inexperienced formation evaluation personnel and
differences in reservoir identiﬁcation models.
2.1. Random forest
Random forest is an ensemble learning algorithm based on decision
trees. It uses bootstrap technology to extract randomized samples from
original samples to construct a single decision tree. At each node of the
decision tree, a random feature subspace is used to select a sorting point.
Finally, these decision trees are combined to obtain the ﬁnal prediction
result through a majority vote. Before we have a deeper understanding of
random forests, we need to introduce decision trees ﬁrst because it is the
basic classiﬁer in the random forest algorithm.
Decision trees are a widely used tree-like classiﬁer. It starts from the
root node of the tree and continuously splits by selecting the optimal
column attributes to construct the tree nodes one by one until the stop-
ping condition for tree building is reached; for example, the data in the
leaf nodes are all of the same category. Compared with algorithms such
as neural networks, decision trees are very interpretable. Each path from
the root node to the leaf node represents a rule, and the decision tree is
based on these rules for classiﬁcation or prediction. When making pre-
dictions, the decision tree starts from the root node to determine the only
path to the leaf node. The majority category the samples in the leaf node
becomes the predicted value of the decision tree. According to the
different criteria applied when selecting the attributes for classiﬁcation,
common decision tree generation algorithms are ID3 and C4.5, based on
Shannon entropy splitting, and CART, based on Gini coefﬁcient classiﬁ-
cation (Tewari and Dwivedi, 2019). When used for classiﬁcation tasks,
the C4.5 algorithm is the most commonly used algorithm. Decision tree
splitting uses the information gain ratio as the splitting criterion, calcu-
lated as:
grðX; YÞ ¼ gðX; YÞ
HðYÞ
(1)
gðX; YÞ ¼ HðYÞ � HðYjXÞ
(2)
where g(X, Y) refers to the information gain and the degree of uncertainty
of the event, which is calculated by subtracting conditional entropy from
entropy. The information gain ratio adds a penalty term H(Y|X) on the
basis of the information gain. The calculation formula for the penalty is:
H
 
YjXÞ ¼
X
n
i¼1
piHðYjX ¼ xi
!
(3)
Correspondingly, the calculation formula of entropy is:
HðpÞ ¼ �
X
n
i¼1
pilog2pi
(4)
The greater the entropy, the greater the amount of information con-
tained, and the greater the uncertainty. The establishment of a decision
tree essentially differentiates the data layer by layer by formulating rules
so that the uncertainty of the data after classiﬁcation is gradually
reduced.
A decision tree is a single classiﬁer. Although it is very interpretable,
due to the limitations of its own model, there is a bottleneck in its

performance improvement, which leads to unsatisfactory training and
prediction accuracy. To solve this problem, an ensemble learning algo-
rithm is used to integrate multiple decision trees. Bagging and boosting
are two categories of algorithms in ensemble learning. Bagging algo-
rithms uniformly randomly sample from the original data so that the
training of each basic classiﬁer in the ensemble is independent of the
others. The process of the random forest algorithm can be divided into
three parts:
① Bootstrap sampling of samples, that is, at the beginning of con-
structing the tree (training the model), random sampling with
replacement is performed from the training dataset Dn, sampling
the same number of n data points.
② Carry out the selection of random feature subspace. Each new
subdataset formed by sampling is used to construct the corre-
sponding random forest decision tree. When splitting tree nodes,
ﬁrst randomly sample m features (m<D) from the most primitive
D features, then select split features and split points from the
feature subspace formed by these m features. The selection cri-
terion is a decrease in the information gain ratio. The above
process is repeated to construct the tree nodes one by one until the
stopping conditions are met. These stopping conditions can be
that all the data in the subdatasets are distinguished or the number
of samples in the leaf nodes is less than a preset threshold.
③ Voting predictions. The decision tree of each basic classiﬁer is
used to make independent predictions ﬁrst to obtain the
discriminative category of the new data, then the results from
each tree are used to output the ﬁnal separate results by means of
majority voting. Fig. 1 shows the prediction process of random
forest.
2.2. The oversampling method for unbalanced datasets
An unbalanced dataset is a very difﬁcult problem in actual machine
learning prediction, especially when the total number of samples is
insufﬁcient or the cost of obtaining samples is too high. In the classiﬁ-
cation task, if the number of samples in different categories in the pro-
cessed dataset is quite unequal, the direct use of machine learning
algorithms for training will lead to poor prediction results. Such a
training dataset is called unbalanced. In the unbalanced dataset, the
category with a large sample size is called the majority category, and the
category with a small sample size is called the minority category. In many
practical scenarios, the number of minority types is small and difﬁcult to
identify, but these samples may contain critical information. If there are a
large number of discriminative errors in the classiﬁcation of these sam-
ples, it may cause a very serious impact, especially when the categories of
these samples are the categories we care about most. Traditional machine
learning algorithms will assume that the sample sizes of different cate-
gories are similar. What these algorithms care about is how to ensure the
classiﬁcation accuracy of the entire dataset, which will bias the model
towards categories with the most samples during the classiﬁcation pro-
cess. Based on these factors, when dealing with the problem of imbal-
ance, the data need to be specially processed to improve the balance of
the dataset.
Oversampling alleviates the imbalance between the categories by
expanding the size of the samples of the minority categories while
maintaining the original scale for the samples of the majority categories.
Oversampling methods include nonheuristic and heuristic algorithms.
The typical nonheuristic method is random oversampling. In this way,
the size of the minority types of samples is increased by simply copying
some of the minority types of samples. The random oversampling method
is relatively simple and convenient to apply and can help the prediction
result. In this paper, the oversampling method is selected to rebalance
datasets in the reservoir identiﬁcation problem based on logging as much
as possible.
3. Data
3.1. Block
Block X in the study area, located in the southern part of the Sichuan
Basin, is a marine overmature shale gas reservoir. High-quality reservoirs
are located in the Lower Ordovician Longmaxi Formation-Upper Silurian
Wufeng Formation, with a burial depth of approximately 3500 m or
more, and belong to deep shale gas reservoirs (Zhu et al., 2019). The
shale in the study area belongs to the main shale gas development ho-
rizon in China and is dominated by black shale with relatively developed
nanoscale organic pores. The total organic carbon content in the study
area is 0–8%, the porosity ranges from 0 to 9.44%, and the clay content
ranges from 10 to 59%. The total gas content of high-quality reservoirs
can be higher than 6 m3/t. Since most of the shale gas reservoirs in the
Sichuan Basin will be constructed in horizontal wells during the devel-
opment stage, this makes the rapid determination of high-quality reser-
voirs of great signiﬁcance, so this paper attempts to quickly identify
high-quality reservoirs using our algorithms.
3.2. Data characteristics
We selected the logging data and core data of 3 key wells for rapid
identiﬁcation of high-quality reservoirs. A total of 76 cores in these 3
wells were subjected to helium porosity experiments, TOC content ex-
periments, and X-ray diffraction experiments. The results of these ex-
periments are usually used to divide high-quality reservoirs. We combine
the high-quality reservoir classiﬁcation standards in the study area given
in the literature and core data to give the high-quality reservoir types
corresponding to all cores, as shown in Table 1. Among them, the
selected standards are TOC content, porosity, and clay mineral content.
Combined with the standards in this table, the reservoir types cor-
responding to the 76 cores can be determined. After this classiﬁcation,
the number of cores corresponding to different reservoir types is counted.
The statistical results are shown in Table 2.
Two key pieces of information can be obtained from the classiﬁcation
results of reservoir categories in different wells. The ﬁrst point is that
there are certain differences in the distribution of reservoir types be-
tween different wells. For Well B, type I reservoirs account for the largest
proportion of all reservoirs. This is consistent with the current under-
standing of the block. Well B has a higher single-well production and is
also the most studied well. The difference in the proportion of Type I
reservoirs between different wells is large, which also emphasizes the
task of reservoir identiﬁcation, especially for high-quality reservoirs that
have a small number of cores and are relatively short for development
plans. Recognition is a very meaningful work. The second point is that
there are differences in the number of different reservoir types in any

well, and the number of core samples corresponding to Type I reservoirs
is relatively small. This is because the thickness of the highest quality
reservoirs in the study area is relatively lower than that of other types of
reservoirs. They are thin, so it is very important to ﬁnd Type I reservoirs
and drill horizontal wells. The small number of core samples corre-
sponding to Type I reservoirs leads to the fact that when modelling the
reservoir identiﬁcation process, the model tends to classify Type I res-
ervoirs as other types of reservoirs, resulting in the inability to accurately
ﬁnd Type I reservoirs. The exploration and development of shale gas is
very challenging.
In this study, Well A was used as the predicted well, and Wells B and C
were used as for model training. Because the amount of core data for
different reservoir types is unequal, the sample needs to be expanded.
According to the oversampling method, the number of cores in Type I,
Type II, and Type III reservoirs was expanded by randomly selected
methods in the datasets from Wells B and C, and the total number of cores
in the four types of reservoirs was increased to 30. The corresponding
core intersection diagram for the expanded dataset is shown in Fig. 2. The
different types of reservoirs clearly cannot be directly divided by linear
models and the traditional method based on intersection graphs cannot
obtain reliable results.
4. Result
The random forest algorithm is used to try to build a model based on
the core data of Wells B and C. Well A is used as a blind well that does not
participate in the modelling process to test the algorithm. This is also
because the data volume of Well A is smaller than those of Wells B and C
and is relatively unsuitable for modelling. The sample numbers of Wells
A, B, and C are 9, 19, and 48, respectively, so the number of samples
involved in modelling is 67 and in testing is 9. This is also shown in
Table 2. Since the split criteria of the basic classiﬁer-decision tree algo-
rithm are relatively ﬁxed, in a strict sense, the parameters that need to be
determined most should be the number of random forest trees and the
selected logging curve characteristics. We use the out-of-bag error as a
test of the modelling effect to analyse the selection of hyperparameters
(Otchere D. A., 2021). The calculation method for out-of-bag error is to
use the established decision tree to predict the samples that were not
drawn when each decision tree was established and count the prediction
results of these samples. We used the data of Wells B and C to model and
explore the best combination of input logging curves and the best number
of decision trees. We used all logging curves to model, chose a log curve
to remove, then and remodelled to compare the results. The corre-
sponding out-of-bag error results are shown in Fig. 3. Out-of-bag error is
actually a method of model validity testing because out-of-bag data do
not participate in the establishment of each decision tree in the random
forest.
It is clear from Fig. 3 that for the random forest algorithm, the AC
logging curve has a negative effect on the accuracy of the model. When
the AC curve is removed, the prediction accuracy of the model improves.
Current research shows that sonic logging in the study area is not closely
related to the TOC content of the reservoir, the porosity of the reservoir,
or the clay content of the reservoir (Zhu et al., 2021a). It is suspected to
be caused by factors such as pore pressure and fractures. The information
provided by the CNL logging curve is not helpful for improving the ac-
curacy of the model. Other curves have played a positive role in the
prediction results, especially DEN and RMSF logging. Therefore, we
choose the 5 curves of density log (DEN), gamma ray log (GR), micro-
sphere focused resistivity logging (RMSF), RD, and RS to establish the
ﬁnal model. Combining the results of out-of-bag errors, we can determine
that as the number of decision trees in the random forest increases, the
out-of-bag errors basically decrease or remain stable. Results also show
that random forest is very suitable for the task of high-quality reservoir
identiﬁcation and there is no obvious overﬁtting phenomenon. Based on

these results, we chose 300 decision trees for modelling. After modelling,

(Table
3).
The
corresponding
RFþoversampling prediction results are shown in Fig. 4.
It can be seen from Table 3 and Fig. 4 that the model obtained by
using the modelling method proposed in this paper has a prediction ac-
curacy of 78% for the core sample of Well A and an error rate of 22%.
Moreover, the type of misjudgement mainly appears between Type II and
Type III, and the accuracy of identifying Type I reservoirs is 100%. To
facilitate the comparison, we use the original sample set and the over-
sampled set as the training data for the KNN algorithm, the support
vector machine, and the random forest algorithm, then predict the core of
Well A with each model. The results of the reservoir types predicted
based on the logging data of the entire interval of Well A are shown in
Fig. 5.
It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the prediction results of the whole well
section of different methods are still very different. Compared with other
algorithms, KNN may be less suitable for the identiﬁcation of high-
quality marine shale gas reservoirs. The prediction results given will
jump throughout the depth section, especially for Type III and Type IV
reservoirs. The problem with Bayes' prediction results is that its evalua-
tion effect is not good for the best quality reservoir section. From the core
reservoir classiﬁcation results of Well A, it can be seen that high-quality
reservoirs are mainly concentrated at the bottom of the entire reservoir,
and this depth section is also the place where the reservoir type changes
most frequently. When drilling a horizontal well, the best drilling depth is
likely to come from this depth section. Using the prediction results of the
Bayes algorithm to determine the drilling position of a horizontal well is
less likely to be accurately determined. The random forest algorithm
combined with the oversampling method and the random forest algo-
rithm without the oversampling method have more reliable prediction

results. Of the two prediction results, the random forest algorithm com-
bined with the oversampling method is more reliable than the core result.
Moreover, it also predicted the existence of Type I reservoirs at

ing signiﬁcance for the drilling of horizontal wells. Using the random

5. Conclusion
An increasing number of blocks of shale gas reservoirs have passed
the exploration stage and have begun to enter the development stage.
This puts forward high requirements for the rapid identiﬁcation of high-
quality marine shale gas reservoirs based on logging. This article con-
ducts research on this task and proposes a rapid identiﬁcation study of
high-quality marine shale gas reservoirs based on the oversampling
method and random forest algorithm. Through a series of studies in this
article, the following conclusions can be drawn:
① Since the thickness of high-quality reservoirs is usually smaller
than that of general reservoirs, training sample sets under-
represent these critical samples and model predictions tend to be
more accurate for general reservoirs. In this paper, the over-
sampling method is used to make the number of training samples
of each type of reservoir equal and 67 core samples were
expanded to 112 samples. The increase in the number of samples
reduces the bias of model building.
② Using the random forest algorithm, nearest neighbour algorithm,
and support vector machine algorithm to predict high-quality
reservoirs, we showed that the random forest algorithm ach-
ieved the best prediction results. In addition to the prediction
accuracy of the other algorithms being lower than that of the
random forest algorithm, they also have relatively poorer pre-
diction effects for the highest quality Type I reservoirs. The
random forest algorithm can achieve the best prediction results,
increasing the prediction accuracy from 44% to 78%.
Finally, this research showed that the combination of the over-
sampling method and random forest algorithm can quickly identify high-
quality marine shale gas reservoirs and thereby provide tangible help for
the development of marine shale gas reservoirs.
