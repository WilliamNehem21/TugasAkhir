1. Introduction 
Feb 2021 marked the 20 th anniversary of the publication of two sem- 
inal papers that revealed the ﬁrst ﬁndings of the Human Genome Project 
[1–3] . This provides an opportunity to reﬂect on how knowledge of the 
human genome and its use in developing more eﬀective treatments for 
diseases has progressed (or not) [ 4 , 5 ], and which challenges remain to 
be overcome, potentially enabled by a new generation of AI methods. 
Genomic and precision medicine have been revolutionary in improv- 
ing treatment options in cancer and rare diseases. Optimism for future 
progress is however tempered by unexpected failures to achieve the 
same level of insights and impact across all diseases. Outside of cancer 
and rare disease, the impact of genomic medicine has been lower than 
originally anticipated. This is true even in disorders like Alzheimer’s dis- 
ease where key genetic risk factors such as ApoE have long been iden- 
tiﬁed [ 6 , 7 ], but which has nonetheless suﬀered from an almost total% 
clinical trials failure rate [54] . 
This failure has signiﬁcantly limited the extension of precision 
medicine approaches into more complex chronic diseases such as neu- 
rodegenerative, metabolic, immunological, respiratory, cardiovascular 
and neuropsychiatric disorders. These diseases have large pockets of un- 
met medical need, impose a huge socioeconomic burden, and account 
for around 85% of healthcare costs, but have so far been impacted rel- 
atively little by genomic insights. 
In large part, this is a consequence of the biological assumptions un- 
derpinning some of the most ubiquitous analytical methods that we use, 
including Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS). GWAS analyze the 
distribution of one mutation at a time to ﬁnd those overrepresented in 
a case vs a control population [9] . GWAS are useful for ﬁnding the low- 
hanging fruit of the simpler forms of disease-variant associations [10] . 
They work relatively well for cancer and rare diseases as these condi- 
tions are often caused by single mutations occurring in protein coding 
regions, which produce a large eﬀect size that is relatively easy to spot 
in a case:control study. 
GWAS and techniques based on their outputs such as polygenic 
risk scores [11] and gBLUP methods [12] are however inherently in- 
capable of fully reﬂecting the polygenic and pleiotropic complexity of 
chronic disease endotypes and phenotypic traits. Their analytical ap- 
proaches and the assumptions underpinning them (e.g., the linear ad-

ditivity of features, the relative importance of rare variants, principles 
of Mendelian inheritance and the presumed accuracy of a single disease 
diagnosis across a heterogeneous patient population) impose a detection 
level limit that we need to overcome to deliver the beneﬁts of genomics 
more widely in precision medicine and selective breeding applications 
in crops and livestock. 
2. Respecting the biological complexity of chronic diseases 
Chronic diseases are heterogenous and polygenic; they exhibit a 
wide spectrum of symptoms, their diagnoses contain multiple patient 
sub-groups with diﬀerent disease aetiologies, severities and therapy re- 
sponses, and many are relatively late onset conditions with signiﬁcant 
clinical and epidemiological confounders. 
This complexity means that a simple ‘single feature at a time’ ap- 
proach like GWAS is unhelpfully divorced from the biological causes of 
chronic diseases. It makes it hard to accurately identify a set of causal 
variants/genes, and the results of GWAS may be incomplete or even 
suspect in chronic diseases. 
For example, many of the ‘causal’ genes originally found by GWAS 
in cardiovascular disease (CVD) have subsequently been re-evaluated 
and their disease relevance repudiated [13–15] . Diseases like CVD and 
Alzheimer’s are now thought to be caused both by ultra-rare Mendelian 
variants with high eﬀect sizes aﬀecting a small minority of patients 
and by multiple other genetic and non-genetic factors that modulate 
most patients’ endotypes via complex mechanisms including incomplete 
dominance, variable expressivity, epistasis and other combinatorial non- 
linear interactions [16] . 
This is not surprising – the iconic IUBMB-Nicholson Metabolic Path- 
ways Chart [17] reinforces the inherent complexity of cellular biology. 
This beautiful and crowded chart reveals some of the complex inter- 
play of intersecting and interacting networks of genetic, epigenetic and 
metabolic control factors that control both normal cellular function and 
disease processes. 
Feedback (and feedforward) regulated processes are subtly balanced 
in normal metabolism, acting to amplify or inhibit pathways depending 
on their metabolic context and conditions [18] . They contain rapid feed- 
back mechanisms such as the modulation of protein activity via post- 
translational modiﬁcations or the allosteric binding of small molecule

ligands, and slower ones such as changes in gene expression. These are 
however predominantly dynamic and non-linear [19] . 
This non-linearity of the underlying biology is an inconvenient truth 
that has been largely overlooked in the ﬁeld of genomic analysis. In 
Alzheimer’s disease alone 1,000 genetic association studies and 75 
GWAS have been performed [20] resulting in just 29 risk genes iden- 
tiﬁed [21] and no new therapies approved. Some practitioners will si- 
multaneously acknowledge the multi-factorial nature of complex dis- 
eases such as Alzheimer’s or type-II diabetes but ignore the importance 
of epistatic and other non-linear eﬀects, preferring to search ever larger 
datasets for ever rarer variants to attempt to improve their models in- 
ﬁnitesimally [ 22 , 23 ]. While there will always be new rare variants to be 
discovered, these are not the only or perhaps even the most important 
signals missing from our models of disease. 
In fact, the non-linear additive eﬀects of feedback loops, epistasis 
and other interactions are key for understanding chronic disease biology 
and how it impacts patient populations [ 24 , 25 ]. They enable eﬀective 
patient stratiﬁcation, and help overcome issues of poor risk prediction 
models, missing heritability and unexplained genetic variance, without 
resorting to an unhelpfully imprecise inﬁnitesimal or omnigenic view of 
chronic disease or other complex biological traits [ 26 , 27 ]. 
3. Single feature vs combinatorial analytics 
Single feature based methods, however sophisticated, cannot capture 
or represent the inherent non-linearity of biological interactions. The 
challenge is analogous to guessing the winning hand in a game of poker. 
A single feature method might add together the face value of the cards 
in each hand (similar to the odds ratios for single SNPs) using a scoring 
scheme like that shown in Fig. 1. 
If we dealt hands of ﬁve cards to four players (as shown in Fig. 2 ) and 
added up their face values we would ﬁnd that they have face value totals 
of 60, 69, 20 and 18 respectively. Working from this limited informa- 
tion, and knowing that higher cards win over lower cards in otherwise 
equivalent hands, you would be justiﬁed in predicting one of the highest 
scores on the left as the winning hand. 
In fact, the hand in the top right is a straight ﬂush, the second highest 
hand in poker and, in spite of a face value score of just 20, the winner. 
In this analogy, the combination of cards is much more important to 
(and predictive of) the outcome than either the individual cards in the 
hand or their summed face values. This signal can only be found using 
an inherently combinatorial approach. 
The same is true in genetics, where we have based most of our target 
discovery analyses and disease/trait prediction models, such as poly- 
genic risk scores (PRS), on the odds ratios of single mutations’ disease 
associations calculated individually in isolation. PRS attempt to synthe- 
size a patient’s full genotype data into a single score that predicts ge-

netic risk for a disorder or trait [28] . gBLUPs do a similar job for the 
heritability of phenotypic traits in livestock and crop species account- 
ing for covariance based on genetic factors in a mixed model framework 
[29] . 
PRS are usually calculated using a selected set of the most signiﬁ- 
cantly disease associated SNPs (from a GWAS), summing an individual’s 
risk alleles using Bayesian or linear regression methods usually weighted 
by allele frequency and eﬀect size. As the odds ratios of GWAS derived 
SNPs are assumed to be linearly additive in most polygenic risk scores 
for complex diseases, the limitations of GWAS discussed above, and the 
inability to stratify the speciﬁc disease associated factors relevant to dif- 
ferent patient sub-groups also adversely aﬀect the predictive accuracy 
of such scores. 
4. Combinatorial analytics reveals chronic disease biology 
Combinatorial analysis on the other hand attempts to identify combi- 
nations of features that when they occur together are highly associated 
with a phenotype (occurring in many cases and relatively few controls). 
The features may include SNPs, CNVs and/or other clinical, transcrip- 
tomic, epigenetic, epidemiological, environmental or other factors. The 
structure of a sixth order phenotype associated combination can be seen 
in Fig. 3 . 
Using combinatorial analysis we can ﬁnd additional signal in patient 
datasets that is invisible to existing GWAS and other genetic analysis 
methods [30–32] . This power to ﬁnd this ’missing’ signal is illustrated 
by a meta-analysis of the various large-scale studies that have been per- 
formed into the genetic factors underpinning COVID-19 host response 
as it relates to disease susceptibility and severity.

COVID-19 surprised the medical community by the range of its symp- 
toms. Rather than a pure viral infection and inﬂammasome/cytokine 
response, the disease has had widespread, potentially long-term eﬀects 
across a range of tissues [ 33 , 34 ]. As data became available at the begin- 
ning of the pandemic, GWAS analysis of very large patient populations 
were run by various groups. 
A GWAS study involving 1,131 severe patients and 15,434 mild con- 
trols identiﬁed one locus associated with high risk of developing severe 
COVID-19 around the ABO blood group gene and another locus on chro- 
mosome 3 [35] . This study was then extended in a global eﬀort that ran 
GWAS on genomic data from 13,641 severe disease patients and over 
2 million controls, identifying four genome-wide signiﬁcant loci that 
are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 11 associated with severe 
manifestations of COVID-19 [55] . 
Most of these correspond to previously documented genes with asso- 
ciations to lung or autoimmune and inﬂammatory diseases. The symp- 
tomology of COVID-19 however extends much further than can be ex- 
plained by these ﬁndings into neurological, coagulation and cardiovas- 
cular, renal and other consequences beyond inﬂammation driven dis- 
ease. 
In contrast, a previous study using a combinatorial analytics ap- 
proach had been run several months earlier on the very ﬁrst COVID-19 
datasets available from UK Biobank [ 38 , 39 ], with just a few hundred 
severe patients, while controlling for all the existing known predispos- 
ing co-morbidities [40] . This study, working oﬀ much smaller datasets 
than the GWAS studies, identiﬁed 156 severe disease associated loci 
that mapped to 68 protein coding genes, spread across a range of mech- 
anisms. 
Many novel targets were identiﬁed that are involved in key se- 
vere COVID-19 pathology and disease mechanisms, including produc- 
tion of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, endothelial cell dysfunction, lipid 
droplets, neurodegeneration and viral susceptibility factors. The novel 
disease associated mechanisms identiﬁed in this genetics based study 
were replicated and validated by subsequent combinatorial analysis of 
de-identiﬁed COVID-19 patient health records (non-genetic data com- 
prising longitudinal diagnosis, claims and lab data) in the UnitedHealth 
Group COVID-19 Data Suite [41] . Several of the novel targets have also 
been subsequently validated in collaborative studies into drug repurpos- 
ing using viral plaque assays and other disease models [ 42 , 43 ]. 
5. Patient stratiﬁcation in chronic disease 
Chronic diseases often present a spectrum of symptoms with varied 
treatment responses across patients who share a diagnosis. There may 
be multiple pathways leading to the key diagnostic phenotypes – for 
example bronchoconstriction and wheezing in asthmatics, or cycles of 
mania and depression in bipolar patients, and variations in response 
may reﬂect diﬀerent disease aetiologies and inﬂuences. Because of this 
diversity within a disease population, GWAS (whose signals must be sig- 
niﬁcant across the whole population) often cannot ﬁnd all of the causes 
of a disease, or accurately stratify patient subgroups within the whole 
population. 
Combinatorial analysis can help with patient stratiﬁcation, distin- 
guishing the diﬀerent disease causes for multiple subpopulations (en- 
dotypes) even in highly heterogenous diseases such as asthma [44] . 
Asthma patients can be categorized into two molecular phenotypes; 
those with high T-helper cell type 2 (eosinophilic/T2) expression and 
those without (non-T2). The latest developments in treatment options 
for severe, uncontrolled asthma have focused on the T2 cytokine path- 
way, but these exhibit no beneﬁt to patients with non-T2 disease [45] . 
It was however unclear whether the sub-groups represented diﬀerent 
disease populations (endotypes) or simply diﬀerent stages of disease, 
epidemiological sensitization factors or environmental triggers. 
Combinatorial analysis of 7,094 T2 cases and 15,071 non-T2 cases 
enabled the identiﬁcation of combinations (up to 5 th order) of features 
associated with the patients’ asthma diagnosis. By tracking which pa- 
tients contain the SNPs identiﬁed in these combinations, the SNPs can 
be clustered to show how they are distributed across the patient pop- 
ulation and how they correlate with the molecular phenotypes of the 
clearly distinguishable patient subgroups. 
This analysis generates detailed disease insights showing mechanis- 
tically explanatory diﬀerences between the two endotypes ( Fig. 4 ) and 
several novel druggable targets for the non-T2 sub-group [46] . Many of 
the signiﬁcant genes found in the T2 subtype are involved in well-known 
processes such as Type 2 immune response, positive regulation of IL-5 
and IL-13 production and lymphocyte diﬀerentiation, whereas genes as- 
sociated with the non-T2 population, are involved in non-immune path- 
ways, including fatty acid synthesis, LDL oxidation and modulators of 
GABA, purinergic and glutamate signalling. 
6. Combinatorial analytics for complex health, production and 
fertility traits in livestock and crops 
The same limitations we ﬁnd in GWAS also aﬀect our ability to iden- 
tify features with signiﬁcant predictive value for complex health, pro- 
ductivity and fertility traits in selective breeding applications in live- 
stock and plant genetics. In animal and crop applications the inﬁnitesi- 
mal model has been central to selective breeding applications since the 
late 19 th century. Fisher showed in 1919 [47] that phenotypic trait val- 
ues and their (co)variances can be broken down into components within 
pedigree structures, and that some level of phenotypic variance is con- 
sistent with multiple Mendelian factors acting additively. This limited 
signal has been good enough to improve the phenotype within heavily 
in-bred pedigrees across multiple species. 
Classical quantitative genetics predicts traits as a linear combina- 
tion of a set of variance components, with their coeﬃcients determined 
by allele frequency. Selection – for example within selective breeding 
programmes – can change the trait mean, at a rate proportional to the 
additive genetic variance. However, when the trait depends on large 
numbers of genes, each of which makes a small contribution, selection 
has a negligible eﬀect on the variance contributed by any individual 
locus. This is a clear indication of the non-linearity of the underlying 
biology. 
Existing tools obviously have some explanatory power but are failing 
to ﬁnd all of the available signal. Even within very heavily inbred popu- 
lations with highly selected phenotypes, there is considerable room for 
non-linear interactions to be used to improve genetic prediction models 
that have previously been based on GWAS results. 
For example, egg weight is an economically important trait for laying 
hens. Egg weight is however thought to be lowly heritable in older birds 
and better phenotype prediction could lead to yield improvements. A 
combinatorial analytics approach was used with a publicly available 
dataset of 1,027 pure bred and highly selected Rhode Island Red hens 
with 300,000 SNPs per bird [48] . The study identiﬁed combinations (up 
to 5 th order) comprised of 2,018 highly predictive SNPs, mapping to 122 
genes that correlated with increased egg weight for birds at 56 weeks of 
age. 
Conversion of the SNP combinations into a standard genomic predic- 
tion model showed a 49% increase in phenotype prediction accuracy as 
well as a materially wider estimated breeding value distribution com- 
pared with standard breeding models based on GWAS and gBLUPs. Used 
to power a targeted selective breeding strategy, this can be expected to 
result in signiﬁcantly increased genetic gain in laying hen breeding. 
7. Computational challenges of combinatorial methods 
Evaluating fully and in a hypothesis free manner the non-linearity 
of interacting endogenous and exogenous factors associated with a phe- 
notype remains computationally challenging. The number of possible 
combinations to be evaluated expands exponentially as the combinato- 
rial order increases.

pathway enrichment results for T2 vs non-T2 
asthma sub-groups showing clear segregation 
of between T2 (left) and non-T2 (right) pa- 
tients. 
In a study with a 3-state SNP genotype model this increases accord- 
ing to n ! • 3 r / r !( n – r )! where n = the total number of SNPs and r = the 
maximum combinatorial order. In a study with 550,000 SNPs, the num- 
ber of 6-combinations is 1 × 10 35 . For such a study, each additional 
step in combinatorial order increases the number of combinations to be 
tested by a factor of about 10 6 . This becomes even more problematic if 
a large number of cycles of permutation are used to correct for multiple 
sampling. 
Despite these serious challenges, the past few years have seen de- 
velopment of methods beginning to identify higher-order interactions. 
Their underlying statistical models can be based on frequentist (regres- 
sion or simple statistic, e.g., chi-squared), Bayesian, or AI approaches. 
Typically, regression or AI models can correct for other covariates (such 
as environmental factors) and can assess SNP interactions not only in 
binary disease phenotypes, but also in quantitative traits. 
Exhaustive (i.e., hypothesis-free) methods have been used to identify 
genetic co-expression networks [49] and pairwise associations between 
genes (traditional epistasis) [50] . Those based on brute force GWAS 
methods do not however scale well to higher-order regulatory patterns. 
Hypothesis driven methods that test only a reduced, preselected set 
of features chosen based for example on pathway information have also 
been proposed [51] , but these methods are likely by design to miss a 
large number of unexpected combinations [52] . These approaches how- 
ever still require huge compute power and even with their signiﬁcant 
compromises can lack statistical power. Consequently, they have been 
limited to subsets of the lower orders, and the functional interactions of 
high-order combinations have not yet been systematically explored. 
This provides huge opportunities for innovative new methods, es- 
pecially using massively parallel computational architectures such as 
GPUs, to explore new and generate new disease insights for complex, 
chronic diseases such as bipolar disease [53] . 
8. Remaining challenges in a combinatorial world 
Combinatorial methods do not by themselves solve all of the prob- 
lems associated with analyzing complex patient or animal datasets. The 
disease heterogeneity and number of samples available in a dataset will 
limit the combinatorial order of the associations that can be validated 
statistically, meaning that very small datasets will not be amenable to 
this approach. The results will also remain inherently rooted in and de- 
pendent on the populations under study and will be most relevant to 
these groups. 
Population structure eﬀects and inconsistent diagnosis/phenotype 
measurements will continue to have an impact on the accuracy even of 
combinatorial analytics methods and the predictive tools built on their 
ﬁndings. However, rather than being smeared by the population averag- 
ing eﬀect of GWAS, these eﬀects will tend to be more obvious, manifest- 
ing as clear disease sub-groups with diﬀerent ancestries and/or pheno- 
type metrics (e.g. smoking, BMI, prescription history, environment etc.) 
than other subgroups. 
Combinatorial methods do nonetheless oﬀer the potential for trans- 
formational insight into the complexity of biology underpinning chronic 
diseases and complex health, production and fertility traits in animal 
and crop production. The ability to identify and apply the non-linear 
signals underpinning complex biological processes could lead to much 
more widespread and accurate use of genomic and precision medicine 
approaches outside just the oncology and rare disease spaces. It may also 
lead to much more accurate genetic prediction models that can help im- 
prove the eﬃciency, environmental footprint and security of agriculture 
and the food production system.
