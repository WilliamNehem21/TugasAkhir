As known in any social networks, agents perform actions, which in order produce different types of 
connections. These actions have more impact on a broad range virtually than in the real life. This is because 
these spontaneous actions that the agents perform are not usually linked in the organization with a sorted type 
of structure, such as hierarchy, holarchy or others. In light of this, a SNO becomes the best fit to describe such 
style of organizations. Further attributes contributing to this type of organization are characterized by 
describing salient qualities of interest in order to measure the quality of interactions and their effect on the 
social capital of the organization. 
3. Qualities of interest 
There are many simplified features that have been used in order to study the structure of existing 
organizations [9][10]. Nevertheless, these proposed features lack the presentational power of representing the 
SNO. Therefore, we propose three important qualities of interest in order to measure the structure of the SNO, 
in this section. These properties are social harmony, cohesion, and spontaneity.  
3.1. Social harmony: 
For a SNO, social harmony is an important attribute. Social balance exists when relationships among a 
group in a social network are congenial [7]. Heider in [7] presented a theory that suggests certain 
combinations of relationships are harmonious whereas others are not. For example, two pairs of friends who 
may have a pair of enemies produce an imbalance.  
Definition 1: social harmony is the balanced state of the existing connections among agents to the total 
connections inside the organization. 
Since SNO is formed with like-minded individuals, we assume a nontrivial degree of social balance. 
Imbalanced relationships are divisive and fall apart. In contrast, balanced relationships lead to increased 
positive interactions that will lead to strengthening dyadic ties, and new positive ties. Therefore, SNO will 
function better with greater balance.  A balance metric is suggested in Equation 1. 
 
 (1) 
Here 
 donates the number of balanced interactions (i.e., triadic balanced interactions in Heider style 
analysis) in SNO while 
donates the total number of interactions in the whole SNO.  
3.2. Cohesion 
Cohesion is another important property for organizations as well as societies [5]. For an organization, 
cohesion is produced by repeated interactions in the group to measures triadic closure in a sociogram that is a 
graph or any other measures (aka, clustering coefficient).  
Definition 2: The cohesion of the organization can be reach by frequent connections among the agents 
through bonding or bridging. 
Cohesion can be measured with 1) a bonding metric [13]. Bonding measure in SNO is proportional to 
social capital. 
  
 (2) 
In equation 2,  is the length of total vectors (
) that has been formed through the agents’ 
connections (i.e. triangle paths in the graph,) and is the length of two paths (
. 2) When the group size 
is large enough to have disparate units, it becomes important for an organization to have connections among 
121
 Saad Alqithami and Henry Hexmoor /  AASRI Procedia  4 ( 2013 )  118 – 124 
these units measured by the bridging metric 3. 
  
 (3) 
Here, 
is the betweenness measure that is averaged over all agents. Betweenness is the number of 
shortest paths from all vertices to all others that pass through that agent [13]. It can be calculated for the agent 
using the following expression, where is starting point, is ending point of the network and 
is the 
number of those paths that pass through : 
  
 (4) 
3.3. Spontaneity 
Actions of an organization are largely in response to interactions with sources outside the organizations 
that are external stimuli (i.e., reactions denoted with
) where the organization attempts to achieve its goals 
with actions.  However, a proportion of actions are strictly generated from internal decision making relying on 
internal interactions (i.e., internal actions denoted with
).  
Definition 3: Spontaneity property a SNO lies in its propensity to initiate unprovoked actions. We take this 
to mean the SNO is generating internal initiative and plans to promote independent agenda. 
Spontaneity metric (i.e.,
) is suggested that measures the ratio of internally provoked actions over all 
actions in the organization. All networked organizations may exhibit spontaneity as the need arise. 
   
 (5) 
The use of these properties is beneficial to refine study the SNO. However, each one of them has different 
characteristics that have to be identified in order to be measured inside the organization. The structure of the 
organization may change depending on the different percentage they have that differ from 0 to 1, on which it 
has a huge impact. We discuss more about these measurements in the following section. 
4. Functionality of the Parameterization  
After proposing the three main qualities of interests, we simplify the functionalities of them by exemplify 
their effect on the organization. The following, Figure 2, will present more description.   
Figure 2. The notion of capturing three key properties, with the maximal or near-maximal values of their associated parameters 
In Figure 2a, presents a structure where the social harmony is highest among the agents, which we 
presented as network nodes. The positive or negative signs present the type of social harmony whether 
balanced or not-balanced. We assume that the social harmony is equal to 1 when the network is balanced, as 
exemplified in our earlier discussion. Figure 2b shows two types of cohesion, where the solid line presents the 
bridging and in contrast the dashes present the bonding. The cohesion is equal to 1 when the organization has 
a fair amount of interactions whether inside through bonding or with outside the organization through

bridging. Spontaneity, as in Figure 2c, links different type of agents who may behave irrationally, where the 
different shapes in the graph state the different kinds of agents, actions, or future interest. It can be satisfied 
and presented by 1 when any of the agents link with another type. All these qualities of interest differentiate 
from 0 (minimum) to 1 (maximum). Any organization may reach the maximum value when it is in the full 
functionality of these qualities of interests.  
The SNO has been deliberated here since the leadership does not have a huge impact of its functionality. In 
fact, leadership and connections are inversely related to many open social environments, Equation 6. 
  
 
(6) 
Thus, leadership affects more than the social harmony among the agent to further impacts the cohesion of 
the organization. Spontaneity indicates that separate agents may have implicit communications with one 
another indirectly based on shared affinities or interest. In various ways, these parameters help to measure the 
social capital discussed next. 
5. Social Capital 
Social capital (SC) in the network can be defined as the cooperative nature of agents who belong to myriad 
networked organizations who operate independently yet in unison from their organizational origins when they 
perform actions together. In other words, it can be characterized as the collocated or virtual collaboration to 
produce successful outcomes and successful connections [2]. There are two major perspectives on SC in 
networks. In the macroscopic perspective, SC for the entire network is considered. In this view individuals do 
not incrementally add to the system or withdraw units of SC. Instead, the foci are on the system principles like 
norms and conventions that provide resources for overall social welfare.  In contrast, the microscopic 
perspective, adopted here, explores how individuals can gain access to resources by their positions and 
connections in the network.  
Definition 4: Social capital in a link is measured from accumulation of positive values of social flow and 
trust plus abundance of communication over the common topic of SNO. At this point we treat all three 
attributes equally. 
The previous definition captured a few main elements of the SC, which have a proportional relationship to 
one another.  Topologically speaking, high bonding rates provide more opportunities for interaction and 
growth of social capital. However, network structure by itself is inadequate for determination of SC. We must 
examine the contents of interaction and dispositions that create social forces that attract or repel individuals. 
At the level of a single link, the nature of social flow in the link leads to accumulation of SC. Social flows can 
be benevolent and positive or negative and lack benevolence. Whereas positive flow leads to net positive gain 
in SC, negative flow leads to loss of SC. Apart from social flow; dyadic ties may harbor trust or promote 
distrust [6]. Trust supports SC whereas distrust erodes SC. If the topic of interaction between the pair is 
centered on the main problem for the SNO, that link positively contributes to SC. In sum, flow, trust, and 
topic are link attributes that are proportional determinants for SC.  
6. Related work 
There have been numerous discussions of network qualities for organizations [12][3]. Although relevant to 
qualities we discuss herein, much of literatures prior to 2010 are applicable to human organizations and there 
is no clear migration connection to online organizations targeted by us. Social networks can be considered as 
a useful tool to describe the interaction in online organizations. Online organizations typically connect with 
each other through different types of ties that in sequence will affect the social capital of each one of them.  
There are two types of connections among the agents, which are implicit and explicit. Implicit affinities 
123
 Saad Alqithami and Henry Hexmoor /  AASRI Procedia  4 ( 2013 )  118 – 124 
can be seen inside the organization where the member has more than one interest to share. However, if any of 
those members has a connection with any other members of another organization, this connection will 
immediately be considered as explicit affinities, as proposed by [11]. These types of connections have studies 
various social networks structures. Even though bonding and bridging must exist together or not at all, 
bonding, however, refers to homogeneous clusters while bridging refers to heterogeneous clusters. Bonding 
helps to enlarge the organization to have more focus of the attentions and to oversimplify the efforts. 
Conversely, bridging helps the organization to further extension of the organization to be able to reach more 
others in order to take advantage of on jointly valuable collaboration. 
Macindoe and Richards [8] propose three features of leadership, bonding, and diversity to compare 
organizations for their network topology. They called it “the network’s fine structure”. To judge the 
similarities between networks, they developed a technique of graph edit-distance to explore the use of 
hierarchical clustering on several networks based on a variety of sources including social interaction data. In 
interaction, the distance among agents can affect cooperation and persuasion negatively. These problems can 
be overcome by successive connections among the agents. The effect on the agents’ sociality is the 
combination of the ties among them as well as both physical and sequential distance [4]. Thus, the interaction 
style can affect the outcome performance and process in the organization.  
7. Conclusion 
In open environments, such as the environments envisioned for SNO, agents are integrated dynamically 
across their organizational and geographical boundaries, to justify each other needs. Thus, SNO model should 
adapt dynamically to changing circumstances by improving the social harmony, coherence and spontaneity to 
encounter both agents and organization goal. In light of this, the paper has been argued that the agents 
amalgamate better in the SNO while in traditional organizations lack the potential power to adopt some of 
these properties of interaction. In particular, such agents must be able to assess these measurements with their 
peers, so that they will maintain a sense of continuity toward the goal of their organization.
