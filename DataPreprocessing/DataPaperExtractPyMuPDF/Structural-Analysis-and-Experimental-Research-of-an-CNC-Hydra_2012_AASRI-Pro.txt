Abstract 
CNC hydraulic swing-type plate shears is one of the important plate processing equipments, whose safety performance and shearing accuracy 
are determined by the structure of its frame and tool carrier. The current mechanical property analyses of plate shears mostly only use finite 
element tools and simply apply uniform load, which can not reflect true work status of the plate shears. By integrating original structures of the 
frame and tool carrier, two working status' static performances of the plate shears are analyzed with finite element method in this paper, where 
the uniform load or moving load are separately applied according to its work statue. The analysis results are verified by the later stress-strain 
tests according to which structural improvements are proposed to provide basis for improving properties of the plate shears.

Introduction 
Swing-type plate shears is a metal processing equipment, which fractures plates into required sizes through relative motion 
and reasonable clearance between the movable blade and static blade. With the rapid development of China's industry, 
individualized needs of plate shears grow rapidly. The frame and the tool carrier are the major components of the plate shears, 
whose strength and stiffness directly determine the safety performance and shearing accuracy. 
Based on empirical formulas and parameters, majority of current domestic plate shears are designed by abiding the traditional 
theory and rules. However, stress concentration and overall force distribution of the machines can not be accurately obtained 
according to the traditional design methods, which leads to high-end performance requirements unsatisfiable[1]. To solve this 
problem, plate shears mechanical properties are studied at home and abroad. Stiffness and strength of the frame were obtained 
by Xiangjun Gu according to the linear analysis and modal analysis with ANSYS[2]. Through analytical processing the model 
established in ANSYS, Xinhua Yang improved structure and mechanical properties of the machine[3]. By programming 
information of each step of the moving load in ANSYS, deformation, equivalent stress and equivalent strain of the frame were 
studied by Yingying Liu[4]. But most of the literatures only theoretical analyzed with uniform load, which didn't analyze their

By taking QC12Y-4×2500 plate shears as an example, static analyses of the frame and tool carrier are carried out separately 
with uniform load and moving load. According to the later stress-strain tests which verify the analysis results, structural 
improvements are proposed to improve properties of the plate shears.

1.2 cylinder thrust, bearing reaction force and shear horizontal thrust 
Since forces on the frame and tool carrier are action and reaction, structure of the tool carrier can be simplified to the 
mechanical model[3] as shown in Fig. 1.

2. Finite Element Analysis of the Swing-type Plate Shears 
2.1 Finite Element Model Establishment and Pre-processing of the Frame and Tool Carrier  
The frame and tool carrier models are separately built by relevant software and then imported into finite element software[6]. 
Parameters of the frame and tool carrier are selected according to their materials: plain carbon steel Q235, where elastic 
modulus is 
5
2.1 10 MPa  and Poisson's ratio is 0.3. 
The frame's underside is full-constrained based on the actual situation. Two reference points, whose degrees of freedom are 
constrained only to rotate around the X axis in local coordinate system, are established at the centers of left and right plate of 
tool carrier and coupled with two holes separately. In order to remove rigid displacement of the tool carrier, translation 
constraint of y, z directions are applied to the contact point between the cylinders and tool carrier in the global coordinate 
system[7]. The frame bed-body is meshed with tetrahedral element, while the beams and tool carrier are meshed with hexahedral 
element. 
2.2  Frame Analysis 
2.2.1 Applying uniform load of shearing force and horizontal thrust on frame 
 
Fig. 2. Frame stress contour; Fig. 3. Frame displacement contour 
Based on the analysis result, maximum stress of the frame which occurs at the throat fillet is 110.2Mpa as shown in Fig. 2, 
while the maximum displacement which occurs at the middle of the front vertical plate is 0.5261mm as shown in Fig. 3. 
2.2.2 Applying moving load of shearing force and horizontal thrust on frame 
15 points are arranged along the static tool apron and coupled with the underside and front of the static tool apron. Shearing 
force and shear thrust are respectively applied and divided into 16 load steps. The inheritance between forces are abolished by 
setting in the load manager to make the forces taking effects in their single steps[8]. 
According to analysis results, the maximum stresses and displacements of the frame under every load step are listed in Table

Fig. 4. Variation diagram of every load step stress 
Informations can be drawn from the stress and displacement contours as follows: 
1) When the shearing force and horizontal thrust haven't been applied in step-1, the minimum stress occurring at the throat 
fillet is 71.71MPa, while the minimum displacement occurring at the top place in the front vertical plate of the frame is 
0.1634mm. 
2) It's shown in Fig. 4 that the whole stress change in a slowly upgrade tendency during the shearing position shifting right. 
The maximum stress which also occurs at the throat fillet achieves 112.2MPa at step-16, relative increased by 1.8% to uniform 
load condition. Meanwhile the larger stress domain in front vertical plate shifts right. The maximum displacement remains 
unchanged at 0.5264mm in the middle of front vertical plate. But the deformation domain of the frame horizontal stand shifts 
right as the load step increasing. 
3) In the load step-9, the stress and displacement changes are consistent with uniform load. 
2.3 Tool Carrier Analysis 
Shearing force pressure and horizontal thrust pressure are respectively applied on the top and back surface of the blade 
mounted position. 
 
Fig.5. Tool carrier stress contour ; Fig. 6. Tool carrier displacement contour 
It is shown in fig. 5 that the maximum stress is 57.52MPa, which occurs at the contact position between shear cylinder and 
wing boards. In addition, bottom of the region where the wing boards being welded with the front plate is a relatively larger 
stress area. 
As it shown in fig. 6 that the maximum displacement is 0.377mm, which occurs at the lower end of the intermediate position 
of the front plate. The upper end of the intermediate position and the two ribs are also the bigger displacement area. 
3. Experimental Verification of Plate Shears for Finite Element Analysis 
The stress-strain test on the frame of plate shears is accomplished with DH3816 static strain gauge and 45° rectangular 
rosette. Fifteen testing points are arranged at the four corners of the cylinder mounting holes on the frame, throat fillet, bearing 
hole, front vertical plate and lower area of workbench, where larger stresses and displacements occur. Four specifications of 
shear plates are tested according to four different thicknesses and lengths of sheared plates. The test strain are calculated into 
stress based on the formulas as follow

Informations can be drawn from the comparison that the results of analysis and test have value gaps around 20% because of 
taking the environmental influences from test site into account. Such as the shearing force is calculated based on traditional 
empirical formula, whose value is bigger than actual value and leads to greater shear stress in later finite element analysis. The 
overall data are within the allowed range except individual testing points. The conclusion can be drawn that the forgoing finite 
element method[9] is reliable and the calculation results of maximum stress of throat fillet are also accords with the actual 
working mode. 
4.  Implementation of Structural Improvement for Plate Shears 
419
 Yong Wang et al. /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  414 – 420 
According to the analysis and testing results, structural improvement suggestions for the Hydraulic Swing-type plate shears 
QC12Y-4×2500 are given as follows. 
In addition to the throat fillet of frame and shear cylinder contact position of tool carrier, the mechanical properties of the 
structural material Q235 can meet the maximum force condition requirements, which means the plate shears has a certain range 
for weight reduction, for example the frame wallboard and tool carrier wing boards can be appropriate reduced. 
Aiming at reducing the stresses of the throat fillet and shear cylinder contact position of tool carrier, reinforcing plates can be 
welded to partly strengthen the two larger stress positions as shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. 
 
Fig. 8. Sketch of frame improvement; Fig. 9. Sketch of tool carrier improvement 
5. Summary 
Based on the existing structure of frame and tool carrier of the hydraulic swing-type plate shears QC12Y-4×2500 and the 
actual shearing process, uniform load and moving load are applied and analyzed by using load step in the finite element analyses. 
Through comparing the two status, it is indicated that the moving load arrangement more fully reflect the impact from shearing 
process on its performance. Experimental data of five testing points of throat fillet are extracted and contrasted with the analysis 
results which are later verified to be reliable. 
This swing-type plate shears can be normally used under the existing structure of frame and tool carrier. In order to improve 
the plate shears properties and reduce weight of the plate shears, the thickness of frame wallboard and the tool carrier 
wing-boards can be appropriately decreased, and reinforcing plates can be welded to partly strengthen the throat fillet and shear 
cylinder contact position of tool carrier.  
In conclusion, the research in this paper can provide a reference for size design, finite element analysis as well as structural 
improvements of plate shears, and has engineering reference value for improving shearing quality and guiding the actual 
production.
