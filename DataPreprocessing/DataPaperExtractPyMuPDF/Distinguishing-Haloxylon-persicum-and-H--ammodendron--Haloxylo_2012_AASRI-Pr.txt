Abstract 
Haloxylon ammodendron and H. persicum are two closely related species in genus Haloxylon of Amaranthaceae. Saxoul 
trees, designated the King of psammophytic plants, have been playing an important role in sand fixation, wind control and 
water conservation in the deserts. In recent decades, artificial and natural Haloxylon populations have been threatened in 
China due to environmental degradation. Genetic evaluation on Haloxylon germplasm resources has been in urgent need 
in China. However, the lack of morphological and molecular markers has severely limited the related researches. In this 
study, a SSR primer pair named QCA58 was found to be transferable and informative for distinguishing the two 
Haloxylon species. Primer QCA58 previously reported by Maughan et al. (2004) produced a DNA fragment of 183bp in 
length containing a stretch of (TG)16 in Chenopodium quinoa Willd. (genus Chenopodium, Amaranthaceae). Surprisingly, 
a stretch of a compound repeat motif TCTTCAGGGTC(T/C)TCTTCAGGGTC was detected in the PCR product (≈ 
970bp in length) of Haloxylon species with primer QCA58. Development of SSR markers commonly involve in tandem 
repeats of short (2–6 bp) DNA sequences. Our results indicated that the longer or compound repeat and its relationship 
with SSRs are noteworthy for the potential in basic evolutionary applications, such as identification at genus and species

1. Introduction 
Plants of genus Haloxylon Bunge are psammophytic shrubs or small trees, belonging to Amaranthaceae 
(formerly Chenopodiaceae) of flowering plants [1-3]. About 13 species have been reported in Haloxylon in 
the world. In China, there are two Haloxylon species with a distribution in the deserts of Northwest China, 
namely H. persicum (white saxoul) and H. ammodendron (saxoul) [2, 3]. They are designated the King of 
psammophytic plants and play an important role in sand fixation, wind control and water conservation in the 
deserts. Distribution of these two species is sympatric in China. H. persicum grows mostly at the top of sand 
dunes, while H. ammodendron is widely distributed on sand dunes, clayed deserts, saline or alkaline deserts 
and Gobi deserts. 
However, in recent decades, planted forests and natural populations of Haloxylon have been threatened in 
China, due to the decrease of river water flow, lowering of underground water level, over development in 
agriculture, and over grazing of animals. Genetic evaluation on Haloxylon germplasm resources has been in 
urgent need [2, 3]. 
Because of the severe environmental conditions in the deserts, such as sand storms, extreme heats and 
drought stresses, the habit of Haloxylon trees are commonly irregular. The tiny gray-whitish scaly “leaves” on 
the green assimilating shoots of H. persicum are in fact aculeate. The true leaves are quite reduced and the 
cortex of young annual cylindrical shoots is the major photosynthetic tissue. The assimilating shoots of H. 
ammodendron even lack such scaly “leaves” [2].  
RAPD and ISSR analyses revealed that a high level of genetic diversity existed within/among natural 
populations of H. ammodendron in Xinjiang, China [5-7]. Other studies based on DNA ISSR markers 
demonstrated that there existed genetic diversity and gene flow within/among populations of either H. 
ammodendron or H. persicum in Xinjiang, China [8, 9]. Using  ITS1 region of nrDNA, pollen of H. 
ammodendron was detected in surface soil in the centre of Junggar Desert Basin, Xinjiang, China, and the 
ecological relationship between vegetation characteristics and pollen in the surface soil was discussed [10]. 
Analysis with 14 ISSR primers did not find genetic difference between individual plants of H. ammodendron

DNA level occurred in the seeds of H. ammodendron exposed to the outer space by “Shenzhou No.4” 
spaceflight [12]. However, limited success was achieved in detecting genetic diversity of the Haloxylon 
germplasm resources. Lack of morphological and molecular markers has inhibited the advance of the related 
researches.Among DNA markers, SSR markers have a high level of polymorphism, better stability and 
reproducibility compared to other DNA markers (such as RAPD and ISSR markers). SSR markers have been 
widely used in studies on population genetics, cultivar classification, genetic mapping, gene localization and 
marker-associated breeding programs [13, 14]. However, few SSR markers have been reported for Haloxylon 
species and their genetic background is still poorly understood. 
Here we report new insights concerning molecular identification of Haloxylon ammodendron and H. 
persicum at species level based on a SSR marker-derived DNA marker. The features and utilization of SSR 
markers will also be discussed. 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1 Sampling 
Young fresh assimilating shoots of Haloxylon ammodendron and H. persicum were collected in July 2008 
and May 2009 from Turpan Desert Botanical Garden of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region and Minqin Eremophytes Botanic Garden, Gansu Province, China, and dried 
immediately using silica-gels for DNA extraction. 
2.2 DNA extraction, PCR amplification and cloned sequencing 
Genomic DNA extraction was conducted following the procedure of Plant Genomic DNA Kit (DP305) 
from Tiangen Biotech (Beijing) Co., Ltd. PCR amplification was conducted following the protocol of 
TaKaRa Code: DR100B. A primer pair (QCA58-F: 5′―CTCGACCAGCAGGGTCTG―3′, QCA58-R: 
5′―CTAGCTAGGCGTTGCCTGAC―3′) [15] was employed. PCR conditions: preheating at 94°C for 4 
min.; 34cycles of 94°C for 1 min., 62°C (annealing temperature) for 58 s and 72°C for 1.2 min.; 8 min at 
72°C for final extension. PCR amplification was performed in an Applied Biosystems Veriti™ 96-Well 
Thermal Cycler (Model#: 9902, made in Singapore). The amplicons were resolved simultaneously on 2% 
agarose gels (Promega, the USA) run in 1 x TAE buffer at 3 V·cm–1 for 2 h and were stained with ethidium 
bromide. Band patterns (Fig. 1) were documented and photographed with the Gel Documentation System of 
Transilluminator BINTA2020D (Liaoning Langke Business and Trade Co. Ltd., China). PCR products (Fig. 1) 
were dug out from the gel using a sterilized scalpel for purification and sent to Beijing Tsingke Biotech Co., 
Ltd. for cloned sequencing. Six to eight independent clones for each sample were randomly taken and 
sequenced in both directions. The sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers JQ768241-
JQ768258.

Results 
By screening 55 SSR primer pairs previously reported for the closely related species [13, 15, 17, 18] of 
the genus Haloxylon in Amaranthaceae, a primer pair named QCA58 was found to be informative in 
distinguishing H. persicum and H. ammodendron. A single band was amplified with primer QCA58 from the 
genome of H. persicum, while two bands were amplified from the genome of H. ammodendron (Fig. 1). Thus, 
the two Haloxylon species were discriminated successfully with primer QCA58. Primer screening success was 
1.8%. A compound sequence repeat motif TCTTCAGGGTC(T/C)TCTTCAGGGTC was detected in the 
PCR product (the cloned sequences of the longer band with a size of 956 to 977bp) of each Haloxylon species 
(repeat type 1, in Fig. 2). The cloned sequence with such repeat motif occupied 16.7% of the investigated 
sequences (n=6) in H. persicum, the rest of the sequences had mutated repeat motif (repeat type 2, in Fig. 2). In 
H. ammodendron, all of the investigated sequences (n=6) only contained mutated repeat motif without type 1 
repeats observed in the longer band. Fig. 2 shows the typical mutated repeat motif (repeat type 2) in H. 
ammodendron. No repeat was detected in the cloned sequences of the shorter band (ca. 564bp in length) of H. 
ammodendron (Fig. 1). The result of this study was also confirmed using samples collected from the fields.

Discussion and conclusion 
Cross-genus transferability of primer QCA58 suggested that the binding regions of primer QCA58 may be 
associated with certain important function in the Amaranthaceae, because of the conservatism. Functional 
correlations of repeat sequences are frequently reported [19]. Many examples could be given. For example, a 
(GT)n repeat could enhance gene activity from a distance independent of its orientation, but more effective 
transcriptional enhancement resulted from the GT repeat being closer to the promoter sequences [19, 20]. In 
rice, variation in the number of GA or CT repeats in the 5' UTR of the waxy gene was correlated with 
amylase content [21, 22]. Microsatellite markers (CCG)n in 5' UTRs of some ribosomal protein genes of 
maize were involved in the regulation of fertilization [23].  
A number of EST-SSR primers proved useful in discriminating different genera, species within a 
particular genus and the different genomes of the tribe Triticeae of the Poaceae [24]. The SSRs derived from 
the functional portion of the genome of bread wheat may be successfully used in cultivated wheat and its wild 
relatives belonging to Triticum-Aegilops complex for comparative genomics studies such as genome analysis, 
localization of expressed genes, and discrimination of different species [24].  
Six of twenty previously developed Beta SSR primer pairs were found to be useful in classification of five 
genetically distinct Salsola taxa [17]. EST-SSR markers derived from transcribed regions of the DNA 
produce a higher rate of transferability, but fewer polymorphism [25]. Based on wheat genomic SSR markers, 
the transferability from wheat to rye was found to be only 17% [26]; however, based on EST-SSR markers, 
the transferability from wheat to 18 Triticum-Aegilops species was found to be as high as 84% [24], and from

Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) to seven grass species was found to be nearly 92% [27]. The 
transferability (1.8%) of the SSR markers from the other related genera to genus Haloxylon was considerably 
low, suggesting a larger genetic divergence between them. 
The two genera (Haloxylon and Chenopodium) of the Amaranthaceae could be characterized with the 
length and repeat motif type of the PCR products using primer QCA58. Microsatellites or simple sequence 
repeats (SSRs) commonly refer to tandem repeats of short (2–6 bp) DNA sequences with a PCR product size 
ranging from 100—700 bp [13, 14, 19, 23]. Our results indicated that the longer or compound repeat and its 
relationship with SSRs are noteworthy because of the potential value for use in basic evolutionary 
applications, such as identification at genus and species levels.
