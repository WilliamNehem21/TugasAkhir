management mode to reform and innovation has become a problem to be solved. With the popularization of 
digital network and education information and applications, management information is becoming one of the 
important factors in measuring the overall level of school, can reach high levels of school management 
important symbols of the University. Comprehensive data acquisition platform for digital University, College 
of management information systems and networks, and sharing environment form a whole range of digital 
space; For University managers to provide application service management platform with the openness, 
flexibility, is a necessary prerequisite to scientific management and management and fundamental ways. 
Whole school will bring a fresh, modern life. 
1.1. Overall structure of financial payment system topology. 
In the construction of the network, we need to make careful arrangements corresponding to each part. This 
system use multi-c/s framework, because of the join between the client and the database a "middle layer", 
making the legality check, data access, business rules, and other work in the middle-tier to handle.Clients do 
not directly interact with the database, but by the middle-tier connection is established, through the middle tier 
interacts with the database, established in the Centre will significantly reduce the number of connections on 
the database server, and dynamically establish and release connections, so clients will no longer be 
restricted.When business rules change, simply change a component on the middle-tier server, and the client 
application does not need to do any processing, sometimes even have to change middle-tier components, only 
need to modify a stored procedure in the database.This makes deployment more secure, large-scale 
development support system, to avoid single points of failure.Application servers and WEB servers can be 
deployed to more than one cluster and avoid single points of failure.System network structure is divided into 
storage networks, networks and access networks.Achieving network security through isolated subnet. 
1.2. System features. 
In General, school fees tend to be concentrated in time, tends to be concentrated within a few days of 
school every year, to complete a large number of collected charge, so if the system is an efficient system is the 
key factor of success.We use the campus card as a platform for financial payment systems, guarantees high 
efficiency of the system and high concurrency.The other hand, due to the increasing student enrollment in 
colleges and universities, especially Bank end, along with the increase in use, requirements for system 
performance will gradually improve in the future, the system must have high levels of scalability, through a 
simple software load balancing technologies through increased hardware method of dynamics to improve 
system performance.Provide an open XML interface, easy implementation and financial and e-card 
system.Open interface to realize the sector data sharing, so as to reduce duplication arising out of data 
exchange between the various departments.Provides reports and query mechanisms can be defined, according 
to the Bank automatically charge registration feedback and report cases of various custom format can be 
generated (such as Word, Excel, text files, DBF, HTML, etc) for statistical queries and queries for financial 
personnel, statistical and monitoring.  
2. Functional design of financial payment subsystem based on campus one-card platform 
According to the practical need of management in network charge, the system consists of subsystems, self 
service account management subsystem, card payment system and statistical analysis subsystem, functions of 
each subsystem are described below. 
424  
 Jun Zheng et al. /  AASRI Procedia  1 ( 2012 )  422 – 427 
2.1. Account management subsystem. 
The subsystem which bind the user authentication and billing policies, access control permissions in the 
policy package in services serves for staff who manage the system and provide a wide range of bulk 
operations,such as bulk household accounts, bulk renewals, bulk sales, bulk modify and so on  to make it easy 
for users of data maintenance, simplify the Administrator's actions..The subsystem also offers customized user 
information management capabilities, administrators can be customized according to the habits of users of 
network operation information, and supporting users in the hostel moved across campus, building and 
migration between the users online account in certification system. 
2.2. Self-service subsystem. 
This subsystem is designed for user level and provides change of user name, password, and other 
functions.After users log in self service platform, history a record of payment can I network, network, network 
details and other queries, can also close, pause, and resume the network using such applications.New 
applications for network users, and campus Portal provides pre-registered Web user interface platform, Web 
users fill out personal information, so as to ensure the accuracy of the information, reduce the maintenance 
workload of administrators. 
2.3. One-card payment subsystem. 
The interfaces of the subsystem complete with a card system, front-end project procurement in the 
construction of campus one-card-card card and POS machines and database, back-end database connect to 
campus network user authentication system, allow for payment by credit card only royalties paid to complete 
network and network access open. 
2.4. Statistical analysis subsystem. 
By CAMS provide a configurable query interface, you will need to write query criteria information in the 
configuration file, available to CAMS system, achieving administrators on user contribution records, network, 
time, network address, use of features such as query and modify.In addition, the report that provides rich 
graphics subsystem and table style, you can easily generate, export, and print. 
3. Set up a financial payment system based on campus one-card platform hardware and software 
conditions 
3.1. General hardware devices. 
General hardware devices include issuing central database servers, front, yinxiao transfer server, 
carDedicated hardware devices including consumer POS, earmark, self-service terminals, card reader devices, 
recharging machine.d application servers, access servers, disk arrays, switches, routers, encryption, card 
issuing Center.

3.2. General software 
General software for SCO Unix family of operating systems, Oracle database, Windows XP operating 
system, Visual Basic 6, Access 2000 databases, applications, software, various subsystems. 
4. Each functional module design 
4.1. WEB client reception module. 
WEB client to provide transfer services between the user and the Bank, provides campus card transfers, 
tuition payment transfers and transfers information inquiry function.Login to card transfers by default when 
the page, users simply pull down menu to select the desired service. 
Recharge card transfers, tuition fee transfer both similar, users need to fill out their own authentication 
(such as: student number) and other related information, click after the silver system gives you links into the 
network, end users to fill in bank-related information, after you click submit, by online banking transfer to 
schools Centre Bank interface sends the appropriate information, and return transfer success.Otherwise, 
returns a failure information, such as: authentication information is not correct, balance transfer amount 
exceeds the bank card. 
(1) Transfer information: users enter your student number, Bank server, query, according to the 
corresponding transfer of information, if transferred, transfers interface to send information to the user, 
otherwise, returns a query does not exist.�
(2) User consumer enquiries: users can check their campus's consumption of certain conditions. 
4.2. Management module. 
Main news complete system, such as publishing some internal payment, recharge, station announcements, 
such as content management;Modify system parameters, such as a modifying merchant, bank code, tests, and 
other related parameters;Data proofing, major review schools bank transactions and bank records of the 
interfaces on the machine are the same. 
4.3. Bank interface module Design. 
Main bank book module of communication between servers and storage, and data processing, is a 
communications hub for the entire system, interface design mainly includes: (1) Interface socket 
communication program: receive and verify information from the earmark machine. (2) Interface design for 
database storage transfer information, statement, and basic database operations. (3) PC and 89C51 single chip 
microcomputer serial communication program: realization of serial communication between single-chip 
microcomputer programs, mainly used for setting a yardage machine IP address. 
(1) The process of payment of tuition. 
Bank server after receiving the payment of tuition fee information, change a user's Dragon card balance at 
the same time, will receive information related to user-generated unique ID to the order number (this is a very 
important sequence number).And then after processing, the order number (for example, MD5 encryption and 
data signature), delivered to the banks ' handling of the interface to be determined by the associated.Tuition 
fee paying student's behavior does not exist, when the interface receives after successful transfer of 
information, financial center server will immediately receive the transfer record, in order to ensure correctness, 
Finance Department data proofing work needs to be done.

Enter a user name, a password and an additional code, and then click "login", note: user name and 
password for the online payment system is not an advanced financial management platform to log in user 
name, password, be careful not to confuse. 
Log in to the system, click on the "pay", the system will display a list will be charged, please click the 
check boxes to select the cost before the name bill payments, confirm, and then click the "pay" button. 
After selecting this payment, payment orders need to be confirmed, cannot be modified after the order 
confirmation. 
Select using the card for payment, banks do not charge fees.Press the "pay" button, please enter the card 
money page, on the left, click the "payment card number search", found after the transfer fee. 
System "bank debits the successful" page, description payment operation completed.Normally within 5 
minutes you can see the relevant fee has been paid. See figure 1. 
(2) "One card" prepaid processing. 
Similar to the process of tuition payment,bank server will receive information related to user-generated 
unique ID to the order number(this is a very important sequence number) after it receives the transfer charge 
information and change a user's Dragon card balance at the same time.And then after processing, the order 
number (for example, MD5 encryption and data signature), is delivered to the banks ' handling of the interface 
to be determined by the associated.When the interface receives after successful transfer of information, 
prompts the user to recharge successful students were confirmed after successful transfer, the Yardage on a 
yardage machine, to ensure safety and accuracy of the student transfer information to interfaces on the 
machine, proofing of the financial sector to take measures quickly to data for effective proofreading. 
5. Conclusion 
In order to improve the financial payment system based on campus one-card platform features, future 
directions: (1) ASP.NET in terms of memory usage and execution time is consumed very large, PFIP engine 
running requires more code than the equivalent PHP page, need to be improved. (2) In the course of testing the 
system, testing programme is limited to functional testing, practical testing and so on .other more effective 
means are to be further used for the better testing performance of schemes. (3) Application for building system 
on the security mechanism need to be further improved, especially on running IlS server, and security is 
required for further study.
