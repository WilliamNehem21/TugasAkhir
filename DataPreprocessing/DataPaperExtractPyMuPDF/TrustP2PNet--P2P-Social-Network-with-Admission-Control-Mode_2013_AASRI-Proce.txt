webs after many attempts of trying other way only if the websites have other paths. In addition, sometimes 
though the websites are still available to us, we can always find a best way, i.e. with the highest speed to use. 
In one word, we need a put up way which can make the accessibility of Internet more robust with better 
performance. P2P systemis answer we find. In a typical P2P system, there is not any center server, and only a 
register server generate identifications for the nodes who want to join the system, but not one is responsible 
for monitoring the behaviors single nodes. When strange nodes come to certain nodes and request for service, 
the requested nodes make their own opinions on response positively or negatively, according to their 
knowledge of the coming nodes.  
The P2P work style bring huge advantages to the system. First of all, the Internet is more accessible for the 
users. Those banned websites to certain people for political or technical reasons may now be available to them. 
Only if the websites have links with nodes in the system, there is hope that they can be visited hence make 
useful information be shared by more people. Secondly, no central node which is responsible for the 
authentication or data transferring of all nodes exists in the system, hence avoid the bottleneck. The 
maintenance of central server always costs heavy economical and technical load and affects the performance 
of the system when large data in running. Thirdly, all the nodes in the system are of the same importance and 
function, hence have good robust for no of the broken down of single node can cause disasters to the system.  
Even no disaster happens, when more than one path exists, the nodes can find a better way to enjoy better 
performance. 
As to the problem that how the nodes join the system, currently popular P2P software does not put up an 
effective way. A common way as BitTorrent adopts is to let all nodes join in the system only if they wish. 
They do not care whether a certain node is honest or malicious in the beginning. They put up sets of methods 
to evaluate and stimulate the behaviors of nodes---- sometimes the stimulation is too weak to make sense, and 
such mechanism shall cause delay between the coming of malicious nodes and the finding of them. There is 
no effective mechanism to make sure the good identification of nodes hence cause hidden insecure trouble to 
the system. 
And on the other hand, for the nodes within the system, when they want to demand some service, they may 
not know the better choice. The ones with the highest evaluation in the system do not necessarily mean the 
best service provider for every node. They may even been not available to some of them. 
In order to solve the two problems mentioned above, we put up the trust system based on social networks to 
work. 
2. TrustP2PNet 
Here, the TrustP2PNet which we proposed is proxy working in the application layer overlaid above the 
physical networks of Internet. It is consist up with the nodes and their available parts of the Internet. When a 
node wants to visit some place inaccessible for him, he pack the destination in the datagram and sent to the 
nodes who might reach the destination. When another node receives the datagram, he picks up the destination 
and transfers the data for the original node.  
The TrustP2PNet works as a typical P2P system without the intervention of center server. Only a register 
server generate identifications for the nodes who want to join the system, but not one is responsible for 
monitoring the behaviors single nodes. When strange nodes come to certain nodes and request for service, the 
requested nodes make their own opinions on response positively or negatively, according to their knowledge 
of the coming nodes. 
The TrustP2PNet and its P2P work style bring huge advantages to the system. First of all, the Internet is 
more accessible for the users. Those banned websites to certain people for political or technical reasons may 
now be available to them. Only if the websites have links with nodes in the system, there is hope that they can 
283

be visited hence make useful information be shared by more people. Secondly, no central node which is 
responsible for the authentication or data transferring of all nodes exists in the system, hence avoid the 
bottleneck. The maintenance of central server always costs heavy economical and technical load and affects 
the performance of the system when large data in running. Thirdly, all the nodes in the system are of the same 
importance and function, hence have good robust for no of the broken down of single node can cause disasters 
to the system.  Even no disaster happens, when more than one path exists, the nodes can find a better way to 
enjoy better performance. 
In order to solve the two problems mentioned above, we proposeda trust system based on social networks 
which run on the application layer. 
3. Trust based Social Networks 
The area of trust and reputation in P2P systems has been a hot subject.However, so far away they do not 
have favorable mechanisms. Most of their solutions are based on an accumulative credit system. They don not 
refuse any peers, honest or malicious, to join in the system, but confine their behaviors according to their score. 
This way necessarily causes delay between malicious nodes. Moreover, such mechanism often deploys a 
center server to record and update the credit score of the peers. It introduce more risk of attacks on the center 
server for the malicious peers want to rise their scores to gain more service. If the system is totally distributed, 
they may have to conquer many of the other peers to realize their aim, however now they only have to attack 
one server. Compared with the huge benefits they may gain, such energy is worth. 
In order to overcome such disadvantages listed above, we proposed the trust system based on social 
networks. We suppose that people can always trust their friends who they know well, and can rely on their 
opinions of unknown people. Experientially people always believe in themselves better than others, but when 
they have no idea of something, the knowledge from their friends is better than just guessing out of all reason. 
The initial users of the system are always honest until malicious peers join in to generate the unfairness. And 
when people in system find malicious peers they are willing to inform their friends to erase them. Based on 
these common senses we proposed our model as follows. 
4. Trust based Admission Control Model (TACM) 
Before discuss the model, we define two basic concepts: Trust Value ����and Recommendation Value 
����between node P and node Q���� is theprobabilitythatreflects the degree of how node Ptrust node Q. 
thevalues of ����vary from 0 to 1. For the most trustable node (say M)of P and P itself, the Trust value can be 
equal to 1, i.e. ���� � �, and ���� � �; And for a node N which is stranger for P, the trust value is 0, i.e. 
���� � �. The Recommendation Value ���� reflects the trust degree that node P recommends node Q to 
other nodes. Here we restrict the Recommendation Valuebetween 0 and 1.For node P itself and nodes M with 
very high Trust Value ����, the Recommendation Value ����to 1, i.e. ���� � �. And for some node Mwith 
whom we do not familiar, the RecommendationValue ����will be small. And for node Q whom we do not 
recognize or do not trust, the RecommendationValue ����will be 0, i.e. ���� � �.  
Initially, all the nodes in the system are supposed to be honest. And at the beginning, only those who know 
each other directly can construct Trust relationship and recommend for each other. Here define some 
0<���<1 as the trust threshold. If ���� � ���, we say that node Q is trustable for node P, and if ���� � ���, 
then node Q is not trustable to node P. Here the above assumption is just used to simplifystructure of our trust 
model. For any two nodes A and B that do not exist any direct connection, we set ���� � �and ���� � �. 
The nodes with Recommendation to each other construct the initial system. When a new node N comes 
and tries to join the system, N has to find at least one node in the system already to trusts and recommends it, 
284  
 Wu Liu et al. /  AASRI Procedia  5 ( 2013 )  281 – 286 
 
we called it becomes the friend of the node in the system, otherwise it can only be anisolated node out of the 
system. And once it gainsthe trust of somenode, it can be regarded to join in the system successfully. 
Then when a new node X comes to node P and ask for its permits to join in, P can make two choices: 
1) ifP knows X well and regard it believable, then set: 
����� � �
���� � � 
2) ifP does not know X well, the trust value ���� is calculated via recommendation: P ask for its friends 
forX’s credit: 
���� � � � ���� � � �
�
���� ���� � ����
�
����
����
 
Where, i stands for the set of all the friends for node P, and ���� is the Recommendation value that node i 
recommends x. ���� is theinitialtrust value that node P trust node X. 0<� � �, 0<� � �, ������ � � � �. 
If ���� � ���, it is said that node P trust node X, set ���� � ���, which means that node P knows node X 
indirectly and recommend it with reservation; 
If ���� � ���, it is said that node Pdoes not trust node X, and set ���� � �. 
�(and � � � � �) is a control factortwo adjust the weight of trust value between itself and its friends. 
And

 reflects multiple nodes’trust on to a single one: if some node is more trustableto node P, 
it will get more recommendationtrust which will increase itstotaltrust value. 
5. Implementation of the Model TACM in TrustP2PNet 
We apply the formula into the TrustP2PNet Project and design the TrustP2PNet system which is an 
application overlay of the physical networks. It is constructed by thenodes and their accessible parts of the 
Internet. every peer in the systemis a proxy which voluntarilyrelay the traffic of pass through it . Each node of 
TrustP2PNet is composed of 4subsystems: The Functional-Module, the Calculation-Engine,the Friends-List 
and the Evaluation-Engine. Where, theFunctional-Module is used fortransferring traffic, registering andother 
functions. Our policy model for admission control is implemented inthe calculation engine.When a new node 
comes, the calculate engine is responsible to calculate its trust value and reflect to the friend list to record, and 
when the node interact with some new node, as the functional module offers or demands the service, the 
evaluate engine estimate the Recommendation and record in order for further calculation for the calculate 
engine. 
6. Parameters and Simulations 
Obviously, whether a node can join the system depends on the parameter�, which reflects the degree a 
node believe in itself or believe in the friends, and ���, which reflects a node adopts a strict policy on making 
friends or a loose one. 
Consider a random system as below. There are twenty nodes initially, most of the honest nodes in red have 
constructed the system but left a few honest nodes in the out as well as some malicious nodes in green. 
If the system does not offer knowledge about the new nodes and let single nodes to make judgments by 
themselves, they may choose to accept or refuse to add the new node randomly due to an absence of effective 
way to evaluate the new comer. The result is obvious that malicious nodes join in the system as easily as 
285
 Wu Liu et al. /  AASRI Procedia  5 ( 2013 )  281 – 286 
 
honest ones. That’s a common way adopted by most of current P2P systems. It depends much on mechanisms 
in later phase to erase the malicious nodes. 
And if nodes in the system adopt very strict policy on permitting new comer, namely they only add who 
they know directly to the system, in other words let � equals to 1 and omit all friends’ recommendation, we 
can deduce another result: malicious nodes cannot be added in easily nor can the system expand easily. 
And with our model, depending on different �and ���, considering the portion of new coming nodes and 
total nodes in the system as the result of the system development, we can gain a three-dimensional picture. 
And other points of values of � and ��� do not seem to have much affection on the curves, so we set:� �
��� and ��� � ��� 
 
Figure 1.we can see when the abscissa:�� is bigger than 0.8, hardly does the portion of new nodes to total nodes increase. It reflects the 
abovediscussion, if one over emphasize its own opinion and omit friends’ recommendations, the system is hard to expand. So � in our 
model should be smaller than 0.8. 
 
Figure 2.we can see when ��� is between 0.9 and 0.85 the proportion is always increasing and not stable. So we can set ��� smaller then 
0.8 to gain a stable status. 
7. Conclusion 
In this paper, we proposed a Trust based Admission Control Model TACM for P2P network, and 
implemented a P2P social network system TrustP2PNet based on TACM. The TrustP2PNet is composed of 
286  
 Wu Liu et al. /  AASRI Procedia  5 ( 2013 )  281 – 286 
 
application layer proxies with P2P structure. Additionally, an admission control model based on 
recommendations from trustable friend in social networks is proposed to prevent malicious peers fromthe 
TrustP2PNet. Both the simulation results and the practical application of TACM in the system TrustP2Pnet 
show that, with our model, it can not only effectively protect the system from malicious peers but 
alsopossessvery good scalability.
