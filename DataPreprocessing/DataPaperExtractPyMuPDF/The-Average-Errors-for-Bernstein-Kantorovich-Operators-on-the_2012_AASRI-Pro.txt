Abstract 
In this paper, we discuss the average errors of function weighted approximation by the Bernstein-Kantorovich operators. 
The strongly asymptotic orders for the average errors of the Bernstein-Kantorovich operators sequence are determined on 
the r-fold integrated Wiener Space.

1. Introduction 
Let F be a real separable Banach space equipped with a probability measure  �  on the Borel sets of F. Let 
X be another normed space such that  F is continuously embedded in X. By ||.|| we denote the norm in X. Any 
:
T F
� X
such that 
||
( ) ||
f
f
�T f
�
 is a measurable mapping is called an approximation operator. The p- 
average error of T is defined as

2. Main result 
      Many mathematicians have investigated the approximation behavior of Bernstein-Kantorovich operators 
on
Lp[0,1],1
� p
� � . Recently Xu Guiqiao [3] studied the simultaneous approximation average errors for 
Bernstein operators on the r-fold integrated Wiener space. Motivated by [3], we consider the average errors of 
function weighted approximation by the Bernstein-Kantorovich operators on the r-fold integrated Wiener 
space. We obtain the following:
