The study investigated the improvement of slowly digestible starch fraction of cardaba banana via octenyl
succinic anhydride (OSA) modiﬁcation process. A nonlinear (Response surface methodology [RSM] and artiﬁcial
neural network [ANN]) and linear (partial least square [PLS]) models were employed and their predictability was
compared. The result revealed that all the modelling techniques were accurate in predicting the experimental
process. The optimized RSM values for the production of slowly digestible starch (SDS) fraction were OSA con-
centration of 4%, reaction time of 47.49 min, and pH of 10 with a predicted SDS value of 44.64%. Among the
modelling techniques, ANN was adjudged as the predictive model for improving the SDS yield. The regression co-
efﬁcient coupled with the variable important in the projection (VIP) values of the PLS model indicated that the
OSA concentration was the most important factors responsible for high SDS yield. Finally, a structural comparison
of the optimized starch against native starch revealed the formation of high ordered crystalline structure of the
starch due to the impregnation of the modifying agent to the hydroxyl group of the cardaba banana starch.

1. Introduction
Green bananas are common herbaceous plant which belongs to the
genus Musa (Arvanitoyannis et al., 2008). It originated from Southeast
Asian, however, many species had been traded many decades ago
which had led to the cultivation of bananas in more than 100 countries
worldwide(Arvanitoyannis et al., 2008). Among the species of banana
cultivated in Africa especially South-Western Nigeria is the Cardaba ba-
nana (Musa ABB).
Cardaba bananas (Musa ABB) are majorly utilized in food product
development such as fried chips. They are a group of under-utilized ba-
nanas which are easily prone to post-harvest spoilage. Their propensity
to spoilage is due to their moisture content which is relatively high as
well as it metabolic and physiological features (Olawoye and
Gbadamosi, 2020a). A report of Ravi and Mustaffa (2013) depicts that
cardaba banana contains a high pulp starch content of 83.26%, in
which the amylose content is 35.18% while the amylopectin content is
48.08%.. This high starch content makes cardaba banana an important
raw material in starch production.
Starch, a major constituent in human diet, is made up of a polymer
(homo) of glucose (amylose and amylopectin) and classiﬁed into
three major categories, which are; the resistant starch, SDS and rapidly
digestible starch (RDS) (Englyst et al., 1996). The RDS is the starch frac-
tion that undergoes digestion within 20 min of consumption in the
human gastrointestinal tract and foods/starches high in RDS are usually
regarded as high glycemic food. The SDS fraction, however, on the other
hand, is digested within 20–120 min of consumption in the gastrointes-
tinal tract. The starch digestion is at a slower rate hence, leading to the
slower release of glucose in the bloodstream. According to Englyst
et al. (1992), SDS promotes satiety; a beneﬁcial effect of athletes who
need a prolong and constant supply of glucose into their bloodstream
with a low glycemic response. Other beneﬁts of SDS include improving
the overall blood glucose control in patient suffering from diabetes
mellitus, oxidative stress reduction as well as weaken the cholesterol
levels of blood serum in a patient with hypolipoproteinaemia
(Fagbohun et al., 2020).
Resistant starch belongs to the starch fraction that resist digestion in
the small intestine but undergo fermentation by the colon microorgan-
ism to produce short-chain fatty acid (SCFA). This SCFA provides the
body with additional energy as well as a high concentration of butyrate;
a beneﬁcial chemical that helps to reduce cancer of the colon. Food high
in SDS and RS is associated with low glycemic index and hence, the de-
mand for the designing of starch food with low glycemic had increased
in recent times. However, starch in their native state contains a high
fraction of rapidly digestible starch which in turn resulted in high glu-
cose response and hence, the need to modify the native starch to over-
come this challenge. Generally, starch modiﬁed using physical,

chemical, enzymatic and genetic approaches had widely been studied
and used in the food industry as an alternative approach to improve
the slowly digestive starch fraction (Li et al., 2017).
Octenyl succinic anhydrides are categorized as a safe compound by
the Department of Agriculture (FDA), thereby improving it potential
for use in the synthesis of SDS fraction. In their studies, Ai et al. (2013)
and Simsek et al. (2015) in their separate studies reported that starches
modiﬁed using OSA reduced enzymatic digestion in comparison with
their native. Also, Remya et al. (2018) and Quintero-Castaño et al.
(2020), reported that succinylation improved the slow digestion prop-
erty of banana starch. However, to produce starch with low digestion
property, the is need to study the effect of process variables such as re-
action time, the concentration of octenyl succinic anhydrides as well as
substrate pH on the slow digestion property. Hence, the need to model
and optimized the process variables involved in the modiﬁcation of
cardaba banana starch using response surface methodology, partial
least square and artiﬁcial neural network.
Response surface methodology (RSM), a statistical and mathemati-
cal modelling method used for experimental design, building of
model, evaluating the inter-correlation between experimental factors
and to determine the optimum processing condition for maximization
or minimization of experimental response. It is basically an optimization
tools used after which the insigniﬁcant independent variables had been
screened out. RSM a found many applications in food processing opera-
tion such as bioactive compound isolation (Olawoye and Kadiri, 2016),
starch isolation (Qi et al., 2018), production of high resistant starch
(Mutlu et al., 2017), and starch crystallinity (Purohit and Rao, 2017) for-
mation of cross-linked starch.
Partial least square regression analysis (PLS) unlike RSM is a non-
linear supervised classiﬁcation, statistical and mathematical modelling
methods used to develop and established the relationship between
two experimental data sets. Although, PLS had found little application
is food, however, Chen et al. (2012b) and Maulidiani et al. (2013)
used it in comparison with artiﬁcial neural network and support vector
regression to model the antioxidant activity in green tea and Pegaga ex-
tract, respectively.
Artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) is a machine learning tools that
mimic human brain. It is made up of interconnecting neuron and
hence, it has the capability to solve complex non-linear process of two
experimental data sets (Agu et al., 2020). It is advantageous over other
non-linear modelling tools such as RSM in that it requires no prior
knowledge of the experimental data set before modelling. Many re-
searchers had employed it along with other modelling tools in model-
ling their experimental process and found its' superiority over other
tools. This study, therefore, aimed at improving the slowly digestible
starch fraction of cardaba banana starch through the modelling and op-
timization of the process variables (OSA concentration, reaction time
and substrate pH) using response surface methodology (RSM) as well
as comparing the optimized values obtained using RSM with that of par-
tial least square regression analysis (PLS-R) and artiﬁcial neural net-
work (ANN).
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cardaba banana starch isolation
Starch isolation from cardaba banana was carried out using the
method described by (Olawoye and Gbadamosi, 2020b). Brieﬂy, the ba-
nana was washed and sliced under water to prevent the browning of
the banana slices. The sliced cardaba banana was commuted using
Stephan machine (Stephan universal machine, Germany). Following
commuting, the starch mash was mixed with water and the starch sus-
pension was thereafter sieved using sieve (200um). The starch slurry
obtained was along to stand overnight after which the supernatant
was decanted. The starch residue was washed three times with distilled
water. The starch obtained was dried at 45℃ for 12 h. The dried starch
was packed in an airtight container and stored at room temperature
prior to analyses.
2.2. Production of OSA starch
The isolated cardaba banana starch (native starch) was modiﬁed
using the methodology of Han and BeMiller (2007) as modiﬁed by
Olawoye and Gbadamosi (2020b) to produce OSA starch. Native
cardaba banana Starch (100 g, dry wt.) was dispersed in 500 mL conical
ﬂask containing distilled water with constant stirring on a magnetic stir-
rer. The pH of starch slurry while stirring on the magnetic stirrer was ad-
justed to different pH ranging between 8 and 10 as speciﬁed by the
experimental design which is shown in Table 1. using 1 M NaOH and
1 M HCl. Following the adjustment of the substrate pH, different con-
centration of Octenyl succinic anhydride (3–5%) was added, and agita-
tion was continued at room temperature (≈26 ± 2 °C) while the pH
was maintained using 1 M NaOH or HCl at different reaction time rang-
ing from 30 to 60 mins. At the end each reaction time, the starch slurry
was neutralized to pH 7.0 with 1 M HCl or 1 M NaOH. The modiﬁed
starch was collected by centrifugation, washed three times with water
and was thereafter, dried at 45 °C for 12 h to obtain OSA starch. The
dried starch was kept in an airtight container until further analysis.
2.3. Experimental design
The experimental procedure for the production for improving the
slowly digestible starch of cardaba banana was based on a Box-
Behnken design (BBD) using three-level factor which generated 17 ex-
perimental runs. OSA concentration (3–4%), reaction time (30–60 min)
as well as the pH of the (8–10) were the continuous factors while the
slowly digestible starch fraction (%) was the response. The modelling
using ANN and PLS-R was done by dividing the experimental data ob-
tained from BB design into two sets: testing and training data.
2.4. Determination of OSA starch SDS content
The SDS content of the cardaba banana starch was determined fol-
lowing the method described by Olawoye et al. (2020) with slight
modiﬁcation.

2.5. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)
The short-range order structure of optimized OSA starch and native
starch were identiﬁed using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry
(FT-IR) equipped with attenuated reﬂectance (ATR). The starch sample
was placed in the FT-IR spectroscopy with the spectrum corrected to by
baseline ranging from 1200 to 800 cm−1 before deconvolution. After
that, the band intensity ratio of 1045/1022 cm−1 and 1022/995 cm−1
was evaluated.
2.6. Modelling and optimization of SDS
2.6.1. Development of RSM model
The model was ﬁtted to obtain the best polynomial equation using
the BBD experimental data. Experimental data was analyzed using De-
sign Expert 12.0.3 (Statease Inc., USA). Regression analysis, response
surface plotting and analysis of variance were analytical process
employed in the optimization of the processing condition for the isola-
tion of the SDS fraction of the cardaba banana starch. The RSM model
was tested for accuracy by comparing the predicted values with the ac-
tual values obtained for the experimental design. The data that was de-
rived from the established optimum condition established from the
developed mathematical model was employed as the validating set.
The quadratic model is given in Eq. (1).

where, Y is the response variable (SDS), b0, bi, bii, bij are the regression
coefﬁcients that shows the relationship between the responses and
the processing conditions, Xi. Xi and Xj are the coded independent vari-
ables assigned to the OSA concentration, substrate pH, and reaction
time. ⅇ represents the random error.
2.6.2. Development of ANN model
The ANN Modelling and optimization was carried out accroding to
the methods of Olawoye et al. (2020). To predict the output variable
(SDS), two transfer functions were used which were multilayer
full
feedforward
(MFFF)
and
multilayer
normal
feedforward
(MNFF), while different learning algorithms such as incremental
backpropagation (IBP), quickprob (QP), genetic algorithm (GA), batch
backpropagation (BBP), and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LM)
were used to train the ANN data sets. The ANN architecture consisted
of input, output and hidden layer. The transfer function of output and
hidden layer was iteratively determined through the expansion of sev-
eral networks. Optimal network topology was likewise determined. A
default stopping criterion of 100,000 iterations was set on the ANN dur-
ing training.
2.6.3. Development of PLS-R model
Partial least square regression modelling of the experimental data
was performed using Simca (v. 14.1, Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). The
BBD experimental data (17 observations) were used for the PLS model-
ling in which the OSA concentration, reaction time and pH were used as
the input variables (X), The SDS of the starch was used as the output
variable (Y). The BBD experimental data sets were split randomly into
two groups in which 11 observations were used for training data sets
while 6 observations were used as testing data sets. Models were devel-
oped using the training data sets to ﬁnd the optimal parameters while
the validation of the model was done using the testing data sets. The ac-
curacy of the experimental model was done using the R2 and Q2. The co-
efﬁcient of determinant (R2) indicates the goodness of ﬁt of the
experimental model while the goodness of prediction of the experimen-
tal model for the Y-variable as well as the signiﬁcance of the PLS compo-
nents is depicted by Q2. The validity and degree of ﬁt of the PLS model
were determined using a permutation test. The variable importance in
the regression coefﬁcient and projection (VIP) was analyzed using the
interaction between the independent (X) and dependent variable (Y).
Finally, the score plot and loading of the PLS-R was evaluated for the dis-
tribution of the experimental observations.
3. Result and discussions
3.1. Regression model and statistical analysis
The Box-Behnken design (BBD) for the starch digestibility index, as
well as their actual and predicted response, is shown in Table 1. The
value of the slowly digestible starch varied between 31.88 and 44.68%.
The experimental data were ﬁtted and subjected to multiple regression
analysis to determine and evaluate the coefﬁcient of estimate and
model equation. The model was ﬁtted and the second-order polynomial
model equation for the prediction of the response is shown in Eq. (2). As
shown in Eq. (2), A, B, C represent the succinate concentration, time and
pH, respectively.

þ 4:17A2−2:12B2 þ 1:45C2
ð2Þ
The multiple regression analysis and ANOVA results of the model is
shown in Table 2. The ANOVA result reveals that the quadratic model
is signiﬁcant in predicting the experimental design due to its low p-
value (<0.0001) as well as its high Fisher test (F value) value
(645.80). Among the terms, the linear term of succinate concentration
and the reaction time was observed to be signiﬁcant at p < 0.01, while
the linear term of the substrate pH was only signiﬁcant at p < 0.05. Of
all the terms, only the cross-product term of reaction time and substrate
pH was observed not to be signiﬁcant (p > 0.05). In the order of level of
importance, the quadratic term of OSA concentration was found to be
most important of the terms due to its highest Fishers test value
(2308.95) followed by the cross-product between succinate concentra-
tion and substrate pH. The lack-of-ﬁt which is a measure of the predict-
ability of the multiple regression model by comparing the variation
around the regression model was found to be insigniﬁcant (p > 0.05) in-
dicating that there was 11.9% chance that the lack of ﬁt is due to noise.
The predictability and adequacy of the model were evaluated based
on the coefﬁcient of determinant (R2). According to Guan and Yao
(2008), a model is tagged good for ﬁt if the coefﬁcient of determinant
(R2) which is a measure of goodness of ﬁt is greater than 0.80. As it
could be seen from the result, the coefﬁcient of determinant, as well
as the adjusted R2, is 0.9980 and 0.9973, respectively. The closeness to
one of the coefﬁcients of determinant and adjusted R2 is a conﬁrmation

that the experimental model can predict adequately the experimental
process.
Another quality parameter to determine the accuracy of the qua-
dratic model to adequately predict the experimental data is the coefﬁ-
cient of variation which measures the ratio of the standard deviation
of estimate to the mean values of the observed response. The low
value of the CV (0.51%) denotes the responsibility and suitability of
the experimental model.. The synergetic effect and the importance of
the experimental model terms on the dependent variable of the slowly
digestible starch was evaluated using the regression model and pre-
sented in Eq. (2).
Aside reaction time, all linear terms had negative coefﬁcient of esti-
mate as reﬂect in the equation. These resulted in a negative coefﬁcient
of estimate between the model terms and the subsequent slowly digest-
ible starch. This implies that an increase in these terms will result in a
decrease in the slowly digestible starch fraction of the succinic anhy-
dride modiﬁed cardaba banana starch. The cross-product terms, the
quadratic term of succinate concentration and pH had a positive coefﬁ-
cient of estimate and hence positive relationship between the terms and
the corresponding slowly digestible starch. This ﬁndings also commen-
surate with the report of Betancur-Ancona et al. (2002) who reported a
positive effect of pH variation on Jack bean.

3.2. Interactions of independent variables and process optimization
The 3-D surface plot which shows the impact of the independent
variables impacted on the percentage SDS is shown in Fig. 1(a–c). The
simultaneous effect of the succinate concentration and reaction time
while holding the pH constant is presented in Fig. 1(a). The ﬁgure re-
vealed that the initial increase in the succinate concentration resulted
in a decrease in the slowly digestible starch yield, however, increasing
the concentration above 4.47% resulted in a slight increase in the SDS
yield. The initial decrease in SDS value was observed at low reaction
time and this could be due to the inability of the functional group within
the modify agent (succinic anhydride) to fuse to the hydroxyl group of
the starch and hence, the ability of the hydrolyzing enzymes to rapidly
digest the starch. The single effect of the reaction time shows that the in-
crease in the reaction time up 46.2 min brought about a slight reduction
in the yield of the slowly digestible starch, however, increasing the time
further led to a spontaneous decrease in the percentage slowly digest-
ible starch. The increase in the SDS fraction of the starch as the reaction
time increases can be attributed to the replacement of the hydroxyl
group present in the starch molecule by the functional group of the
modifying agents (OSA) (Altuna et al., 2018). For maximum slowly di-
gestible starch yield, the succinic anhydride concentration needs to be
at maximum coupled a time of reaction of 48 ± 1 min.
Fig. 1(b) shows how varying concentration of succinic anhydride
and pH impacted the percentage of SDS of starches that were modiﬁed
using the succinylation process while keeping reaction time constant.
The result revealed a response surface with a minimum point. The effect
of pH on the SDS yield shows that an increase in the pH resulted in a re-
duction in the yield of the SDS while an increase in the succinate con-
centration resulted in an initial decrease in the SDS yield. However, a
succinate concentration of 4.56% and above slightly led to an increase
in the slowly digestible starch. The effect of pH and time of succinylation
reveals that the pH of the substrate had a linear effect on the percentage
slowly digestible (Fig. 1c). As shown in the ﬁgure, the pH at a lower time
of reaction had little or no effect on the SDS yield, however, a slight in-
crease in the reaction time led to increase in the percentage SDS at max-
imum pH. The increase is SDS of the starch at maximum pH of the
substrate could be due to the increase in the reaction efﬁciency as well
as the degree of substitution thereby resulting in sufﬁcient activation
of the hydroxyl group for the nucleophilic attack of the anhydride moi-
eties (Segura-Campos et al., 2008). Optimal condition values for the pro-
duction of slowly digestible starch from cardaba banana was established
using RSM were OSA concentration of 4%, reaction time of 47.49 min,
and pH of 10 which yielded a predicted SDS value of 44.64%, which
was validated experimentally as 44.68% SDS.
3.3. SDS modelling using artiﬁcial neural network
Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) are computer-based program
which mimics the human brain by modelling the interaction between
independent variables and their responses. In the neural network
modelling for this study, the input variables were the succinate concen-
tration, pH, and time, while the output variables majorly the slowly di-
gestible starch of the modiﬁed cardaba banana starch. Olawoye et al.
(2020) in their previous study, reported the occurrence of many learn-
ing algorithms hence the difﬁculty in the pre-selection of the algorithm
to be used in advance. Owing to this, several learning algorithms were
used to detect the algorithm that best ﬁt the experimental data used
in the artiﬁcial neural network modelling. This result obtained is pre-
sented in Table 3 and the result revealed that the increment
backpropagation (IBP) algorithm best ﬁt the experimental data. This
was used to build a multilayer full feed-forward neural architecture.
Moreover, the neural network is affected by the type of transfer
functions used. This affect both the learning rate as well as the perfor-
mance of the network. With this respect, several transfer functions
were applied to the hidden and output layers and it was observed that
the sigmoid-sigmoid transfer functions bring about the acceptable
model. In a network architecture, the number of hidden layers to be
used in the network topology is important and hence there is a need
to carefully select the number of hidden layers. To achieved this, a trial
by error method is used in the selection of the number of hidden layers
and the result which is based on the best goodness of ﬁt is presented in
Fig. 2. Therefore, 3-9-1 network architecture (Fig. 3) was used which in-
dicates three input variables, nine hidden layers and one output layer.
Many input and output transfer functions were used; however, the
sigmoid-sigmoid transfer function was chosen in that it gave the highest
coefﬁcient of determinant and lowest root mean square of error. The re-
sult of the ANN modelling as shown in Table 3 revealed the value of
0.9988 and 0.019 were obtained for the coefﬁcient of determinant
(R2) and RMSE, respectively for the training data set while the result
of the testing revealed that the value of the coefﬁcient of determinant
(R2) and RMSE were 0.9991 and 1.54 respectively. The result obtained
revealed that the artiﬁcial neural network can be used to predict the re-
lationship between the independent (input) variables and slowly di-
gestible starch yield adequately. Optimal condition values for the
production of SDS from cardaba banana was established using ANN
and the optimal conditions were OSA concentration of 3.69%, a reaction
time of 43.75 min, and pH of 9.8 which yield a slowly digestible starch of
44.84%.

3.4. SDS modelling using PLS modelling
The result of the PLS analysis revealed that both the ﬁrst and compo-
nent contributed 33.33% variance in the experimental data sets, there-
fore, the two components amounted to 66.67% of the total variation of
the experimental data sets. The result of the score scatter plot of t[1]
against t[2] for the training and testing data sets from the PLS model is
shown in Fig. 4(a & b). The relationship between the independent vari-
ables (OSA concentration, reaction time and pH) and the dependent
variable (slowly digestible starch) was evaluated using the partial
least square (PLS). The accuracy of the PLS model in describing the
data sets of the experiment was determined using the coefﬁcient of de-
terminant (R2), the goodness of prediction Q2 and root mean square of
error (RMSE).
According to Olawoye et al. (2017), a model is said to be accurate in
predicting the experimental data sets if the R2 is higher than 0.8 and the
RMSE is as low as possible. The high R2 (0.999) coupled with low RMSE
(0.1263) of the PLS model indicates the goodness of ﬁt of the model, the
goodness of predictability of the model for the dependent (Y) variables
(Q2) is 0.599. According to Eriksson et al. (2006), a PLS model with Q2
above 0.5 indicates good predictability. Table 4, reveals the regression

coefﬁcient of the PLS model. As it can be seen from the result, all the
model terms had a positive regression coefﬁcient with the slowly di-
gestible starch except for the linear and quadratic term of the reaction
time which had a negative regression coefﬁcient. The positive regres-
sion coefﬁcient indicates a positive synergy between the model term
and the Y variable and vice versa. Owing to the regression coefﬁcient,
the prediction regression model is shown in Eq. (3).
The ranking, as well as the variable importance of projection (VIP) of
the model terms, is presented in Table 4. According to Cho et al. (2009),
a VIP value above one (1) is termed signiﬁcant while a value below 0.5 is
regarded as insigniﬁcant ones. As shown in Table 4, the quadratic term
of the OSA concentration was ranked ﬁrst with the highest VIP (1.889)
and hence, the most signiﬁcant model terms. However, the interaction
terms of OSA concentration and reaction time, reaction time and pH,
as well as the linear terms of reaction time and pH in which their VIP
values fell below 0.5, were not signiﬁcant in predicting the PLS model.
A 3D surface plot to show the interactions between the independent
variables is shown in Fig. 2(d–f). The result obtained from Fig. 2(d–f)
shows a similar trend to that of RSM. Fig. 5. shows the permutation
test for the third component of the PLS model. According to the result,
the Y-axis intercept of R2 and Q2 is 0.297 and −0.223, respectively. In
the report of Eriksson et al. (2006), a PLS model is termed valid and
obey thumb's rule if the Y-axisintercept of R2 is less than 0.3 and Q2 is
less than 0.05. Also, the farther the R-line is to the horizontal line, the
more valid the PLS model is which is an afﬁrmation of the result ob-
tained for the experimental model.

3.5. Comparison between PLS and ANN model
Comparison between PLS and ANN analysis was done by evaluating
the conformity of the predicted and actual percentage slowly digestible
starch. Fig. 6(a–d) reveals the relationship between the training data
sets and testing data sets of the ANN and PLS analysis. It could be seen
from the result that both the training and testing data sets of the ANN
and PLS models exhibit the same trends. For the PLS model, the R2 and
RMSEE values for the training and testing data sets were 0.981; 0.092
and 0.997; 0.268, respectively. The high coefﬁcient of determinant
(R2) for both the testing and training data set is an indication of the pre-
dictability and accuracy of the PLS model. The RMSEE value of the train-
ing data set is low which indicates the ﬁt of the observations of the PLS
model. Also, the R2 of the training and testing data set of the ANN model
were 0.9945 and 0.9999, respectively. The result obtained from both the
ANN and PLS model shows there was an increase in the coefﬁcient of de-
terminant (R2) of the testing data set over the training data set which in-
dicates good predictability of the models. This observation, however,
contradicts the ﬁndings of Maulidiani et al. (2012) and Chen et al.
(2012a) who reported a decrease in the R2 from training to testing
data sets. This reduction was reported to be due to large numbers of
input in the PLS and ANN models.
3.6. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)
The external region of the starch granule can be studied using the
ATR FT-IR spectrum. According to Warren et al. (2016), the band inten-
sity at 1100–900 cm−1 had shown to be sensitive to changes in the
structure of starch especially the spectrum band at 1000, 1022 and
1047 cm−1. starch samples with more amorphous region had higher
1022 cm−1 band while there exists a deﬁnite crystallinity for the band
at 1000 and 1047 cm−1 for crystalline starch samples. These properties
of starch have led to the measurement of the short-range ordered mo-
lecular structure through the adoption of the band ratios at
1022:1000 cm−1 and 1047:1022 cm−1. Fig. 7 shows the short-range
FT-IR spectra of both the native and optimized succinate starch, the ﬁg-
ure revealed that both FT-IR spectra were similar. As reported by
Warren et al. (2016), starches with similar FT-IR spectra exhibit the
same crystalline structure. From Fig. 7, the FT-IR ratios of 1047/1022
and 1022/995 cm−1 was calculated and the values were 0.9062 and
1.087, respectively for native starch while the values obtained for opti-
mized succinate starch were 1.0903 and 1.004, respectively. According
to Warren et al. (2016), the 1022:1000 cm−1 intensity ratio is sensitive
to hydration resulting in liquid-crystalline polymeric structure of the
native starch and hence the susceptibility of the starch to enzymatic hy-
drolysis. The 1047/1022 intensity band ratio was found to increase due

to succinylation and could be attributed to the ordered helical structure
formation leading to the crystallinity of the succinate starch.
4. Conclusion
Cardaba banana starch was extracted and esteriﬁed successfully to
produce slowly digestible starch using octenyl succinic anhydride. The
esteriﬁcation process yields a slowly digestible starch which ranged be-
tween 31.88 and 44.68%. Modelling the SDS using RSM, ANN, and PLS
revealed that all the models were signiﬁcant in predicting accurately
the experimental process. Optimal condition values for the production
of slowly digestible starch from cardaba banana was established using
RSM were OSA concentration of 4%, reaction time of 47.49 min, and
pH of 10 which yielded a predicted SDS value of 44.644%, which was val-
idated experimentally as 44.68% SDS. The optimal conditions values for
the production of SDS using ANN were OSA concentration of 3.69%, re-
action time of 43.75 min, and pH of 9.8 which yield a slowly digestible
starch of 44.84%. A comparison between RSM, ANN, and PLS in model-
ling the SDS fractions revealed that ANN, followed by PLS demonstrated
better predictability over RSM. This study revealed that cardaba banana
