1. Introduction 
Mobile communication is one of the most advanced ways for communication in the world. With its 
network coverage and capacity having reached a high level, quality, cost and service are more concerned 
about [1]. How to make the communication network to run at their best and provide users with high-quality 
network services? They are the primary tasks of the network operation and management. The worst cells have

become the key indicators to measure the wireless quality in the mobile communication networks. At present, 
one of the worst cells optimization problems is how to dig out the worst district efficiently. In the past, people 
queried the worst cells just to rely on their definition [2], and the results only were the worst cells lists, which 
couldn t show the extent of their "worst". In this paper, a mining model based on the clustering algorithm is 
established to query the worst cells. It can not only dig out the worst cells efficiently, but also reflect their 
"worst" and priorities of time so as to take optimization measures accurately. So we can say that it plays an 
essential role in the optimization of wireless networks. 
2. Paper Preparation 
2.1. Select characteristic indicators 
Select data indicators clearly and accurately, understanding that the purposes of data mining are important 
steps in data mining [3]. In this model, choose seven variables which have great influence on the cells 
performance as the characteristics description indicators, they are TCH Call Dropping Rate, Each Channel 
Traffic, TCH call Dropping Number, TCH Connection Rate, TCH jam Number, TCH Jam Rate and 
Interference Number.[5] 
2.2. Data Collection and Data Preprocessing 
In this model, the data preprocessing techniques such as vacancy value processing, data cleaning and data 
transformation are mainly used. There are two kinds of processing methods to handle the vacancy value, one 
is to use the default value for filling, and the other one is to delete the record. In this paper, use the second 
method. Data cleaning mainly reduces data quantity which participates in modeling which called variable clip, 
the processing time and data capacity decrease relatively. [6][10] For example, in the same cells, TCH traffic 
and each channel traffic has a strong positive correlation in statistical sense, so use one as the indicator in 
model. Use digital code when deal with each channel traffic. According to the definition in the China Unicom 
GSM nets mobile communication performance statistics system, when each channel traffic is more than 0.6 
erl, call them super busy cells; when each channel traffic is between 0.1 erl and 0.6 erl, call them normal 
service cells; when each channel traffic is less than 0.1 erl, call them super idle cells; convert them 
respectively into 1, 2, 3. In addition, the dimension of indicators is not identical, which needs to make these 
indicator data standardizing.  
2.3. Index weight Determination 
The above indexes for the target layers have different importance, in another words, they have different 
weights. In this paper, use the method AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) to determine index weight. The 
method compare the importance between one index and another one, then establish the corresponding 
judgment matrix, at lastly, solve the eigenvalue of the matrix [9].

2.4. Design DM Algorithm 
In this model, treat the worst cells as outlier and choose clustering algorithm. Cluster analysis as a 
quantitative method, gives a more accurate and detailed classification tool on the view of data analysis. K-
means is a typical K-means algorithm based on distance, and take the distance as the similarity of the 
evaluation indicator, which thinks that the closer two objects are, the greater the similarity is. [11] The 
algorithm considers that clusters are composed of the objects with close distance, and take the Euclidean 
distance as the similarity measure, so its ultimate goal is to get the compact and independent cluster [4]. The 
specific approach is shown as follows: 
 Choose k objects at random, each object represents the initial mean or center of a cluster, for the rest of 
the objects, assign them to the most similar cluster according to the distance from them to the mean of each 
cluster. Assuming the sample set is divided into C classes, by using the vector quantity, the clustering canter 
of the Class h is represented as

In other words, this is the foundation of the algorithm similarity measure. Because of the weights  existing, 
different indexes have different influence to the clustering. It also is an important variable parameter, by

3. The Mining Model for the Worst Cell Blending in the Weight of Indictors 
3.1. Model Description 
This model is mainly divided into four modules, and respectively is the index module, data module, mining 
module and the optimization module. The index module is divided into index selection and index weight 
determination. In the process to determine the index weight, use the method AHP, relying on subjective 
experience. Data module includes related data collection and processing; Mining module is used to combine 
the index weight into the data mining algorithm and find out the worst cells promptly and accurately; the 
optimization module for the worst cells mainly includes the correlation analysis of the performance indexes, 
then takes the corresponding measures according to the different situations.

assign each object (again) to the most similar cluster; 
 Update the cluster mean to calculate the mean of the objects in each cluster until no longer changes.

3.3. Results Analysis and Model Verification 
Realize the mining model for the worst cells, and get some conclusions such as the follows: 
 According to the sorting, 14 sample cells have the worst quality, followed by 10 sample cells, they all 
need to find the reasons and be processed as far as quickly.  
 According to the clustering results, the cells in cluster 1 have good indicators, cannot be temporarily 
processed; the cells in cluster 4 have the worst indicators, so they are the worst ones. We need to find out the 
reasons and process them in time. The "worst" extent of the cells in cluster 2 and cluster 3 is between the 
cluster 1 s and the cluster 4 s, with different situations, so we need to take various measures to treat them.  
 According to the definition of the worst cells in the Chinese Unicom GSM nets mobile communication 
performance statistics system, 14 and 10 samples of the telephone traffic are set to 2, and satisfy the 
requirements that every channel traffic value must be during 0.1 erl and 0.6 erl. They also have more than 3% 
call dropping rate. Verify the correctness of the definition by the model results.[8]All tables should be 
numbered with Arabic numerals. Headings should be placed above tables, left justified. Leave one line space 
between the heading and the table. Only horizontal lines should be used within a table, to distinguish the 
column headings from the body of the table, and immediately above and below the table. Tables must be 
embedded into the text and not supplied separately. Below is an example which authors may find useful. 
 Get rid of the history that just relied on the definition to query the worst cells, and mine out the worst 
cells efficiently, also reflect the "worst" extent of the worst cells, at last improve the efficiency of dealing with 
the cells which have the worst quality. 
4. Conclusion 
The proposed mining model of the worst cells based on clustering algorithm, blending in the index weights, 
just offers a new idea to dig out the worst cells effectively. To some extent, it has certain significance on the 
development and optimization of wireless network, but still has a lot of problems. One is that only consider 
the congestion and interference problems when indicators are selected, but actually there are still many other 
performance indicators; another one is that K-means algorithm itself has many defects to improve and the 
method(AHP) has strong subjectivity. Therefore, we still need further studies to optimize and solve the worst 
cells problems.
