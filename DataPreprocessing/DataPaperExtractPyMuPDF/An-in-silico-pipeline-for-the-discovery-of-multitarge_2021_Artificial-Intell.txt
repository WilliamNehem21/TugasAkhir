The search for novel therapeutic compounds remains an overwhelming task owing to the time-consuming and 
expensive nature of the drug development process and low success rates. Traditional methodologies that rely on 
the one drug-one target paradigm have proven insuﬃcient for the treatment of multifactorial diseases, leading 
to a shift to multitarget approaches. In this emerging paradigm, molecules with oﬀ-target and promiscuous in- 
teractions may result in preferred therapies. In this study, we developed a general pipeline combining machine 
learning algorithms and a deep generator network to train a dual inhibitor classiﬁer capable of identifying pu- 
tative pharmacophoric traits. As a case study, we focused on dual inhibitors targeting DNA methyltransferase 1 
(DNMT) and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), two enzymes that play a central role in epigenetic regulation. We 
used this approach to identify dual inhibitors from a novel large natural product database in the public domain. 
We used docking and atomistic simulations as complementary approaches to establish the ligand-interaction pro- 
ﬁles between the best hits and DNMT1/HDAC2. By using the combined ligand- and structure-based approaches, 
we discovered two promising novel scaﬀolds that can be used to simultaneously target both DNMT1 and HDAC2. 
We conclude that the ﬂexibility and adaptability of the proposed pipeline has predictive capabilities of simi- 
lar or derivative methods and is readily applicable to the discovery of small molecules targeting many other 
therapeutically relevant proteins. 
Introduction 
The epigenetic landscape encompasses a series of protein families 
associated with gene modulation. These mechanisms involve chemical 
modiﬁcations around histone side chains, thus changing its stability 
or favoring protein-protein interactions [1] . Currently, research eﬀorts 
have turned to epigenetics as the missing link in chronic diseases such 
as cancer or Alzheimer’s [2] . Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are a promi- 
nent example of clinically relevant epi ‑targets. The human genome in- 
cludes 18 HDAC isoforms, classiﬁed in four classes based on their se- 
quence homology to yeast protein [3] . To date, HDAC inhibitors con- 
stitute a novel alternative for the treatment of neoplasia. Other studies 
have shown increased therapeutic applications of HDAC inhibitors, in- 
cluding those as anti-inﬂammatory [4] and antiviral agents [5] . A sig- 
niﬁcant concern for such therapies is drug safety because HDACs pre- 
serve a catalytic Zn 2+ core and potent inhibitors often result in pan- 
HDAC inhibition and pleiotropic eﬀects with no clear mechanism of

action [6] . Recent studies have proposed the collective inhibition of 
other epi ‑targets, such as readers (e.g., bromodomains) or other writ- 
ers (e.g., DNA-5-methyltransferases), to improve their biological activity 
and clinical eﬃcacy [7] . Thus, research on epigenetic polypharmacol- 
ogy or epi ‑polypharmacology is on the rise [8–10] . 
DNA methylation is the addition of methyl groups to cytosine to 
produce 5-methyl cytosine [11] . This reaction is catalyzed by DNA- 
methyltransferases (DNMTs), which include DNMT1, which has a main- 
tenance role as it preserves the methylation pattern, and DNMT3A/B, 
which is responsible for de novo DNA methylation [12] . Experimental 
evidence suggests that mitotic inheritance of this epi ‑mark has complex 
implications in aging and tumorigenic processes [13] . The pharmaceu- 
tical potential of DNMT inhibition is irrefutable, yet most clinically ap- 
proved inhibitors include nucleosides, which have long-term safety con- 
cerns such as mitochondrial toxicity [ 14 , 15 ]. Therefore, it is urgently 
needed to search for novel non-nucleoside scaﬀolds or privileged struc- 
tures as DNMT inhibitors [16] .

Fig. 1. The CADD pipeline proposed in this 
work integrates ligand-based and structure- 
based methods for virtual screening of 
DNMT1/HDAC2 dual inhibitors. 
Computer-aided drug design (CADD) has revolutionized drug dis- 
covery and development. Although CADD still has several areas of im- 
provement [17] , it has contributed directly to the development of 70 
drugs in clinical use [18] . CADD uses two main approaches: Structure- 
based drug design (SBDD) and ligand-based design drug design (LBDD). 
SBDD is a common approach that primarily relies on molecular model- 
ing and simulation, while LBDD focuses on small molecule featurization 
and characterization of high-dimensional data. Computational methods 
have shown notable success for single-target molecules, but a major 
challenge in multitarget drug design is the selection of target combi- 
nations for the desired therapeutic eﬀect [19] . In the SBDD approach, 
the pocket similarity between proteins is expected for better results and 
hit enrichment [20] . From the LBDD perspective, the hunting ground 
for multitarget molecules is the putative intercept of small molecule’s 
chemical spaces. Recently, machine-learning approaches combined with 
fragment or scaﬀold searches have yielded promising results [21] . 
Despite these advances, a predictive model capable of informing 
the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of multitarget drugs (i.e., 
structure-multiple activity relationships) is highly dependent on the di- 
versity, size, and quality of the available data. Over the last few decades, 
many computational tools derived from machine learning and natural 
language processing are now able to transform molecular structural in- 
formation, from small amounts of experimental data, into a helpful rep- 
resentation suited for the generation of novel compounds generated in 
silico . Applying these new algorithms into the drug discovery pipeline 
represents a big step in reducing resource expenditure, thus providing 
a wide range of growth opportunities for non-traditional players in the 
market, such as academia and developing countries [22–24] . 
The development of multitarget pharmacological therapies, capable 
of regulating diﬀerent biological targets related to a speciﬁc disease 
[ 25 , 26 ], represents a challenging pharmacological problem because of 
the high complexity of the protein signaling networks involved in the 
physiopathology of the disease [27] , prompting for eﬃcient tools for de- 
signing master key compounds. Examples of privileged scaﬀolds have 
been described in the literature, including benzodiazepines as seda- 
tive agents [28] , CCK antagonists [29] , and bromodomain inhibitors 
[30] . These structures may serve as starting points for lead develop- 
ment [31] or chemical library design [32] , thus pressing the need for 
further study and characterization [33] . To overcome these challenges, 
in this study, we introduce a CADD pipeline that integrates SDBB and 
LBDD methods for the virtual screening of dual inhibitors ( Fig. 1 ). 
As a case study, we applied this virtual screening protocol to identify 
DNMT1/HDAC2 dual inhibitors. The pipeline is based on open-access 
data and tools, using records from public molecular repositories and 
medicinal chemistry groups. This methodology takes advantage of con- 
ventional machine learning classiﬁers, a multi-objective particle swarm

optimization algorithm, and a deep generator network latent space to 
train a dual inhibitor classiﬁer for virtual screening [ 34 , 35 ]. We success- 
fully generated new molecular hypotheses derived from large natural 
products public repositories that meet a required proﬁle. 
Methodology 
Dataset acquisition and preprocessing 
We trained two classiﬁers as future parameters of a swarm optimizer 
objective function to guide the optimization algorithm to an enriched 
segment of the chemical space. We obtained molecular bioactivity pub- 
lic information of DNMT1 inhibitors using a curated dataset previously 
published [36] . The dataset was enriched with activity data available 
in ChEMBL25 [37] selecting compounds with IC 50 values lower than 
100 𝜇M. Also, we retrieved HDAC2 inhibitors from a dataset reported 
by our group [38] . We ﬁltered and curated the eﬀectors using the pa- 
rameters reported by Fourches et al. [39] . We used Open Babel [40] and 
DataWarrior (v. 5.2.1) [41] to perform the canonical linear notation 
line-entry system cSMILES, protonation states, molecular properties val- 
ues (between the Rule of Five and the Rule of Three range), as well as 
metal salts, small fragments, and removal of duplicated entries. The to- 
tal number of compounds considered in this study is summarized in 
Table 1 . 
The negative class of HDAC2 (non-inhibitors) was obtained by cal- 
culating a diverse subset with RDKit (v.2018.09.3) and Mayachemtools 
[45] of the HDAC decoys in the Oxford Protein Informatics Group site 
[46] . For DNMT1 inhibitors, counterparts were generated on-demand 
with DeepCoy [44] using the active compounds dataset as reference. 
The compounds of interest were generated to match DUD-E descriptors 
in a 150:1 decoy-to-reference ratio following selection of top decoys us- 
ing the provided DeepCoy scripts. Finally, the following descriptors for 
both sets were calculated in DataWarrior: molecular weight (MW), topo- 
logical polar surface area (TPSA), cLogP, number of rotatable bonds, the 
fraction of sp 3 carbon atoms, number of H-bond acceptors, and donors.

We conducted principal component analysis (PCA) of the seven auto- 
scaled properties for analysis and visualization. 
Independent DNMT1 and HDAC2 classiﬁers 
Data preprocessing. Each dataset point was represented with the 
help of the RDKit Python module [34] as a concatenated vector of Mor- 
gan Binary Fingerprints ( n = 2) [47] and seven previously described 
molecular descriptors. Given the numerical features diﬀerences, each 
representation was standardized, subtracting the mean and scaling to 
unit variance using the Scikit-learn module [48] in Python. 
Model training and validation . We compared the performance of 
four diﬀerent classiﬁcation algorithms for each dataset (i.e., DNMT1 
and HDAC2): logistic regression (LRC), decision trees (DTC), random 
forest (RFC), and extreme gradient boosting classiﬁers (xgboost classi- 
ﬁer; XGBC). The comparison was performed with Scikit-learn and xg- 
boost [49] Python modules. Each model was trained and validated by 
ten-fold cross-validation and grid search optimization to tune their re- 
spective hyperparameters. Finally, we selected the logistic regression 
model for both classiﬁers, given its compatibility with the swarm op- 
timizer architecture and performance comparing with the best perfor- 
mance model, xgboost. 
Compound generation 
The small number of dual inhibitors publicly available makes it 
almost impossible to apply traditional machine learning methodolo- 
gies to determine the general molecular pattern responsible for dual 
DNMT1/HDAC2 inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we applied a 
multi-objective molecular particle swarm optimizer coupled to a contin- 
uous latent space obtained from a deep generator network pre-trained by 
the translation process from SMILES to canonical SMILES of 75 million 
molecules [34] . This algorithm uses RDKit functions like drug-likeness 
[50] , synthetic accessibility [51] , and partition coeﬃcient to construct 
an objective function for guiding the compound generation. 
The objective function allows the inclusion of in-house models as 
part of their parameters, enabling the pre-trained classiﬁers inclusion 
to constrain the chemical space into a region enriched by hypothetical 
multitarget compounds related to dual inhibition. In this work, the scor- 
ing function includes approximations of general desirable parameters 
for drug design, including drug-likeness, synthetic accessibility, heavy 
atoms count, substructure matching; also including DNMT1 inhibitors 
and HDAC2 inhibitors pre-trained classiﬁers. These parameters were 
heuristically weighted as follows: Objective Function = 22.5 (DNMT in- 
hibitor classiﬁer) + 22.5 (HDAC inhibitor classiﬁer) + 15 (Drug-likeness 
function) + 40 (Synthetic Accessibility function + Macrocycles penaliz- 
ing function + Heavy Atoms Count function + ChEMBL_Structure + Sub- 
structure_Match). We chose these speciﬁc weights to balance the struc- 
tural features of the generated molecules, considering pharmacophoric 
elements previously suggested for DNMT1 [52] and HDAC2 [53] during 
the curation and ﬁltering process. The substructure matching query was 
N-( p -methylphenethyl)-benzamide. This compound was selected based 
on selective HDAC2 inhibition, which may be related to other mech- 
anisms beyond zinc interactions, such as hydrogen bonding networks 
[54] . 
To further restrict the chemical space of generated compounds, we 
selected four structurally diverse queries as the optimization starting 
point (molecular seeds, Chart 1 ): gliburide (DNMT inhibitor), panobi- 
nostat (HDAC inhibitor and low DNMT inhibitor; [16] ), 15a (nanomo- 
lar dual inhibitor) [55] , and SAHA (HDAC inhibitor, also the structural 
basis for both 15a and panobinostat). 
Generation of putative dual inhibitors 
We employed the previously described scoring function to gener- 
ate between 1000 and 2500 molecules starting from the selected seeds 
(within an average of 30 optimization steps and 45 runs). The resulting 
structures were subjected to a semi-automated selection process to alle- 
viate the tendency of these molecular generators to produce uncommon 
substructures, intricate chemical patterns, duplicate molecules, small di- 
versity sets, or structurally incorrect compounds [56] . Given the phar- 
macophoric traits of the generated molecules, our hypothesis holds that 
many of these molecules contain enough structural information to elu- 
cidate the general pattern necessary to produce a biological response 
in one or two of the selected biological targets. To further increment 
the molecular diversity of putative dual inhibitors, we added ten decoys 
for each generated structure using DeepCoy generator. Finally, we ran- 
domly selected one of the ten decoys obtained per structure, resulting in 
a balanced proportion of approximately 1:1 positive and negative exam- 
ples. The ﬁnal dataset was preprocessed and represented as described 
for the independent DNMT1 and HDAC2 datasets. 
Dual inhibitors classiﬁer 
Xgboost [49] was developed to control over-ﬁtting, improve per- 
formance, and increase computing speed compared with other tradi- 
tional non-ensemble algorithms. Therefore, we selected this classiﬁca- 
tion method, applied grid search for hyperparameter tuning followed 
by ten-fold cross-validation. Training of the ﬁnal dual inhibitors clas- 
siﬁer was done using the dataset of generated putative dual inhibitors, 
described in the last section. 
Virtual screening 
Natural products continue to have paramount importance in drug 
discovery [57] . Often curated by a trial-and-error process searching for 
therapeutic agents, it is not surprising that almost one-third of FDA- 
approved new chemical entities were derived from natural sources [58] . 
For this reason, we selected a large natural product collection available 
in the public domain as the chemical space for virtual screening: the 
natural products database COCONUT with more than 406,076 unique 
ﬂat natural products collected from 53 data sources [59] . Of note, the 
virtual screening protocol proposed in this work can be used with any 
small-molecule database. 
Using the model trained with the generated molecules, we selected 
the compounds with class probability values between 0.5 and 0.9. 
We also removed highly halogenated molecules (i.e., those with three 
or more halogen substitutions) and structures with MW higher than 
650 Da; this value was selected as a cutoﬀ based on the MW distribution 
(see Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). A dimension- 
ality reduction and visualization for the resulting molecules were ap- 
plied using T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) [60] on 
molecules PathFp descriptors from DataWarrior (binary hashed vector 
that encodes up to seven atoms linear strands). The resulting color-coded 
classiﬁer probability 2D space was used for selecting hits, with each 
node representing a low dimensionality molecular embedding and each 
edge representing the similarity between adjacent nodes. In this way, a 
pair of connected compounds with a substantial diﬀerence in probabil- 
ity could be considered an activity cliﬀ [61] , where slight probability 
diﬀerences may be interpreted as a continuous SAR. 
Molecular modeling of natural product hits 
After hit selection and inspection, compounds were submitted to a se- 
ries of analyses to better characterize their putative interaction as dual 
DNMT1/HDAC2 inhibitors. The ﬁrst step involves a ﬂexible pharma- 
cophoric alignment between hits and compounds 12a ( Figure S8 in the 
Supporting Information ) and 15a ( Fig. 2 ) synthesized by Yuan et al. 
[62] . This was done with pharmACOphore, as this utility bases its scor- 
ing of alignment on the ant colony optimization metaheuristic [63] . The 
hits selected from the previous analysis were docked to DNMT1 (PDB ID: 
3SWR) and HDAC2 (PDB ID: 6WBW) to test their putative interaction

with the epi ‑enzymes. We performed molecular docking with PLANTS 
(v.1.2) [64] . The binding site was deﬁned within a 10 Å sphere around 
the co-crystalized ligand of each protein; 25 orientations for each hit 
were further inspected and selected based on their 3D similarity and 
interactions using the orientation found in the crystal structures as ref- 
erence. The best protein-ligand models were relaxed for 200-ns using 
all-atom molecular dynamics simulations (MD) in a solution containing 
150 mM NaCl using AMBER on Tesla V100 GPUs [65] . In all cases, we 
used the AMBER ﬀ19SB [66] and the General AMBER [67] force ﬁelds to 
model protein, water, ions, and small molecules. The trajectories were 
analyzed using MDTraj (v.1.9.4) [68] and Contact Map (v.0.7.0) [69] . 
Results and discussion 
DNMT1 and HDAC 2 datasets 
Visual representation of chemical space with PCA (for covariance 
values see Table S1 in Supporting Information) showed signiﬁcant dif- 
ferences between DNMT1 actives and decoys ( Fig. 2 ). This was ev- 
idenced from property distribution among the calculated descriptors 
(Figures S1-S3 in the Supporting Information), particularly those related 
to solubility and polarity. In contrast, for HDAC2, a signiﬁcant overlap 
can be observed, as decoys cover similar regions on the visualized space 
( Fig. 2 ). The distribution of compounds in the chemical space is the 
result of DeepCoy using more than 25 descriptors and a high number 
of iterations (around 1000–2000 decoys per active molecule) to con- 
struct decoys. [44] . We also postulate that better coverage for DNMT1 
decoys may be observed in this chemical space. To balance the com- 
putational cost and accuracy of the model, we selected 150 decoys per 
active molecule that have shown better performance than the original 
DUD-E [44] . 
Classiﬁcation and model selection 
We chose logistic regression as the best performance model by grid 
search model comparison. The results of cross-validation, confusion ma- 
trix, and overall mean accuracy for DNMT1 and HDAC2 inhibitors are

It has been reported that RFC often outperforms LRC [ 70 , 71 ]. In this 
study, we found that LRC produces similar results to those by RFC with 
modest computational resources (e.g., a typical laptop or desktop com- 
puter with four CPU cores). This feature is key for the performance of 
the algorithm, as virtual screening campaigns are often conducted on 
databases containing 10 5 –10 7 molecules [72] . While it can be argued 
that the improved performance of LRC methods is achieved at the ex- 
pense of accuracy, a recent study showed that there are no signiﬁcant 
diﬀerences between LRC and other algorithms in predicting outcomes 
of similar complexity (i.e., high dimensionality) [73] . In addition, XGBC 
yielded similar values to LRC, and hyperparameter selection showed

that XGBC used linear booster for best results ( Tables 2-3 ). Nevertheless, 
the LRC model simpliﬁes its implementation given module dependen- 
cies present in further steps along the pipeline. 
Property space of generated dual inhibitors 
We found that the decoy coverage improved signiﬁcantly for the gen- 
erated dual compounds ( Fig. 3 ), which may be attributed to a higher 
control over property space delimitation, as molecular seeds share com- 
mon traits and features. The impact this had on results is clear; for in- 
stance, classes are not easily separable, therefore giving further support 
to the hypothesis proposed above. Chemical space coverage of generated 
compounds shows the overall preservation of the calculated properties 
among decoys. 
Model training and validation for dual inhibitor classiﬁcation 
With the generated compounds and decoys, an independent classiﬁer 
was trained. We train an XGBC for the virtual screening task of using the 
Python Xgboost library. Model validation and optimization followed the 
same steps as implemented for DNMT1 and HDAC2 classiﬁers. Results 
are summarized in Table 4 .

Best parameters: booster = dart 
We found that hyperparameter optimization yielded better results 
based on dropouts for the adaptive regression trees (DART) method. 
This ensemble algorithm was conceived to prevent over-specialization 
often found in gradient boosted trees (GBT) [74] . We also selected this 
particular model because of its use in GBT, and because this algorithm 
has shown notable performance for protein-ligand interaction modeling 
[71] . Validation procedures are data-dependent, as class imbalances can 
lead to artifacts on classiﬁcation or prediction. In this sense, ROC curves 
are used to assess the true predictive power of a model by using the 
area under the curve as the primary value for comparison. Herein, we 
included ten-fold cross-validation and ROC curves. Based on this the in- 
dependent classiﬁers (DNMT1 and HDAC2) obtained with LRC showed 
good consistency and performance. 
In addition to ROC curves, we calculated the Matthews correlation 
coeﬃcient (MCC) to test the predictive power of developed classiﬁers 
(see Table S2 in the Supporting Information). This coeﬃcient was ini- 
tially developed to evaluate classiﬁcation performance, as it is obtained 
directly from the confusion matrix. The possible values for MCC range 
from − 1 to 1, with zero being equivalent to random chance [75] . MCC 
oﬀers some advantages over traditional metrics such as accuracy and/or 
F1 score [ 76 , 77 ]. Furthermore, MCC is robust enough to evaluate the 
predictive power of models even on “adverse ” situations such as class 
imbalance [78] .All of the models used herein obtained a good correla- 
tion with values above 0.9 and 0.85 for independent and dual classiﬁers 
respectively. 
Another common problem during machine learning campaigns is 
overﬁtting. Indeed, algorithms are prone to poor generalization if cau- 
tion is not exercised during model training. To overcome this issue, best 
practices include the use of a validation set and early stopping [79] . Ad- 
ditional measures include hyperparameter tuning; for logistic regression 
penalties, such as L1 and L2, are commonly used to avoid overﬁtting. 
For XGBoost slow learning rates and early stopping are strongly rec- 
ommended as best practices. For the case study presented hereunder, 
overﬁtting may also arise from data. Given the trend to follow speciﬁc 
pharmacophoric traits to design DNMT (nucleosides or charged amines) 
and HDAC (hydroxamates) inhibitors, we used a consensus approach for 
hit pruning using SBDD. 
Virtual screening of natural products 
The broad chemical space covered by the natural products contained 
in the COCONUT database [80] oﬀers an excellent case study to identify

potential dual inhibitors. A total of 1239 compounds (0.3% of the entire 
database) were recovered by our protocol ( Fig. 4 ). Based on scoring val- 
ues and the t-SNE connectivity, we identiﬁed two main clusters (A and 
B) to select hit compounds. In Fig. 4 , the color scale facilitates identi- 
fying compounds with a higher probability of the desired trait for dual 
inhibition. Connectivity, on the other hand, guides the identiﬁcation of 
high structural similarities among compounds. We note, however, that 
caution must be exercised when interpreting the connectivity plots as a 
cluster with heterogeneous coloring may be indicative of activity cliﬀs 
[81] . 
Cluster A (6 compounds, Fig. 4 ) showed consistent probability val- 
ues, mainly due to structure conservation. The source of diversity in this 
cluster comes from the fragments found in the main chain of the scaﬀold, 
1-oxo-hexahydro-2H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazin-7-yl-urea ( Fig. 5 A). There- 
fore, this scaﬀold has an apparent continuous SAR, with the main dif- 
ference being the aromatic substituent adjacent to the urea moiety. 
However, on closer inspection, there are notable changes on neighbor- 
ing scaﬀolds when the classiﬁer’s probability is lower than 0.7. Con- 
versely, cluster B (32 compounds, Fig. 4 ) showed a more heterogeneous 
distribution of dual activity scorings, i.e., the network representation 
suggests abrupt changes in dual activity. We found that most of the 
best-ranked compounds share a common scaﬀold: 2-{5,11-dioxo-6aH- 
isoindolo[2,1-a]quinazolin-6-y]}acetamide ( Fig. 5 B). In this cluster, the 
primary diﬀerences among neighboring compounds are the length of 
the substituent chain and the size of the capping group at the end of the 
chain. The structures of the scaﬀolds emerging from the virtual screen- 
ing are shown in Chart 2 . 
Molecular modeling of virtual screening hits 
Alignment 
We further explored the pharmacophoric similarity using the hits 
discovered in the COCONUT database. We selected ﬁve hits based 
on the classiﬁcation score used in this study; speciﬁcally, we se- 
lected two molecules from cluster A (CNP0136972 and CNP0241750, 
Fig. 5 A), which represent the scaﬀolds with a continuous SAR, and 
three molecules from cluster B (CNP0012378, CNP0390399, and 
CNP0404639, Fig. 5 B), which represent the scaﬀolds that have a more

heterogeneous SAR. Our results suggest that the computational hits 
share pharmacophoric similarity with the molecular seeds used for 
compounds generation. Therefore, we conducted ﬂexible alignments of 
pharmacophoric elements. This approach is based on the notion that 
aligned compounds share a similar structural arrangement when bound 
to their target, thus facilitating the analysis of conserved interaction pat- 
terns using spatial criteria [82] . Our analysis showed that the best hits 
give good matches to reference dual compounds ( Fig. 6 ). Comparison 
of the hits with compound 15a revealed that the common spatial dis- 
tribution of interacting elements is shared among hits discovered with 
the virtual screening approach ( Fig. 6 ). It is important to note that while 
alignment is an LBDD approach that cannot provide direct insight on the 
putative binding mode, it supports the hypothesis that a common pat- 
tern can lead to a pharmacophore hypothesis for dual DNMT1/HDAC2 
activity. 
Molecular docking of the hits onto DNMT1 and HDAC2 
For context, we summarize known interaction patterns and signiﬁ- 
cant residues for each target. Further reference can be found in Figures 
S9-S10 in the Supporting Information, which illustrates the interaction 
of DNMT1 and HDAC2 with the inhibitors used as a control in this study. 
For DNMT1, the main protein-ligand interactions associated with inhi- 
bition are glutamic acids, evidenced by the recurring trait of charged 
amines in potent inhibitors [83] . Other important residues for the inter- 
action with nucleosides include a hydrophobic dyad formed by residues 
F1145 and W1170. It has recently been suggested that residue N1578 
may serve as a bridge between the enthalpic polar glutamic acids sub- 
pocket and hydrophobic/aromatic regions of the pocket, providing an 
unexplored trait for DNMT1 inhibition [16] . 
The design of HDAC inhibitors often relies on zinc-binding groups 
[84] that result in potent but non-speciﬁc HDAC compounds. Accord- 
ingly, several hypotheses have been proposed to guide the design of se- 
lective inhibitors towards HDAC2. Recent observations point to hydro- 
gen bonding for selectivity [85] . Other compounds, such as benzamides, 
have shown weak interactions towards the zinc center. However, benza- 
mides also show selectivity for class I HDACs [86] . Molecular modeling 
of computational hits showed adequate interaction proﬁles, illustrated 
by the docking poses of screened compounds showing good agreement 
with co-crystal references, with higher deviations present for HDAC2 
( Figs. 7 and 8 ). We hypothesize that this diﬀerence arises primarily from 
the absence of a zinc anchor and the size of the compounds. Never- 
theless, consistency among poses was observed across shared scaﬀolds. 
Therefore, the binding mode for HDAC2 may not be the most repre- 
8

Artiﬁcial Intelligence in the Life Sciences 1 (2021) 100008 
sentative one because of the pre-existing conformation of the binding 
pocket, which is a well-known bias found in SBDD approaches [ 87 , 88 ]. 
Similar to the pharmacophoric alignment, molecular superposition 
of docking poses to co-crystallized ligands was conducted to identify pu- 
tative binding conﬁgurations (Figures S11-S12, in the Supporting Infor- 
mation). To this aim, we used complementary LBDD and SBDD methods 
to compare the pharmacophoric alignments and gain further insight into 
the molecular traits needed for dual DNMT1/HDAC2 inhibition. 
Molecular dynamics simulations of the ligand-protein complexes 
We performed MD simulations to determine the stability of the 
ligand-protein interactions predicted by molecular docking and to ex- 
amine potential variations in the orientation and conformation of the 
molecules in the binding pockets. The selection of docking poses is a 
signiﬁcant challenge in SBDD [89] , so we selected both consistent and 
divergent poses to analyze the interaction proﬁle of computational hits 
further. In this way, it is possible to better distinguish true binders from 
decoys [90] . Results showed that computational hits and protein com- 
plexes are relatively stable during production runs (Figures S13-S32 in 
the Supporting Information). 
Histograms in Figures S32 and S33 show contact concurrences in MD 
simulations, as obtained with Contact Map. These are computed based 
on distance thresholds between protein and ligand. Concurrences may 
be used to identify metastable states in binding events. All hits showed 
reasonable proximity with F1145 and W1170; other notable contacts in- 
clude S1146 which forms contacts with SAM and sinefungin, and with 
N1578, a prominent contact proposed for novel DNMT1 inhibitors [16] . 
For HDAC2, the predicted ligands are more mobile than in DNMT1, al- 
though this is probably an inherent behavior given their size and orien- 
tation in the binding pocket. A notable trait is the hydrophobic contact 
of the molecules with phenylalanine. Similar results have been obtained 
in other studies [91] . Molecular modeling results (docking and dynam- 
ics simulations) support the hypothesis of dual inhibition. 
Conclusions 
Drug discovery endeavors are on the hunt for novel methodologies 
or optimization strategies to diminish the high attrition rate and cost 
involved. Polypharmacology become a promising venue for better ther- 
apies, however, this increases the complexity of the rational design. 
This work introduces a general CADD pipeline that integrates LBDD 
and SBDD to support dual-target compound discovery and design. As 
a case study, we successfully developed a classiﬁer for DNMT1/HDAC2 
inhibitors using public datasets and open-access software. The classiﬁer 
uncovered two promising scaﬀolds in the COCONUT natural product 
database that was used as an example of a large screening compound 
database. Both scaﬀolds showed high scores and good interaction with 
both proteins at the molecular level. We conclude that the ﬂexibility and 
adaptability of the proposed pipeline has predictive capabilities of sim- 
ilar or derivative methods and is readily applicable to the discovery of 
small molecules targeting many other therapeutically relevant proteins.
