Fault interpretation plays a critical role in understanding the crustal development and exploring the subsurface
reservoirs such as gas and oil. Recently, signiﬁcant advances have been made towards fault semantic segmen-
tation using deep learning. However, few studies employ deep learning in fault instance segmentation. We
introduce mask propagation neural network for fault instance segmentation. Our study focuses on the description
of the differences and relationships between each fault proﬁle and the consistency of fault instance segmentations
with adjacent proﬁles. Our method refers to the reference-guided mask propagation network, which is ﬁrstly used
in video object segmentation: taking the seismic proﬁles as video frames while the seismic data volume as a video
sequence along the inline direction we can achieve fault instance segmentation based on the mask propagation
method. As a multi-level convolutional neural network, the mask propagation network receives a small number of
user-deﬁned tags as the guidance and outputs the fault instance segmentation on 3D seismic data, which can
facilitate the fault reconstruction workﬂow. Compared with the traditional deep learning method, the introduced
mask propagation neural network can complete the fault instance segmentation work under the premise of
ensuring the accuracy of fault detection.
1. Introduction
Fault interpretation is a periodic work, which involves long-term
iteration and repeated veriﬁcation. Since deep learning has been
proven superior at discovering complex structures in high-dimensional
data (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), it has attracted widespread attention
from various ﬁelds in recent years, and it has achieved good results in
image classiﬁcation, target detection, semantic segmentation, etc. For
instance, fault detection could be regarded as a semantic segmentation
problem where we classify each point in seismic data as ‘fault’ or
‘non-fault’. Therefore, many studies have applied the deep learning
method to tackle such problem (Guitton, 2018; Guo et al., 2018): Huang
et al. (2017) uses a variety of seismic attributes as the input of con-
volutional neural network (CNN) and builds a big data platform, which
promotes the application of deep learning methods in geophysics; Xiong
et al. (2018) uses seismic data slices in different directions as the input of
the neural network which make full use of the continuity of the fault in
three-dimensional space; Wu et al. (2019) uses a large number of labeled
synthetic data as the training set and introduce U-net network model
which greatly improves the effectiveness of fault detection. The
Unet-based fault detection is directly applied to the entire seismic volume
data and does not need to process each seismic voxel point separately.
This way, it makes full use of the spatial characteristics of faults and
greatly reduces the calculation cost.
Existing studies regard fault detection as a semantic segmentation
which lacks the description of the relationship between faults and the
establishment of the spatial topological structure of fault model. In order
to further reduce the labor cost and improve the effectiveness of fault
detection, we introduce instance segmentation to solve problem.
Compared with semantic segmentation, instance segmentation not only
needs to distinguish fault and non-fault, but also needs to classify and
mark different faults speciﬁcally (fault 1, fault 2 and etc). We adopt the
idea of video instance segmentation to deal with fault instance segmen-
tation because each frame of video data has continuity in time, while
seismic data has continuity in space. Video object segmentation methods
can be divided into two types: propagation-based methods and detection-
based methods. Propagation-based methods mainly leverage the tem-
poral coherence of object motion. These methods rely on the spatio-
temporal connections between pixels. The detection-based methods, on
the other hand, learn the appearance of target object from a given

annotated frame, and perform a pixel-level detection of the target object
at each frame. The core idea of our method is to combine such two modes
of fault segmentation based on both the reference proﬁle and the fault
tracking from the previous proﬁle. In our work, we make a set of 3D fault
instance segmentation labels, based on the synthetic seismic data
following Wu (2019), as training data. We train the mask propagation
neural network (Oh et al., 2018) in a step-by-step process iteratively. We
complete the fault instance segmentation in a user-deﬁned range and
show the ﬁnal result of fault reconstruction. A multi-input, multi-level
encoding and decoding convolutional neural network is used to learn the
distribution and combination rules of fault between the adjacent proﬁle
and the reference proﬁle to predict the target proﬁle, so as to realize the
fault combination modeling of the whole seismic data. The reference
proﬁle is a pre-determined reference proﬁle with fault marks, while the
adjacent proﬁle is the previous proﬁle with new fault marks transferred
down proﬁle by proﬁle. Compared with traditional deep learning
methods, such as CNN, we can not only identify faults and non-faults, but
also describe the relationships between faults. Such that we provide
valuable information for a more effective fault interpretation.
2. Method
The core of our idea is to build an analogy between seismic volume
and video stream. We take the proﬁles of seismic volumes along the

inline direction as video frames and achieve the fault instance segmen-
tation by the mask propagation method. The network achieving mask
propagation has two mainstreams: one is to exploit the appearance of the
target faults in a given reference proﬁle called reference stream, and the
other is to propagate the key proﬁles to roughly specify and locate the
target faults of interest called the target stream. Then the mask propa-
gation neural network learns the rules of distribution and the shape-shifts
among reference proﬁle, previous proﬁle and target proﬁle, and to
further complete fault instance segmentation in each proﬁle of the
seismic volume data. Eventually, using the relationship between the
faults obtained by fault instance segmentation, fault reconstruction can
be completed more easily and quickly.
3. Training data
We need 3D seismic volume data with fault instance segmentation
labels to train deep learning model. A set of 3D fault instance segmen-
tation labels are made from 3D 0–1 fault labels using a semi-automatic
picking method, as shown in Fig. 1. We manually pick the fault slices
in a large area and then classify the remaining unlabeled fault points via
k-NearstNeighbor (KNN) method (Cover, 1967). In our method, the
selected neighbor is the fault point that has been correctly classiﬁed, and
the classiﬁcation of the point to be classiﬁed is determined according to
the category of the adjacent 10, fault points (k ¼ 10). According to the
spatial distribution of fault points, the linear distance between two
sampling points in space is selected as the measurement distance. The
measuring distance is deﬁned as follows:
After the labeling work, we have 3D fault instance segmentation la-
bels, then we select 256 sets as the training dataset and 12 sets as the test
dataset. Each set consists of a total of 32 pieces of continuous seismic
proﬁles in total.
4. Network structure
In this paper, we use a mask propagation neural network with an
encoder-decoder structure, as shown in Fig. 2. The network has two input
streams, including the reference stream and the target stream. Each input
consists of one seismic proﬁle and one corresponding fault instance
segmentation mask.
The model output one result to show the fault instance segmentation
of target proﬁle. The reference stream consists of the ﬁrst seismic proﬁle
and its fault instance segmentation mask. The target stream consists of
the current seismic proﬁle and the fault instance segmentation of the
previous proﬁle. Both share a multi-level encoder designed as ResNet50
(He et al., 2016), and is contacted together through a global convolution
block, which is used to match the features of fault instance segmentation
between the reference stream and the target stream. To overcome the
limitation of convolution operation, two convolution layers of 1 � k þ k
� 1 and k � 1 þ 1 � k (e.g. k ¼ 7) are set in a global convolution block.
The two convolution layers are added to be the input of a residual
convolution block.
The decoder layer is composed of numbers of decoding blocks and is
matched with the encoder layer. The decoding block operates with skip
connections of the encoding block and up-sampling. Finally, the fault
instance segmentation mask of the target proﬁle is obtained as output
through a convolution layer and a softmax layer.
Our method relies on two kinds of knowledge, as suggested by the
structure of the mask propagation convolutional neural network: one is
the human knowledge that is the fault instance segmentation labels
picked manually, the other is the machine knowledge that is the propa-
gation rules learned from mask propagation neural network. The two
kinds of knowledge restrain and support each other to achieve the semi-
supervised fault instance segmentation in 3D seismic data.
5. Training step
In our work, the mask propagation neural network is trained in a step-
by-step process iteratively, as shown in Fig. 3. If the ﬁrst seismic proﬁle is
considered as the reference proﬁle, training starts with the second pro-
ﬁle, which is chosen as the target proﬁle. The training step needs N-1
times in total (N is the number of proﬁles).
For example, if we select the pth proﬁle as the reference proﬁle and
the tth proﬁle as the target proﬁle, the whole training step indicates as
follows: in the current training step, the reference stream always keeps
the pth proﬁle and the pth fault instance segmentation mask. The target
stream is comprised of the tth seismic proﬁle and the (t-1)th fault instance
segmentation mask. The mask propagation neural network receives the
two input streams and outputs the fault instance segmentation mask of
the tth seismic proﬁle. Then we propagate it through the network as the
previous fault instance segmentation mask in the target stream. In this
way, 32 pieces of adjacent proﬁles are iteratively processed as one data
set. We have trained 256 data sets for 100 epochs.

6. Inference step
The inference step needs a range of proﬁles in a data set that is user-
deﬁned rather deﬁnite. We divide a 3D seismic volume into several data
sets, as shown in Fig. 4.
Each set would go through the mask propagation neural network as a
test sample and it will be recombined together to achieve fault instance
segmentation in 3D seismic data. For the prediction of multiple fault
instance segmentations, a simple way is to run each fault independently
and to label the pixel with the largest output probability of fault instance
segmentation. We take softmax aggregation as the loss function that
combines multi-instance probabilities softly. It assumes that probabilities
of positive samples and negative samples sum to 1. We calculate fault
instance segmentation mask using the equation below and pass it as the
input of the next proﬁle.

where σ and logit represent the softmax and logit functions, respectively,
Pi;m is the network output probability of the instance m at the pixel
location i.(m ¼ 0 indicates the background), and M is the number of
instances.
The inference step is similar to the traditional fault interpretation in
workﬂow. It starts with labeled fault instances of the interested proﬁle
and creates subsequent fault instances in a user-deﬁned range like Fig. 4.
If there are some fault misclassiﬁcations in proﬁle M. We can relabel
proﬁle M and regard it as the ﬁrst reference proﬁle. Then the inference
step starts over with proﬁle M. The instance segmentation results can
classify fault points into different instances from a range of proﬁles. Then
we easily and quickly reconstruct fault surfaces based on fault instance
segmentations, as shown in Fig. 5.
7. Result
We evaluate our method on two chosen sets (set A and B) from a
synthetic seismic volume, whose size is 128*128*32. Each fault instance
segmentation mask has been labeled in the ﬁrst proﬁle. We show the fault
instance segmentation result of the 1st, 9th, 17th, 25th proﬁles in Fig. 6.
Set A contains four non-intersecting fault instances, which have the
similar fault dip and strike. We can see blue fault instance fade away as
inline direction goes on. Some fault instances of set B are intersected. The
magenta fault instance and the blue fault instance belong to one instance
segmentation of faults, but two different branches in the shape of “Y”.
Our method can sculpture the details of the fault edge between fore-
ground (fault) and background (non-fault) in fault detection, also detect
various fault instance segmentations in one proﬁle while keeping the
shape of fault instance segmentations both in the crossed and isolated

areas.
8. Conclusion
Most fault interpretation methods based on deep learning focus on
fault detection. We study fault instance segmentation on 3D seismic data
based on deep learning on the ﬁrst try. Our method takes the 3D seismic
data as a sequence of proﬁles, which is similar to the form of video
frames. The mask propagation neural network is designed to learn the
propagation of fault instance segmentations in proﬁles along the inline
direction. We demonstrate the results of fault instance segmentation in
seismic proﬁles and show fault reconstruction based on work mentioned
above: the fault instance segmentation and the reconstruction of fault
surfaces are carried out on several groups of validation data sets. The
validation samples include independent fault examples and cross fault
examples. The experimental results show that the front and back scenes
of fault and non-fault are separated clearly. Further, the separation of
multiple examples of fault is complete and clear, which veriﬁes the
effectiveness of our method. Fault instance segmentation further im-
proves the efﬁciency of fault intelligent interpretation, so it has high
practical value and research signiﬁcance. Compared with fault detection
based on other deep learning method such as CNN, our method can not
only identify faults, but also characterize the relationship between faults.
In future research, we hope to add continuity constraint to the fault and
to solve the problem of discontinuity of fault line when the fault is far
away from the reference proﬁle.
