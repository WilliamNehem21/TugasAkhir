In rock cutting, a pick is subject to three orthogonal forces, namely cutting force (also called drag force), 
normal force and sideway force (also called lateral force) [1]. This paper focuses on the cutting force as it is a 
major concern of existing literature. Researchers focus on the cutting force because it is the major force to 
form and remove chips from rock. It directly affects specific energy [2]. A lot of research effort has been made 
to calculate (predict) the cutting force of a pick [3-8]. Various cutting force models including theoretical, 
empirical, semi-empirical and numerical models have been developed. Although these models have various 
forms, consider different factors and developed based on different pick types (e.g., radial and point-attack), 
Depth of Cut (DOC) is always a major variable. For example, both Evans [3] and Goktan [4] indicated that 
cutting force is proportional to the square of DOC, but Yilmaz et al [5] revealed that the cutting force had a 
linear relationship with DOC while Liu et al [7] demonstrated that the cutting force had an exponential 
relationship with DOC based on their laboratory experiments. 
Significant research effort has also been made to calculate DOC. Hurt et al [9] presented an approximate 
formula and a more exact equation in 1982. In 1996, Liu and Roxborough [10] further developed an accurate 
solution for the calculation of the DOC of a pick in a cutting cycle. However, these DOC calculation models 
are derived based on the picks which cut the same line. The cutting forces calculated using the existing force 
prediction models and DOC models are often far away from the observations in the mining production. The 
allowable linear advance speed (also called tram speed) of a drum based on the predicted cutting force is often 
much lower than the actual the linear advance speed in the production. In other words, if the mining machine 
is operated based on the predicted force, its productivity would be much lower than its actual capability. In 
fact, a drum used in mining production is normally composed of a number of cutting picks which cut a large 
area with multiple cutting lines. In this case, under certain conditions, the cuts between picks can have 
interactions as reported by Sun, et al in 2012 [11]. Their research showed that the cutting interactions between 
picks will reduce the “actual” DOC of the picks. Nevertheless, a quantitative analysis of the influence of 
cutting interactions on the cutting force of a pick is yet to be conducted. This paper attempts to address this 
issue. The research results can assist in understanding the influence of cutting interactions on the ‘actual’ DOC 
of picks so as to help the selection of excavation machines and/or cutterhead motors, optimize drum design 
and maximize mining productivity.

When the advance speed of the drum reaches a certain level, the cuts between picks will interact with each 
other. Fig. 1 shows an example that the cut of Pick 3 has been affected by other picks. It can be found that the 
chip breakout lines of Pick 2, 4 and 5 have crossed the cutting path of Pick 3 and removed some rock material 
before Pick 3 cut the rock again. In fact, not only is the cut of Pick 3 affected by the cuts of other picks, it also 
affects the cut of other picks, i.e., the cuts of Picks 1 and 2 in this example. 
The cutting interactions have reduced the “actual” DOC of picks. Take Pick 3 as an example, when there is 
not cutting interactions, its DOC is equal to its advance displacement in a revolution, i.e.,  
 .                                                                         (2) 
When cutting interactions happen, its “actual” DOC will become smaller than 
. It is a function of the line 
spacing between Pick 3 and other picks, the angular positions of Pick 3 over other picks, the breakout angle 
and the advance displacement in a revolution of the drum. Refer to [11] for more details. In the following 
section, the influence of the cutting interactions on cutting force of a pick is investigated. 
3. Changes of pick cutting force due to cutting interactions 
Various numerical simulations have been conducted to investigate the influences of the cutting interactions 
on cutting force of a pick. In these simulations, the following cutting force models are considered:

Eq. (3) is presented by Evans [3] for point-attack picks. In this equation,

Eq. (4) is presented by Liu, et al [7] for point-attack picks. In this equation, 
 is mean cutting force.

Eq. (5) is presented by Yilmaz, et al [6] for radial picks. In this equation,

shear strength of the rock being cut,  is the sliding frictional angle between cutting bit and the rock,  is bit 
width,  and  is rake angle.

Three example results are presented in Figs 2 - 4. To obtain Fig. 2, it was further assumed that the tensile 
strength and the uniaxial compressive strength of the rock were 6 MPa and 55 MPa respectively, and the semi-
conical angle of the pick was 40 degree. To obtain Fig. 4, it was assumed that the uniaxial compressive 
strength and shear strength of the rock were 120 MPa and 40 MPa respectively, the sliding frictional angle 
was 30 degree, the bit width was 20 mm, and the rake angle was -5 degree.  
From Figs. 2 – 4, it can be seen that the predicted cutting forces without considering cutting interactions are 
all overestimated. Especially when the drum runs at a high linear advance speed, the predicted cutting forces 
without considering cutting interactions are significantly higher than the estimated cutting forces with a 
consideration of cutting interactions. 
An additional interesting finding from the simulation is that the cutting forces calculated using Eq. (4) 
dramatically increased with the linear advance speed of the drum (Fig. 3). Considering Eq. (4) was developed 
according to laboratory cutting tests on coals with DOC less than 5.5 mm, its applicability to large DOC 
should be investigated carefully.

4. Conclusions 
In rock cutting, picks could have cutting interactions with each other when the linear advance speed 
reaches a certain level. The cutting interactions could reduce the “actual” cutting forces on picks.  
Existing cutting force models are normally developed based on small DOC used in laboratory experiments 
without significant cutting interactions. Care should be taken when these models are applied to the actual 
applications with large DOC.
