Aqueous solubility is a key chemical property that drives various processes in chemistry and biology. Its com- 
putational prediction is challenging, as evidenced by the fact that it has been a subject of considerable interest 
for several decades. Recent work has explored ﬁngerprint-based, feature-based and graph-based representations 
with diﬀerent machine learning and deep learning methodologies. In general, many traditional methods have 
been proposed, but they rely heavily on the quality of the rule-based, hand-crafted features. On the other hand, 
limitations in the quality of aqueous solubility data become a handicap when training deep models. In this study, 
we have developed a novel structure-aware method for the prediction of aqueous solubility by introducing a 
new deep network architecture and then employing a transfer learning approach. The model was proven to be 
competitive, obtaining an RMSE of 0.587 during both cross-validation and a test on an independent dataset. To 
be more precise, the method is evaluated on molecules downloaded from the Online Chemical Database and 
Modeling Environment (OCHEM). Beyond aqueous solubility prediction, the strategy presented in this work may 
be useful for modeling any kind of (chemical or biological) properties for which there is a limited amount of data 
available for model training. 
1. Introduction 
Signiﬁcant progress has been made in the prediction of quantitative 
structure-property relationships (QSPRs) for small organic molecules, 
in particular in machine learning [1] . In the context of small-molecule 
drug discovery and the development of agrochemicals, cosmetics, func- 
tional foods, etc., aqueous solubility has been a ﬁeld of active research 
for several decades now as it determines, among many other things, a 
compound’s ability to cross the biological membranes and, hence, its ca- 
pacity to induce desired biological eﬀects (e.g. in the context of pharma- 
cology) and/or undesired biological eﬀects (in the context of toxicology) 
in organisms. The development of highly eﬃcacious small-molecules 
that are suﬃciently soluble in water remains a challenging task because 
aqueous solubility and biological activity are often observed to be in an 
indirect proportional relationship [2] . 
Aqueous solubility is usually reported as log 𝑆, the logarithm of base 
10 of the aqueous solubility in mol/L. However, aqueous solubility is 
not an easy molecular property to measure accurately, for which rea-

son various approaches for measuring it are in existence and use. Data 
quality varies substantially between diﬀerent data sources, and results 
obtained with diﬀerent technologies are not always comparable. This is 
the reason why we can in part observe only a moderate reproducibil- 
ity of aqueous solubility measurements. On the whole, there are varied 
sources of data, and the exact information connected with aqueous sol- 
ubility methodology is not always given [3] . In consequence, the lack 
of high-quality datasets for computational aqueous solubility prediction 
is problematic [4,5] . Please note that the reported prediction root mean 
square errors (RMSE) ranges 0.6–1.4 log , with the average at 0.9 log [6] . 
Classical machine learning techniques have demonstrated remark- 
able performance in QSPR modeling, including aqueous solubility pre- 
diction. Generally, classical machine learning approaches can be split 
into two stages. The ﬁrst stage aims to encode the input data and extract 
the most important features or properties connected with the molecule. 
In consequence, one gets a molecular representation. The second stage 
usually applies an algorithm that takes a calculated molecular represen- 
tation as an input and returns some response. In addition, while building

machine learning models, one uses the train-test split as a method for 
evaluating the performance of a machine learning algorithm. 
To address the problem of aqueous solubility prediction, several 
methods have been proposed [7,8] . The ﬁrst technique appeared in 1924 
in work by Fühner [9] . Fühner observed that the addition of successive 
methylene groups causes a decrease of aqueous solubility. Subsequently, 
scientists discovered that various molecular features aﬀect aqueous solu- 
bility [10–12] . Over the years, diﬀerent models were applied. Erickson 
used linear regression to investigate the aqueous solubility of homol- 
ogous series of organic molecules [13] . He observed that log 𝑆 was a 
negative rectilinear function of alkyl chain length of homologous series. 
Later, Hewitt et al. analyzed multilinear regressions performance to pre- 
dict aqueous solubility [14] . Their conclusions were surprising since a 
simple linear regression approach proved to be superior over more com- 
plex modeling methods at that time. The authors noticed that the statis- 
tical ﬁt of the training and validation data was reasonably good ( 𝑅 2 val- 
ues of 0.74 and 0.67, respectively). Finally, the root mean square error 
(RMSE) value for the test set of 0.95 was obtained. With Random Forest, 
Palmer et al. studied the prediction of aqueous solubility for a data set of 
compounds that are solid at room temperature [15] . Their method has 
been shown to perform comparably to other methods, including some 
that require 3D structure calculation. To specify, the authors predicted 
the log molar solubility values for the molecules in the test set with 
RMSE of 0.69. Also, Lind and Maltseva have demonstrated that Sup- 
port Vector Machines with a Tanimoto similarity kernel detects aque- 
ous solubility with accuracy, expressed in terms of root mean square 
error, produce comparable results than other reported approaches [16] . 
They reported that the cross-validation on a diverse data set resulted 
in a RMSE of 0.62 and 𝑅 2 of 0.88. Besides, artiﬁcial neural networks 
have been utilized to predict aqueous solubility [17] . The goal was to 
take advantage of their ability to approximate non-linear functions. For 
instance, Eri ć et al. proposed a methodology for the automatic adjust- 
ment of descriptor’s relative importance in counter-propagation shallow 
neural networks in order to predict aqueous solubility [18] . The perfor- 
mance of their ﬁnal model based on seven descriptors for prediction of 
aqueous solubility was satisfactory since the authors reported an RMSE 
of 0.679 on test dataset. 
Very recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) [19–21] have yielded 
impressive performance in molecular and other materials property pre- 
diction [22–25] . While the classical machine learning approaches re- 
quire hand-crafted molecular descriptors as inputs, DNNs can employ 
more lossless formats and train models in an end-to-end fashion in order 
to predict the target endpoints. Besides, there are many diﬀerent formats 
of input representation [26] . The standard type is a topological graph 
that describes the connectivity of the atoms. Another example is SMILES 
strings (Simpliﬁed Molecular Input Line Entry System). Broadly speak- 
ing, SMILES is a text-based format where chemical species are mapped 
to single ASCII strings [27] . 
Deep learning systems have improved the state-of-the-art in aque- 
ous solubility prediction. For instance, Lusci et al. proposed an archi- 
tecture that uses a recurrent neural network and molecular structures 
converted into directed, acyclic graphs. Their methodology, called UG- 
RNN, sometimes outperformed current then state-of-the-art techniques 
[28] . For instance, UG-RNN achieves RMSE of 0.96 on the intrinsic sol- 
ubility data set. Another example is the work of Wu et al., where the 
authors constructed a topology-based multi-task deep learning strategy 
(MT-DNN) and achieved some of the most accurate predictions of aque- 
ous solubility (RMSE of 0.649) and the partition coeﬃcient [29] . Also, 
Liu et al. presented a competitive approach (Chemi-Net) based on convo- 
lutional neural networks to predict aqueous solubility and other ADME 
properties [30] . They demonstrated that Chemi-Net beats the compet- 
itive models and achieves an 𝑅 2 of 0.585. Finally, in 2020 Tang et al. 
[31] proposed a self-attention-based message passing neural network 
to identify the relationship between molecular solubility and structure. 
Their method obtained an RMSE of 0.661 (for aqueous solubility pre- 
diction) on a small collection of compounds.

Although the performance of computational models for the predic- 
tion of aqueous solubility has greatly improved by employing deep- 
learning architectures, there remains room for improvement. First, 
among the deep learning approaches, graph neural network (GNN)- 
based methods attract signiﬁcant attention because of their ability to 
model interactions between atoms. The idea is to treat a molecule as a 
molecular graph where atoms are associated with nodes. However, sim- 
ple operations such as summation and average may not capture various 
characteristics. Thus, more studies are required to analyze the contri- 
butions of diﬀerent parts of the compound to make decisions. Second, 
a great majority of deep learning aqueous solubility prediction models 
that can be found in the literature are rather shallow networks hav- 
ing around seven layers [32] . Obviously, the performance could be en- 
hanced by going wider or deeper [33,34] . Unfortunately, such modiﬁca- 
tions are constrained by the limited number of molecules with reliable 
aqueous solubility information. 
To address the above-mentioned problems, in this study, we propose 
a deep learning architecture that employs both a text representation of 
molecules and a graph-based strategy with an attention mechanism to 
learn and predict aqueous solubility. The core contributions of this work 
are as follows. (1) We treat aqueous solubility prediction as a transla- 
tion problem. Our architecture represents an encoder-decoder design. 
However, in order to learn a latent representation, our main encoder 
consists of two subencoders, i.e., a graph encoder and an encoder that 
employs a Transformer. We call this architecture M2M. (2) To address 
the problem of the availability of limited amounts of high-quality data 
and to increase the aqueous solubility prediction performance, transfer 
learning is incorporated. Therefore, we ﬁrst pretrain the model on pKa 
dataset that consists of more than 6000 chemical compounds. Then, the 
learned knowledge is transferred to be used on a smaller water solubility 
dataset. The ﬁnal architecture is called TunedM2M. (3) We demonstrate 
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in 
aqueous solubility prediction. Since we found the most recent and rele- 
vant work connected with aqueous solubility prediction was conducted 
by Tang et al., our model performance is evaluated against the dataset 
used in their paper. 
2. Materials and methods 
In this section, we describe the methodology presented in the work, 
the datasets, and the algorithms employed. Table 1 summarizes all no- 
tations used throughout this paper.

2.2. Datasets characteristics 
Firstly, a pKa dataset was applied to pretrain our M2M model. Then, 
log 𝑆 values related to aqueous solubility [35] were used to M2M trans- 
fer learning that we call TunedM2M. 
Dataset for developing the pretrained M2M 
We use dataset that contains pKa data for 7911 chemical compounds, 
and apply it to pretrain M2M. The data come as SMILES. One may obtain 
the chemicals from the DataWarrior [36] application folder. According 
to the analysis performed using Toxprint chemotypes [37] , the chem- 
ical structures have a high diversity of functional groups. Therefore, 
they are suﬃcient to support our research, i.e. pretrain M2M. For the 
purpose of this study, preprocessing of the chemical structures was per- 
formed. More speciﬁcally, in the ﬁrst step, the minor components of any 
multi-component compounds were stripped. Second, duplicated struc- 
tures were removed from the set. Also, we excluded inorganic chemicals 
and mixtures. The ﬁnal, processed pKa dataset consists of 6245 chemi- 
cals with measured pKa values. Fig. 3 illustrates the similarity map for 
pKa dataset. The measured values are highly diverse ( Fig. 3 ). 
Dataset for TunedM2M 
The dataset we employ in this paper for M2M transfer learning was 
obtained from OCHEM [35] . It consists of 1311 molecules, which were 
randomly assigned to a training set (80% of all molecules), a valida- 
tion set (10%), and test set (10%), following the procedure described in 
Tang’s paper. In addition, in order to ensure that there was no overlap 
between the data used for pretraining and transfer learning, we checked 
for matches in both datasets. The corresponding chemical compounds 
were removed. In addition, Fig. 4 depicts the similarity map for solubil- 
ity dataset. As one may note, the solubility properties are diverse among 
the molecules. Also, in order to explore the chemical space, we apply 
PCA to project the ﬁnal representation obtained from TunedM2M into a 
three dimensional space. In addition, the Euclidean distances to the cen- 
troid were calculated. The result is shown in Fig. 5 . The red star is the 
centroid of the space. Chemical compounds that are in the 75 percentiles 
closest to the centroid are colored in blue, whereas those further apart 
are colored in brown. The analysis indicate that the number of outliers 
is relatively small. 
2.3. Graph neural networks 
Graph neural networks (GNNs) were introduced by Scarselli et al. 
[38] in 2009. According to the concept, a graph  = ( , ) is deﬁned by 
its vertices  and edges  ⊆  × . Moreover, each vertex 𝑣 𝑖 ∈  is nat- 
urally associated with a vector of attributes 𝑎 𝑖 , and each edge ( 𝑣 𝑖 , 𝑣 𝑗 ) ∈ 

is naturally associated with a vector of attributes 𝑒 𝑖,𝑗 . There is also de- 
ﬁned a neighborhood function ̃𝑁 𝑖 = { 𝑣 𝑗 ∶ ( 𝑣 𝑗 , 𝑣 𝑖 ) ∈ } that assigns a set 
of neighbors ̃𝑁 𝑖 to each vertex 𝑣 𝑖 ∈ . The primarily goal of GNNs is to 
learn a state vector ℎ 𝑖 that is associated with each vertex 𝑣 𝑖 ∈ . In the 
beginning the vector is initialized as ℎ 0 
𝑖 = 𝑎 𝑖 . The state of all the vertices 
is then updated until the stopping criterion is reached. The update pro- 
cedure is based on the assumption that each vertex communicates with 
its neighbors by sending and receiving messages. Therefore, the state ℎ 𝑡 
𝑖 
of vertex 𝑣 𝑖 at layer 𝑡 depends on its state at the previous layer, ℎ 𝑡 −1 
𝑖 , and 
all messages which came from neighbors 𝑣 𝑗 ∈ ̃𝑁 𝑖 . In general, it can be 
deﬁned as follows: 
ℎ 𝑡 
𝑖 = 𝑈𝑝 ( ℎ 𝑡 −1 
𝑖 , 𝐴𝑔 𝑔 ({ 𝑀( 𝑣 𝑖 , 𝑣 𝑗 , 𝑡 ) ∶ 𝑣 𝑗 ∈ ̃𝑁 𝑖 })) , 
(1) 
where 𝑈𝑝 is a function that updates the state, 𝐴𝑔 𝑔 denotes a neighbor- 
hood aggregation function, and 𝑀 is a message function. 
2.4. Graph attention mechanism 
Attention mechanism in deep learning was ﬁrst proposed in 2015 by 
Bahdanau et al. [39] to address the common problem in natural lan- 
guage processing, i.e., translation of long sequences. In fact, attention 
allows to assigning a learnable weight to pairs of elements such as nodes 
in a graph to focus on the most relevant parts of the graph. More for- 
mally, attention is deﬁned as a function 
𝑔 ∶ 𝑣 𝑖 × ̃𝑁 𝑖 → [0 , 1] 
that for a given vertex 𝑣 𝑖 ∈  projects each vertex in ̃𝑁 𝑖 to a relevance 
score that informs how much attention is given to a particular neigh- 
bor vertex. If one considers an attention-based graph neural network, 
it means that the function 𝐴𝑔 𝑔 in Eq. (1) employs an attention mecha- 
nism. In this case, we add an extra attention coeﬃcient 𝛼𝑖,𝑗 to modify 
the weight of ℎ 𝑡 
𝑗 , where 𝑣 𝑗 ∈ ̃𝑁 𝑖 . 
2.5. Initial featurization 
The initial atom and bond features used in our study are shown in 
Tables 2 and 3 , respectively. The M2M’s initial attributes 𝑎 𝑖 are the atom 
features for the vertex 𝑣 𝑖 ∈ , while the M2M’s initial edge features 𝑒 𝑖,𝑗 
are the bond features for an edge ( 𝑣 𝑖 , 𝑣 𝑗 ) ∈ . In order to extract these 
features, RDKit [40] was used. Finally, the initial representation of the 
atom is a 130-dimensional vector, and the input representation of the 
edge is a 8-dimensional vector. 
2.6. Molecular transformer 
Transformer [41] architecture was originally proposed for various 
sequence-to-sequence tasks, including machine translation, and lan- 
guage understanding [42,43] . In fact, the huge success of transformer- 
based models is attributed to the multihead self-attention component 
that enables the network to capture contextual information from the 
entire sequence. A multihead attention layer includes several scaled dot 
attention layers that run in parallel and are concatenated at the end. 
In case of the 𝑖 th attention head and for a matrix 𝐻 ∈ ℝ 𝑙×𝑑 , the self- 
attention maps 𝐻 into three matrices: the query matrix 𝑄 = 𝐻𝑊 𝑄 , the 
key matrix 𝐾 = 𝐻𝑊 𝐾 and the value matrix 𝑉 = 𝐻𝑊 𝑉 , where 𝑙 is the 
length of the input sequence, 𝑑 is the dimension of the input sequence, 
𝑊 𝐾 , 𝑊 𝐾 , 𝑊 𝑉 are learnable parameters. Then, the attention scores can 
be expressed as: 
𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ( 𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉 ) = 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 ( 𝑄𝐾 𝑇 
√
𝑑 
) 𝑉 . 
(2) 
2.7. Molecular embedding 
Mikolov et al. [44] introduced Word2Vec to learn word embeddings 
in the natural language processing ﬁeld. The idea behind this method 
follows the assumption that words that appear frequently in similar con- 
texts share a semantic relationship. The method achieves an embedding 
for each word in the training corpus by training a fully-connected shal- 
low neural network to predict either the target word given the context 
(the CBOW model) or the context given a target word (the Skip-Gram 
model). It shows that Word2Vec has inspired much research in various 
domains such as bioinformatics [45] . It was also employed for the rep- 
resentation of chemical compounds [46] . 
2.8. M2M and TunedM2M architecture 
According to the notion of transfer learning, we divide our approach 
into two parts: a source task and a target task. In our work, the source 
task is how to represent the molecules and then predict pKa. However, 
the main target task is to predict aqueous solubility expressed as log 𝑆. 
In the following, we describe the proposed methodology in detail. 
2.8.1. M2M 
In order to accomplish the source and target tasks, we design an 
architecture that we call M2M. The model aims to learn feature repre- 
sentation using molecules as described in Subsection Dataset for devel- 
oping the pretrained M2M , and then predict pKa. Fig. 2 illustrates the 
proposed model. As visualized in this ﬁgure, our architecture consists of 
three main components: the encoder, the embedding layer, and the pre- 
diction layer. With respect to representation learning, the core part of 
the model is the M2M encoder, which includes the embedding block 
and two (sub)encoders, namely graph (sub)encoder and transformer 
(sub)encoder. Each of these elements has an inevitable impact on the 
ﬁnal form of the M2M encoder and involves several operations that can 
be summarized as follows. 
(1) Graph (sub)encoder aims to generate a low-dimensional, hidden 
representation for atoms in a given chemical compound. Firstly, in order 
to construct a graph (sub)encoder, we assume that a molecule is repre- 
sented as a graph, as discussed in Subsection Graph neural networks . In 
this setting, vertices are associated with atoms, and edges correspond 
to bonds. Additionally, we propose a set of features to provide initial 
molecular attributes, as explained in Subsection Initial featurization . To 
build the graph, we employ the deep graph library (DGL) [47] . Our 
graph (sub)encoder includes a stack of the single (sub)encoder layers. 
In addition, each layer aggregates the attribute information from the 
neighboring vertices of a target vertex. Fig. 2 a illustrates a single layer 
of our graph (sub)encoder. Formally, it is deﬁned as follows: 
ℎ 𝑡 +1 
𝑖 
= 𝜎( 
∑
𝑘 ∈ ̃𝑁 𝑡 
𝛼𝑖𝑘 𝑊 ℎ 𝑡 
𝑘 ) ,

where 𝑊 ∈ ℝ ̃𝑑 𝑔 ×𝑑 𝑔 is a weight matrix. Furthermore, the vital component 
of each single layer is an attention coeﬃcient that is associated with an 
attention mechanism introduced in Subsection Graph attention mecha- 
nism . More speciﬁcally, during the process, features are concatenated 
and parameterized by a weight vector ⃖⃗𝑎 ∈ ℝ 2 ̃𝑑 𝑔 + ̃𝑒 . Also, nonlinearity is 
provided by LeakyReLU function. It is interesting to note that we per- 
form normalization using a softmax function denoted by 𝜎. All these 
operations can be expressed as: 
𝛼𝑖𝑗 = 
exp ( 𝜎( ⃖⃗𝑎 𝑇 [ 𝑊 ⃖⃖⃗
ℎ 𝑖 ||𝑊 ⃖⃖⃖⃗
ℎ 𝑗 ||𝑒 𝑖𝑗 ])) 
∑
𝑘 ∈ ̃𝑁 𝑖 exp ( 𝜎( ⃖⃗𝑎 𝑇 [ 𝑊 ⃖⃖⃗
ℎ 𝑖 ||𝑊 ⃖⃖⃖⃗
ℎ 𝑘 ||𝑒 𝑖𝑘 ])) 
. 
(4) 
What is more, to capture multiple types of relationships between 
vertices, multihead attention is used. As a result, we concatenate the 
diﬀerent representations learned by diﬀerent heads in the hidden layer. 
Then, they are averaged on the ﬁnal layer of our graph (sub)encoder as 
follows: 
ℎ 𝑡 +1 
𝑖 
= 𝜎( 1 
𝑀 
𝑀 
∑
𝑚 =1

𝑘 ∈ ̃𝑁 𝑡 
𝛼𝑚 
𝑖𝑘 𝑊 𝑚 ℎ 𝑡 
𝑘 ) , 
(5) 
where 𝑀 is the number of heads involved in the multi-head attention 
mechanism. 
(2) Embedding block is designed to obtain a vector representation 
of a molecule based on SMILES. Therefore, in order to transform the 
molecule SMILES to vector representation, we train a Word2vec model. 
Speciﬁcally, we follow a Skip-gram conﬁguration. Our goal is to maxi-

the network that can be expressed as follows:

2.8.2. TunedM2M 
In terms of the main target task of predicting aqueous solubility ex- 
pressed as log 𝑆, we opted to utilize the learned knowledge from a pre- 
trained network (M2M) and apply the trained parameters to a new re- 
gression task in a process called transfer learning. Therefore, the idea is 
to transfer the weights calculated for 𝑝𝐾𝑎 prediction. Here, we make use 
of the encoder and the embedding layer from M2M. Then, ﬁne-tuning 
of the parameters is employed to accommodate aqueous solubility pre- 
diction. The resulting architecture is called TunedM2M. 
2.9. Evaluation details 
Root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and 
mean square error (MSE) are used to measure the prediction perfor- 
mance. Additionally, in some cases, to provide more reliable results, 
Pearson correlation coeﬃcient (PCC) and coeﬃcient of determination 
( 𝑅 2 ) are given as well. PCC is used to measure the linear association 
between two variables. In turn, ( 𝑅 2 ) is seen as the proportion of the 
variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the inde- 
pendent variables. Moreover, throughout this paper, unless otherwise 
stated, each dataset was randomly split into a training, validation, and 
test set (80%, 10%, and 10%, respectively).

3. Results and discussion 
To evaluate the performance of our method, we compared our ap- 
proaches with the state-of-the-art models that have demonstrated su- 
perior performance in Tang’s work on aqueous solubility prediction 
task. Speciﬁcally, random forests (RF), message passing network (MPN), 
self-attention-based message-passing neural network (SAMPN), multi 
message passing network (multiMPN), and multi self-attention-based 
message-passing neural network (multiSAMPN) are used. RF classiﬁer 
[48] is one of the most popular and successful classiﬁcation/regression 
methods in Euclidean spaces. It employs multiple decision trees to train 
and predict samples. MPN [49] is a deep neural network-based approach 
that operates on a graph and separates the prediction process into two 
phases: message passing phase and readout. SAMPN [31] can be seen 
as an extended version of MPN with an extra added attention mecha- 
nism. Tang et al. also introduce multiMPN and multiSAMPN that are 
variants of MPN and SAMPN, respectively, where the models learn both 
the relationship between chemical structures and properties and the re- 
lationship between intrinsic attributes of molecules. In addition, since 
our goal is to obtain a model that performs robustly, the same set of hy- 
perparameters for ﬁne-tuning was determined (see Table 4 ). We design 
tasks to answer a few questions. 
Q1: Do M2M and TunedM2M improve the aqueous solubility predic- 
tion results? 
One may notice that either M2M or TunedM2M outperformed all 
competitive methods (see Figs. 6 , 7 and Table S1 in the Supplemen- 
tary Materials). TunedM2M achieves an overall RMSE of 0.587, MAE of 
0.449, and MSE of 0.403, which indicates a high degree of accuracy. 
Crucially, although M2M is trained only on aqueous solubility dataset 
that comprises a small number of samples, it still achieves a reasonable 
performance. As shown in Fig. 6 a, multiSAMPN achieves an RMSE of 
0.661, MAE of 0.482, and MSE of 0.424. Compared to those scores, M2M 
obtains better prediction performance since it obtains an RMSE of 0.646, 
MAE of 0.456, and MSE of 0.411. Furthermore, the experiments indicate 
that selection of evaluation measure doesn’t matter here since we arrive 
at the same conclusion. As summarized in Figs. 6 b and 7 , M2M leads to 
an overall 𝑃 𝐶 𝐶 = 0.94 and 𝑅 2 = 0.88, while TunedM2M achieves 𝑃 𝐶 𝐶 
= 0.97 and 𝑅 2 = 0.92. All in all, one may observe that the M2M archi- 
tecture has a positive impact on prediction performance since M2M is 
trained only on the aqueous solubility dataset and achieves the second- 
best performance among all models. However, these results also clearly 
indicate that the pretraining phase of M2M as performed in TunedM2M 
improves performance even more. Undoubtedly, TunedM2M produces 
fairly bad results for only a few molecules (see Fig. 7 b). These molecules 
are diverse in structure, i.e., that they cannot be assigned to one or a few 
chemical classes. In contrast, the multiSAMPN produces many more bad 
predictions than our model (see Fig. 7 a). More speciﬁcally, it produces 
too low log 𝑆 values for a range of diﬀerent compounds. Also, it produces 
too high log 𝑆 values for some polyhalogenated compounds and some 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Additionally, note that we evaluate 
statistical signiﬁcance using a one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test and 
deﬁne the statistical signiﬁcance as 𝑝 -value less than 0.05. All in all, 
both M2M trained only on aqueous solubility dataset and TunedM2M 
signiﬁcantly outperform the other models.

Q2: Is there any noticeable diﬀerence between M2M when learned 
only on the aqueous solubility dataset, and TunedM2M? 
The computational tasks run to answer Question no. 1 suggest that 
TunedM2M works better than M2M trained on the aqueous solubility 
dataset. Nevertheless, to answer Q2, we conducted additional analyses: 
TunedM2M was again compared to M2M that is trained from scratch 
only on the aqueous solubility dataset. However, this time, both M2M 
and TunedM2M were trained on diﬀerent numbers of training data 
and tested on the test set with the ratio of train:valid:test at 8:1:1 
and random split. As Fig. 8 shows, with diﬀerent numbers of train-

ing data, our TunedM2M outperformed in all cases our M2M trained 
from scratch on aqueous solubility dataset. This suggests that the trans- 
fer learning strategy that is applied in the TunedM2M architecture pro- 
vides a robust improvement of the model. In other words, the outcomes

mean that the training of pKa data beneﬁts the prediction of aqueous

Q3: What is the chemical explainability of TunedM2M? 
We propose a set of tasks to check how each atom contributes to the 
predictive performance gain. Fig. 9 shows the impact of atoms at the 
example of three selected chemical compounds. In general, TunedM2M

accurately assigned positive importance scores to atoms that contribute 
to aqueous solubility and negative scores to atoms that are hydrophobic. 
Besides, it can be observed that the atoms that have positive importance 
scores form a groups that can be associated with some functional groups 
that are hydrophilic, such as amines, ketones, aldehydes or ethers. 
Q4: What is the interpretability of TunedM2M? 
In order to get more insight into TunedM2M and to gain a better un- 
derstanding of its performance, we selected an exemplary molecule pre- 
sented in Fig. 9 c and analyzed how the atom state vectors change during 
the learning process. Fig. 10 shows heat maps of the atom similarity ma- 
trix for the selected chemical compound. Indeed, one may notice that 
the pattern after training is diﬀerent from the pattern observed before 
training. Fig. 10 a demonstrates that the heat map of the similarity matrix 
reveals similar levels of randomness across diﬀerent layers. In contrast, 
after training, we obtain three clusters of atoms that are associated with 
functional groups: an oxime group (atoms no. 0, 1, 2), an arene group 
(atoms no. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) and a nitro group (atoms no. 8, 9, 10). In fact, 
this observation is strongly correlated with the chemical interpretation 
of the given structure. Therefore, one may infer that TunedM2M is able 
to learn a representation related to molecular aqueous solubility. 
Q5: Do the models capture meaningful patterns in the distance map- 
ping? 
We also perform our analysis in latent space. We randomly chose 
1000 molecules from the dataset and calculated the 𝐿 2 -norm distance 
between them. The normalized distance mapping is shown in Fig. 11 . 
The scale bar on the right side refers to the distance between two 
molecules labeled by row and column. Furthermore, the diagonal el- 
ements colored in blue show the distance of a molecule from itself. 
In turn, the red parts mean the farthest distance. It seems that both 
multiSAMPN and TunedM2M reveal meaningful patterns in the dis- 
tance mapping. It clearly indicates that for similar log 𝑆 values the mod- 
els are able to locate similar molecules in the latent space. Neverthe-

less, TunedM2M puts chemical compounds that have similar proper- 
ties closer to each other in space, and that explains the performance of 
TunedM2M ( Figs. 12 and 13 ). 
Q6: Does the usage of (sub)encoders aﬀect the ﬁnal performance of 
M2M? 
To investigate the contribution of diﬀerent factors that inﬂuence 
the performance of M2M, we conducted ablation studies. As shown 
in Fig. 14 , decoupling knowledge-aware components such as a graph 
(sub)encoder and an embedding block in M2M encoder from our learn- 
ing framework yields a signiﬁcant drop of performance. Moreover, it 
seems that a graph (sub)encoder is crucial and eﬀective for better re- 
sults. In addition, the lack of transformer causes the worst performance. 
Q7: Does scaﬀold-based splitting of the data aﬀect the performance 
of M2M and TunedM2M? 
We also evaluate the models on scaﬀold-based split. Scaﬀold split- 
ting is performed using Bemis-Murcko [50] methodology that divides 
the dataset into a training set, a validation set, and a test set according to 
their two-dimensional molecular structures. As the Fig. 15 shows, both 
M2M and TunedM2M beat all the competitive approaches. To be more 
precise, TunedM2M reaches an RMSE of 0.672, MAE of 0.501, and MSE 
of 0.438. The second-best approach is M2M trained only on aqueous sol- 
ubility dataset (RMSE = 0.721, MAE of 0.564 MSE of 0.471), while the 
third-best is multiSAMPN that obtains an RMSE of 0.735, MAE of 0.571, 
and MSE of 0.48. In fact, the results indicate that scaﬀold splitting is a 
more challenging setting since it yields less impressive scores than the 
random split approach. Nevertheless, the outcomes indicate that even 
when the training and the test set have diﬀerent characteristics related 
to the molecular structures, the TunedM2M is able to learn the general 
representation of the molecules and returns a competitive prediction.

(sub)encoder, an embedding block and a transformer in 
M2M encoder from our learning framework, a signiﬁcant drop 
of performance is observed.

Q8: How does the model work for a dataset of intrinsic water solu- 
bility? 
As part of an additional task, we apply the proposed model to the 
molecules provided by the organisers of the 2019 Solubility Challenge 
[6] . It is somewhat not surprising that RF obtains the best results, i.e., 
RMSE of 1.62 (see Table 5 ). It shows that for an extremely small dataset, 
including 100 molecules in the training set, deep learning-based ap- 
proaches reveal very high error on a test set (32 molecules). Although 
TunedM2M’s performance is not satisfactory, it achieves the third best 
result (RMSE of 3.19). We hope this observation will help to explore fur- 
ther the challenges connected with prediction of the intrinsic solubilities 
of molecules for small datasets. 
4. Conclusions 
To increase the accuracy of aqueous solubility prediction and over- 
come the diﬃculties of training deep neural networks caused by limited 
reliable aqueous solubility-related datasets, in this work, we introduced 
a transformer-based architecture. Moreover, we employed a transfer 
learning strategy and called the ﬁnal architecture as TunedM2M. This 
paper presents the workﬂow and performance of our method. In fact, 
thanks to the well-designed encoder, TunedM2M provides insights on 
which fragments of the chemical structure have the greatest inﬂuence 
on the property of interest. Furthermore, several proposed tasks have 
shown our approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art models. The 
results also demonstrated that the accuracy of the aqueous solubility 
prediction was signiﬁcantly improved. Therefore, the outcomes reveals 
that transfer learning is an eﬀective way to solve the data-hungry prob- 
lem and may be beneﬁcial for improving the regression performance of 
other models.
