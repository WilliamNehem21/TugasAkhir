When using discounting with weighted timed transition systems, there are sev- eral choices available. One can discount by steps as e.g. in [14,17], or by elapsed time as e.g. in [11]. Under the former version, events are discounted by the number

We have shown that if one wants an accumulated weight function in a timed transi- tion system to satisfy a certain natural additivity property, as given in Definition 2.2, then there is only very little choice left as to how to define it. In particular, neither the quotient approach of [4] nor the step-based discounting in [14,17] give rise to accumulated weight functions which are discounted in time.
