number of important basic facts about recursive coalgebras. In Section 4, which is the main section of the paper, we show how recursive coalgebras arise from comonads, comonad-coalgebras and distributive laws. In Section 5, we conclude by pointing out some directions for future research.

Very recursiveness is roughly in the same position wrt. recursiveness for coalgebras as allowing primitive recursion is wrt. initiality for algebras. The new work of Adamek, Milius and Velebil [19,3] on the free completely iterative (resp. iterative) monad of a functor (elaborating on their original approach in [1,2]) is centered around the dual concept (resp. a finitary version of it).

Theorem 4.4 provides a powerful generalization of the central theorem in [27], which was on structured recursion schemes for initial algebras derivable from comonads (cf. also the dual result stated in [4,7]; we note that in [28], the substitution and solution theorems of [20,1] were proved from this result). Indeed, the theorem of [27] is just a special case of Theorem 4.4 now.
