Researchers face a significant challenge in identifying and searching for the most relevant papers for their work owing to the rapid growth of scientific knowledge and the increasing number of research articles published across numerous fields. To solve this issue, scientific article recommendation algorithms emerged as useful tools for supporting researchers in identifying the most relevant articles customized to their unique study objectives. These recommendation systems analyze and evaluate many accessible scientific literatures using modern algorithms and approaches, providing researchers with customized recommendations that fit their areas of interest.

Scientific article recommendation systems aim to improve the research process by automating the tasks of article discovery and searching, allowing researchers to focus on their primary jobs rather than wasting time searching for appropriate materials. To provide reliable and customized suggestions, these systems use various information sources, including metadata, article content, citation networks, and user preferences. These recommendation systems attempt to provide researchers with a customized and efficient experience by considering many aspects, such as content similarity, citation trends, and user feedback.

One of the key limitations of existing systems is the cold-start problem, in which newly published or less-well-known articles lack sufficient data for effective recommendations. By incorporating a weighted semantic similarity index into the citation graph, the proposed strategy enhances content-based filtering by considering the semantic relationships between articles in the graph network. This index gives more weight to items that are more semantically comparable, boosting the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations. The system can better grasp the context and content of articles using powerful natural language processing techniques and semantic analysis, even when complete information is unavailable, thereby alleviating the cold-start problem.

Hybrid recommendation systems integrate content and graph-based approaches to successfully handle the cold-start problem. A content-based approach can provide initial recommendations whenever a researcher searches for a paper. The cold-start problem is avoided by using the text content of an article, which consists mainly of the abstract, title, and keywords. The citation graph adds further efficiency to the system by computing citations that match and recommend relevant papers. In addition to addressing the cold-start problem, the proposed hybrid graph recommendation strategy addresses the issue of sparse matrices. The vast amount of available scientific literature often leads to sparsity, making it challenging to establish meaningful connections and provide comprehensive recommendations. By integrating a graph-based recommendation system and COOT optimization, this strategy leverages the relationships between articles and citations to overcome sparsity issues. By constructing a robust graph network, the system can identify hidden relationships, uncover valuable connections, and provide diverse and accurate recommendations. The COOT optimization algorithm further enhance the performance of the recommendation system by efficiently optimizing the result-selection process, ensuring that the most relevant and high-quality articles were selected.

By incorporating the weighted semantic similarity index and COOT optimization into the hybrid graph recommendation strategy, researchers can benefit from an improved recommendation system that addresses the limitations of existing approaches. This system overcomes the challenges of the cold-start problem and sparse matrices, offering researchers an efficient and accurate means of discovering articles relevant to their research needs. By integrating advanced natural language processing techniques, semantic analysis, and graph-based recommendation systems, the proposed strategy empowers researchers to navigate the vast landscape of scientific literature confidently, thereby saving time and effort in searching for relevant articles. The main contributions of this study are as follows.

A literature study for scientific article recommendation systems was conducted by classifying the articles into three primary categories: content-based, collaborative systems, and hybrid systems. The primary issues addressed to improve the performance of recommendation systems are cold-start, data sparsity, privacy, scalability, and diversity (Fayyaz et al., 2020). The following literature discusses the attempts to solve these issues using various methodologies.

Word2Vec converts words into vectors based on various characteristics, including the window size and vector dimensions (Jatnika et al., 2019). Word2vec uses a fixed-size vector to represent words. This vector efficiently captures semantic and syntactic similarities (Orkphol and Yang, 2019). It is modeled with one layer of an artificial neural network that predicts the value using a larger corpus of training text data. There are two variants of word2vec, namely CBOW and skip-gram. CBOW predicts the current word based on a list of words, and skip- gram predicts a list of words around the current word (Jatnika et al., 2019). Word2vec prevents overfitting by transforming the one-hot encoder values into continuous low-dimensional values. With this model, it is also possible to increase the efficiency by using a reduced training sample (Xiao et al., 2018).

Definition1: Citation Graph GCG is defined as GCG = {N, E}, where N represents the set of nodes N = {Np,Nr }, and E represents the set of edges from the graph E={ Er, Ec}. In the node-set, N is the citation graph GCG, Np represents the paper node, and Nr is the reference node. In the set of edges E, Ec denotes the citing edge, and Er denotes the co-cited edge.

This study used the citation network dataset of Tang et al., where the citations were taken from various sources, including DBLP, ACM, MAG, and other comparable sources (Tang et al., 2008). The citation research for this study used the DBLP citation network, version 13. Nearly 5,354,309 distinct publications with approximately 48,227,950 citation relationships constitute this version of the DBLP. The dataset was broadly clustered into 13 main groups: computer science (CS), Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE), Mechanical and Automation Engineering (MAE), and civil engineering. The primary features of the DBLP citation network dataset version 13 include the title, keywords, abstract, field of study, references, author, venue, and year of publication.

The computational complexity of HSARCO depends on the number of iterations, citation graph size, cluster size, and number of articles in each cluster. The time complexity for the initial clustering process is O(K), where K is the number of clusters. To compute the text similarity score, the complexity is O(N), where N is the total number of articles in the clusters. For citation graph generation, the complexity directly depends on the number of edges E and the number of nodes D; therefore, the complexity is O (E + D). Finally, the complexity of the citation graph exploration using COOT optimization is O (G*(E + D)), where G is the total number of local group leaders. Based on the time complexity of each step in the proposed HSARCO algorithm, the factors that directly affect the complexity are the number of nodes D, the number of Edges E, and the group population of COOT G. The overall complexity is determined by the most time-consuming step, which is citation graph exploration using COOT optimization O (G*(E + D)). Therefore, the total computational complexity of this algorithm is O (G*(E + D)).

In COOT, during the exploration process, the score of each node is updated using an algorithm upon visiting each node. Every time a node is visited based on a high-citation score node (leader) from the entire graph, nodes with high citations (group leaders) are constantly generated. These processes are repeated until the stop condition for the algorithm is satisfied, and the leader nodes (both leader and group leaders) continue to change. Upon reaching the stop condition of an algorithm, where no nodes are left to visit, the algorithm stops and finalizes the highly influential nodes. With COOT, it is very simple to identify the most influential nodes, as they have one leader node and N local leader nodes, along with some mildly influential nodes from the local groups. All these nodes were selected for weighted average computation to generate the recommendation list.

In the first level of the approach, a straightforward content-based recommendation system was developed using Word2Vec and LSTM. This initial approach focused on utilizing the titles and abstracts of the articles as the primary attributes for recommendations. However, the accuracy of this approach is not particularly high. To improve accuracy, the approach was further enhanced with graph-based recommendations. This involves the utilization of citations to recommend articles. By incorporating these graph-based recommendations, the results showed an increase in accuracy compared to the initial approach.

Furthermore, the algorithm was upgraded by introducing COOT optimization techniques. This upgrade significantly improves the results obtained using the recommendation system. It was observed that combining the methods of Word2Vec, LSTM, citation graph, and COOT optimization led to the best results in all scenarios, resulting in a significant increase in accuracy. The analysis of the proposed algorithm demonstrates that it achieves the best results when the Word2Vec, LSTM, citation graph, and COOT optimization methods are combined. This comprehensive approach substantially increases the accuracy of the article recommendation system.

ClusCit (Ren et al., 2014): Cluscite attempts to cluster the citation based on the relevance of the query in the heterogeneous bibliographic network. After grouping them based on relevance, it finds the group with the utmost relevance to the query, and based on that, it recommends the document.

RSHK-RNN (Zhu et al., 2021): In this study, the authors constructed bibliographic networks using the metadata of research articles by converting metadata relations into vectors using TransD and PV-DM models, which were used for text vectorization. The recommendation model uses an attentive bidirectional RNN that focuses on user identity.

The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed HSARCO model outperforms the four baseline models in terms of article recommendation. The HSARCO model outperformed the CB-CR model in terms of precision by 2.3%, ClusCite in terms of recall by 1.6%, and MRR by 5.7% when compared with the RSHK-RNN. According to these results, the HSARCO model is more precise, efficient, and reliable for recommending relevant articles.
