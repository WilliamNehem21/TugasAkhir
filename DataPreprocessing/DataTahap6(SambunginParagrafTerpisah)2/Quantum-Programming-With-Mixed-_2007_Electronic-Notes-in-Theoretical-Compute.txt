In this paper we offer a programming approach to quantum computation using mixed states. Mixed- state quantum systems generalise standard (pure) quantum systems by allowing the state of the system to be a probabilistic distribution of pure states. We build on previous work by Aharonov et al. and generalise their results from quantum circuits to probabilistic (and quantum) programs.

In general, an observable is represented by a self-adjoint operator and the measurable values are exactly the eigenvalues of that operator. It is a generalisation, since by the well-known spectral theorem the eigenspaces of a self-adjoint operator are pairwise orthogonal and complete the enveloping space. That definition of Fin remains valid when an observable  is defined by a self-adjoint operator O.

We conclude by giving a unitary version of finalisation which uses the dilation technique. The unitary embedding D can be easily lifted to work with quregs - for simplicity we maintain the same notation. We note that D actually depends on the observable we want to mimic, since the dimen- sion of the enveloping space grows with the number of possible results of the measurements.
