There has by now been quite a substantial number of attempts to incorporate defeasible reasoning in logics other than propositional logic. After a first tentative exploration of preferential predicate logics by Lehmann and Magidor [18], some more recent investigations have attempted to define notions of defeasibility in deontic log- ics [22], and of defeasible subsumption for description logics [3,12,5]. Nevertheless, a generally accepted semantics for preferential reasoning in modal logics, with a corresponding syntactic characterization, does not yet exist.

These formal constructions closely resemble those of Kraus et al. [16] and of Lehmann and Magidor [19], the difference being that propositional valuations are replaced with elements of the set Un. In Section 4 we provide an extended example including an instance of a modal preferential model.

Recent work by Casini and Straccia [5] in the context of description logics makes it possible to improve on this algorithm, from an implementation point of view. Casini and Straccia proposed a syntactic operational characterization of rational closure for the description logic ALC, but without providing a semantic counter- part. The algorithm draws on work by Lehmann and Magidor [19], Freund [11] and Poole [23], is based on performing a number of classical entailment checks (for ALC), and is easily amenable to implementation. From their description it is clear that the number of classical entailment checks needed is quadratic in the size of the knowledge base under consideration.
