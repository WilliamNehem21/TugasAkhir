way we obtain an (infinite) stream over 2 = {0, 1}. From this example we derive a general principle: fractal structure of a certain shape enables us to symbolically represent the shape, using infinite streams. The current paper is all about making this principle formal.

Example 3.1 [The module MI for the unit interval] The combinatorial specifi- identifying two points, one from each copy. It is made formal as the module MI cation for the unit interval I is informally: I is the union of two copies of itself, displayed below left; it is taken from [16]. The display is according to the legend

Remark 3.2 In [16, 17] what we have called a combinatorial specification is called a self-similarity system; and the induced coalgebraic fractal (i.e. a final coalgebra) is called the solution of the self-similarity system. Their symbolic/combinatorial nature is not emphasized there.

The directions of further developments are different, too. In the current paper we focus on a metric extension, relating a coalgebraic fractal with a metric fractal induced by an IFS-like specification. In contrast, Leinster pursues mostly a topologi- cal extension: he endows a coalgebraic fractal with canonical topological structure. Based on this, in [17] Leinster presents recognition theorems: they tell if a given topological space is a solution of a certain self-similarity system or not.
