This paper is organized as follows. We show related works in Section 2. Next, we describe the system model in Section 3. We for- mulate the problem in Section 4 and then we describe our scheme. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in Section 5. Finally, the paper is concluded and future research directions are given.

alternating renewal process. 1(0) period implies the channel is occupied (free) and cannot be traded. We assume that 1/0 transi- tions can be detected by the spectrum sensing but that is not our concern of this paper. The following condition for specifying the state of the channel is used:

The profit maximization for a PU is a unique challenge due to time-varying spectrum availability and dynamic nature for spec- trum market. Many attributes for spectrum market change over time. These changes include: demand, spectrum cost, and supply. Therefore, PU must jointly consider SUs admission and eviction
