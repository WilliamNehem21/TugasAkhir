Unfortunately, while reachability between terms is decidable for PRS [19], it be- comes undecidable for O-PRS due to the associativity of  [16]. Despite this unde- cidability, we consider in this paper the reachability problem between two (infinite) sets of terms. Since process terms can be seen as trees, we consider representations of sets of terms based on (bottom-up) tree automata. To sidestep the undecidability result, we proceed as follows: better underapproximations. Moreover, if for k and k + 1 the computed under- approximations are the same, then we know that we have computed an exact representative of the reachability set. Note that the underapproximations we compute are exact if the ordered processes can only perform a bounded number of communications. This is the case of our case study, which is a real example.
