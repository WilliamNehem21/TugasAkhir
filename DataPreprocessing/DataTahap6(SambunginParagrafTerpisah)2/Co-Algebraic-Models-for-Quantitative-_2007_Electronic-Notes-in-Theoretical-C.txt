Recently, some approaches have addressed the definition on non-syntactical mod- els of spatial logics. In [16] and [13], for example, spatial logics have been interpreted over particular kinds of graph rewriting systems, rather than on the term language of a specific process calculus. In [23], a non-syntactical interpretation of paral- lel decomposition is given, by adding spatial information to the semantics of the language: a coalgebraic model, called spatial transition systems (STS), has been developed and tested as a semantic model for a CCS-like process calculus. It has been shown that the STS semantics is fully concurrent (for example, the processes a.b+b.a and a|b have different meanings). In STS, the semantics of process calculi is given by reaction rules, making behavioral observations about isolated subsystems impossible.

This definition, differently from the one in [23], allows us to observe the parallel decomposition of a process only if the involved subprocesses are reactive, i.e. they can synchronize with other processes at some point (similarly to the location se- mantics of CCS [5]). The obtained SLTS bisimulation obviously contains ordinary CCS bisimulation, and it is coarser than structural congruence: consider the pro- this formula measures the minimum available quantity of a certain kind of re- source (modeled by a process that can do a), after the occurrence of event b. This kind of formula can be compared, in the setting of multi-valued logics, to the is- sues dealt with when considering history dependent access control policies [1]. In our case, the measure of resource usage policies depends on the past history of execution, as it is the case for the validity of policies in history dependent access control.
