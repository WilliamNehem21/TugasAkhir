Theorem 4.19 implies that we can obtain a minimal Coalg(D)-representation of a step-by-step T by quotienting Dif(T) with D-bisimilarity. This could be an interesting alternative to computing the minimal realisation of [T ] via normalisation and quotienting N(T) with S-bisimilarity. Of course, an actual implementation of a step-by-step T should be based on the minimal realisation of [T]], since the output produced by Dif(T) would have to be reduced in the free group in order to obtain the behaviour. The following example illustrates the difference between the two types of minimal realisations.
