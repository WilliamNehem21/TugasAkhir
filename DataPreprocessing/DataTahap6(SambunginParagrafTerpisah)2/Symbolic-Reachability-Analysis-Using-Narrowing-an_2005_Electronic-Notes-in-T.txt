discovered a data item that was meant to be a secret. In this section, we will exploit the strong completeness result in Section 5.1 to show how narrowing provides a generic and complete procedure for the analysis of such security properties.

In the general case, the reachability problem for security protocols is known to be undecidable [14]. An important decidable subcase is where the num- ber of protocol sessions, i.e., where the number of principals instantiating the protocol roles, is bounded. Even this restricted scenario has an infinite state space, since the intruder can interfere with the protocol execution by forging arbitrary messages. Several authors have proposed decision procedures for the reachability problem in this subcase [20,1,33,38]. An important limita- tion of all these works is that their analyses do not account for the algebraic properties of the underlying cryptographic primitives. This simplification is not valid for a variety of cryptographic primitives used in practice, such as xor, products, and Diffie-Hellman exponentiation. The attacker can exploit algebraic properties of these primitives, such as commutativity, associativity, and cancellation, to find attacks that are otherwise not possible [39].

it is only a semidecision procedure in that it need not terminate. However, it may be possible to identify several cases where the narrowing procedure for reachability goals is guaranteed to terminate. This is beyond the scope of this paper, and is an important problem for future research.

have a solution; a solution, if it exists, essentially describes an attack. Note that, since the number of principals is finite, there are only a finite number of total orderings of actions. Such a formalization of the secrecy problem can be found, for instance, in [1,33], to which the reader is referred for further details. We can represent the constraint system above as a rewrite theory R =
