The computational aspects of PL topology are important in applications. For example, one has intensively studied the question whether a given simplicial com- plex has a geometric realization in Rd, for small d, see e.g., [6,7], and references therein. In comparison, studying computational aspects of barycentric subdivisions is relatively new. Because of this, we felt it might be a good idea to bring some of the central open questions to the readers attention. We begin this note by recalling one of the standard results of PL topology, where we refer to [2] for terminology of PL topology, and to [4] for terminology of combinatorial algebraic topology.

complexes K and L only, however it can be very hard to determine this number exactly, even in special cases. In [5] we started the study of the case dim L = 0. This turned out to be more sophisticated than initially realized. While many open questions remain, we list some of the known facts.
