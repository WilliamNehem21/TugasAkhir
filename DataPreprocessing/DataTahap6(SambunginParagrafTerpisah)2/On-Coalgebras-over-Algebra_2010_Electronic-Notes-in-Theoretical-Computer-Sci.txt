The situation described until now in this section can be presented as follows: If two endofunctors T and H are given, one may search for the appropriate monad such that (T, H) form a commuting pair. As there is a special bond between algebras of T and coalgebras of H, it is not clear whether the general case of any two (finitary) Set-endofunctors would have a solution. But there is another possible approach: Start only with one endofunctor and additionally with a (finitary) monad; find then a distributive law inducing a Kleisli (or algebra) lift. Once this is accomplished, one should built a second endofunctor on Set (assuming this is possible) in order to obtain a commuting pair, using the functor obtained on Alg(M).

The second part of the paper introduces the notion of a commuting pair of endofunctors with respect to a monad. This seems to be new, however a detailed analysis and more examples are needed in order to better understand this structure (like the connection between bisimulations and traces exhibited in [8]). We plan to do this in a further paper.
