antennas using 50 W for 5 and 10 min. Ablation diameters, ablation lengths and aspect ratios were deter- mined. Sleeved antenna produced lowest reflection coefficient, high power dissipation, low power dissi- pation density, high SAR and high temperature in the simulation. Sleeved antenna provides excellent localization, large ablative diameter, low backward heating and high aspect ratio than single slot, dual slot and monopole antennas.

The materials used for this study are COMSOL Multiphysics software version 4.4 (Stockholm, Sweden), a 2.45 GHz solid-state microwave generator (SAIREM SAS 200 W, Neyron Cedex, France), semi-rigid coaxial cable (RG405 Coax, Pasternack Enterprises Inc, Los Angeles), excised bovine liver, Teflon tape and ImageJ software (NIH) for analysis of acquired images.

Differences in ablation diameters, ablation lengths and aspect ratios of the four antennas were analyzed to study the relationship between them using ANOVA (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, SPSS). P-value <.05 was considered to be statistically sig- nificant. Also, the percentage difference of ablation coagulation diameter and length of antennas were compared with monopole antenna.
