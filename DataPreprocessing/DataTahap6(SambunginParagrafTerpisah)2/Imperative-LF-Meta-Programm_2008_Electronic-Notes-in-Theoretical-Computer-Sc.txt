Logical frameworks have enjoyed wide adoption as meta-languages for describing deductive systems. While the techniques for representing object languages in logical frameworks are relatively well understood, lan- guages and techniques for meta-programming with them are much less so. This paper presents work in progress on a programming language called Rogue-Sigma-Pi (RSP), in which general programs can be written for soundly manipulating objects represented in the Edinburgh Logical Framework (LF). The ma- nipulation is sound in the sense that, in the absence of runtime errors, any putative LF object produced by a well-typed RSP program is guaranteed to type check in LF. An important contribution is an approach for soundly combining imperative features with higher-order abstract syntax. The focus of the paper is on demonstrating RSP through representative LF meta-programs.

to write an imperative version of this function, which caches intermediate results. Caching intermediate results is a simple but highly effective optimization in au- tomated reasoning systems. In the case of the Deduction Theorem, we will cache intermediate proofs using an attribute dedthm cached. Since the type of the cached
