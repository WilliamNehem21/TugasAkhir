In contrast to the determinant expansion from GI , the sum-of-products rep- resentation of labels of G yields a direct correspondence of species-line-graphs and expansion terms. Terms have the same partial derivatives if their species-line-graphs have identical substrate-reaction edges. This observation motivates to identify com- patible line-graphs in G and determine their overall contribution to the expansion from their stoichiometric labels.

As an example, L1 and L2 in Example 6.3 are the only non-trivially compatible species-line-graphs. The notion of compatibility suggests a strategy to determine if det(J ) vanishes by summing over each individual compatibility class of L(G). If all classes are either non-negative or non-positive, the sign of the determinant is independent of the state x.

by LC leads to a new compatible species-line-graph with positive contribution that compensates the negative. However, there might be a second species-line-graph in the same class, also with negative contribution that contains another negative cycle that leads to the same compensating species-line-graph. Thus, the compensating species-line-graph needs to dominate the sum of all these contributions. Next, we give conditions when such situation arises and provide a simple sufficient condition that excludes it.
