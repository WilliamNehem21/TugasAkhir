Lemma 2.1 [3, Lemma 2.3] Let G be a graph. If H is the graph obtained from a graph G by adding a pendant vertex to any vertex of G, then det(D(H)) is invariant, regardless of which vertex of G has been connected to the pendant vertex by an edge.

{v1, v2,..., vk} and {vk+1, vk+2,..., vn}, respectively. Let G be the graph obtained from G1 and G2 by adding an edge between vertices v1 and vn, and let H be graph obtained from G1 and G2 by identifying vertices v1 and vn and then adding a pendent vertex from v1 (or vn). Then, det(D(G)) = det(D(H)).
