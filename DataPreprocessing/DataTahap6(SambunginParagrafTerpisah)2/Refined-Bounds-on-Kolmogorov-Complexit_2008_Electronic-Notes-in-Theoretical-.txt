First we examine how the different measures are related to each other. Given two dimension functions g and h a comparison of Hh and Hg can be achieved by simply comparing the behaviour of the functions g and h close to zero. The following lemma gives a relation between the behaviour of the dimension functions g and h and the corresponding measures Hh and Hg.
