signed to the azomethine group. Based on the polarographic data and acid-base pKa values were determined spectrophotometrically. The reduction mechanism pathway was sug- gested. The azomethine group proved to be in the azo form since the nitro group of the p-NO2

with the p-NO2 substituent (IIf) where reduction of the nitro group along 6 e wave (wave c) is at more negative potential than that of the 4e reduction wave of the azomethine linkage (c.f. results). The importance of the nitro group for discrimi- nation between an azo or hydrazone tautomeric structure of the azomethine linkage lies in the fact that literature survey of azo compounds containing a nitro substituent at any loca-
