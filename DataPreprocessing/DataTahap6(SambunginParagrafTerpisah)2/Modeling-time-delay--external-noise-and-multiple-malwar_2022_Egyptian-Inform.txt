Most malware models (SEIR, SIR, SIRD, ESIRD, SISL, SIRS-L, SILRD, etc.) are inspired and derived from the traditional classi- cal SIR model. A mathematical model is always based on sim- plified assumptions for a critical problem or malware and network issues. The assumptions are completely correlated with the corresponding malware, network failures, and hacking issues. Thus, we can study any critical networks like hetero net- works [44], LSTM networks [45], or machine-to-machine net- works [46] with the help of a structured classical base model like SIR. So, in this study we consider a complex network model formulated to show multiple infections and its corresponding (t) + E1 (t) + E2 (t) + I1 (t) + I2 (t) + R (t) + V (t). Actually, to obtain our model herein, we added sub-classes to the original SEIR-V model [8] i.e. the exposed and the infectious classes, which allow

Stochastic mathematical model	WSN environments are characteristically affected by a number of random factors [47], such as temperature, physical obstructions such as range and dis- tance between devices in the network, and natural disturbances like latency due to heavy traffic and huge transmission of data that is not fixed. Excepting deterministic processes, a considerable portion of environmental factors involve uncertainties and are innately random, as is evident in network traffic, unexpected fail- ures, hacking by black hat hackers using malware, network fluc- tuations due to numerous issues like increase in errors, individual quality parameters, and open source tools etc. The recurrence of random drivers in network processes motivates the study of how a stochastic environment may affect and determine the dynamics of network systems.
