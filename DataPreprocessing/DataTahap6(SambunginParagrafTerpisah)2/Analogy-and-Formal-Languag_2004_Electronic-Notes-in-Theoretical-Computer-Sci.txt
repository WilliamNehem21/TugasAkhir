An intuition about analogies is that two analogies could always be con- catenated if they do not have any symbol in common. In fact, there are three possible ways of concatenating which meet intuition. However, for- mally, concatenating is not the only possibility. One could mix up sym- bols, for instance: " : a = bb : bab. We shall reject this possibility.

The previous definition conforms to the usual presentation of formal languages. It aims at the generation of a language. Thus, as usual, stan- dard structural induction is used to generate all of the members of a lan- guage of analogical strings. Starting with the elements of A, all possible analogies with the elements of M as models are applied.

The reciprocal problem of generation is that of recognition. With an analogical system, the grammaticality of a given string, i.e., its member- ship in a language, is tested against the set of attested strings of that lan- guage, after the reduction of that given string, by analogy, using the set of models. For recognition, the strings in the pairs of M are used in the reverse direction they appear in M, and the analogies are solved in the direction reverse to that for generation. This is possible thanks to the in- version of ratios in Theorem 2.1.

Consistency: fan bn =n  1g  (fabg; fab ! aabbg). By induction on n. Base: ab 2 (fabg; fab ! aabbg) is true, by definition of a lan- guage of analogical strings. Induction: suppose that an bn is a member of

Proof. Let (A; M) be a language of analogical strings. Let us call kA the maximum over all j w j with w in A. kA exists, because A is finite. Let us call kM the maximum over all j v0 j j v j with v ! v0 in M. kM exists also, because M is also finite.
