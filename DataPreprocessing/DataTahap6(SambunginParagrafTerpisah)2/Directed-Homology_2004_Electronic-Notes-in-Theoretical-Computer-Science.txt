One can gain valuable insights in concurrency theory by exploring the ge- ometry of concurrent systems. This point of view has been promoted for some time, and it appears that it is gaining territory. In this paper, we are introducing a notion of directed homology for semicubical sets, which should hopefully have various applications as a strong invariant of higher-dimensional automata [11], systems of weakly synchronizing PV processes [1], and other related formalisms for concurrent systems.
