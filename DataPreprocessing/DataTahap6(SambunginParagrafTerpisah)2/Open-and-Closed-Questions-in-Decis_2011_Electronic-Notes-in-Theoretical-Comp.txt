Three friends are going out together for the evening and need to pick a designated driver. First they assume that Andrew will drive, but he objects and suggest Barry instead. They agree that Andrew will drive unless the majority prefer that Barry drives. But they vote for Barry to drive. This time Barry objects because Charles has not even been considered. They decide that Barry should drive unless the majority prefer that Charles drives, in which case Charles is picked as the driver. This happens and Charles is selected, despite the fact that the majority prefer Andrew (the original choice) as the designated driver.

These formal properties of our models capture a common insight. When asking an open question, there is more than one way to proceed, depending on which ceteris paribus assumptions are dropped. For closed questions, the extension to compound formulas is much easier. We simply define 14 An alternative approach would be to focus on the changing awareness of the agent making decisions as a result of obtaining answers to her questions. Existing work on logics of awareness include [5], [8], [4] and [10]. As far as we are aware, there is no direct technical relationship between these approaches and ours.
