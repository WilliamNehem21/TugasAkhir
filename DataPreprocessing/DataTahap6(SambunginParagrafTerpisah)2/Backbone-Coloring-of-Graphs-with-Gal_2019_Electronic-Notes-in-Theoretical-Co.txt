with our result, we deduce that a q-backbone coloring with 2q + 2 colors can be obtained in linear time. We do not know whether our bound is tight when G is triangle-free. It is trivially tight when G is not triangle-free as it suffices to take a K4 with K1,3 as backbone. Therefore, we pose the question:

coloring of G. Now, we prove that it is a circular backbone coloring. For this, we prove that, given a central vertex v, all of its neighbors in the backbone are colored with an appropriate color. First observe that v receives color 1, q +3 or q + 2. In the first case, the colors allowed for its neighbors in F are q +1 or q + 2. In the second case, all the its neighbors in F are colored with colors 1 or 2. Finally, in the last case, all the its neighbors in F are colored with colors 1 or 2q + 2. Hence cj is a circular q-backbone coloring of (G, F ).
