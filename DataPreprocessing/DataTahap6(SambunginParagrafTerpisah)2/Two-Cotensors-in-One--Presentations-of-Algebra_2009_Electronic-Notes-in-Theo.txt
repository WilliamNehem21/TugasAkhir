Let I be the category whose objects are finite sets of atoms, and whose morphisms are injections. In what follows, we write I for the category of presheaves SetI. Let A be the presheaf in I given by A(A) = A.

We survey some rudiments of algebraic theories and Lawvere theories in the en- riched setting. The reader will find more detail and discussion, and more generality, in [14,22,26]; a reference for enriched categories is [12]. In Section 3.4, we consider the relevance of the theory to the categories f and A, considered above.

Example 5.2 Cartesian structure. For a simple first example, let C be any category with an initial object, and let M be the class of all isomorphisms in C. There is a compatibility structure in which all morphisms with common codomain are related. The induced structure on SetC is the cartesian closed structure.
