Normandin et al. explored temporal and spatial host-pathogen dynamics in Ebola virus disease through a natural history study in rhesus monkeys. Bulk transcriptomics of over 400 samples highlighted clinically relevant changes in host gene expression and the emergence of viral mutations that were specific to individual tissues.

Uganda and of other filovirus diseases, such as Marburg virus disease, underscore the importance of addressing filovirus threats. EVD is a prototypical viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) with clinical manifestations including fever, severe gastrointes- tinal involvement, hemodynamic dysfunction, and multiorgan failure leading to death.7 Notably, the host-pathogen determi- nants of this severity remain relatively obscure, and we lack comprehensive insight into the molecular pathobiology underly- ing severe EVD.

Gene expression across tissues (separated by the clusters in A) for the top 8 correlated and anti-correlated DEGs and 3 representative viral genes. Samples are ordered along the x axis by tissue and DPI. On the y axis, DEGs are clustered and labeled by direction.

Our analysis of host transcriptional responses across tissues adds further dynamic and tissue-specific context to known fea- tures of pathogenesis and identifies intriguing novel responses related to tissue connectivity. Beyond expected changes in ISG and cytokine expression,14 the comprehensive nature of our dataset enabled us to identify differential dynamics across tissues. This study also revealed previously unknown features of disease. We observed changes in ECM genes in most tissues, with widespread dysregulation of collagen-, laminin-, and carti- lage-related gene families in several tissues as well as an in- crease in collagen cleaving enzymes such as metallopeptidase (MMP8, MMP3, and MMP2) in the blood, skin, and brain. These findings provide new molecular insight into the etiology of vascular endothelial and connective tissue disruption (i.e., vascular leak syndromes, characteristic of severe EVD) and may suggest molecular pathobiology common to other hemor- rhagic fevers; for example, similar dysregulations in ECM have been reported in other hemorrhagic fevers, such as dengue virus infection,77 and ECM cleaving enzymes play a key role in venom- induced hemorrhage.78 Interestingly, these enzymes have also been reported to play a role in cell-to-cell viral transmission in West Nile virus79 and influenza virus,80 warranting further inves- tigation into the roles of these genes in EVD.

Through this study, we add further spatial and temporal gran- ularity to known signatures of EVD while also suggesting new molecular drivers of pathogenesis. We illustrate relationships be- tween host and viral signatures during EVD and propose poten- tial mechanisms that may generate these signatures. Finally, we provide computational and experimental tools to not only facili- tate further investigations of EBOV infections but also provide a model for future studies seeking to nominate and validate mo- lecular bases of disease progression.

Tissue homogenates inactivated in TRIzol were phase-separated with chloroform at the Broad Institute, and total RNA was extracted from the aqueous phase using the MagMAX MirVana total RNA kit (ThermoFisher) on a KingFisher FLEX instrument. DNA was removed by TURBO DNase treatment following RNA extraction. A TRIzol-inactivated aliquot of the viral seed stock injected into an- imals from this study was also obtained and extracted with the Direct-zol-96 MagBead RNA (Zymo Research).

Ebola viral load in all extracted RNA samples was measured by qRT-PCR using an SYBR Green assay with previously published primers targeting the EBOV NP gene.83 A standard curve of a DNA gBlock (IDT) encoding the target region was used to calculate viral copy numbers. Curves of temporal change in viral load in each tissue were clustered using iterative K-means longitudinal data clustering with the R package KLM with maximum number of NA tolerates per trajectory of 1.

We followed an existing protocol for the multicistronic minigenome assay53 with some modifications. We seeded HEK 293T cells into collagen-coated 24-well plates, grew to 60% confluency, and transfected cells following the xtremegene9 transfection protocol with the previously described plasmid ratio (31.25 ng of NP-P2A-VP35, 18.75 ng of VP30, 250 ng of L, 62.5 ng of 5MG plasmid en- coding eGFP, 62.5ng of T7pol). We harvested cells 48 h post-transfection with trypsin, washed once with PBS and stained with DAPI for cell viability. We then measured the percentage of eGFP positive live cells for each condition which we considered as infected host cells.

pnc = softmax(ync). To allow sample-specific deviations from this prior trajectory, we finally sample pnc from a Dirichlet distribution pnc ~ Dirichlet(adir pnc). Here, adir is the global Dirichlet concentration parameter which controls how sample trajectories can deviate from the prior trajectory.

ple-to-sample trajectory deviation, a larger choice of s0 couples adjacent times more strongly together (i.e., stronger time regulari- zation), and T sets the trajectory correlation timescale. Like before, we normalize the unnormalized cell population ync by applying the softmax function along the last dimension to obtain pnc = softmax(ync). In contrast to the polynomial model, ync is already a latent variable which accommodates for sample-to-sample deviation from the trajectory. Therefore, sampling from the Dirichlet distribution is no longer needed in this approach.
