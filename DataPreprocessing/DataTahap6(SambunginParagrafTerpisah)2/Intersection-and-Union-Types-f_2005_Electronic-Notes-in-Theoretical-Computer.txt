It is a conservative extension of the Strict Intersection Type Assignment System of [1] (see also [2,3]), in that lambda terms typeable in that system translate to X -nets, while preserving the type. It is also a natural extension of the system considered in [5], i.e. the basic implicative system for Classical Logic, but extended with (strict) intersection and union types and the type constant T. The main results of this paper are that this notion is closed for both subject-reduction and subject-expansion.

The notion of intersection type assignment on X that we will present in this section is a natural extension of the system considered in [5], i.e. the basic implicative system for Classical Logic, but extended with intersection and union types and the type constant T.

There exists a whole plethora of directions of research that need exploration for X . The one started with this paper, a notion of type assignment using intersection types, will need to be more strongly linked to existing systems, like those of [9,2,12]. Using those results, we want to look at the problem of termination, semantics, approximation, etc.
