The usefulness of a logic depends on the available connectives in its language: thus, as we have pointed out in the introduction, for talking about paracompleteness we need a negation and a disjunction satisfying particular conditions. However, we are going to complete the language with an appropriate conjunction and an appro- priate implication. In Definition 2.3 we establish some conditions on connectives so they can be considered as conjunction, disjunction, and implication.
