The subject matter of this paper is classical normal modal logic of non-monotonic interactive proofs, i.e., a novel modal logic of negation-complete and thus disjunctive interactive proofs (LDiiP) and an existing modal logic of non-disjunctive and thus negation-incomplete interactive proofs (LiiP) (cf. [20] and [19]). (We abbreviate interactivity-related adjectives with lower-case letters.)

Our immediate motivation for LDiiP is first the theoretical concept and second the practical application of a negation-complete variant of our interactive proofs [20,19,17]. The overarching motivation for LDiiP is to serve in an intuitionistic foundation of interactive computation. See [17] for a programmatic motivation.
