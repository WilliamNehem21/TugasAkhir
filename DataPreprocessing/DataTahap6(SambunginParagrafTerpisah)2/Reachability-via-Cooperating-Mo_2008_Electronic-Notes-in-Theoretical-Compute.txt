Moreover, the morphisms h and g have to be defined such, that they do uniformly this for all input words w, that is, that they can generate all potential input words. Hence, the process is inherently nondeterministic. This, however, is no problem, since the morphisms are allowed to be noninjective.

Above results deserve a few comments. First of all, Theorem 7.3 (even in the case of biprefix morphisms) was first proved in [11]. A simpler, more like a textbook type proof, was recently given in [9]. In the latter case p can be shown to be 2.
