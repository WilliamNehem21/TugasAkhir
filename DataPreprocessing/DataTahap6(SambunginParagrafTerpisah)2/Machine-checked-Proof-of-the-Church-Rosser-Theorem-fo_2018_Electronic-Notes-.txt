classical informal proofs use the BVC. We can also mimic this practice in this case since our induction principle gives us a binder y distinct form x and fresh in Nj. Then, we have the freshness premises to successfully apply the sub- stitution composition Lemma 2.9 and conclude this proof in the following steps:
