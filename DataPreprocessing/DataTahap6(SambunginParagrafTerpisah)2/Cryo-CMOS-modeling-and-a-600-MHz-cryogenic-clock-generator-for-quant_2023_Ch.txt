This article is organized as follows. In Section II, we provide a description of cryogenic device characterization and the developed 4 K CMOS model for circuit design. Section III elaborates on the clock generator architecture and cryogenic circuit design considerations. The measurement results of the clock generator at 300 K and 4 K are presented in Section IV, and finally, we conclude this article in Section V.

quantum transport42, source-to-drain tunneling43-44, etc.) have not been taken into account. Besides, the Monte-Carlo parameters, parasitic capacitors, self-heating effect45, mismatch parameters33, and small-signal model46 of cryo-MOSFETs also need further study and modeling. These works will be carried out in our next stage of cryo-CMOS modeling research.
