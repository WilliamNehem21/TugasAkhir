It may be argued that Definition 2.8 is a natural generalisation of the notion of strong universal multimap in a multicategory [10], and Definition 2.10 the nat- ural generalisation of representability from multicategories to polycategories (pace Defn. 2.5). In Section 3, we will see that these concepts are special cases of more general fibrational concepts. Like strong universal multimaps in a multicategory, both in-universal and out-universal polymaps are closed under composition in an appropriate sense.

We should emphasise that the results in this section, and in particular the poly- categorical Grothendieck correspondences, are conditioned on having a theory of weak 2-polycategories. To the extent of our knowledge such a theory has not been carefully worked out yet. We leave it as future work to craft this theory. Meanwhile we will describe the properties we assume to hold for weak 2-polycategories after recalling the usual notion of categorical Grothendieck correspondences.
