For the general theory of universal algebras the reader may consult Burris and Sankappanavar [12] Gratzer [21] and McKen- zie, McNulty and Taylor [29]. The main references for topological algebras are Taylor [50] [51], Gumm [22], Bentz [8] and Coleman [13] [14].

+ T . T is a lambda theory if T + = T (see [3, Def. 4.1.1]). As a matter of notation, T ` M = N stands for  + T ` M = N; this is also written as

For any T0-space A the partial order  is called the specialization order of . Notice that any continuous map between T0-spaces is necessarily monotone and that the order is discrete (i.e. satis es a   b i a = b) i  A is a T1-space.

The previous axioms of separation can be relativized to pairs of elements. For example, a and b are T2-separable, if there exist open sets U and V with a 2 U , b 2 V and U \ V = ;. T1-, T0-separability are similarly de ned.

Each partition P of any set X into disjoint subsets, together with ;, is a basis for a topology on X, known as a partition topology. A subset of	X is then open if and only if it is the union of sets belonging to P and thus its complement is also open; thus a set is open i it is closed. The trivial partitions yield the discrete or indiscrete topologies. In any other cases	X with a partition topology is not T0.

Let (A; ) be a partially ordered set (poset). B  A is an upper (lower) set if b 2 B and b  a (a  b) imply a 2 B. We utilize the notations B" (B#, Bl respectively) for the least upper (lower, upper and lower) set containing a subset B of A. We write a" (a#, al respectively) for fag" (fag#, fagl).

Given a poset (A;  ) we can nd many T0-topologies  on A for which is the specialization ordering of (see Johnstone [25, Section II.1.8]). The Alexandro topology and the weak topology de ned below are the maximal one and the minimal one with this property.

It is an easy matter to verify that the A-clopen sets of an Alexandro space constitute a topology, denoted by  . It is the partition topology (see Sec- tion 2.3) generated by the partition of the space in connected components.

Since a map is monotone i the inverse image of an upper set is an upper set i the inverse image of a lower set is a lower set, then every monotone map is continuous w.r.t. the partition topology  .

Let U and S be two A-clopen sets such that U is a neighbourhood of c1, S is a neighbourhood of 0, and U \ S = ;. Because s(a; b) = c1 2 U and s is continuous w.r.t.   , then there exist two A-clopen sets V and W such that for every M and N such that  ` M = N. The re exive closure of ! satis es the diamond property, and the relations  and   commute. Then the reduction rule ! = ! [ ! is Church-Rosser by the Hindley-Rosen Lemma (see Barendregt [3, Prop. 3.3.5]).

If  `  tu =  then  tu =   , so that there is a reduction  tu   . This is possible only if tu is a -redex i.e. if  ` t = u.	2 tu = i  ` t = u, so that our hypothesis  6` t = u implies  6` c1 =  . The remaining part follows from the induction hypothesis and from Lemma 4.1 applied to cn+1   (cn) .	2

-term t is the element jtjC of C (see Section 2.2). For the sake of simplicity, we write directly t for jtjC when there is no danger of confusion. De ne 0 and s(x; y)   xy. Since  ` xx = , then we have that C j= x: xx = x: . This last identity implies cc = ( x: xx)c = ( x: )c = for all c 2 C.
