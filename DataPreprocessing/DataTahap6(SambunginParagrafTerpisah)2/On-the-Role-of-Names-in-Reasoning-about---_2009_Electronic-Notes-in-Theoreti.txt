Notice that the permutation action on variables is an identity. Implicit in this definition is the assumption that variables always have empty support. This design feature allows us to omit explicit representation of permutations at the term level. Dependency of a variable on names can be encoded via a technique called raising, to be explained shortly.

Notice that the definition of open bisimulation uses quantification over substitu- tions. A direct encoding would therefore formalize this name substitution explicitly. However, we can obtain a more concise encoding by using quantifiers of logic. This encoding is not new and has been used in a previous work [24]. We refer the reader to this work for the details concerning the use of quantifier alternations to encode distinctions and to avoid explicit encodings of substitutions.
