A model for random simplicial complexes of higher dimension was recently in- troduced and studied by Linial, Meshulam and Wallach, see [27], [28]. The funda- mental groups of random 2-complexes are random groups of a fairly general type. Important progress in understanding this model of random groups was made re- cently by Babson, Hoffman and Kahle [3].
