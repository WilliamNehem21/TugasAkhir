We will be particularly interested in the category DGbal of rooted dialogue games and balanced conflict-free strategies. In order to perform our comparison with graph games, we adapt the definition of the positional graph (Def. 1.6) associated to a dialogue game, by considering only its balanced positions:

Definition 6.2 The balanced graph G(A) of a rooted dialogue game A is the re- striction of GraphA to the balanced positions and to the edges between them. Note that the paths of G(A) are exactly the balanced trajectories of A.
