One definition is by induction-recursion. In induction recursion, one defines a set inductively, while at the same time defining a (typically set-valued) function on that set, that may be mentioned in the inductive clauses. The solution is an initial algebra for an endofunctor on a category of families. The reason that this is an induction recursive definition of a family of sets, rather then a plain inductive definition, followed by a recursive definition of sets is that the second component of the operand family is used in the definition of the first component of the output family. For an explanation of the principles underlying induction recursion see the papers [9] [8] by Dybjer and Setzer and the references therein. The constructors and their associated decoding functions are as follows:

Final coalgebras of indexed containers impose a form of sort-constraint on infi- nite terms (in which the indices are type identifiers). Our definition of composition has the smell of cut-elimination, except that no sort-structure is present. With a sort-structure, the source of this aroma can be investigated. There may be connec- tions here with continuous cut-elimination and continuous normalisation and the repetition rule of Mints: see also [5].
