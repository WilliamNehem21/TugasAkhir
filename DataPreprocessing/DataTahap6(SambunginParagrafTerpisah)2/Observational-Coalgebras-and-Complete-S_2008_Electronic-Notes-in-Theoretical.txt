final coalgebra. We call such a representation of a set X an observational coalgebra. Any observational coalgebra has two crucial properties: strong extensionality and what we call relative finality. The first property is the basis for a proof principle on observational coalgebras and the second one is the key for the coinductive definition of constants and functions on observational coalgebras.

The notion of an observational coalgebra is in general too abstract to work with. In this section we define the more concrete notion of a complete set of co-operations. We first introduce the notion of a cosignature and of a co-operation and then state when a given set of co-operations is complete.
