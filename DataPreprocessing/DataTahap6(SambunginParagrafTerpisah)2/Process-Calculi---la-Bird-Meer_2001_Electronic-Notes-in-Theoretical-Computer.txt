Finally the approach is independent of any particular process calculus and makes explicit the different ingredients present in the design of any such calculi. In particular structural aspects of the underlying behaviour model (e.g., the dichotomies such as active vs reactive, deterministic vs non de- terministic) become clearly separated from the interaction structure which defines the synchronisation discipline.

commit itself, i.e., that appear in at least one derivation of p, is called the sort of p and denoted by L(p). [14] provides a syntactic criterion to compute a majoring approximation of L(p) by induction on the process expression. A semantic definition can, however, be given as
