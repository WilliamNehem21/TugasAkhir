with limited resources, which are essential components of a drone net- work, have limited capacity, computing capabilities, and standby time. A Drone network sends confidential, vital and moment data between participating organizations over an unsecured channel of communica- tion. It is crucial to ensure the validity and reciprocal credibility of all involved parties when maintaining the confidentiality material. Due to the limited capabilities of drones, it is not possible to use sophisticated multifactor authentication such as fingerprints, bilinear map pairings, and digital certificates within the Drone network itself. This is because of the complexity of the computations.

The cost of calculation and communication must also be reduced. In order to construct a lightweight authentication mechanism for the deployment of the Internet of Drones, researchers in [10,23] developed an authenticated key agreement (AKA) approach using just hash func- tions and XOR operations (Drone). No comprehensive safety verification of the proposed AKA protocols has been carried out using the known computer-based encryption methods evaluation testing tools. However, the schemes are light and incur minimal high processing costs. An asym- metric wavelet transforms pairing-based key agreement mechanism has been proposed for Drone deployments [24,25]. As a result of its low-cost

In [24], there are no formal proofs that the schemes are secure. Last but not least, Wizid et al. [26] developed a lightweight AKA technique for authenticating users and piloting drones in Drone applications. In this approach, only fuzzy extractor and hash functions are used, result- ing in remarkable lightweight properties with little memory overhead and computational and communication expenses. As long as a powerful Canetti-Krawczyk (CK) adversary has access to all the exchanged mes- sages in the proposed authentication protocol, a session-specific tempo- rary information attack is achievable. The authors proposed a method for maintaining privacy while enabling authentication [6].

It is possible to acquire compact attributes in encryption by using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Because of the reduced keystrokes, it consumes less memory and is faster in field arithmetic [28]. ECC is a good choice for developing public-key cryptography algorithms for devices with limited resources, such as drones. The finite field costs are investigated in comparison to the proposed system method. The strategy outlined in [14] has a number of limitations that the method does not. It is possible to expand the number of drones that can be uti- lized in the proposed system approach as the Drone network expands, and this is why AC is included in the proposed strategy. The validity and secrecy of the proposed approach can be verified using the widely acknowledged automatic cryptographic protocol verification tool, Pro- Verify. To verify its reliability, the proposed system performance is com-

The OpenMote-b hardware platform needs both time and energy to accomplish each atomic hardware operation. If you are doing point mul- tiplication, there is no such thing as an ideal elliptic curve size. The secp160r1 curve can take 58.0 milliseconds, while the secp256r1 can take up to 109.3 milliseconds. It takes between 1:44 and 2:75 ms to per- form an elliptic curve addition, as opposed to 2:53 for an HMAC-SHA. They are also running quicker than ever before, with a completion time of fewer than 0.05 milliseconds each time.

OpenMote-b hardware platform, elliptic curve secp160r1, and ten independent Proposed protocol executions were used to calculate an average claimed time length for that protocol. When two devices are using the proposed protocol, it takes about 340:478 milliseconds for everything to be done. Once the key is generated, the exchange of au- thentication materials and computation of the final Session Key takes 243:392 ms. We found in OpenWSN that the number of RF slots avail- able in a time unit can have a significant impact on the execution time of a given protocol. According to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, a slot pe- riod of 10 milliseconds is provided by default. Within 30 milliseconds, data transmission from one device to another is deemed successful (or, in the worst-case scenario, 60 milliseconds). For the devices tested, El- liptic Curve Multiplication takes the longest time.

In order to power the OpenMote-b board, you will need two AA bat- teries. Manganese/Alkaline batteries, on the other hand, use about 3:84 watt-hours of power, or 13; 824 Joules, each charge at a voltage of 1:5 V. A single usage of proposed system consumes less than 0.0134 percent of the battery capacity, making it virtually non-existent.

that is unknown to AC, and so cannot rebuild the secret key that has al- ready been formed or forecast future shared key that will be acquired. So any hostile object would cause the communication between two partic- ipants that computed separate interim session keys, which would cause unrecovered mistakes when the identification labels were transferred and validated. The proposed mechanisms have been independently val- idated by the ProVerif tool.

Opcodes are created ex-negotiation at any moment, even though the initial session key is the same throughout all cases of Proposed. To put it another way, they ensure that each new protocol instance generates a unique set of session keys, preventing any replay attacks. The multiple nodes would be unable to construct the right identification codes if prior communications are replayed (see division B for the formal demonstra- tion of this condition).
