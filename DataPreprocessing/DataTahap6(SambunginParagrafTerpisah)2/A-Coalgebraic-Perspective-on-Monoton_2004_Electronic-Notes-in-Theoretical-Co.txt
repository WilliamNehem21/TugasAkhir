about these systems. The main benefit which can be expected from defining coalgebraic semantics for modal logic is to obtain results for different types of modal logics in a uniform way. Here the type of a modal logic is determined by the endofunctor T . Research in this direction has been carried out for the inductively defined Kripke polynomial functors (cf. [10,13,30]) but also for arbitrary endofunctors T (see [24,19,26,27]).

We will briefly introduce the main concepts and results from the algebraic duality theory of monotone modal logic. Apart from fixing notation, the purpose of this section is to provide the reader with some insight into the relationship between algebraic duality and the UpV-functor of section 3.2.

Proof. The proof of this lemma is virtually identical to that of Lemma 5.2.6 in Marx [23], which relies only on the Kripke version of bisimulation products and the basic duality between Kripke frames and baos. These analogues for monotone frames and bams are shown in [12].
