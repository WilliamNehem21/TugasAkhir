Once the Baire metric has been introduced, the scene is set for fruitful use of a range of classical metric (or topological) tools. The Baire distance can be extended to the Hausdorff distance on sets of entities, thus allowing the modelling of a spectrum of nondeterministic notions. In general, we want to work with sets of meanings where all relevant limits are present, leading to the use of closed subsets and of complete spaces. A large proportion of the programming notions considered induces in a natural way the notion of a (first) computational step - to be followed by the remainder of the computation. In many cases, this will have as counterpart that the semantic function which is to be associated with the notion concerned enjoys the property of being contractive. Here we recall the classical Banach fixed point theorem: each contractive endofunction on a complete metric space has a unique fixed point. This result is pervasive in all of metric semantics, both as definitional principle and as a proof principle. As to the latter: if one wants to show

We add a side remark on the role of topology here: Transition systems may satisfy two finiteness conditions (viz. of being finitely branching or image finite. An important result of metric semantics is the following: the operational semantics associated with a finitely branching (image finite) transition system is a compact (closed) set.
