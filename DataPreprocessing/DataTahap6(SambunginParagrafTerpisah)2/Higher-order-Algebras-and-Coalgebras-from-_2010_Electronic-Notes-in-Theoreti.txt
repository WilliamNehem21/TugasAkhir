The study of algebras and coalgebras involve parametric description of a family of endofunctors. Such descriptions can often be packaged as parameterized endofunctors. A parameterized endofunctor generates a higher-order endofunctor on a functor category. We characterize initial algebras and final coalgebras for these higher-order endofunctors, generalizing several results in the literature.

The rest of the paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 intro- duces the notion of parameterized endofunctors, making observations about some examples. Section 3 sets the stage for the main result by defining a certain com- pleteness (and co-completeness) conditions on parameterized endofunctors which we call suitability. Section 4 states the main results and provides a detailed proof for the algebraic case. We also provide a sampling of how the theorems may applied in several disparate situations. We end with Section 5, providing some summarizing conclusions.

The definition of initial and final suitability generalizes a collection of common concepts in the theory of algebras and coalgebras. Free monads, completely iterative monads, and their duals are in fact based on initial or final suitability conditions for certain parameterized endofunctors. The following examples clarify the nature of how initial and final suitability generalizes and unifies these notions.

The study of algebras and coalgebras often depend heavily on the choice of the base category. Generally speaking, it is often fruitful to fix a category and consider interesting families of endofunctors, which either admit algebras or coalgebras or both. The proposal in this research is to consider functor categories as an appealing option for the fixed category.

This result follows as an application of Theorem 4.5. It is the simplest case where the parameter category B is not discrete. The direct proof is given by Chuang and Lin and applied to give inductive semantics to dependent types [5].
