is formed over all the biopolymer blend compositions. Various types of bands for the two biopolymers and their blends were assigned in FTIR spectra. XRD scans reveal broad and sharp peaks, which indicate the amorphous nature of PMMA and the semi-crystalline nature of PCL, respectively. From UV-Vis spectra, with increasing PCL concentration the position of the sharp edge was slightly shifted toward higher wavelength and also the energy gap decreased from 5.047 to 4.265 eV; this suggests the miscibility between the biopolymer blend. From TGA studies, it is clear that the weight loss of the PMMA is higher than the weight loss of the PCL. Thus, it may be concluded that the addition of PCL biopolymer in- creases thermal stability. All previously stated results suggested that the optimum concentration at PCL/PMMA 80/20 of the bioblends may be taken to improve some of the electrical, structural and optical properties for use in biological applica-
