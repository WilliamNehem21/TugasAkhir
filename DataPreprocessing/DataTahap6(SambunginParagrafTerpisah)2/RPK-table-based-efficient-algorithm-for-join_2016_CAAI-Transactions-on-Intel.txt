Distributed system has been proven powerful for large- scale datasets analysis. MapReduce [3] is an important par- allel computing framework in distributed system. It has been studied and applied widely in academia and industry. How- ever, both the join and aggregate operation processed on MapReduce are time-consuming [4,5]. The main performance mance by building middleware or cache structure on top of MapReduce framework. These are optimizations specif- ically on join strategies and they need to modify the core framework of MapReduce. Our proposed algorithm, on the other hand, is more general and can improve the efficiency of join-aggregate operator.

propose our algorithm on MapReduce to process aggregate queries containing join operation on large-scale data. Our approach improves the performance of query execution by reducing communication overhead, decreasing job setup time and disk I/Os. The experiments confirm that our algorithm has a better performance than existing approaches.
