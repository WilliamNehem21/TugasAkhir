Here the square brackets on the left refer to the coproduct of FH and FV in H/Mon(A ) and those on the right to H + V in Funf (A ). The verification uses the universal property of the free monad on H + V and is not difficult. The fact that (20) holds follows from the same diagram.

Finally, the rational monad RH and the monad TH are both characterized by universal properties; RH is the free iterative monad and TH the free completely iterative one. It remains to be seen whether CH can be characterized by some universal property, too. Unfortunately, context-free trees cannot serve as a guiding example in this respect as no universal property of them is known.
