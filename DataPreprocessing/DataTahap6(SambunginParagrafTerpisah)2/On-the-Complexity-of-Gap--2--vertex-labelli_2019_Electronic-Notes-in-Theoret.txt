Gap-[k]-vertex-labellings were introduced by A. Dehghan et al. [3] in 2013. In their article, the authors investigated both the computational complexity of decision problems associated with the gap-[k]-vertex-labelling of some families of graphs, as well as the least k for which some graphs admit such a labelling. They also show that deciding whether a given graph admits a gap-[k]-vertex-labelling is NP-complete for denote by T = (t1, t2,..., tp) an (arbitrary but fixed) ordering of all the p triangles in G. Also, we abuse notation to say that ti = {ex, ey, ez} is the triangle of G induced by edges ex, ey and ez of E(G).
