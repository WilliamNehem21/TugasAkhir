This work is one step further within a broader effort, whose first results appeared in [6], to develop a general theory of reflection for logics and declar- ative languages. In this regard, the results presented in this paper raise the issue of how the universal theories of related logics are themselves related. We expect that the metalogical foundations provided by the theory of gen- eral logics [9], which are at the base of our axiomatic approach to the study of reflection, will provide the concepts needed to address in a precise and formalism-independent way this issue.
