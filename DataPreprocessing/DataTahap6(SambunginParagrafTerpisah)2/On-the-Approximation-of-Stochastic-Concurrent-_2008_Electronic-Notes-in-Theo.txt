Process algebras offer an elegant framework to describe a wide range of systems, from computer networks to biological systems. When additional information re- garding (stochastic) speed of actions is added, we end up in the realm of stochastic process algebras (SPA), a widespread modeling technique in performance analy- sis [15] and in systems biology [20]. SPA are usually given a semantics in terms of continuous-time Markov Chains (CTMC [19]) - in fact, they can be seen as an high-level description language for CTMC. Therefore, all the analysis techniques for CTMC can be applied also to SPA, like steady-state or transient analysis. Moreover, many features of CTMC (like block decomposability) can be lifted to the level of SPA, greatly simplifying the analysis [15]. However, analyzing a stochastic system is a computationally expensive activity, and all previously mentioned techniques suffer severely from state space explosion. This phenomenon gets even worse when com- ponents are present in many copies, like molecules involved in chemical reactions.
