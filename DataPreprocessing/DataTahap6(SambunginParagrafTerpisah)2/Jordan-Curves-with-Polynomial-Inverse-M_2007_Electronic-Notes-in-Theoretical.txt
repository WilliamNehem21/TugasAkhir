complexity of Julia sets. Chou and Ko [5,6] studied the problem of finding paths in a two-dimensional domain. Ko and Yu [12] studied the problem of computing single-valued analytic branches of logarithm and square-root func- tions on a two-dimensional domain. Yu, Chou and Ko [18] studied the prob- lem of computing the minimum-area circumscribed rectangles and squares of a Jordan curve. All these works (and many others) used Turing machines and oracle Turing machines as the basic model.

We note that, in contrast to Theorem 4.2, it is not hard to verify that the curve constructed for the UP lower bound for the membership problem, as given in Theorem 7.3 of Chou and Ko [4], actually has a polynomial inverse modulus. Thus, we have the following stronger results about the membership problem than that of Chou and Ko [4].

In the previous sections, we studied the notion of polynomial inverse modulus of two-dimension Jordan curves. We presented evidence that the property of polynomial inverse modulus helps to reduce the complexity of some impor- tant problems about two-dimensional domains, including the inverse function problem, the membership problem, the path problem, and the analytic contin- uation problem. In addition, we observe that most Jordan curves constructed, in the earlier studies of two-dimensional domains, for the lower bound results for these problems satisfy this property of polynomial inverse modulus of con- tinuity. This includes the constructions for the lower bounds for the mem- bership problem and the path problem, as well as the fractals constructed for the nonrecursiveness result for the area problem (see Ko [10] and Ko and Weihrauch [11]).
