plane into precisely two components). It means that these closure operations can be used, as an alternative to the Khalimsky topology, for solving problems of computer graphics and computer image processing. We also demonstrate that using them has some advantages over using the Khalimsky topology.

Clearly, uR is a closure operation on X. It can be shown that uR is idem- potent if and only if (X, uR) is an Alexandroff topological space. Of course, uR is not additive in general, but, on the othere hand, the union of a system of closed subsets of (X, uR) is a closed subset of (X, uR).

The sets J from Theorem 3.9 need not be simple closed curves in (Z2, vn) in general and so this Theorem is not a satisfactory analogy of the classical Jordan curve theorem. In what follows we will give a criterion under which a given simple closed curve in the space (Z2, vn) separates this space into precisely two components.

While in the ternary digital plane the triangle ADE is a Jordan curve, in the Khalimsky plane it is not even a COTS-Jordan curve. In order that this triangle be a COTS-Jordan curve in the Khalimsky plane, we have to delete the points A,B,C and D (and then it will become even a Jordan curve). But this will lead to a deformation of the triangle.
