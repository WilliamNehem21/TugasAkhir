Conventional logic gates (e.g. AND gates) cannot be used for building a reversible computer. An appropriate design approach is necessary. Both small building blocks and a more complex circuit in MOS technology are presented. Today, these are useful in low-power digital electronics. Tomorrow, these may be useful in quantum computers.

Dual-line hardware allows very simple implementation of the inverter. It suffices to interchange its two physical lines in order to invert a variable, i.e. in order to hardwire the NOT gate. Conditional NOTs are NOT gates which are controlled by switches. A first example is the CONTROLLED NOT gate:

This, however, does not mean that the reversible MOS circuits are useless today. Indeed, as they are a reversible form of pass-transistor topology, they are particu- larly suited for so-called adiabatic addressing. Here, all signals are gradually set, first to an intermediate level, then to their final values. In practice, such procedure leads to a factor of about 10 in power reduction [10].
