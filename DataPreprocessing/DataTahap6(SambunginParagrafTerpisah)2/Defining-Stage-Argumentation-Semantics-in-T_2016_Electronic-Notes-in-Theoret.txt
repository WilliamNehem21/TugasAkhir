We define a new logic programming semantics in terms of abducible atoms. We use it to characterize the stage extensions of an argumentation framework AF by means of an associated normal program PAF . We also define the stage semantics for a special type of normal programs and present a similar characterization.

In this section, we review some theory about logic programming semantics and argumentation semantics. As it has been done before [4,8], we establish the rela- tion between a specific argumentation semantics of an argumentation framework and a semantics defined on the normal logic program associated to the argumenta- tion framework. We start with the basic definitions and facts we need about logic programming semantics and argumentation semantics.

{d(a), d(c)}. Moreover, we can verify that M = {d(a), d(c)} is the only stage model of PAF since M \ Facts((PAF )M ) is minimal with respect to set inclusion. Hence, according to Theorem 2.10, {b, d} is the only stage extension of AF , which coincides with the result showed in example 2.6.
