We presented propositional hybrid logics as established enhancements of propo- sitional temporal logics with the ability to name and re-bind specific states. We then provided a sound relational abstraction technique for hybrid Kripke structures and a hybrid version of computation tree logic. We further moti- vated and discussed a definition of hybrid labelled Markov chains and a syntax and semantics of probabilistic computation tree logic in this hybrid setting. Our abstraction techniques for hybrid Kripke structures should be transfer-

Our exposition of hybrid logics was heavily inspired by the introductory article at http://www.hylo.net/ and comments made by Chris Hankin, Sebastian Nanz, and Herbert Wiklicky. We thank the anonymous referees, Joost-Pieter Katoen, and Prakash Panangaden for constructive comments that helped shape the final version of this paper.
