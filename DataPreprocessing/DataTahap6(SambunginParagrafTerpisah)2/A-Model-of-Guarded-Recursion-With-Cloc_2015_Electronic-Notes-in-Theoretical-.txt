In previous versions of this calculus, different clocks represented separate time streams and clock synchro- nisation was prohibited. In this paper we show that allowing clock synchronisation is safe by constructing a new model of guarded recursion and clocks. This result will greatly simplify the type theory by removing freshness restrictions from typing rules, and is a necessary step towards defining rewrite semantics, and ultimately implementing the calculus.

Remark 3.18 This interpretation is standard, see e.g. Jacobs [10], but note that it is crucial that we have general clock substitution GR (f ), for arbitrary f , and this is precisely the ingredient that was missing in previous models, hence the restrictions on clock instantiation rules.
