The Director Agent has total knowledge about the protein actual spatial confor- mation and its function is to coordinate searching agents, aiming at a more efficient spatial exploration. The Director agent has no representation in the Cartesian space. It is an agent that acts on the 3-D space from outside. Director Agents perform global moves on the searching agents. It is mandatory to have at least one Director Agent in the simulation.
