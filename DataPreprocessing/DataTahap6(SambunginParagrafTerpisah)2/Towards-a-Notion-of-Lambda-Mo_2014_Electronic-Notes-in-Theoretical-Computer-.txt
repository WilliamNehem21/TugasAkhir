I give first a definition of algebraic theory exactly parallel to that for operads or symmetric operads. As with the definition of operads there is a lot of structure to lay out. Of course that is an argument in favour of the abstract approach of [6].

That concludes my preferred category theoretic definition of algebraic theory. It is easy to see that with the definitions sketched above each cartesian operad gives rise to an algebraic theory. Conversely given an algebraic theory T one can recover the corresponding cartesian operad in a simple fashion. In order to define the operadic composition

The category theoretic definition of algebraic theory has the merit of being more succinct than the operadic definition while keeping in focus the important aspect of functoriality. Hence I refer to it simply as an algebraic theory. However if one leaves the category theoretic perspective aside then one can make to do with a simple and elementary formulation.

We have our identity, projections and compositions and we need unit and as- sociativity laws. I held off giving these for the monoid so as to handle them all together. Let me give the unit laws first augmenting those for the monoid. These involve the occasional tweaking to take account of the retraction. I present them so they parallel the laws as they appeared in section 3.3. So the left laws are
