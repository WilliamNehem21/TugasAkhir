In order to simplify the writing of the reduction rules, pi denotes a variable x such that f (x)= i. The quantum program state then becomes a pair [Q, M'] with M' = M[pf(x1 )/x1] ... [pf(xn)/xn] if the domain of f is {x1,... xn}.

The entanglement relation of a new qubit relates this qubit with itself. Since the information about entanglement is stated in the typing rules (5) by a relation over variable names, the new qubit must be immediately named. That is why the syntax always gives names to newly created qubits let x = new M in M.

A more elaborate example would be the data used during the execution of the One Way Quantum Computer [11]: a rectangular array of qubits, where all qubits are initially entangled with their neighbours, and where the entan- glement within this quantum data structure is consumed in a stepwise manner by successive 1-qubit measurements. An interesting special case, which would at least fit the One Way Quantum Computer, is the family of quantum data structures corresponding to graph states [4,7]. This will be studied further in the scope of this work in progress, with the associated notion of types.
