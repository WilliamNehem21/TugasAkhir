There are two types of names: sites, which are the nodes of the network, and links, named connectors between pairs of sites. Sites are just atoms, e.g. a, links have the form lab, meaning that there is a link named l from a to b.

Section 2 of this paper is devoted to a recapitulation of NCPi syntax and se- mantics. The main contribution is Section 3 where, in order to demonstrate the expressive power of our language, we present a NCPi model of the p2p architecture Pastry [16]. This model has been devised in the context of the FP7 Autonomic Service-Component Ensembles (ASCENS) project, where the routing functionali- ties of Pastry are employed in a cloud-computing case study. Details can be found in [18, Chapter 6].
