Type systems for the non-size-increasing polynomial time functions have been extensively studied, see e.g. [3]. Such systems constitute an alternative to predica- tive recursion which rules out not only recursive definitions leading to exponential growth, but also natural algorithms computing non-size-increasing functions.

where the leftmost inclusion is strict because sbs0 and sbs1 are not regressive. Using the encoding technique of regressive machines introduced in [9, Section 6], one can show that R(P )= S(P ), but it does not seem possible that such technique can be applied to show that R(sbs0, sbs1)= S(sbs0, sbs1). A possible continuation of this work could address such question as well as the search of function algebras for the regressive and non-size-increasing functions of well-known complexity classes.
