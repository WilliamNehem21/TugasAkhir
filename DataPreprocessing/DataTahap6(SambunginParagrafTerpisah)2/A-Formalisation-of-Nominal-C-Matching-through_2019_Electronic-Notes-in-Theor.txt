Nominal unification is a decidable problem and efficient nominal unification al- gorithms are available [18,12,11], that compute solutions consisting of freshness con- texts (containing freshness constraints of the form a#X) and substitutions. Nomi- nal unification modulo commutativity (C), consists of nominal unification problems in which the signature of terms contains commutative function symbols. This alge- braic property has to be taken into account during the unification process.

Section 2 presents basic concepts and notations. Section 3 presents the exten- sion of simplification rules for nominal C-unification with protected variables, and discusses how the formalisations of termination, soundness and completeness were adapted. Section 4 introduces the nominal C-matching algorithm, and discusses the formalisation of its termination, soundness and completeness properties. Section 5 concludes the paper.

Remark 4.4 In the specification, the set of protected variables of a C-matching problem is given as a parameter of the deductive system that remains unchanged during derivations. For simplicity, in the following results the protected set is de- noted as X .
