The purpose of this paper is to investigate the connections between KM-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces and the associated order structures of formal balls. We introduce the notions of Yoneda T -completeness and Yoneda S-completeness on KM-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces. In both cases, the associated posets of formal balls are directed complete. In particular, for a subclass of KM-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces, Yoneda T -completeness and Yoneda S-completeness are characterized respectively by directed completeness of the associated posets of formal balls.

Remark 2.12 For more details of Theorem 2.11, we recommend the reader to [19]. Moreover, it is interesting to note that there exist fuzzy quasi-metric spaces such that any map of the characteristic family is not an ordinary quasi-metric. An extraordinary example was given in [18].

In this paper, we concentrate on the relationships between fuzzy quasi-metric spaces and the related order structures of formal balls. For this purpose, we introduce the notions of Yoneda T -completeness and Yoneda S-completeness on KM-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces. The relationships between completeness on fuzzy quasi-metric spaces and the associated posets of formal balls are discussed. Moreover, Yoneda T -completeness and Yoneda S-completeness on a subclass of KM-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces are characterized, respectively, with the aid of order-theoretical properties of the associated posets of formal balls.
