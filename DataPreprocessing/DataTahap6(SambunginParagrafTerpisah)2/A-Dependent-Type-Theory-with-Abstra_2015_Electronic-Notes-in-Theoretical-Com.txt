We cannot do the same for concretion and take its result type to be T (n/nj), because as we mentioned at the end of Sect. 2.1, validity of FreshMLTT judgements is not preserved in general by name-substitutions, only by name-permutations. 8  This

Proof. (sketch) The proof is done by mutual induction on the judgements of the FreshMLTT type system. We omit the induction steps for those judgements that already appear in MLTT, since a detailed proof (using contextual categories) can be found in [22, Chapter 3]. The remaining induction steps follow from the properties of the CwF Nom established in Sect. 3. We give details for the interesting cases.

We have given a semantics for FreshMLTT by identifying appropriate structure in the particular CwF of nominal sets. It should be possible to axiomatize that structure as a generalised algebraic theory [2] extending the one for categories with families given by Dybjer [8, Sect. 2.2]. In this way one would obtain an algebraic version of the type theory we study in this paper.
