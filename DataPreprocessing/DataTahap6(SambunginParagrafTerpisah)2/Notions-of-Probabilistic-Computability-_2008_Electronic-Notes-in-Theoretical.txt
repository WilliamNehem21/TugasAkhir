Section 3 contains precise definitions of the three weakened concepts of com- putability corresponding to items (I), (II) and (III) above; by considering mixed settings, we arrive at a total of five concepts. Each of these computability con- cepts is accompanied by a weakened continuity concept; the focus is on working out relations between these weakened forms of continuity and classical properties of the representations, spaces, measures and mappings. We then study the pair- wise relations between the five concepts: We either give a strong counter-example showing that one concept does not imply the other, show that one concept always implies the other, or show that one concept implies the other under mild additional assumptions.
