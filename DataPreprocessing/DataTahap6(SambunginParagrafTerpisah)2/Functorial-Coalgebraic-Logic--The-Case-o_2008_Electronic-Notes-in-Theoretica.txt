The purpose of this section is an algebraic investigation of logics for coalgebras. The general idea is as follows. Just as coalgebras are given wrt a functor T on, say, Set, so are logics for coalgebras given by a functor L on, say, Boolean algebras. The following example shows how logics for coalgebras given in a more conventional style give rise to a functor on the category BA of Boolean algebras.

different coproduct structures. But this implies working with a different functor than L. Instead, we can use another approach, namely to consider the free L- algebra over different presheaves of variables. For example, if W is the presheaf of variables defined explicitly by
