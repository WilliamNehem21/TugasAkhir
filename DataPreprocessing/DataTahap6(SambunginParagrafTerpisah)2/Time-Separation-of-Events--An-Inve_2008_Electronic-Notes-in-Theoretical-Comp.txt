given events i and j is NP-complete ([12]). We focus here on the inverse problem: we seek intervals for the component delays, so that the time separation between i and j is guaranteed to be no greater than a specified bound. We give a polynomial time method to solve it, and explain how it is useful for relaxing some bounds associated to some component delays while preserving the global separation time from i to j.

The direct problem of time separation of events has received considerable atten- tion in the literature (see, e.g. [5] for an extensive survey). Even in the case of acyclic timing constraint graphs, the direct problem is NP-complete [12]. Many researchers have thus proposed polynomial-time approximating algorithms, which give an upper approximation of the maximal separation time. In contrast here, the time generated will be guaranteed to be the exact maximal time (for a pos- sibly restricted domain of component delays, however). Other researchers have replaced some of the bound values by parameters, then have computed the exact solution space using exponential-time procedures (e.g., Fourier-Motzkin elimination or Presburger-based procedures [2])). A variant of this approach has been proposed using additional techniques of abstract interpretation [9] or parametric reachability analysis [8].

Note that checking the unsatisfiability of system (4) is exponential in the num- ber N of events, due to the presence of min and max constraints in (2)-(3) (The general problem is indeed NP-complete; see, e.g. [4]). We loose therefore the polynomial-time complexity result of the basic method. Still, this enhancement turns out to be useful in practice.
