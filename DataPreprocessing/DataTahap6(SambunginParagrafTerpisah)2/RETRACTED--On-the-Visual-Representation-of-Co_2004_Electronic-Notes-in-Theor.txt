Graphs are usually associated with intuitions and illustrations, not with rig- orous proofs. Visual representations are allowed in the context of discovery, not in the context of justification, in which empirical justifications have used for graphs instead of analytical justification. Thus, there are several mistakes related to the use of graphs, one of them being the reliance on graphs to guide the logic in the construction of proofs instead of the axioms [5]. This implies that the use of pictures is a flaw in a formal system. R. Bardohl et al. [2], Is- abel Luengo [1] and Miller [4] have shown that the problem is not with graphs, but with having bad semantics and syntax. They have also determined that a graph-based reasoning system can be built for graphs, with formal semantics, syntax and rules of inference, and that it is a sound system, meaning that no fallacies can be derived from it. The fallacies in graphs arise from the fact that the accidental features of the graph are taken to represent features. This is why a system with clear syntax and semantics will help make fallacies impossible.

C6.1. Any row (column) or mroute may be erased; any section or semi-section of a row (column) may be erased; and any cell that is not an intersection of mroute or of one row and column and is not on a section may be erased. If an mroute is erased, any marking that marks it must also be erased.
