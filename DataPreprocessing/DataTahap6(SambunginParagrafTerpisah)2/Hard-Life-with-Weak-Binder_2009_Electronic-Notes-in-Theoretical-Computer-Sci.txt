A further contribution is a trace inclusion preorder  for weakly bound processes: when p  q, the traces of p are included in those of q. We compare this preorder with a trace inclusion preorder for strongly bound processes. Preorders of processes are a relevant and non-trivial aspect of subtyping/subeffecting for type and effect systems [1]. Also, thay can be udes to study the compliance of contracts with implementations and subcontract relations in calculi for Web services [5,6].

We shall now introduce a preorder p N q on weakly bound processes. Here, we use a set of names N as an index to the preorder relation. This index is needed to avoid name confusion, as we shall see below. When p N q holds, then the semantics of p is included in that of q (second item of Theorem. 5.7).
