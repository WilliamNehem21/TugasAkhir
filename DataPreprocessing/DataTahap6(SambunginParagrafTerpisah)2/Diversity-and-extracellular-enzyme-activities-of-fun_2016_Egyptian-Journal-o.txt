endophytes have been explored for diverse applications owing to their production of extracellular enzymes [9]. The enzymes function so as to obtain nutrition from their host, hydrolyze food substances and are involved in eliciting defense mecha- nisms against pathogens [10]. There is an imperative need to discover and utilize diverse novel enzymes with high stabil- ity for industrial processes. The present work aims to examine the diversity of endophytic fungal assemblages and their ability to produce extracellular enzymes in selected plants.
