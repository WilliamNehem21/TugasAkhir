This paper is organized as follows. Our proposed method is reported in the next section. In Section 3, the experimental re- sults of our proposed method and other existing methods are presented and compared fairly. Section 4 contains our con- cluding remarks.

has different position. In the left segment of gray scale shows that the proposed method has a highest PSNR values and lowest MSE, AMBE values. Moreover, it can be seen that the PSNR values decrease when we move away from the left of gray scale and there is an increase in the MSE and AMBE values.
