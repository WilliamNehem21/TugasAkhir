In example (1), only communication happens. In the next two examples, both mobility and communication take place. A careful observation reveals that (2) and (4) use different sorts of mobility, which we call one-dimensional mobility and two-dimensional mobility respectively. In (2), all locations are always located on the same level, no location nesting being permitted, while in (4), ambient n becomes a subambient of m after its movement.
