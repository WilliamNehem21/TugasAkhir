Generality. The definition, as stated, is specialised to simple graphs. Yet, the underlying concept is quite robust and can be stated mutatis mutandis for other kinds of graphical structures: multigraphs, directed graphs (bi-rank-width), hy- pergraphs, Petri nets etc. This suggests that the fundamental theory ought to be done in a more general setting.

Fix a ring R (e.g. the integers); this is the source for the entries of our matrices, which we will not explicitly reference during the development in order to reduce the number of subscripts. We use r, s to range over R.

group. Next, if [K] = [L] then K + KT = L + LT . Since K and L are upper triangular, they clearly agree in all non diagonal entries. The ith diagonal entry of K +KT = L+LT is 2Kii = 2Lii. Using the additional assumption on R, Kii = Lii.2
