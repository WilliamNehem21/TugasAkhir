mit the inclusion of quantum components. This extension permits a compositional description of quantum protocols, in which quantum components interact with clas- sical finite state components. In our view, the inclusion of explicit components of finite state classical control adds conceptual clarity and precision to quantum pro- tocols.

Qubit automata are a C-automata with state space C2 which singly, or combined, form quantum automata. We will describe three particular qubit automata which will need for our discussion of teleportation. One of the qubit automata is a quantum automaton; the others will be combined to form a 2 qubit quantum automaton.
