The arrival of massive amount of expression data puts the emphasis on com- putational methods to overcome the difficulties of interpretation of experimental data. Instead of providing a clear explanation of biological systems, data reveals the difficulty for analyzing them. The variety of components and their interacting capabilities lead to cope with their complexity. This opens a field of modeling to investigate computational biological systems.

The paper is organized as follows: section 2 gives the basics of BRN. The core of the paper is in section 3 where we give a formal semantics for BRN. In section 4 we show on a small example how to use the tool HyTech [2] to analyze a BRN.
