We show that, surprisingly perhaps, the particular discounting used in [8] is in fact very close to the original ideas of Shapley. This observation allows to realize that the specific discounting of [8] suffers in fact from some needless restrictions. We advocate that dropping the constraints imposed in [8] leads to a more general and elegant theory that includes parity and mean payoff games as particular limit cases.

Thus uparity(p) is either 0 or 1 depending on the parity of the maximal one day payoff visited infinitely often 6 . Although there are many apparent similarities between mean payoff and parity games, especially in the deterministic case, [4,15], the exact relation between these two types of games remained elusive. In part at least this was due to the absence of appropriate discounted parity games. In fact, one of the most striking features of mean payoff games is the possibility of approximating them by discounted games. Therefore it seems that, unless we find discounted counterpart for parity games, the analogies between parity and mean payoff games should be considered as superfluous.
