The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an introduction to BPMN; an introduction to CSP [14] and Z [20], which are used throughout this paper, is given in the Appendix. In Section 3 gives an overview of our syntactic description of BPMN. Section 4 describes briefly our relative timed semantics. In Section 5 we show some properties relating the timed and untimed models based on CSP refinements, and revisit the example to show how the relative-timed model one outgoing transition. It takes a unique name for identifying the activity. In the environment of the timed semantic model, each atomic task must take a positive amount of time to complete. A bpmn state describes a subprocess state. It is a

We have implemented the semantics described in this paper as a prototype tool us- ing the functional programming language Haskell. Readers may find a copy of the implementation from our web site 3 . The tool inputs a XML serialised representa- tion of BPMN diagram from the JViews BPMN Modeler [9], enriched with timing information as custom properties, and translates it into an ASCII file containing CSP processes representing its behaviours expressed in machine-readable CSP [14].

The following are some results of the timed model. We say a diagram is timed if it contains timing information and untimed otherwise; every timed diagram is a timed variant of another untimed diagram, i.e. an untimed diagram augmented with timing information. Below is an intuitive property about timed variation.

not be directly applicable to the business process developers whereas our definition captures the six-dimensional space defined by W3C standards [21, Section 3.2.6]. Also unlike BPMN, their target graphical notations and hence their semantic models are not designed for analyses of collaborations where more than one diagram is under consideration. Furthermore, our semantic model has been defined in correspondence to our earlier untimed model [16] so that timed-independent behavioural properties may be preserved across both models.
