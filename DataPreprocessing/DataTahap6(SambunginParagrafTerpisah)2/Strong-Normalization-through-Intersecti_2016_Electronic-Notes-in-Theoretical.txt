The converse can be simply shown by using the Weighted Subject Reduction property. Notice that similar results for idempotent intersection type systems cannot be proved in a combinatorial way, they are typically based on reducibility arguments [31,17,25]. This is exactly the place where the quantitative approach by means of non-idempotent types makes the difference.
