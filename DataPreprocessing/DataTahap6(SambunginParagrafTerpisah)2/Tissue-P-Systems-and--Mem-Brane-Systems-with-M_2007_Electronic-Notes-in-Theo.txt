We investigate tissue P systems with (non-restricted, symmetric) versions of mate and drip operations and prove that such systems are computationally complete with the minimal number of two cells when working on strings. Moreover, we consider the variant of scattered context tissue P systems with mate and drip operations and show a similar computational completeness result with using at most four cells during any computation. In all cases, the corresponding results for (mem)brane systems are established, too.

Recently, some attempts have been made to combine the various models in the area of membrane systems (P systems, e.g., see [12], [15]), where the objects are found in the regions enclosed by the membranes, and of brane calculi [4], where the ob- jects are found on the membranes (e.g., see [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [11], [13]). We here follow this research line by investigating tissue P systems with the brane operations mate and drip; in fact, we shall consider non-restricted, symmetric variants of the mate and drip operations (as already suggested in [1]). A closer look shows that the (mem)brane systems investigated in [1] are only of depth 2, i.e., elementary membranes are placed in the skin membrane. Hence, these systems could also be interpreted as tissue P systems where the skin membrane corresponds to the en- vironment. Having this interpretation in mind, we can immediately establish the

After some preliminary definitions, we will present our definitions for tissue P systems with mate and drip operations. First, we shall consider such systems working with multisets placed on the membranes of the cells, yet due to the direct correspondence of these systems with those investigated in [1], the main (computa- tional completeness) results for these systems can directly be taken over from the proofs given there. Hence, in the rest of the paper we focus on tissue P systems with mate and drip operations working on strings placed on the membranes of the cells, and we show that these systems are computationally complete (i.e., they can generate any recursively enumerable string language) with the minimal number of two cells occurring at most during any computation; a similar result, but with using at most four cells, is established for the variant with scattered contexts. Some open questions and further remarks conclude the paper.

Following the notations of [1], in the model of (mem)brane systems these op- erations have the following meaning: (u|a, b|v; x) fuses a membrane carrying the multiset sua and the membrane carrying the multiset bvw into one cell which then has the multiset suxvw, i.e., ab is replaced by x and the remaining multisets are taken as they are. In fact, this means that from the two membranes [ ]sua and [ ]bvw we get the membrane [ ]suxvw . In our model of tissue P systems with mate and drip operations this means that from the two cells [ ]sua and [ ]bvw we get the cell

The drip operation (u|c|v; y, z) in the model of (mem)brane systems splits a membrane [ ]sucvw into the two membranes [ ]suy and [ ]zvw where s and w are arbitrary splits of the remaining objects except those specified in the drip rule (i.e., u, c, v). In the model of tissue P systems this means that the cell [ ] sucvw is split into the two cells [ ] suy and [ ]zvw.

erations considered in [1] by just replacing the initial multiset of cells [ ] w1 ,... , [ ] wn by the corresponding multiset of membranes [ ]w1 , ..., [ ]wn embedded in the skin membrane (which only carries the empty multiset and can never be involved in a

ing string and need not be directly connected to a and b, respectively (hence, we use the notion scattered context). The same holds true for the contexts u and v at the left and at the right of the cutting site c in the drip rule (u|c|v; y, z) ,i.e., for the scattered context variant the drip rule is interpreted as follows: applying the drip operation (u|c|v; y, z) to [ ] s1us2cw1vw2 yields the two cells [ ] s1 us2y and [ ] zw1vw2 .
