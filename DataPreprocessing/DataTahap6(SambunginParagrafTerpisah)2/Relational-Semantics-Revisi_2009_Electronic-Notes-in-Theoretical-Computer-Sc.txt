Using this syntax, one may express nondeterminism (using the if ... fi construct), infinite nondeterminism (using x:=?, meaning that x is assigned an arbitrary nat- ural number), and iteration (using do ... od). E and B are expressions and Boolean expressions, respectively. As a (non-essential) simplification, we assume that the evaluation of an expression in a state never leads to an error. Errors may be introduced explicitly by the abort command, implicitly by non-applicable if instance, the very involved calculation of the maximal fixpoint of the example given on page 175 of [8] may be compared with the function N 2, coming from the present paper (which is actually continuous, although we have neither proved nor used this fact in this paper). When applied to the same example, N 2 yields stability of approximation after only two steps from the empty relation as starting point, using a much easier calculation. Nevertheless, it might be possible and interesting to conduct a study similar to the one in the present paper, using the union and intersection operators as parameters.

This holds in all cases, as opposed to the usual Smyth ordering, where the set of valid total correctness formulae pertaining to c1 is a subset of those pertaining to c2, provided c1 approximates c2 (i.e., the logical characterisation is monotonic).
