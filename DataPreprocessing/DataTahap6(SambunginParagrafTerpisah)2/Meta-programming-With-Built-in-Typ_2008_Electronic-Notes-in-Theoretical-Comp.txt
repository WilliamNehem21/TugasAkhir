This example demonstrates type-preserving syntax-to-syntax transformations between object-language programs. Substitution, which we shall develop in the remainder of this paper, is one such transformation. Furthermore, a correct im- plementation of substitution can be used to build more syntax-to-syntax trans- formations: we shall provide an implementation of big-step semantics that uses substitution.
