Example 3.16 Let  be a Kripke model representing the behaviour of a local network in a business office. Suppose that, in this network, there are three com- puters and two printers, managed by a common server. For a restricted analysis of  with respect only to the printing protocols, we may assume that all that the employees of the office do at the computers is to print documents.

This interplay between interleaving and synchronization can then be used to describe a fairly large group of games. A recent paper [17] also works with this idea that concurrency operators can be used to model simultaneous games. The authors use CPDL [15] as a stepping stone to build a concurrent dynamic game logic. However, since CPDL does not admit communication, their logic also has that limitation. As the generalization from CPDL to channel-CPDL has as drawbacks the loss of decidability and the loss of a complete axiomatization, our logic may be better suited for the generalization of the logic presented in [17] to deal with simultaneous games with communication, as we briefly illustrated.
