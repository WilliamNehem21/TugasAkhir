Asia [1,2]. Moreover, the Northeast region of India is consid- ered as a biodiversity hotspot for flora and fauna, particularly of economically important microbes, that are yet to be ex- plored [3]. The fish and meat are the important source of food across the world. The ethnic people of Assam traditionally used as probiotic bacteria in procurement of yogurt and cheese [20]. The microbiota of fermented fish and meat, the ethnic food of Assam, India is almost next to untouched. Thus, an attempt was made to identify potent indigenous probiotic candidate in traditionally prepared fermented fish and meat products through a comprehensive approach which would originally con- sider the safety features of the strain and potential application of the isolated strain and finally its ability to survive through the entire GIT in order to deliver the health benefits.

Chemicals and consumables used in the study were pur- chased from Merck India Pvt. Ltd., and all the microbiological media were purchased from HiMedia India Pvt. Ltd. Bacterial growth was monitored at 600 nm wave length using UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800, Japan). Centrifuga- tions were carried out in Sigma 3-30K centrifuge, Germany.
