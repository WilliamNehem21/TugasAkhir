An important (though somewhat hidden) point in the definition of a Type-2 ma- chine is that its output tape be one-way; compare e.g. [21, top of p.15]. This condition allows to abort a real number computation as soon as the desired preci- sion is reached, knowing that this preliminary approximation will not be reverted. It also is crucial for the Main Theorem to hold.
