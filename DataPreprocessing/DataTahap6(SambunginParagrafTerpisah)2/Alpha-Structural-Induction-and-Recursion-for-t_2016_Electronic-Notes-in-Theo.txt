Inductive types can be introduced as usual, i.e. by enumeration of their con- structors, but they can be parameterised in objects of other types. Because of the latter it is said that type theory features families of types (indexed by a base type) or dependent types.

Because of the preceding feature, type theory can be interpreted as a construc- tive logic. Specifically, this is achieved by representing propositions as inductive types whose constructors are the introduction rules, i.e. methods of direct proof, of the propositions in question.
