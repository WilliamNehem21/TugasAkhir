Traditional proof theory of Propositional Logic deals with proofs whose size can be huge. Proof theoretical studies discovered exponential gaps between normal or cut free proofs and their respective non-normal proofs. The use of proof-graphs, instead of trees or lists, for representing proofs is getting popular among proof-theoreticians. Proof-graphs serve as a way to study complexity of propositional proofs and to provide more efficient theorem provers, concerning size of propositional proofs.

We want to emphasize that the fpl-graphs put together information on formula graphs and R-nodes. To make it more transparent we can use different types of lines. In this way F-nodes and edges between them are used solid lines, whereas R- nodes and edges between them and adjacent premises and/or conclusions are used dashed lines and additionally delimiter nodes have been shaded.

The Lemma 2.5 below enables us to prove that a given graph G is a fpl-graph. Among others it says that we have to check that each node of G is of one of the possible types that generate the construction cases of Definition 2.2.

In this section, we describe the normalization process for fpl-graphs. Eliminating a maximal formula is very similar to the procedure for mimp-graphs described in [6], where we considered only the case of implication, now we define the maximal formulas in conjunction, disjunction and implication. The notion of reordering is provided as well, because when the maximal formula is removed a reordering of nodes occurs.

Proof. This characteristic of preservation of the premises and conclusions of the derivation is proved naturally. Through an inspection of each elimination of maxi- mal formula is observed that the reduction step (see Definition 3.4) of the fpl-graph does not change the set of premises and conclusions (indicated by the D-nodes H and C) of the derivation that is being reduced.
