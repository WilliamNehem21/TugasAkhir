[1] report that between 75-80% of students are visual learners. Most students will retain more information when it is presented with visual elements (pictures, diagrams, flowcharts, etc). In programming, visual learners can benefit from creat- ing diagrams of problem solutions (e.g., flowcharts) before coding. Similarly, visual representations of data structure states should help in data structure understand- ing. Thus, it would be beneficial to have a tool that enables students to visualize both the conceptual and the implementation aspects of data-structures.

We surveyed over 21 tools that are used for the purpose of data structure vi- sualization [5] and found that most tools (more than 14 in our survey) focused on conceptual understanding. We found that only 7 implementation level tools were available to help students during program comprehension and debugging activities. None of these implementation tools fulfilled all of our goals, viz.,

During execution, Java programs will usually create a variety of objects from both user and library classes. Since these objects only exist during execution, being able to visualize them in a meaningful way can be an important element of program comprehension. Although this visualization can be done mentally for simple objects, most programmers can benefit from seeing more tangible representations of complex objects while the program is running.
