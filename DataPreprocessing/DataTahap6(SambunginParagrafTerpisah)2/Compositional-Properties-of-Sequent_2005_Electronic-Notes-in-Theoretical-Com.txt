Because the complexity of large systems is normally uncontrollable, it is necessary that a method for developing such systems is compositional (verti- cally or horizontally) in order to avoid combinatorial explosion in specifying and verifying them, e.g. [10,19,3,2,16,4,5,15]. The compositional method al- lows one to build up a large system by composing existing systems with the defined constructors and reduce the problem of correctness for a complex sys- tem to similar and simpler correctness problems for the subsystems.

which we denote by the process P , for one production step. If there is a car available for P then P will either get the car, adjust the motor, mount the windscreen, control the car, and put the car on the conveyer band or P will get the car, mount the windscreen, adjust the motor, control the car, and put it back. Then P may start again. The first option can be specified by

[4,5] studied the compositionality of a choppy logic [22], which is an ex- tension of classic propositional temporal logic [21] (PTL for short) by intro- ducing a chop operator. [15] defined a modal process logic which has com- positionality. But the logic can only express regular properties of processes.
