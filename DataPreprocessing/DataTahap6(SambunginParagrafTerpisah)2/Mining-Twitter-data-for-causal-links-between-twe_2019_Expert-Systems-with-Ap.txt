Identifying customer feedback could enable enterprise deci- sion makers to understand feedback that leads to positive or negative consumer experiences (Chang, Chou, Wu, & Wu, 2017; Lim & Tucker, 2017). Customer feedback extraction methods from textual data are an emerging field. Wang, Youn, Azarm, and Kannan (2011) propose a systematic method that extracts cus- tomer data for product design selection based on web-based user- generated content. Yan, Xing, Zhang, and Ma (2015) develop a novel method that ranks candidate terms in online customer re- views in order to automatically elicit enterprise attributes that in- terest customers. Recently, a sentiment analysis and a case ana- logical reasoning model have been proposed for extracting enter- prise attributes and latent customer needs from online consumer reviews (Zhou, Jiao, & Linsey, 2015).

and product market adoption in order to predict product sales. Nguyen, Shirai and Velcin (2015) analyze sentiment of the top- ics, which are extracted from social media networks using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), for stock market prediction. Ho, Damien, Gu, and Konana (2017) investigate a potential dynamic relationship between sentiment expressed on social media networks and future stock returns.

time series are stationary in each sub-interval in this work (see Section 3.2) (Liu & Bahadori, 2012). A time lag L is not set to zero, because (1) it is known that a time delay in enterprise outcome re- sponses (e.g., stock price responses) to news or events exists (Hou & Moskowitz, 2005) and (2) this research is used for predicting fu-
