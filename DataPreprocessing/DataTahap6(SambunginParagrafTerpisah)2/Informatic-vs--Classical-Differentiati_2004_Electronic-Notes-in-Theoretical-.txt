at which the content of the output changes with respect to the content of the input. This, for instance, can be used to record how quickly a selfmap converges to a fixed point, and sheds light on whether a fixed point is a local attractor or not. These ideas have been used to study the complexity of algorithms [5] and in the search for fixed points and zeros of functions [4].
