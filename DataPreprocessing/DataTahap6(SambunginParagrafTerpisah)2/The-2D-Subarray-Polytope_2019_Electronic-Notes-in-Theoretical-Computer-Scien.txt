A slightly more general version of the problem has also been studied under a poly- hedral approach in [9] and in [11]. In the former, the authors analyze new lower bounds on the optimal cover size based on the fractional solution of the linear pro- gramming relaxation of the proposed formulation. The latter discusses two integer programming models for the rectangle cover of a convex polygon.

Although sub-cubic, these algorithms may not be of practical use when m and n are close to real-sized images. Furthermore, in a column generation environment we need not solve the column generation problem to optimality, since a column with a negative reduced cost suffices to continue with the procedure. Hence, fast heuristics may be useful for this problem and, in particular, linear programming- based heuristics (e.g., rounding heuristics) may be of interest. Due to these facts, we are interested in an integer-programming based approach for the maximum subarray problem for d = 2.

The associated polytope may be regarded as a two-dimensional version of the full interval vectors polytope, i.e., the convex hull of vectors in {0, 1}n having consecutive ones. The corresponding polytope has been studied in [6] and the results therein have inspired some of the results in the current work.
