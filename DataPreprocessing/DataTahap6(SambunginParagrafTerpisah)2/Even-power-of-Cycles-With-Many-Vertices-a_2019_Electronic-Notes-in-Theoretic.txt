and O represents the graphs where both problems are unknown. The row k = 2 is fully solved, due to [3]. The rows k = 3 and k = 4 are fully solved, due to [1]. The column 2k + 1 consists of complete graphs, since 2k + 1 is odd, the graphs are Type 1 [15]. The column 2k + 2 is fully solved, due to [15]. The TCC was proved for the columns 2k +3 to 2k + 5, due to [15]. The TCC was proved for even n, due to [4]. The TCC was proved for Ck, with n = r(2k + 1)+ k and r > 0, due to [3]. Note that this result also proves the TCC for some specific values of odd n. The graphs Ck, with n = r(2k + 1) and r > 0, are Type 1, due to [3].

graphs is fully classified with respect to total coloring by using the conformable condition: the Type 1 complete graphs Kn are precisely the conformable ones, i.e., the graphs Kn with n mod 2 = 1. However, the conformable condition does not characterize the Type 1 cycle graphs, as there are conformable cycle graphs that are Type 2, for example, graph C7.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we define operations and op- erators that are used in Section 3 to present a threshold for a even-power of cycle graph to be Type 1. In Section 4 we present a framework to decompose a power of cycle graph into a set of smaller power of cycle graphs. In Section 5 we present our conclusions and possible further directions and applications of the developed tools.
