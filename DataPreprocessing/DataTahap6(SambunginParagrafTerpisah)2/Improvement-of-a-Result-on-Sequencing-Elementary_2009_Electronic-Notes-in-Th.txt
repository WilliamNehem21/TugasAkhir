Cellular automata (CAs) are discrete dynamical systems where, for each itera- tion, the component units of a regular lattice are updated synchronously through the action of a local transition rule. Typically, these components (or cells) are identical finite automata, organised in a single pattern of connections to other neighbouring cells, quite often under periodic boundary conditions. A transition rule provides the next state of each cell, according to the current state of the cell itself and the cell states of its neighbourhood.
