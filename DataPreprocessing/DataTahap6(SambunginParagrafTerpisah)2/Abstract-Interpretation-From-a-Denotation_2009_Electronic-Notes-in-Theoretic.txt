Abstract interpretation and denotational semantics share foundations and appli- cations, and the interaction between the two areas is intricate. The inverse-limit construction and its associated Scott-topology show how to derive abstract domains as structural approximations of inverse-limit-defined Scott-domains. The inductive format of denotational semantics definitions ensures the soundness of the resulting abstract interpretation, where abstract domain replaces Scott-domain. In this man- ner, abstract interpretation can be explained from the perspective of denotational semantics.
