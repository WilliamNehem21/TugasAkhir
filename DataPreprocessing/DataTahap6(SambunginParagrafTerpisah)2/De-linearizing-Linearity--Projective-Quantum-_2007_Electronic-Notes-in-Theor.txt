Next we consider additive types which distribute over the tensor, from which measurements can be build, and the correctness proofs of the protocols discussed in [2] carry over to the resulting weaker setting. A full probabilistic calculus is obtained when the trace is moreover linear and satisfies the diagonal axiom, which brings us to a second main result, characterization of the necessary and sufficient additive structure of a both qualitatively and quantitatively effective categorical quantum formalism without redundant global phases. Along the way we show that if in a category a (additive) monoidal tensor distributes over a strongly compact closed tensor, then this category is always enriched in commutative monoids.

Hence it indeed suffices for the ortho-structure to be limited to assuring coherent coexistence of the pseudo-projections with the SCCC structure since for all the other qualitative uses of the biproduct structure in [2] we can as well use the freely added product structure which does not genuinely interact with the SCCC structure. Conclusively, we decomposed the additives in a fundamental structural component, namely the ortho-structure, and, a classical branching structure, which can be freely added as a product structure. This classical branching structure can of course be of a more sophisticated nature than the one we used here, for example one might want to capture classical mixing, but the bottom line is that it can be introduced on top of the ortho- SCCC structure and hence is not an intrinsic ingredient.
