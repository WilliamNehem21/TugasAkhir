The IoT has its own set of firmware difficulties. These gadgets appear to function mystically, but they are the result of a collection of numerous different microprocessors within each one. These specialized micro- processors serve a variety of purposes: some are for graphics, others offer a fast and connected response to your input, and others support AI for intelligent capabilities and other tasks. Each has its firmware layer (software written specifically for each piece of hardware) and may run on multiple operating systems. The firmware allows a device to fulfill its intended duties and ensures the proper operation of a range of physical components. The device kernel, the file system, which stores specific files essential for device performance, and the bootloader, which is responsible for initializing important hardware components and assigning the necessary resources, are examples of such components.

Son et al. (2019) [4] secured the stability of the firmware, the au- thors suggested a novel firmware administration architecture based on Blockchain and the Inter-Planetary File System. However, because IoT device version control and URL authenticity cannot be assured, IoT devices can now get firmware updates and updates over Blockchain networks. The suggested approach allows for secure firmware trans- mission and updates, and the security level of IoT devices is projected to improve. According to the findings, secure firmware delivery and up- dates are conceivable, and IoT device security standards are predicted to improve.

Remote firmware upgrades on IoT devices result in periodic device failure and performance deterioration. To upload the updated code with updates or corrections and re-install the gadget on the field, the gadget needed physical access to a computer. Companies, on the other hand, will find this approach to be extremely inefficient and unscalable. Over- the-air firmware updates, on the other hand, offer a unique technique to upgrade linked devices without interfering with them, remotely and consistently. Thakur et al. (2019) [5] developed a scheme for updating the firmware of various IoT devices over the internet.

The identification of harmful code in firmware, susceptibility min- ing, backdoor finding, and copyright protection can all benefit from similarity and homology analyses of firmware codes in IoT terminals. To examine the topic of code resemblance and homology analysis, Zhu et al. (2020) [6] concentrated on code categorization and qualitative char- acterization of code aspects. The authors took an information-centric approach to firmware development, concentrating on firmware stabil- ity, anti-variability, and heritability. By analyzing the gene length be- tween the codes, this study demonstrated a security detection solution for IoT terminal firmware. The results of the experiments reveal that this technique has a decent search pairing effect and has certain benefits over previous similarity theory-based firmware security investigative techniques.

Zhu et al. (2019) [7] introduced a unique dynamic analysis approach for detecting memory corruption issues in IoT device firmware packages that are lightweight. The main aim was to fuzz the binary program code while dynamically running them using symbolic execution. The authors created a prototype, and the findings revealed that the suggested framework could perform the Fuzzing test in an average of 40 s. In all, the framework loaded and evaluated lightweight IoT firmware in 210 s, including 170 s for static analysis. The usefulness was demonstrated when it was applied to 115 firmware images from 17 vendors and identified that 35 of them had memory opportunities for corruption, all of which were zero-day flaws.

sensor. On an ATmega1284P chip, the authors examined the concept of a secure firmware upgrading mechanism. To show the attack vector of the developed countermeasure, as well as the potential pitfalls found by this approach, as these problems may emerge during the deployment by other companies.

Jang et al. (2020) [10] investigated the behavior and vulnerabilities of Avatar and Firmadyne IoT firmware. While most analysis tools run firmware in a simulated space, there are several concerns to consider, ranging from whether firmware can be run to data gathering. The au- thors created a dynamic analytical model that can be used on IoT devices immediately. A dynamic analysis methodology based on S-Trace that operates on IoT architectures like MIPS and MIPSEL was presented, demonstrating that IoT vulnerabilities may be assessed effectively.

Wang et al. (2021) [11] presented a technique for scalable and smart firmware analysis. This technique examines over forty different firm- ware file system designs, summarizes, and retrieves file system charac- teristics, and creates a firmware feature repository. This solution can suit the demands of popular devices in terms of firmware analysis and se- curity analysis. The suggested approach was tested on over 100 different types of genuine device firmware to ensure its usefulness. Passing our

SUIT, a new IETF specification for secure IoT firmware upgrades. On several restricted commercial off-the-shelf IoT devices, we test the per- formance of our solution. The authors concluded that for IoT devices with less than 32 KB of RAM and 128 kB of flash memory, it is viable to provide a safe, standards-compliant automatic update system that em- ploys cutting-edge security.

Ahmed et al. (2020) [15] presented a scalable approach to verify the security of IoT firmware against the Mirai threat in this research paper. The authors put the proposed method to the test by statically analyzing over 1200 current firmware images to see how resistant they are to the Mirai botnet. According to the findings, the Mirai virus is present in 193 out of over 1200 firmware images. The authors tested this approach against a range of IoT device firmware images to get successful results. In comparison to other alternatives, the research determined that the approach is more extensible, less costly, and proactive.

The security concerns with Internet protocol cameras were the main topic of this study by Almazrouei et al. (2023) [19]. To help businesses and security specialists forecast attacker behavior and secure the sys- tems, a deeper investigation of IP camera vulnerabilities and their impact on user security and privacy was conducted. The goal of this study was to investigate and identify the security and privacy flaws related to an IP camera. To do this, a direct inspection of the camera was conducted. A VAVA Outdoor Wireless IP Security Cam that was used as a home security camera was put to the test in a real-world setting. For this, data was acquired from a variety of online sources, and after that, the

The first step of the security analysis is selecting an IoT device. The authors decided to experiment and analyze commonly found Smart IoT camera devices in homes. One such device is the fully-featured sur- veillance smart IoT D-Link DCS-5020L wireless network camera [21]. This IoT device works day & night and offers several features like wide view range, 4x digital zoom, motion detection, pan and 120-degree tilt, mobile app, and web browser access for remote access. The device also has a built-in wireless extender to expand Wi-Fi coverage up to 8 m.

randomness or uncertainty in a system. In the context of IoT firmware, entropy could refer to the randomness or unpredictability of the data being transmitted, the complexity of the firmware code, or the degree of randomness in the inputs to the firmware. To mathematically define entropy, we can use the concept of information entropy, which is a measure of the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a message or system. Information entropy is often represented by the symbol H and is typically defined as the negative sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes multiplied by the algorithm of those probabilities:

firmware, vulnerabilities that, if exploited, could lead to breaches of privacy. By identifying and addressing these issues, society can better safeguard its right to privacy in an increasingly connected world. Moreover, the research contributes significantly to enhancing cyberse- curity awareness and preparedness. As IoT cameras become more inte- grated  into  our  homes,  they  become  attractive  targets  for

cybercriminals. Vulnerabilities in firmware can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and even the use of these devices in large-scale cyberattacks. By conducting a forensic analysis and security assess- ment of IoT camera firmware, this research not only helps protect in- dividual homes but also contributes to the collective cybersecurity resilience of society.

Additionally, the societal context includes issues of trust and accountability. Manufacturers and service providers play a pivotal role in the deployment of IoT devices. Through this research, the account- ability of these entities in ensuring the security and privacy of their products is highlighted. It encourages responsible practices in the IoT industry and fosters trust between consumers and technology providers. Lastly, the significance of this research extends to its role in shaping future technological developments. Identifying weaknesses in current

Though IoT deployments are increasing across a variety of sectors, most IoT devices do not have a built-in secure firmware upgrading mechanism. Critical security flaws cannot be addressed without such a mechanism, and IoT devices can become a permanent problem, as proven by recent large-scale hacks. IoT security cameras employ het- erogeneous, closed-source firmware focused on business but not secu- rity, whereas with the edge, resources are finite, and reusability is common. Manufacturers and developers should check their compliance preparedness when developing firmware and after it has been deployed. Companies may measure compliance preparedness to standards and regulations across sectors by conducting comprehensive firmware implementation analysis and monitoring.
