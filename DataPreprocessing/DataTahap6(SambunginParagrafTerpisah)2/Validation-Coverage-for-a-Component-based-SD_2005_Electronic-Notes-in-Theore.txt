adopting an exhaustive exploration algorithm. Therefore, the validation of a large system like the SCA needs to measure the actual amount of verification activity performed. We can transfer to the validation of an SDL model the concept of coverage, which is widely used in the area of software testing to measure the percentage of the system which has been exercised by the per- formed tests: particular structures of a program are chosen as the unit of coverage, so that the notion of statement coverage, branch coverage, condition coverage, etc. . . are commonly used.

environment (signals StateOfDrt ) up to the FiltrateDrt process. The signals which need to be added in the new scenario are drawn as dashed lines. These guidelines can apply provided we know the communication semantics both of the new component, and of the existing ones: this is possible if we know the internal structure of the component, or if we have the MSCs describing all its possible behaviours; the latter is applicable only for small components. More- over, we can note that the closer the added component is to the starting point of the processing chain, the lesser the coverage will result in the regression validation, since the MSC will be violated very soon; however, in this case the reuse of the MSCs will result less expensive, since fewer changes will be applied from the new component backwards to the environment.
