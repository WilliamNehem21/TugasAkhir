Summarizing the above discussion, we find that the relation between au- tomata theory and (modal) logic has been investigated intensively and suc- cessfully, but not uniformly or systematically. Various modal languages have been developed uniformly for coalgebras of arbitrary type, but none of these languages admits explicit fixed point operators. And lastly, we see that cer- tain kinds of automata have been studied from a coalgebraic perspective, but automata for arbitrary coalgebras have not been developed. It thus seems that there is a clear gap here, and it is precisely this gap that we intend to start filling with this paper.

F-automata are supposed to operate on pointed F-coalgebras. A pointed F- coalgebra is a pair (S, s) such that S is an F-coalgebra and s is an element of the (underlying set of) S. Basically, the idea is that the F-automaton will either accept or reject a given pointed F-coalgebra. The best way to express

The reader may not have recognized his or her favorite, or at least familiar, type of automaton in Definition 3.1. In particular, the transition function or relation of standard automata operating on (infinite) words or trees take input from an alphabet or set of labels. Here we briefly indicate how this can easily be incorporated into our approach.

Before we can do anything interesting, there are some a few technicalities that we have to get out of the way. First, we need a Finiteness Lemma stating that the truth of a formula only depends on its free variables. We omit the proof for lack of space.

Remark 4.13 It also follows from standard fixed point theory that least and greatest fixed points of monotone operations on complete lattices (such as full power set algebras) can be approximated by ordinal unfoldings. Using this, there is a nice connection between our coalgebraic fixed point logic, and more standard coalgebraic logics.
