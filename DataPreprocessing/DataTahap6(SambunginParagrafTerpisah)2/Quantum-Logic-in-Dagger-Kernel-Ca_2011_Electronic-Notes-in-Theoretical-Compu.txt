The paper is organised as follows. After introducing the notion of dagger kernel category in Section 2, the main examples are described in Section 3. Factorisation and (co)images occur in Sections 4 and 5. Finally, Section 6 introduces the Sasaki hook and and-then connectives via adjunctions, and investigates Booleanness.

It remains an open question whether a similar construction can be performed for orthomodular lattices (see [13]), instead of Boolean algebras. The straightforward extension of the above construction does not work: in order to get kernels one needs to use the and-then connective (&, see Proposition 6.1) for composition; but & is neither associative nor commutative, unless the lattice is Boolean [15].
