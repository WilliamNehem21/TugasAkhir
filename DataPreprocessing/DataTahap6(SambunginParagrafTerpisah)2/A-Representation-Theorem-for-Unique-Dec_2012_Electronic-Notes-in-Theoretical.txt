By symmetric monoidal M-category, we mean an M-category with a symmetric monoidal structure on its underlying category. We do not assume that the sym- metric monoidal structure is compatible with the M-enrichment. For symmetric monoidal M-category C and D, a symmetric monoidal M-functor from C to D is an M-functor from C to D that is symmetric monoidal.
