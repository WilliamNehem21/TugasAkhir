Notation. The paper resorts to standard mathematical notation typically used in model-oriented specification methods, like Vdm [14], Z [27] or B [1]. We adopt, however, a pointfree specification style (as in, e.g., [9]) which leads to more con- cise descriptions and increased calculation power. The underlying mathematical universe is the category of sets and set-theoretic functions whose composition and

Central to our approach is the presence of a particular coordination connector, called the orchestrator, whose role is to manage the interactions among all other elements in the architectural network. In a sense, the orchestrator corresponds to an intermediary layer between components and ordinary connectors, i.e., it acts as a bridge among components and connectors.
