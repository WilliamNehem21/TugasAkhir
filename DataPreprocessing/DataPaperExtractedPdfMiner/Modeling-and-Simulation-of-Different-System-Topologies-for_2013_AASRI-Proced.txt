Abstract 
Power Quality enhancement in a distribution network is achieved by shunt compensation device known as  Distribution 
static  compensator  (DSTATCOM).In  this  paper,  three  different  system  topologies  for  Distribution  Static  Compensators 
(DSTATCOMs)  are  modeled  and  tested  using  Simulink’SimPowerSystem  Toolbox  for  power  system  quality  studies. 
Simulation  tests  on  a  distribution  system,  equipped  with  the  unbalanced  and  non-linear  load.  With  the  different  system 
topologies  of    Distribution  Static  Compensators  (DSTATCOMs)    it  is  observed  that  power  factor  can  be    improved  in 
supply  system.  The  DSTATCOM  controls  are  based  on  Synchronous  Reference  Frame  control.  The  modeled 
DSTATCOM topologies can be used to develop and test different, control strategies and methods for the DSTATCOM. 
These models can also aid instructors in teaching power quality courses.

1. Introduction 

Distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) is one of the power custom device that is used for Power 
Factor Improvement  on  source  side [1].  The  DSTATCOM  has  a  Six-leg Voltage-Sourced  Converter  (VSC) 
with Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) as  a switching element. Different studies have been performed

to evaluate the performance or propose control strategies for DSTATCOM to improve its performance [2-10]. 
Time domain simulations and /or practical experiments have been used to perform these studies.Time domain 
simulations have been shown to provide accurate prediction of the behaviour of Voltage-Sourced Converter 
(VSC)  based  FACTS  devices  [11].  There  are  many  packages  available  to  model  and  simulate  VSC  based 
FACTS devices such as EMTP, PSCAD, MATLAB/SIMULINK, PSIM. MATLAB/SIMULINK is the most 
widely  used  package  in  engineering  sciences  since  it  has  many  toolboxes  that  cover  all  engineering 
applications  [12].  This  paper  models  and  simulates  three  different  system  topologies  for  Distribution  static 
compensator  (DSTATCOM)  using  Simulink’SimPowerSystem  Toolbox.  The  DSTATCOM  topologies  are 
based on Synchronous Reference Frame (SRF) control [13].  
2. System Topologies for DSTATCOM  
There are different system topologies for the DSTATCOM.  Out of which, three are selected and used in this 
paper. The selected systems are: 

1- DSTATCOM with supply side-connected rectifier shown in Fig.1. (System 1)  
2- DSTATCOM with load-side-connected rectifier shown in Fig.2. (System 2)  
3- DSTATCOM with constant dc voltage shown in Fig.3.  (System 3) 
 The  load  which  has  been  selected  for  these  topologies  are  three  phase  unbalanced  R-L  load  and  diode 
rectifier as a nonlinear load. A step-up transformer for stepping up the voltage has been used in between the 
STATCOM and distribution system.

4. Simulation Results 

The three DSTATCOM topologies have been simulated for the power factor improvement mode. The total 

simulation period is 1.0 s. Based on the simulation results,the following analysis can be prepared: 

(1)The simulation results of sysem1 are depicted in Fig. 6. Load current is unbalanced and non-sinusoidal.  
Compensator current is sinusoidal in nature. The phase angle between source current and Terminal voltage are 
Zero degree. This ensure Power factor will be unity i.e. Power factor can be improved after the DSTATCOM 
is  switched  on.  The  dc  link  voltage  Vdc  as  shown  in  Fig  continues  to  increase  until  the  DSTATCOM  is 
switched on and finally reach the steady state value of 500V. It starts settling after 0.2 s. The dc voltage Vdc 
starts to build up on the dc capacitor Cdc.  

(2)The  simulation  results  of  sysem2  are  depicted  in  Fig.7.  The  waveform  of  Load  current,  Compensator 
current,  Source  current  and  Terminal  Voltage  are  same  as  in  Fig.6  but  the  magnitude  of  load  current  is  
comparatively increased. Power factor can be improved after the DSTATCOM is switched on. The DC link 
voltage  Vdc  exponentially  increasing  with  time  as  shown  in  Fig.  The  DC  link  voltage  is  not  maintained 
constant but tending towards the value of 250 V. 

(3)The  simulation  results  of  sysem3  are  depicted  in  Fig.8.  The  waveform  of  Load  current,  Compensator 
current, Source current and Terminal Voltage are same as in Fig. 6. Power factor can be improved after the 
DSTATCOM  is  switched  on.  The  DC  link  voltage  is  maintained  constant  at  500  V  before  and  after  the 
DSTATCOM  is  switched  on.  This  allows  the  DSTATCOM  to  improve  Power  Factor  with  almost  no 
interruption in the load current.

5. Conclusion 
This  paper  has  developed  models  for  different  system  topologies  of  the  Distribution  Static  Compensator 
(DSTATCOM)  using  Simulink’SimPowerSystem  Toolbox.  The  control  of  the  DSTATCOM  system 
topologies  is  based  on  Synchronous  Reference  Frame  control.  Time  domain  simulations  have  been  used  to 
verify the operation of these models. These models can be easily modified to:  
1- Perform different types of power quality studies in a user friendly simulation environment for teaching and 
researching.  
2- Test control strategies and methods for the DSTATCOM.   
3- Develop models for other system topologies of the DSTATCOM, which is not considered is this paper, by 
modifying the existing modeled topologies.
