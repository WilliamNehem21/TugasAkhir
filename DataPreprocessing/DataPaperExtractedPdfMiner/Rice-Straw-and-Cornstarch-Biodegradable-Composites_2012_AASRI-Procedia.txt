Abstract 

The main goal of this work was to use rice straw (RS) in the production of environmentally sound composites using corn 
based  adhesives  (CA).  Treatments  of  RS  with  NaOH  and  hot-water  were  undertaken  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  such 
treatments  on  the  performance  of  produced  composites.  The  influence  of  composite  density  and  starch  content  on 
properties  of  composites  was  also  investigated.  The  microstructure  of  fractured  surfaces  was  further  observed.  Results 
showed that cornstarch based composites had higher flexural strength. Composites made from hot-water treated straw and 
cornstarch had better interface and higher flexural strength, and flexural strength reached peak values at starch content of 
10%  and  composite  density  of  0.7  g/cm3.  Composites  made  from  non-treated  straw  and  cornstarch  had  lower  moisture 
absorption.  Moisture  absorption  was  increasing  with  starch  content  increasing  and  density  decreasing.  The  composites 
developed from this work may have potential application for ceiling panels and bulletin boards.

Using straw and other agricultural residues for preparation of composite materials has become the focus of 
world. But the crushed materials (e.g. straw powder, rice husk powder, husk powder or extracted straw fiber) 
of agricultural residues are the main materials of the composites [9-11], and using discarded tires, formaldehyde 
resins,  polymers  as  matrix  for  preparation  of  composite  [12-13].  Such  composite  materials  have  better  water 
resistance and acoustic insulation properties, higher internal bond strength and flexibility and flexural strength, 
bigger  fracture  coefficient.  But  smashing  agricultural  residues  and  extracting  fiber  from  straw  waste  lots  of 
energy, and the matrix of the composites is difficult to degrade.  

Energy saving and environmental protection  are the world's urgent request. This research used rice straw 
and  corn  starch  to  prepare  biodegradable  composite  materials,  and  focused  on  the  influence  of  composite 
density  and  starch  content  on  flexural  strength  and  effect  of  straw  treatments  on  moisture  absorption.  The 
microstructure of fractured surfaces was further observed. 

2. Material and Methods 

2.1. Materials and equipments 

Corn  starch  was  food  grade  starch,  Shandong  Jincheng  Food  Co.,  Ltd.  products.  Rice  straw  was  from 
Liuhe, Nanjing, previous year products. NaOH, AR (Analytical reagent); Na2S2O3, AR; borax, AR; 30%H2O2, 
AR; FeSO4·7H2O, AR, the reagents above mentioned were Nanjing Chemistry reagent Ltd. products.  

Pressing  equipment  was  XLB-DC  magnetic  plate  vulcanizing  machine,  Rubber  Machinery  Co.,  Ltd. 
Huzhou Shunli products. Performance testing machine was TMS-Pro, FTC products, US. Moisture absorption 
testing  instrument  was  HPX-16085  constant  temperature  and  moisture  case,  Shanghai  Xinmiao  Medical 
Treatment Ltd. products. Stereomicroscope was SMZ1000, Nikon Japan products. 

2.2.  Sample preparation 

RS was extensively washed with distilled water in order to remove impurities (mainly dust). This operation 
was performed several times at room temperature and under vigorous stirring. After successive washings, RS 
. This material was stored in hermetic plastic containers in order 
was dried in an air-circulated oven at 103
to prevent microbial attack (i.e. fungi) before using it in followed treatments. Washed RS without any further 
treatments was used as control and was labeled CRS. 

Some components of cellulose fibres represent a hydrophobic blockage for fibre wetting and they must be 
efficiently  removed  [14-15].  RS  is  rich  in  silica  and  waxes,  deteriorating  the  properties  and  making  RS 
unsuitable  for  textile  applications[15].  In  order  to  improve  the  RS  wettability  and  performance,  different 
treatments were applied. CRS was soaked in 2% NaOH solution, for 2 h at room temperature with occasional 
shaking  followed  by  washing  with  distilled  water  for  several  times  to  leach  out  the  absorbed  NaOH  until 
neutral was reached subsequently oven dried. The NaOH-treated CRS was labeled as NRS.  

CRS  was soaked in hot-water, for 2 h at 100

 followed by oven dried. The hot-water-treated CRS  was 

labeled as HRS. 

Cornstarch adhesives was prepared by the dispersion of the cornstarch (CS) powder in distilled water at a 
CS-to-water  ratio  1:10  under  stirring  at  room  temperature  for  2  h  with  1.2wt%  sodium  thiosulfate 
(Na2S2O3.5H2O) on dry basis of CS for preventing deterioration. The resultant adhesives were then ready to 
be mixed with RS. 

The composites were prepared using a hot compression molding process. Treated and untreated CRS (1~2 
cm length)  were blended  with starch adhesives in a  high-speed mixer  for 10 min at room temperature. The

equilibrated mixtures were subsequently hot-pressed into composites in a 10 cm×10 cm steel mould equipped 
with stops to achieve the same thickness (4.4 mm) at certain manufacturing parameters. Fig.1 was composites

Fig. 2 showed the relationship between starch content (density) and flexural strength of cornstarch based 
composites. From fig. 2a, flexural strength increased and then decreased with increasing of starch content, and 
reached  the  peak  value  at  starch  mass  fraction  of  10%.  The  flexural  strength  decreased  with  increasing  of 
starch mass fraction above 10%. This could be accounted for that the relative starch dosage was less, adhesive 
had weakened solidification and could not glue the rice straw completely, so the flexural strength was lower at 
starch  mass  fraction  below  10%.  Interfacial  area  of  straw  was  definite,  and  maximum  utilized  quantity  of 
starch  mantled  straw  existed.  Excrescent  starch  adhesive  made  the  composite  internal  structure  looser  at 
starch mass fraction above 10%, and the flexural strength decreased. 

From fig. 2b, flexural strength increased with increasing of composite density, increased significantly with 
increasing  of  density  at  0.6~0.7  g/cm3,  decreased  slightly  with  increasing  of  density  above  0.7  g/cm3.  This 
could be accounted for looser internal structure, more moisture content of composites and weakened adhesive 
solidification, and the flexural properties were lower at density below 0.7 g/cm3. When density was 0.7 g/cm3, 
moisture content was appropriate, starch adhesive diffuses uniformly and could glue the rice straw completely, 
flexural strength and flexural elastic modulus reached the peak value. The flexural properties decreased with 
increasing  of  density  above  0.7  g/cm3,  this  was  due  to  more  compact  internal  structure  and  more  difficult 
starch adhesive diffusion. 

From fig. 2, flexural strength of cornstarch based composites from hot-water treated straw was higher, and 
flexural strength of cornstarch based composites of NaOH treated straw was worst. This may be due to higher 
SiO2 content of straw themselves, and SiO2 forms a non-polar surface structure in fiber, weakening adhesive 
adsorption. Meanwhile, there was a wax layer on straw surface, making less friction between straw and more 
difficult for starch adhesive to permeate through straw, it was difficult to form "gel nails" in bonding process. 
All  above  mentioned  had  negative  impact  on  composites  manufacture,  and  decreased  flexural  properties  of 
composites.  Hot-water  treatments  could  reduce  SiO2  and  wax  content  of  straw  effectively,  making  better 
cementation  of  straw  and  starch  adhesive,  and  also  preserving  straw  fibers,  so  composites    from  hot-water 
treated  had  higher  flexural  properties.  However,  NaOH  treatments  could  hydrolyze  straw  cellulose,  making 
straw looser and softer, lower polymerization of straw cellulose and lower flexural properties of composites 
from NaOH treated straw.

existence  of  SiO2  and  wax  on  straw  surface,  preventing  water-soluble  reagent  penetrating  through  straw 
effectively, so non-treated straw based composites showed better water resistance.

.  

Fig. 4a showed moisture absorption of different cornstarch content composites. From fig. 4a, composites 
had faster increasing in prophase and higher moisture absorption rate at cornstarch mass fraction of 14%, and 
the other three  kinds composites had  similar  moisture absorption curves. This could be  accounted  for  more 
existence of hydrophile starch on surface and in interior of composites at starch mass fraction of 14%, leading 
to more starch content higher moisture absorption ratio and faster increasing in prophase. 

Fig.  4b  showed  moisture  absorption  of  different  density  cornstarch  based  composites  at  starch  mass 
0.6  g/cm3)  composites 
fraction  of  10%.  From  fig.4b,  moisture  absorption  rate  of  lower  density  (0.5
increased faster than others. This could be accounted for lower density less tightness of composites, leading to 
more  moisture  absorption  ratio  at  same  phase.  Moreover,  composites  had  similar  equilibrium  moisture 
absorption rate due to same weight of straw and starch.

From  the  figure,  hot  water  and  NaOH  treatments  could  reduce  SiO2  and  wax  content  of  straw  effectively, 
improving the interphase boundary of  matrix and reinforcement,  and  composites from hot water and NaOH

treated  straw  had  less  stratification  and  crack.  NaOH  treatments  could  hydrolyze  straw  cellulose,  making 
straw looser and softer and composite from NaOH treated had lower flexural properties. 

4. Conclusions 

Composites from hot-water treated straw and cornstarch had better interface and higher flexural properties, 

and flexural strength reached peak values at starch mass fraction of 10% and density of 0.7 g/cm3.  

Composites  from  non-treated  straw  and  cornstarch  had  lesser  moisture  absorption  ratio,  and  equilibrium 
moisture absorption rate  was  8.48%. Moisture  absorption ratio increased  with  starch content increasing and 
density of composites decreasing.
