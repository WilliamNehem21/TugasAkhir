1. Introduction

This study proposes a human body motion prediction model that can adapt to the disorders in various human
motion patterns and represent the kinematic constraints. In human motion prediction, the acquisition of
features that capture inter-motion and inter-joint linkages is considered effective. To generate links that are
adaptive to the reference time of dominant features and their crossing-over joints, we construct an attention-
based network that aggregates motion sequences temporally and spatially. We evaluated the motion prediction
results using the Human3.6M dataset with the indices of mean angle error and mean per joint position error
and showed that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

3D human motion prediction is a process that takes a numeric
human body pose sequence as input and predicts the future pose
sequence as shown in Fig. 1. Motion prediction is an essential tech-
nology with many applications such as human‚Äìrobot interaction [1],
automated driving [2], pedestrian tracking [3]. Various input formats
are possible for person motion prediction, including video [4], scene
mesh [5], object information [6,7]. Especially motion capture informa-
tion about a single person is widely used due to its high practicality
in terms of sensing cost and accuracy. These motion predictions deal
with numerical values of skeletal information obtained from motion
captures such as joint positions and angles, as shown in Fig. 2. Since
human motion involves many interlocking joints, the description of its
characteristics requires high-dimensional information in both time and
space. In addition, the prediction task is highly dynamic and nonlinear
and inherently involves high-dimensional uncertainty as time passes.
Therefore, there is a limit to the analytical acquisition of features
required for motion prediction [8,9]. Recently, data-driven approaches
such as [10‚Äì16] has become the mainstream. For example, in the
case of walking, both hands and feet dominates in the same motion
cycle, while the left and right hands and feet are linked in opposite
phases. Thus, there is a strong bias in the continuity and regularity of
natural human motion. Data-driven approaches have improved motion
prediction performance by separating pose information into temporal
and spatial axes and modeling feature aggregation with appropriate
network structures, respectively [17]. In this paper, we propose a
method to classify the features that have been generalized by the

conventional networks by temporal and spatial aggregation and to
obtain high generalization performance by incorporating each aggre-
gation model by adding appropriate information to the framework of
attention [18]. We propose a method to achieve a high generalization
performance within each aggregation model by adding appropriate
information to the framework.

Temporal aggregation involves ‚Äò‚Äòtranslation generalization‚Äô‚Äô and
‚Äò‚Äòtime scale generalization‚Äô‚Äô as shown in Fig. 3. The generalization
of translation means acquiring features that do not depend on at
which time in the input sequence a given action occurs. The gener-
alization of time scales means acquiring features that do not depend
on how long a behavior occurs and how fast the same behavior is
performed. Previous methods adopt mainly four approaches, including
convolutional neural network (CNN) [11], recurrent neural network
(RNN) [10,13], discrete cosine transform (DCT) [12] and attention
mechanism (Attention) [15,19]. CNN has excellent generalizability of
temporal translation, but it is not easy to generalize the time scale
because the kernel size fixes the reference time time-length. RNNs have
the generalizability of time-scale in terms of the reference time-length
stretch modeling. However, it belongs to the Markovian models, which
is not suitable for translational generalization, due to the accumulation
of errors when the dominant features of the motion appear in the
forward part of the sequence. DCT can acquire features referring to
the overall input time by transferring them to frequency space before
processing them. The pose information transferred to the frequency
space can be generalized for both translation and scale because the
time shift and frequency are separated. However, DCT has difficulties

vector of joint angles, ùê´ùëñ ‚àà R3. There are two types of angle-based descriptions.

generalizing the translation because the time shift remains absolute due
to the boundary condition in acyclic operation. Attention can provide
feature descriptions referring to the entire time region by explaining
the proximity between time points with Positional Encoding. Although
Positional Encoding provides generalization for both translation and
scale, it may be inferior to DCT for acquiring periodic motion features
because it gives the proximity discontinuously for each time pair. In
this method, we propose a new positional encoding in the attention
architecture, which reproduces the operations in frequency space such
as in DCT. This method provides frequency and time-shift information
to Attention‚Äôs Query in the framework of relative position embedding
(RPE). The model can acquire motion features with separate translation
and time scales, which means it can interpret the same motion events
with the same parameters when they appear at different times and
speeds of occurrence.

Spatial aggregation critically involves generalizing motion features
per joint and spatial dependencies between joints. Generalization of
motion features per joint means acquiring independent features re-
gardless of any joint. For example, the motion features observed in
the right knee are also applicable to the left knee. Generalization of
spatial dependence among joints means the acquisition of reference
relationships among joints to provide each motion, for example, the
rotation linkage of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist to produce a straight-
line trajectory of the fingertips. Previous methods have focused on
the expression of spatial dependency using network structures such as
Graph Convolution and Graph Attention. Specifically, they generate
a joint graph with each joint as a node, then detach the joint-wise
features and the spatial dependencies across joints. For joint-wise fea-
tures, they consider the feature dimensions retained by each node as

Fig. 3. Generalization of temporal features: (Left) The foot during walking is dominated

identical and share the rotation matrix applied between joints. They
also provide the importance that each node attaches to other nodes
during aggregation, as adjacency matrices, to represent the spatial
dependencies between joints.

The methods that use motion trees as adjacency matrices can de-
scribe spatial proximity in link connection relationships, but they make
it difficult to reference distant joints. Wei et al. [12] enables referencing
of distant joints by learning the adjacency matrix. Due to the lack of
information on the original connection relations of the motion tree, it
was not sufficient for acquiring global features such as capturing the
entire near joints of arms and legs. Li et al. [13] gives the closeness of
joints to each other by constructing a multi-scale graph that integrates
close joints. While wide-area features are easier to acquire, the choice
of which joints to integrate relies on heuristics. The generalization of
spatial dependence is still an unsolved problem.

We focus on the fact that the generalization issues are different
between the two data description methods, position-based and angle-
based, which have been evaluated separately as independent problems.
Concretely, the position-based description can capture the features that
represent a wide range of motions, such as the interlocking of distant
joints in the kinematic tree due to the relative positional relationships
of the joints. On the other hand, angle-based description has an ad-
vantage in capturing features that represent local actions, such as local
actions at a terminal joint, regardless of the posture of the root side
in the kinematic tree. Therefore, we employ an approach in which
the angle-based description gives the features held by each node of
the joint graph, and the position-based description provides the spatial
dependence during feature aggregation.

As shown in Fig. 6, we attempt to generalize both local and global
motion features by building a predictor that handles angle-based fea-
tures while incorporating position-based features suitable for represent-
ing spatial dependencies. Since the rotation axis of each joint can vary
from moment to moment as the human pose, Inverse Kinematics (IK),
an algorithm that calculates the angle of each joint from the input posi-
tion, requires the asymptotic computation of recursive equations. Since
the inclusion of IK in the network degrades the prediction accuracy for
actions far from the reference pose, adding a location-based description
to the input does not directly improve accuracy. Therefore, previous
methods use only angle-based or position-based descriptions for input
and output, such as Fig. 5 (see Fig. 4).

The contribution of this work is to improve the performance of
motion prediction by increasing the generalizability of motion feature
acquisition, both in terms of temporal and spatial aggregation. For
temporal aggregation, we introduce operations in frequency space in
the framework of RPE to Self-Attention to achieve generalization in
both translations of occurrence time and time width scale for the
reference time of dominant motion features. For spatial aggregation,
we derive position-based and angle-based pose descriptions that can
be linearly mapped in the vicinity of the input final pose through
the parameter space of Lie algebra, and assign position-based features
to angle-based features by Cross-Attention, which allows us to both
generalize the motion of individual joints and generalize the spatial

dependence between joints. We performed benchmark tests for motion
prediction using the Human3.6M [20] and CMU-Mocap [21] datasets
and showed that our model has superior performance compared to
conventional methods.

2.1. Temporal aggregation

Modeling human motion prediction is difficult due to its high
dimensionality, nonlinear dynamics, and the uncertainty of human
motion. Analytical methods for short time forecasting have been pro-
posed such as Gaussian process latent variable model [8], hidden
Markov model [9], and random forest [9]. However, these methods
have short applicability due to the models‚Äô limited complexity. Thus,
the mainstream methods in recent years have shifted to using deep
learning.

Previous research has mainly used four models, CNN, RNN, DCT,
and Attention, as efficient ways to acquire motion features in time-
series data processing by deep learning. Li et al. [11] built a Con-
volutional Sequence-to-Sequence model using time series convolution.
Since the range of spatial and temporal dependencies captured by this
model is statically determined by the size of the convolutional filter,

it cannot handle behaviors with different periods. Hence, regression-
based methods, such as LSTM, are widely used because they can
train a time-dependent range [13,22,23]. However, regression-based
methods assume Markovianity, which reduces the robustness in the
temporal direction. DCT transforms a time-discrete input sequence into
a continuous sequence in the time axis and a discrete sequence in
the frequency axis. DCT aggregates centrally in the temporal direc-
tion and directly references distant times, which provides excellent
generalization performance of the feature scale. On the other hand,
the transformation from discrete values requires extrapolation, such as
signal folding to form a periodic function. As a result, boundary condi-
tions remain, and generalization of translation is challenging for acyclic
transition behavior. Therefore, several works proposed a method using
DCT to predict frequency space instead of pose space [12,14]. DCT
aggregates centrally in the temporal direction and directly references
distant times, which provides excellent generalization performance of
the feature scale. On the other hand, the transformation from discrete
values requires extrapolation, such as signal folding to form a periodic
function. As a result, boundary conditions remain, and generalization
of translation is challenging for acyclic transition behavior. Aksan
et al. [15] proposed another approach that uses Attention to refer to
features at distant times without distinction. In Attention, Positional
Encoding assigns time proximity. The generalization performance for
time translation of features is high, and the generalization performance
to feature scales is also maintained due to the possibility of wide-area
referencing. However, it is inferior to the method using DCT in periodic
operation because the proximity exists for each time pair.

Array15(2022)1002123I. Ueda et al.

We attempt to reproduce the scale generalization performance of
DCT with temporal attention by focusing on the frequency components
dominant to the motion in the framework of Positional Encoding. There
are two computational forms of Positional Encoding: absolute posi-
tional encoding (APE) and relative positional encoding (RPE). Benyou
et al. [24] has reported that the performance of BERT can be improved
by using APE and RPE together. Wu et al. [25] proposed a multiplica-
tive positional encoding as contextual RPE. In this method, we propose
an RPE based on the contextual RPE [25] that can reproduce operations
in frequency space, i.e., operations when using DCT, as a convolution
in pose space.

2.2. Spatial aggregation

There are two essential aspects of spatial aggregation: generaliza-
tion of the motion between individual joints, such as the typical motion
of the right and left knees, and generalization of the spatial dependency
between joints, such as the interlocking of the shoulder, elbow, and
wrist, such as the smooth trajectory of the fingertips, which is indepen-
dent of the posture of the whole body. In order to generalize these two
characteristics, conventional methods focus on the representation of
dependencies between joints by network structures. Graph Convolution
and Graph Attention consider the motion tree a graph with each joint
as a node and represent spatial dependencies by adjacency matrices.
Li et al. [11] use the connection relation of the motion tree as the
adjacency matrix of Graph Convolution. Graph Convolution can express
spatial monotonicity such that the closer joints give more importance
because it aggregates only the information of adjacent joints in each
layer. On the other hand, it is difficult to refer to distant or strongly
synchronized joints in the motion tree, such as the left and right
wrists during hand-holding, despite their high spatial dependency. Wei
et al. [12] introduce the adjacency matrix as a trainable parameter.
They consider the connections between joints as complete graphs and
describe the spatial dependence in edge weights, which enables dis-
tance joint referencing. On the other hand, the original information of
the connection relation is lost, such as which joints are adjacent to each
other. Li et al. [13] constructs a multi-scale graph that integrates close
joints to obtain global features such as focusing on the movement of
the entire foot instead of independent joints such as the knee and ankle.
While this method makes it easier to obtain global features by omitting
similar joints, it relies on heuristics to select which joints to integrate.
Emre et al. [15] uses Graph Attention to feed the adjacency matrix
dynamically. In common with each method, the problem is generalizing
the spatial dependence between joints.

We focus on generalizing spatial dependency by utilizing data
structures instead of network structures. In general, networks utilize
position-based or angle-based descriptions for data structures describ-
ing input/output poses. The position-based description directly uses the
3D position of each joint acquired by motion capture [26], etc. The
angle-based description determines a skeletal reference shape, such as
T-pose or A-pose. It uses Euler angles and rotation vectors to describe
the rotation of each joint from the reference shape.

In the position-based description, it is easy to obtain spatial con-
straints on the end joints, such as the mutation of the ankle position
into a zero vector when the axial foot stops during ground contact.
The position-based description is also suitable for describing the rela-
tionship between joints and selecting the joints to be gazed at from a
global perspective. It can explicitly describe the positional relationship
between joints distant from each other in the motion tree by using
relative positions. On the other hand, the link length strongly affects
the movement of the joint position, and the scale is different between
the behavior of the hip joint and that of the toe. For example, even if the
motion from the elbow to the toe is the same, the dynamic coordinate
transformation depends on the shape of the root side, making it difficult
to identify the motion features. Therefore, it is more difficult to obtain
generalized features of individual joints and features of local joints in

comparison with angle-based descriptions. In addition, it is difficult to
apply the constraint that the link length is invariant, such as the arm
length does not change during the motion when the output is directly
represented as a 3D position.

With angle-based description, it is easy to obtain local behavioral
features such as gazing from the elbow to the tip of the elbow, regard-
less of trunk behavior such as prone or crouching. Also, by describing
the output as angle-based, fixed link length can be applied. The disad-
vantage is that the link length information is lost from the data, making
it difficult to describe the relationship between distant joints that are
not directly connected. This makes it difficult to acquire global features
and model spatial dependencies between joints dynamically. Wei et al.
compared the performance of Res-Sup, ConvSeq2Seq, Traj-GCN, and
Traj-GCN networks by using a position-based description for direct
motion prediction and an angle-based description for transformation to
each joint position after prediction. It is pointed out that the prediction
performance of the angle-based description is inferior to that of the
position-based description.

In the proposed method, features and spatial dependencies acquired
from the position-based description are introduced into the intermedi-
ate features of the motion prediction network using the angle-based
description using Cross-Attention. The transformation from positional
information to angular information, called inverse kinematics, requires
recursive computation because the superposition of rotations cannot
be decomposed. Since even a deep-learning-based predictor has a sig-
nificant error, simply adding a position-based description to the input
does not improve performance. We decompose the pose sequence into
differences from the final input pose to isolate rough motion informa-
tion, such as standing or walking, which facilitates the coordination
of position and angles. In a similar approach, Liu et al. [16] proposed
a joint trajectory space that can efficiently analyze motion context
while preserving information on joint trajectories by decomposing the
description of joint positions into the final pose and the velocity of each
frame. We assume that the input and output poses are in the vicinity
of the final input pose and achieve the linkage between position and
angle via the Lie algebra around the rotation matrix of the final pose.

3. Our approach

Fig. 7 shows the entire proposed method. For input and output, we
use the rotation of each joint in the form of a rotation matrix. As a pre-
processing step, we convert the input to position-based and angle-based
representations based on the final pose. Full connection and graph
convolution gives the pose information as a feature vector for Self-
Attention and provide the APE information. This network comprises
a Transformer Encoder, which takes the position-based description
as input and outputs the feature values, and a Transformer Decoder,
which takes the angle-based description as input and performs forward
prediction.

The transformer contains Temporal Attention for aggregation be-
tween time points, Spatial Attention for aggregation between joints,
Cross Attention for importing position-based features to the decoder
side, and a Feed Forward network. The decoder outputs the data in
rotation vectors in all coupling layers for each time and joint. The
post-processing obtains the output pose sequence by finding the rota-
tion matrix corresponding to the vector using the matrix exponential
function and applying it to the final input pose.

3.1. Position-based and angle-based pose descriptions

In this method, position-based and angle-based features are ob-
tained for spatial information aggregation to describe the coordination
of distant joints and generalize each joint. The inverse kinematics prob-
lem is converted from joint positions to angles, and it is difficult to solve
the error even with recent deep learning techniques. In this study, we
define a highly accurate mapping from the position description to the

angle description and embed the necessary information in advance to
avoid the accumulation of errors. Specifically, forward kinematics can
provide a differentiable mapping from joint angles to positions using
the offset and rotation matrices for each link in the reference pose.
The rotation matrix takes a tangent plane at the reference pose and
defines a Lie algebra, which can be used to create a 3-DOF parameter
representation for each joint. Furthermore, this parameter space can
be interconverted by defining Jacobians with position descriptions. In
this section, we first introduce the parameter notation of Lie algebra
as the angle notation. Then, we show that the position change and
the transformation map of Lie algebra to the parameter space can be
described in terms of the local coordinate system of joint positions.

We denote the angular description of the pose at time ùë° as ùëãùë° =
[ùêåùë°,1, ‚Ä¶ , ùêåùë°,ùëÅ ]. Each ùêåùë°,ùëñ ‚àà R3√ó3 is an orthogonal matrix whose
determinant is 1, which is a member of the special orthogonal group
ùëÜùëÇ(3). We consider the Lie algebra associated with the tangent plane in
the input final frame Mùêø,ùëñ. The matrix ùëä ‚àà R3√ó3 on the tangent plane
is multiplied by the source of the Lie algebra [ùê´]‚àß, represented by the
rotation vector ùê´ = [ùëü1, ùëü2, ùëü3]ùëá , as follows.

The ùëä can be defined to map to ùëÜùëÇ(3) by the matrix exponential

By using ùëÖùë° = [ùê´ùë°,1, ‚Ä¶ , ùê´ùë°,ùëÅ ]ùëá as the angle description, we can
quickly obtain the derivative for the angle of the joint position given
by the forward kinematics. The Lie algebraic parameter of rotation
provides a stable property as the input‚Äìoutput space of the network
because it avoids singularity and uniqueness problems such as gimbal
lock, unlike angle descriptions such as Euler angles.

Next, we focus on the position-based description that can collabo-
rate with the angle-based description. For simplicity, we assume that
the links are connected as 1, 2, ‚Ä¶ , ùëñ, ‚Ä¶ , ùëó ‚àí 1, ùëó, ‚Ä¶ , ùëÅ. The offset of link
ùëñ at the reference pose is ùê•ùëñ ‚àà R3, the rotation matrix from the reference
pose is Mùëñ ‚àà R3√ó3, the translation of the root is ùê•0, and the rotation
matrix M0 = I. The homogeneous coordinate transformation matrix ùëáùëñ
by link ùëñ is shown in Eq. (4).

Note that B is the matrix representing the parent‚Äìchild relationship

Since B is a value that can be set statically for the same skeletal model,
and since the skeletal model is a tree structure with joint 1 as the
root, we can transform B into a lower triangular matrix by exchanging
columns. The inverse of the mapping by the lower triangular matrix can
be easily represented in the network. By adding the information of J to
the encoder‚Äôs input, the transformation to the angle can be embedded
in the network. This method uses Cross-Attention to combine angle-
based features, so the rotation matrix is further separated at the encoder
side, and the combination of joint position and joint coordinate system

3.2. Embedding of human pose information

(18)

Pose-Embedding generates ùê∑-dimensional feature vectors of poses
that can be aggregated by Self-Attention from pose sequences with
position-based and angle-based descriptions transformed in Section 3.1.
Let the input and output pose sequences be the tensors of G ‚àà
Rùêø√óùëÅ√óùê∂ , E ‚àà Rùêø√óùëÅ√óùê∑, respectively. C is the number of elements in each
description, e.g., 3ùêæ for the position-based description in Section 3.1
and 3 for the angle-based description. G is the number of elements in
each description, e.g., 3ùêæ in the position-based description and 3 in
the angle-based description. G is described by a common evaluation
axis for time, specifically, the feature values ùê†ùë°1,ùëñ, ùê†ùë°2,ùëñ at time ùë°1, ùë°2
and joint ùëñ are directly comparable. On the other hand, for space, the
feature values ùê†ùë°,ùëñ1, ùê†ùë°,ùëñ2 for time ùë° and joints ùëñ, ùëó are taken to different
evaluation axes. For example, the elbow joint and the knee joint have
two axes of motion: flexion‚Äìextension in the offset vertical direction
and adduction‚Äìabduction in the offset direction. They have similar
ranges of motion, but the directions of the axes of motion are different.
Therefore, the input ùê∫ùë° ‚àà RùëÅ √ó ùê∂ at each time is rotated for each joint,
and then static graph convolution is performed on the joint graph to
output the feature vector ùê∏ùë° ‚àà RùëÅ√óùê∑.

Aùë° = ùúé(Qùë°Kùëá

ùë° ).

(24)

Note that ùúé(‚ãÖ) is the activation function, which generally uses a
normalization such that the sum of the directions is one after applying

Eq. (25) gives the interpretation that the adjacency matrix is a dynam-

Temporal Attention is similarly an independent process for each

joint. The input/output to the layer at joint ùëñ is as follows:

3.4. Embedding time and joint proximity

The Attention mechanism aggregates all of the time and joint infor-
mation in the input indistinctly. For this purpose, the proximity of time
and joint is assigned to the feature vector by Positional Encoding. Our
method uses Absolutely Positional Encoding (APE) to obtain features
that depend on absolute time and specific joints and Relative Positional
Encoding (RPE) to obtain generalized features that do not distinguish
the timing of occurrence.

Fig. 9. RPE gives the product of query and cosine when computing Temporal Attention.

APE assigns proximity to the feature vectors generated in Sec-
tion 3.2 just before the network‚Äôs input. Proximity on the time axis

In this method, we use a fully learnable APE with the learnable

In RPE, when computing Temporal Attention, we design it in such
a way that it assigns proximity only to queries, as shown in Fig. 9. For
feature dimension ùëê, if the proximity between times ùë°1 and ùë°2 is ùëßùëüùëíùëôùëéùë°ùëñùë£ùëí

movement class. However, the number of evaluation sequences was
small, and the chosen sequences were biased toward easily predictable
ones. Lingwei et al. [14] pointed out the inaccuracy of the evaluation
and evaluated the entire sequence for each action class. We inherit this
benchmark and evaluate it using the entire test data.

We also evaluate the same on the CMU-Mocap dataset [21]. For
the sake of fairness, we use the same data as in Res-sup [10] with the
anthropometric differences removed and validate it on eight classes of
test cases.

4.2. Evaluations

Following the standard evaluation metrics used in Res-sup [10],
the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE), which describes the av-
erage distance from the ground-truth value of each joint position
in millimeters, is used to evaluate the results. The prediction times
were compared for 80, 160, 320, and 400 [ms] as in the previous
study. We measured the MPJPE for the output angle converted to
the position by forward-kinematics. As a baseline, we compared the
results of our method with those of four recent methods: Res-sup, Traj-
GCN, DMGNN, and MSR-GCN. We used the results reported in each
paper for each error directly. Since DMGNN [13] did not report the

error of 3D positions, only the results of angular error were compared.
For Human3.6M, we conducted comparative experiments on whether
it has Encoder and RPE modules and uses position-based and angle-
based descriptions. We omitted the cross-attachment of the decoder
and used only the self-attachment for the angle descriptions for the
experiments without the encoder. For the experiments without RPE,
we configured each Temporal Attention as a regular self-attention.
We replaced the decoder‚Äôs initial input ùëÖ1, ‚Ä¶ , ùëÖùêø with a single zero
vector for the only position-based description experiment. For the only
rotation-based description experiment, we replaced the encoder‚Äôs input
with angle informations ùëÖ1, ‚Ä¶ , ùëÖùêø instead of positions ùëÉ1, ‚Ä¶ , ùëÉùêø. We
implemented the architecture of our method using Pytorch [27], and
trained the model using AdaBound [28] for the gradient method. The
learning rate is ùëôùëü = 0.0001, ùëì ùëñùëõùëéùëôùëôùëü = 1.0, ùë§ùëíùëñùëî‚Ñéùë°ùëëùëíùëêùëéùë¶ = 0.0005,
mini-batch is trained with random extraction of batch size 256, input
sequence length is 32 frames, and output sequence length is 10 frames.

4.3. Results

Table 1 shows the experimental results of the position error in
Human3.6M [20]. In Human3.6M, all the motion classes outperformed
the conventional method in prediction below 320 [ms]. In ablation,

compared to the case without encoders or position-based input, there
is a remarkable improvement in the whole-body movement classes
such as Discussion, Sitting, SittingDown, and WalkingTogether. We
considered that the position-based description, directly referring to the
positional relationship of distant joints, worked effectively.

On the other hand, there is no significant improvement in the
long-time prediction of 400 [ms]. The association between position
and angle is assumed to be near the last input pose as the reference
pose. This may have made it challenging to integrate the position-
based features into the angle-based features when the movement is
significant. In addition, the performance of short-time prediction is
particularly significant for motion classes that include many periodic
motions, such as Walking, Directions, Greeting, and Phoning. The con-
siderable improvement compared to the experimental results without
RPE suggests that the dominant frequency component enhancement by
RPE plays a role similar to that of DCT and improves the prediction
performance for periodic motions.

In the ablation of data description, the performance of long-term
prediction without position-based and short-term prediction without
angle-based are lower than our original. We interpret this result that the
position-based description affects long-time prediction since it detects
global features of the whole body. In contrast, the angle-based involves
short-time prediction since it detects local features of each joint unit.
Table 2 shows the experimental results of position error in CMU-
Mocap [21]. Similar to Human3.6M, we can find an improvement in
the performance of CMU-Mocap for predictions below 320 [ms]. In ad-
dition, the improvement is more significant in the motion classes with
complex motion patterns near the final input pose, such as basketball.
We believe that this method extracts effective motion characteristics
because it can refer to both position-based and angle-based features.

constraints such as connection relation and link length invariance by
using angle as output. By selecting the appropriate architecture for ex-
tracting the features of position and angle, we create an inference that
can predict with high accuracy even for non-periodic and difficult-to-
generalize motion classes. The results show that our model outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods in short-term prediction.

5. Discussion and future works

References

This paper proposes a method for extensive temporal and spatial
information aggregation using Self-Attention. For temporal aggrega-
tion, the dominant frequencies are emphasized in the framework of
relative positional encoding and used together with absolute positional
encoding to achieve aggregation that incorporates the characteristics of
conventional models using DCT. For spatial aggregation, we focus on
the fact that position-based and angle-based descriptions are suitable
for global and local feature extraction, respectively, and constructed
a structure that incorporates the position-based features extracted by
the encoder into the angle features by Cross-Attention. We also show
that a linear mapping can be defined between the parameter space
of Lie algebra and the position space of the joint coordinate system.
We introduce a position- and angle-based description in the neigh-
borhood coordinates of the final input pose. At the same time, we
realized the expression of conditions such as fixation and contact
of end joints by using the position as input and the expression of
