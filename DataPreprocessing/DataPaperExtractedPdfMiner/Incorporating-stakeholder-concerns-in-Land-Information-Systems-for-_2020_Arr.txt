Stakeholder satisfaction

Urbanization increases urban ﬂood. This urges hydrologically and economically planned land development de-
cisions. When decision making, incorporation of hydrology model with GIS is a common practice due to the
requirements of accuracy and efﬁciency. Nevertheless, GIS and hydrology incorporated tools (HydroGIS) should
facilitate stakeholder concerns for practical implementation. But there were no single tool and developing such
becomes a hard undertaking due to the absence of proper guidelines. Therefore, the present work is to identify the
stakeholder concerns and incorporate those in a HydroGIS tool (Land Information System) for Urban Flood
Management. For the purpose, it identiﬁed and veriﬁed the stakeholder concerns through a literature survey and
stakeholder discussions. Then, incorporated those into the tool and evaluated the achievement. Present work
identiﬁed and incorporated the stakeholder requirements; such as the requirement of an automated tool, User
friendliness using novel GIS-GUI development guidelines, development of the software using a novel approach of
development, security through novel security mechanism and, integrating the hydrology-GIS model using a
suitable base software. The systematic incorporation of such requirements into the tool shows the growth in user
satisfaction from 48% to 92%. The accurate recognition and incorporation of stakeholder requirements lead to the
successful HydroGIS tool in urban ﬂood management.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background

Urbanization, which is mainly caused by the migration of people to
seek employment opportunities and better services, creates high popu-
lation densities because of land restrictions in designated areas [1]. The
UN report on World Urbanization Prospects - 2018 [2] shows only 43% of
world population lived in urban area in 1990. However, it has increased
to 55% in 2018 and predicted to be 60% by 2030. This will deﬁnitely
cause aggravated pressures on urban land development.

Demand for land development exerts pressure on surface runoff
drainage systems and also on the available water storage in ﬂoodplains.
Hellmers et al. [3], study shows the increment in ﬂood inundations areas
with the urban growth and existing drainage system. Carver [4] describes
the reduction of lag time to collect runoff to drainage as a reason for
ﬂood. USGS fact sheet [5] also describes the negative effect of

urbanization on streams. Further, whilst attempting to model the urban
ﬂood, Xia [6], found that the rainfall excess overwhelming the drainage
capacity.

Meantime the guideline developed by Jha et al. [7], highlights the
appearance of urban ﬂood fatalities had not reduced in developing
countries. The state of art review of Hammond et al. [8], describes the
damages by grouping into two areas, tangible (destruction of properties)
and intangible (effect on health, economical and etc.). Further Pregnolato
et al. [9], describe the ﬂoods’ negative effect on transportation, and
Elmoustafa’s [10] study shows all the above as repercussions of ﬂoods.
Moreover, Xia et al. [6], study ﬁgures out devastating damage due to
such urban ﬂood. Therefore, ﬂooding is described as a major factor that
disrupts the equilibrium of economic activities in urban areas because of
the damage to property, crippling of transport and other public utilities
and increased pollution of the environment.

At 2011, Gunaruwan [11], found that the estimated damage in
Colombo city, Sri Lanka for a 25 year ﬂood is approximately 260,000

$/km2. According to Huizinga [12], damage due to urban ﬂoods varies
signiﬁcantly from Asia to America. Word Bank [13] estimates the global
ﬂood loss will be 52 Bn $/year in 2050 which was only 6 Bn $/year in
2005. This points to the importance of achieving sustainable develop-
ment in urban areas.

Apart from that Jha et al. [7], describe that the existing laws & reg-
ulations are poorly controlling land enhancements which obstruct the
natural water ﬂow. Further Zhou [14] argues that urban land modiﬁca-
tions are only considering the economic factors, then those damage the
natural water systems. Therefore, this “Hydrologically unplanned land
and infrastructure development” becomes the most contributing factor
for the undesirable increase in storm water runoff, shortening of time to
respond and ﬁnally the ﬂood. Hence, there is an urgent need to support
and execute “hydrologically-planned land development” for sustainable
urban environments.

Further, core of sustainable urban ﬂood management is the avail-
ability of a reliable hydrologic model for runoff estimation from urban
land parcels. Then, when developing a system for urban ﬂood manage-
ment, the hydro model is the most important component. Development
of urban hydrologic models spans over 50 years. In 1968, Geological
Survey Circular [15] was developed to guide the hydrology for urban
land planning. Furthermore, various other researches were carried out,
such as, Mcpherson and Schneider [16] attempt to identify urban
watershed modelling problems, Chan and Bras [17] analysis on urban
ﬂood volume distribution and Jacques et al. [18], model of urban runoff
process. Maidment and Parzen [19] pay the attention to urban water use
in 1984. Moreover, when Chow et al. writing their book on Applied Hy-
drology [20], a special attention was paid to urban water to manage the
ﬂood. Since then, a number of books have been written and researches
have been carried out on urban hydrology such as guiding the urban
drainage design in the book of Smart and Herbertson [21], chapter on
engineering application of urban hydrology by Shaw [22]. Djokic and
Maidment [23] analyses the terrain for urban storm water modelling, and
Mitchell et al. [24], model the urban water cycle. Apart from these at-
tempts, UNESCO Urban Water Management Program (UWMP) which
perform under International Hydrological Program –IHP has contributed
to develop and accumulated number of hydro models and share the
knowledge and experience on urban water among 36 UNESCO Member
States [25].

However, there are inherent problems to be solved when hydrology
modelling. Ficchi et al. [26], found that the hydrology models’ accuracy
depends on the resolutions of the inputs. Even though the resolution
increases the accuracy, Ichiba et al. [27], found that high resolution re-
sults performance issues. When hydrology models generate outputs, Eger
et al. [28], shows the importance of removing communication problem
with the non-technical audiences. To solve such problem, Fatichi et al.
[29], urge to improve the visualization of the outputs. However, ac-
cording to Ogden et al. [30], the huge amount of data handling and
manipulating capabilities of the GIS provide assistance to hydrology
models to generate more accurate results. Thakur et al. [31], review
shows that the most of hydrological modeling problems can be solved
using GIS. Hence it can consider that the present hydrology models can
highly dependent on the capabilities of GIS software.

the GIS in hydrology,

Identifying the capabilities of

the term
“HydroGIS” was introduced in HydroGIS 93 conference, Vienna, April
1993, to describe the common ground between GIS and hydrological
applications [32]. Pradeep and Wijesekera [33] have introduced the term
“HydroGIS tool” which is a software tool that facilitates to practice the
hydrologic models using spatial information management potential of
GIS. When considering the HydroGIS tools, Assaf et al. [34], highlight an
important requirement which should provide an interactive stakeholder
decision making capability. Further S€orensen et al. [35], state that the
GIS component of the tool should assist multi-stakeholder approach.

Then multi-stockholder approach assists to practically develop and
implement sustainable urban ﬂood management options.

1.2.

Integration of stakeholder aspirations

Sustainable urban land management in the light of ﬂood management
is a spatially distributed task involving a large number of stakeholders.
Both Gray et al. [36], and Scott et al. [37], have identiﬁed that these
stakeholders consist of land owners and developers, land managers and
policy makers, urban dwellers, business people, migrant employees,
services seekers, technical experts in water and spatial data management
systems, management tool developers and operators who are equally
important for a thriving urban economy.

However, Han et al. [38], highlight that urban lands have more
pressure when considering the effect of urban economy on the interna-
tional supply chain and commodity trade. Hence, the business-people
have more interest on urban lands. Meantime, according to Struyk and
Angelici [39], the Russian urban dwellers pay a high interest on rural
cottages/villas known as dacha phenomenon, and less interest on urban
lands. Then, it can observed that the stakeholder interest on urban land
does not have a common behavior. Nevertheless, it is common that the
uncompromising nature of ﬂoodwater that continues to ﬂow under
gravity with no respect for administrative boundaries.

Therefore, these two main factors: stakeholder interests (objectives)
and nature of water, need to be considered when managing land for
urban ﬂood mitigation. For the purpose, it is necessary to have a GIS for
land management that successfully incorporates urban stakeholder as-
pirations while integrating a spatially distributed hydrologic model to
deliver outputs that satisfy both recipient stakeholders and decision
makers.

In stakholder aspirations evalaution, an important point is high-
lighted by Scott et al., [37]; accordingly, due to the fact that most of the
stakeholders are non-technical, the tool’s capability to provide alterna-
tive solutions is very important. Further, Bacco et al. [40], identify that
such solutions need to be maintainable/sustainable with the assistance of
IT, and it is a technical challenge which is to develop a stakeholder
agreed practical solution in line with hydrological requirements. There-
fore, in other words such spatial tool should provide more non-technical
stakeholder assistance.

As an initial activity, the present work carried out an outline review
on the different software tools and research works which use in the
hydro-land management scenarios against the applicability with non-
technical stakeholders.

There are large number of tools that provide only the land informa-
tion to its non-technical stakeholders such as Micropact’s Land Records
Management [41] which provides land records to judicial works, Acce-
la’s Land Management system [42] that provides online land manage-
ment viewing platform to land owners and decision makers, LRS [43]
provides land information to local authorities for daily administration.
General Code’s Municity [44] which provides a complete land manage-
ment solution to local authorities. This type of software tool needs not
technical knowledge to operate; however, the decisions made through
the tools do not follow proper hydrological assessments.

On the other hand, another set of tools have been utilized land pa-
rameters to perform water related information generation and decision
making. PIHMgis [45] which integrate land information and other pa-
rameters; OpenNSPECT [46] which simulates the soil erosion, water
pollution, and overland ﬂow accumulation; Innovyze’s InfoWorks ICM
Suite [47] which is a sophisticated GIS based real time modeling software
tool set; are the tools which perform watershed management activities
with hydrological models. Further, there are advanced information
processing software to perform storm generation and ﬂood management
activities such as the Real Time Hydrological Model for Flood Prediction

[48] that provides online ﬂood prediction information to the general
public; Worku’s application of SWAT model [49] to analysis the water
yield against the land modiﬁcations; ArcCN-Runoff [50] software which
assist to calcualte hydrological parameters; Geo-PUMMA [51] toolbox
that assist in urban hydrology modelling and NOAA [52] which allows
users to calculate impervious surface area. Furthermore, there are other
tools that are utilizing land information to arrive spatial decisions in
different ﬁelds such as SOLARIS [53] for agriculture which manipulates
soil and land information. However, users of all these tools should have
substantial
input data prepara-
tion/carrying out processes/interpret the outputs.

technical knowledge on either

Then when reviewing all these available software tools, there is a lack
of an integrated, user-friendly tool for non-technical stakeholders (both
the decision makers and land owners) to arrive at economically accept-
able, hydrologically sustainable optimum land development options.

1.3. Deﬁciency of stakeholder concerns in HydroGIS tools

As there are gaps in the initial review, a systematic literature review
has been conducted following the guideline by Kitchenham and Charters
[54]. Accordingly, a set of literature that describe the tool/procedur-
e/guideline/framework which use for ﬂood/water management are
selected. Then literature is evaluated under two research questions (1)
How the literature has identiﬁed the stakeholder concerns and (2) How
those concerns are incorporated to the HydroGIS tool. Among the sur-
veyed literatures, following are crucial for the overall study.

Criollo et al. [55], developed a tool, AkvaGIS to water management
and describe how the stakeholders are interacting with that tool. Xu et al.
[56], describe the integration of GIS for hydro modelling for the stake-
holders’ concern on easy management decisions. However, both have
stakeholders without proper
predetermined the requirements of
requirement gathering. However, Pingale et al. [57], having analyzed
more than 35 case studies in integration of GIS and water resources
models identify the model developers’ concerns but lack of operation-
alization guideline to incorporate those.

Henriksen et al. [58], discusse how to involve stakeholders in
hydro-GIS modelling with only elaborating the management of stake-
holders than their concerns. Voinov et al. [59], provide a better guideline
to Participatory Modelling (PM) which widely identify stakeholder
concerns whilst model development. Leskens et al. [60], present a
framework that allows ﬂexible decision making using interactive models
which are based on theory of collaborative knowledge construction. The
analysis shows that only these three works discuss the stakeholders’
concerns to a broader extend.

However, when Jessel and Jacobs [61] discuss the applicability of
European Water Framework Directive (WFD) in land use development in
watershed management partially identifying the requirements of outputs
except the stakeholder concerns on the inputs. The 2D/3D ﬂood visual-
ization workﬂow of Macchione et al. [62], describes the stakeholder
concerns on output visualization whilst Van Ackere et al. [63], identify
the 2D and 3D simulations are more user-friendly visualization to
stakeholders. Concomitantly, Leskens et al. [64], successfully identify
and incorporate the dynamic output requirements of non-technical
practitioners; Luke et al. [65], study identify the importance of map
output visualization, customized legend and geospatial information to
stakeholders. Nevertheless, all these works only consider the stake-
holders’ output concerns.

Therefore, when reviewing the relevant literature, it has been proved
that attention has been paid to stakeholders’ concerns on outputs rather
than inputs and processes. Apart from that, the importance of the
stakeholder incorporation to the water decision making and suggesting
different work ﬂows has also been discussed to a greater extent. Never-
theless, speciﬁc concerns of stakeholders on the requirement to develop
tools have not been identiﬁed. On the other hand, urban land

management for ﬂood mitigation is a multi-stakeholder activity. Hence it
is vital to identify all stakeholders and their requirements for sustainable
implementation of mitigating measures [35].

At the same time, in the present theory and practices in software
engineering [66, p. 71], the fundamental requirement for a successful
system is to achieve the organizational goals (the business need of the
system/the stakeholders), which stress to address the needs of stake-
holders in a holistic manner. Hence there is an urgent need to contribute
towards
tool development guidelines by
adequately considering stakeholder concerns and demonstrating the
development of a HydroGIS for urban ﬂood management.

1.4. Objective

The objective of the present work is to identify the stakeholder con-
cerns with respect to hydrologically-planned land development and
incorporate those into a Land Information Systems (HydroGIS tool) for
Urban Flood Management. In this effort, a conceptual HydroGIS tool for
urban ﬂood management has systematically been developed on a GIS
platform while incorporating the stakeholder requirements identiﬁed
through literature survey and professional discussions.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Method of incorporating stakeholder concerns

The present work demonstrates the HydroGIS tool which assists the
existing land enhancement approval granting process by providing a new
facility to evaluate the modiﬁcation on hydrological perspective and
opting to prevent urban ﬂood. Previous works of the authors [67,68]
described software development initiatives with rationale behind the
selection of hydro & GIS models except the stakeholder concerns.

Then present work developed and analyzed the main approval
granting use case to identify and classify the stakeholders. A compre-
hensive literature survey was carried out to ﬁnd the different concerns in
GIS automating. Then the ﬁndings were discussed with the identiﬁed
stakeholders and those were modiﬁed and enhanced. To implement
those concerns when developing the tool, it attempted to apply the state
of art methods. If there is no proper method, then present work devel-
oped novel methods. When the tool was developed, it was evaluated with
the potential stakeholders. Later, based on their views, the tool was
further modiﬁed. This was repetitively done to reach to a substantial
satisfaction of stakeholders.

2.2. Outline of HydroGIS tool

The development of HydroGIS tool is aimed at supporting the pre-
vailing land approval procedure of urban development authority in Sri
Lanka. This procedure requires a land developer to submit a hardcopy
application containing details of a proposed development. At present the
approval granting system does not carry out a systematic hydrologic
evaluation and its impacts on ﬂood. The Land parcels in Thimbirigasyaya
municipal area in Colombo, Sri Lanka were selected as the spatial extent
for tool testing.

Then proposed HydroGIS tool compares the pre and post develop-
ment hydrology of the land allotment to grant approval with or without
modiﬁcations following the procedure shown in Fig. 1. At
the
commencement, the tool facilitates the decision maker to perform land
modiﬁcations (Phase one of Fig. 1). Then it visualizes modiﬁcation’s
effect on the runoff generation (Phase 2). Whilst Phase 3, the applicant
and the decision maker are facilitated to perform interactive modiﬁca-
tions by carrying out consultative modiﬁcations to identify the best
available alternative for sustainable ﬂood management.

The HydroGIS tool development used a cyclic approach to

systematically accomplish the stakeholder aspirations by carrying out
repeated evaluation of outputs against the objectives whilst the complex
hydrologic calculations automate separately. This speciﬁc software
development methodology is described in the previous work of the au-
thors [69].

2.3. Stakeholder requirements

2.3.1. Key stakeholders

Key stakeholder groups were identiﬁed thorough Critical evaluation
of the main use case which is granting the approval for land modiﬁca-
tions. It reveals that the stakeholders associated with urban ﬂood man-
four main groups; Group1 – The recipient
agement consist of
stakeholders whose desire is to receive the land development approvals
are the individual land owners or real estate/construction agents. Group
2 –The decision making stakeholders are the policymakers and regulators

granting approvals and they are mostly non-technical. System operators
who perform a mandatory role by transferring information back and
forth between the recipient stakeholder, regulators, decision makers, GIS
experts, and hydrologic modelers making a variety of decisions are also
grouped with decision makers. Group 3 –The expert group consisting of
hydrologic and GIS modelers are the technical stakeholders who imple-
ment the desires of both recipient and decision maker stakeholders.
Group 4 – System and software developers, including computer pro-
grammers who strive to deliver a tool of sufﬁcient quality tool facilitate
the decision-making process are the software developer stakeholders.

In practice hydro and GIS modelers are expected to deliver veriﬁed
models to software developers to incorporate codes for automation.
Thereafter software developers incorporate the tool requirements to suit
the decision makers and recipient stakeholders. In the present setting of
land approval, a land owner’s application is considered by the decision
makers in consultation with the tool operators who transfer the

4

R.M.M. Pradeep, N.T.S. Wijesekera

Array 8 (2020) 100037

requirements to the software developers. Therefore, in the present
development, the key roles considered are those of the decision maker
and the software developers.

2.3.2. Documented requirements

Identiﬁcation of requirements affecting the stakeholders was ﬁrst
carried out by evaluating the state of art and then by performing a
consultation of professionals for the conﬁrmation and ﬁlling of gaps.
Ramachandran [70] has urged to follow the best practices as those can
produce high quality software products while securing stakeholder re-
quirements and development costs. The system development methodol-
ogy is a fundamental best practice. Since 1960s’ different methodologies
are practiced, but today, the methods which are evolved to satisfy the
user requirements are popular [71]. However, Shmueli and Ronen [72]
warn the that greater attention on requirement development as it may
negatively affect the system development project schedule, quality and
cost.

When considering the HydroGIS tool development, Sui and Maggio
[73], review that the practice is either incorporation of GIS to hydrology
model or vice-versa. However, Shamsi [74], recommends the hydro
model to GIS software due to the modeling maturity of hydrology makes
the use of technical maturity of GIS platforms.

When considering the information security requirements of the tool,
the Department of Community Development of New Berlin city [75] has
paid a special attention to security and integrity of spatial land data. It
enhances the stakeholders’ conﬁdence by protecting the urban land in-
formation which are equally worth of urban lands. Further, Bertino et al.
[76], who seek the research directions in spatial data security, state that
the spatial data standards are important as it provides the interopera-
bility whilst maintaining the privacy.

The design requirements of Decision Support Systems (DSS) are
reasonably well documented. The study of Speier and Morris [77]; which
is on decision making accuracy, mental workload and time consumption
against the different user interfaces; reveals number of interface con-
siderations when addressing problems with increased complexity in dy-
namic environments. When Liang et al. [78], developed a land
management system to Dingzhuang city of China, it has been ideintifed
convenient and reversibility in operation, unanimity in interfaces and
simple feedback are as the major design principles. C(cid:2)azares-rodríguez el
al. [79], show that the DSS should provide not only the solutions but also
technical alternatives to develop stakeholders’ conﬁdence.

Assaf et al. [34], whilst attempting to incorporate stakeholders for
DSS system, found that the DSS should provide interactive graphical
based stakeholder decision making facility. Singh and Kumar’s [80] re-
view on the input data scale impacts on output found that the choice of
spatial data, data resolution and efﬁciency of processes are depending on
the stakeholders’ output requirements.

2.3.3. Professional view

A consultative survey to capture the aspirations of non-technical de-
cision makers and GIS system developers on the development of a
HydroGIS tool for urban ﬂood management was carried out with a
sample of 31 non-technical decision makers and four GIS system
developers.

The non-technical decision makers requested a software tool that can
be installed with ease, enables trouble free data entry, capable of data
manipulation without migrating to other tools, and facilitates a smooth
execution of computations with a simple “Next-Next button click” pro-
cess. Key requirements of the decision makers also included the need of a
tool capable of easy map utilization for data handling, presentation,
decision making and output map generation as hard copies. Speciﬁc re-
quests were for the maps that enable easy understanding of land modi-
ﬁcations, easy on screen map and attribute editing capability. Regarding
hydrologic outputs, the stakeholder requirement was to receive easily
understandable graphical results that could easily educate land owners.
Trial and error capability to carry out a variety of alternative land

modiﬁcations, and competency to view and analysis extra spatial infor-
mation by accessing base software whilst the tool is running were also
requested by the non-technical decision makers. However, the decision
makers as a critical concern cited the assurance of land information data
security preventing unauthorized independent access to database and
also preventing use of tool for unapproved alterations. System developers
were concerned about the difﬁculty of achieving data security when
using an off the shelf GIS platform for HydroGIS tool development.

System developers pointing to the challenge of achieving a user-
friendly GIS map based hydro model without having structured guide-
lines stressed the need to contribute towards better GIS-GUI development
guidelines. The other key concern raised was the time constraint for
modeler-developer interaction due to urgency for product development
by adhering to independent development of the front end and the back
end of tools. Developers highlighted the need for intensiﬁed stakeholder
interactions to achieve.

Finally, the following six requirement classes have been identiﬁed
from the literature review and stakeholder discussions were used as
guidance for HydroGIS tool development. These requirement classes are:
(1) Automated tool (2) Platform Selection/Suitable Base Software for the
tool (3) Software Development (4) System Security (5) Dynamic Decision
Making and (6) User Friendliness.

2.4. Stakeholder requirement integration

2.4.1. Automated tool and Platform Selection/Suitable Base Software for the
tool

The present work selected GIS as the base software whilst the hy-
drology model
is embedded using codes due to the technological
advancement of GIS software than hydrology modelling software. Then
HydroGIS tool was developed as a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) extension
to the off-the-shelf GIS software package, due to the ﬂexibility to the
users. ESRI’s ArcMap was selected as the base GIS software due to the
higher popularity among communities. The details of the automation are
described in author’s previous work [68].

2.4.2. Software development

The present work identiﬁed two main works whilst automation. One
is the accurate automation of hydrology model with GIS and other is
incorporating the user concerns sufﬁciently. Then a predictive develop-
ment method was used as the core for the tool development however,
whilst an adaptive development methodology with repetitive prototype
development was utilized as a hybrid methodology for the present user
interface development. In this effort, development works of both the user
interface and the hydro & GIS model computational modules were
simultaneously started by incorporating a combined modelling effort
thus reﬂecting a development model which oriented a process centric
development to achieve a user centric tool. The process is described in
the previous work by the authors [69].

2.4.3. System Security

The present work scenario requested two main functions; share the
spatial data with other authorities and identify unauthorized alterations;
which are partially available with the selected GIS software. Therefore, a
security stamp was incorporated to each spatial feature which enabled
the recognition of alterations and recognizing the nature of authoriza-
tion. The security stamp for each spatial feature was generated by a
simple mathematical model which combines the spatial and non-spatial
data of each spatial feature. In the developed HydroGIS tool, the user
authentication layer recognizes the authorized users to update the spatial
features. The security stamp concepts and veriﬁcation work which are
beyond the scope of the objectives of the present work are described in
authors previous work [81].

2.4.4. Dynamic decision making

Because of the dynamic decision making concern can be primarily

5

and backward the processes step by undo facility.

A user manual with descriptions and illustrations of the tool was
developed to support user friendliness. Further online assistance which
maintaining the styles of the main GIS platform’s online assistance was
developed. Formative evaluations were carried out for satisfaction of
these materials.

2.5. Evaluation with stakeholders

The tool was developed and tested with data of Thimbirigasyaya
Ward of Colombo municipal council, Sri Lanka. The initial stakeholder
satisfaction evaluation was carried out using a sample of 31 users. After
that, the resulted suggestions were appropriately incorporated and sub-
jected to the 1st formative evaluation with 34 users. Similarly, the 2nd
and 3rd evaluations and modiﬁcations were done with 31 and 34
stakeholder sets. After a comparison of the gradual increase of stake-
holder satisfaction in the key areas of concern, the HydroGIS was
accepted to submit for practical application.

A structured questionnaire was developed for easy tools testing. The
stakeholders after performing the tasks of land approval process using the
HydroGIS expressed their satisfaction levels as a percentage. The process
took special efforts to facilitate the stakeholders with both without tool
and with tool situations for the assessment of the advantages of the tool
during the evaluation. Testing was carried out with two sets of potential
system operators. One set participated in the ﬁrst three evaluations and
the ﬁnal evaluation with the other set was considered as tool veriﬁcation.
Finer details of the evaluation process are described in earlier work [82].

3. Results

3.1. The HydroGIS tool

The developed HydroGIS tool was named as “Geographic Information
Systems to Manage Urban Storm Water Considering Land Enhancement
(GIS2MUSCLE)”. Main window of tool (Fig. 2) was designed to maintain
the ~0.6 perimetric ratio – aka Golden Ratio, to achieve user-comfort.
The major user friendly features of the tool are the on-screen dynamic
map and attribute modiﬁcation capabilities (Fig. 3), clear visualization of
the changes to runoff coefﬁcients (Fig. 4) and display of information
pertaining to the storm water runoff before and after the land modiﬁ-
cations with effect of dynamic detention storage (Fig. 5).

3.2. Evaluation of stakeholders concerns

The step by step evaluation results are shown in the Table 1. Evalu-
ation of software development methodology was not included in the
stakeholder evaluation since the performance of the product as per
stakeholder requirements and delivered by following guideline methods
would reﬂect the appropriateness of the method used for software
development.

3.2.1. Automated tool

The initial evaluations received 72% satisfaction for the process
automation. The absence of adequate installation guidance and difﬁculty
to combine two adjacent land parcels and their attributes were the two
main suggestions that had to be incorporated. The next evaluation with
these additions received a 77% stakeholder satisfaction with a suggestion
to customize the attribute update method. This addition increased the
satisfaction level to only 78% since the stakeholders made a request to
further strengthen the onscreen installation assistance and map feature

parcel clipping action. Additionally, it shows three attribute update GUI parts
which appear after on-screen map modiﬁcations.

satisﬁed through trial-and-error facility, the tool is developed with
enabling the back and forth movement in process. Quick and repeated
backward movements with undo facility provide the opportunity for a
decision maker to rebound to an identiﬁed milestone. Further, the rapid
dynamic decision making is always hindered by delays in feeding man-
agement inputs. Therefore, the tool functionality presents default values/
suggestions that can be edited as necessary. Apart from that, as a measure
to reduce incorrect executions either due to data or procedure errors, the
tool design embedded a step wise requirement to obtain decision maker
conﬁrmation. Simultaneously, output presentations on map and cus-
tomizable charts also intend to assist quick decision making whilst dy-
namic decision making is made easy by enabling parallel use of tool and
the base software for actions such as customizing and printing maps. This
parallel access capability also enables the use of GIS software functions
for spatial data manipulation while providing the users a feeling that the
tool is a part of the familiar base software.

2.4.5. User friendliness

In the absence of guidelines to achieve user friendliness of GIS-GUI
extension, a GIS-GUI development guideline has been developed (see
authors’ previous work [82]). Then following such, the HydroGIS tool
developed to carryout onscreen land modiﬁcations, to compare the
executed land alterations, to easily add attributes and to perform sys-
tematic conﬁrmation of edits. Further, the tool designed to maximize
map visualization by reducing the GUI window space. To enhance user
conﬁdence the tool has been further developed to display the modiﬁca-
tions on a map with customized print facility. To achieve user friendly
easy operation, the tool designed to equipped with default data values

identiﬁcation with automatic highlighting facility. Incorporation of these
features raised the satisfaction level to 96%.

3.2.2. User friendliness

The ﬁnal tool prior to stakeholder evaluation received a very low
satisfaction rating of 46%. This evaluation resulted in requests for stan-
dardized GUI sizes, user friendly control and text labels, pop-up help
facility, facility to display progress of each GIS operation, feedback
messages for modiﬁcations, and on screen printing capability. Incorpo-
ration of these capabilities increased the tool satisfaction up to 65%.
Stakeholder concerns were to incorporate error messages with recovery
information, layer buttons with icons, maintenance of command button
and text integrity, and small size GUI with more map layouts. Incorpo-
ration of these improved the stakeholder satisfaction only up to 70%.
Stakeholders expected the improvement of professional attire in maps, a
size change of GUI during hydrograph manipulation, a user manual, vi-
sual clarity and enhancement of hydrograph display. Once these were
achieved the tool received a 92% satisfaction for user friendliness.

3.2.3. Incorporation of security

At the ﬁrst evaluation, the tool lacked a security option, and hence the
stakeholder satisfaction was 0%. The stakeholder sample also lacked
suggestions. In the next development stage, many options were attemp-
ted to secure the data from unauthorized manipulation. The option of
physical access control through a lock and key arrangement in a stand-
alone computer was incorporated. Stakeholders showed non-satisfaction
with a 0% satisfaction. The development strategy of the tool was changed

by considering that data security is a component solely to be handled by a
user authentication method within the Tool. In this effort the greatest
obstacle was to embed a method for an approved user to recognize any
unauthorized changed to data. The concept which was tested in the next
stakeholder evaluation received a 35% satisfaction. In this effort a novel
method that can identify both attribute and spatial feature changes was
developed. The proposed method which deviated from the convention-
ally preferred prevention methods, generates a soft key for the authorized
user to capture unauthorized changes and revert to a secured authenti-
cated setting. The details are included in authors’ previous work [81].
Incorporation of this procedure gained 89% satisfaction.

3.2.4. Base software selection

The selection of ArcGIS as the base software received a 65% stake-
holder satisfaction at the ﬁrst evaluation. The tool developed as a button
of ArcGIS map window in the second version increased the satisfaction to
72%. The stakeholder requirement for conjunctively use base software
functions whilst the tool been active was selectively embedded and
facilitation of these functionalities increased the satisfaction to 76%.
Subsequent stakeholder requirements to incorporate additional base
software functionality such as GIS layer manipulation modelling were
included. This capability to add most of the desired functionalities to the
HydroGIS for conjunctive use increased the stakeholder satisfaction of
base software selection to a value of 93%.

3.2.5. Dynamic nature

The most important dynamic nature, which is the capability to easily
and rapidly carry out undo and redo tool operations in the ﬁrst version of

7

Array 8 (2020) 100037

through integrating the land development and ﬂood management ac-
tivities. Then development of such tool must strike a balance between the
process automation and the achievement of stakeholder concerns &
conﬁdence. Another important consideration is the integration of hydro
model and GIS software (HydroGIS) which are the most required com-
ponents of urban land and ﬂood management.

Among the hydro-GIS integration options, integration of hydro model
into the GIS base software was selected since (1) GIS function automation
requires complex coding and testing which becomes a laborious and time
consuming task, (2) commercial or open source GIS platforms which are
specially developed to perform GIS functions accurately and efﬁciently
leads to better user conﬁdence while saving tool development efforts and
time and (3) availability of signiﬁcant developer-community for GIS
automation platforms. When considering the easy installation, the pre-
sent work focused on the best architectural option as development of the
HydroGIS tool to a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) extension in off-the-shelf
GIS software package, ArcMap.

Bhathal and Singh [83] found that the available security products are
insufﬁcient to fulﬁll the unique stakeholder requirements in new IT
paradigm like big-data management In the same way, there is a unique
stakeholder concern which is to secure the author’s data-dictatorship in
HydroGIS paradigm. In present setting, the intended spatial data of land
allotments are managed by both local authorities and water management
agencies. The possession of valuable urban land allotment boundaries,
attributes and their security are not exclusively handled by a single
agency, but simultaneously both need the ownership of the data. There
are several spatial data security studies such as watermark, hash algo-
rithms [84], GeoXACML [85] and Attribute Based Access Control [86],
but those do not provide the required functionalities. Hence, a novel
method was incorporated enabling the sharing of the dataset but
recognizing any alterations made to data. The security concerns
regarding the computations carried out by combining GIS functions also
poses a challenge. The stakeholder expectation was to giving security
related feedback whilst in the workﬂows rather than forensic analysis.
Therefore, for the automation of processes, the option of developing
codes that can be integrated to the security layer was chosen over the
readily available Model Builder tool of ArcMap software.

In the absence of guidelines to achieve user friendliness of GIS-GUI, a
novel guideline was developed following GNOME guideline of Benson
et al. [87], European Union BEST-GIS guideline [88] and visual consis-
tency guideline of Bloch [89]. It found that the fundamental rules of
buttons, texts, icons, windows and feedback messages are common to
HydroGIS tools too. However, to gain the maximum user friendliness, the
HydroGIS tools should provide more attention to user interface of hy-
drology calculations. Onscreen modiﬁcation of parameter data, dynamic
visual effect such as zoom in and out in hydrograph visualization and
real-time result display on maps are few of them. Further, the work
proved the successful application of the golden ratio for window sizes
according to Gustav Fechner (stated by Stone and Collins) [90]. Even
select a popular GIS base software to reduce the learning curves, it
developed a user manual with tutorial to increase user friendliness as per
Bloch’s [89] idea.

Overall, the dynamic nature of the tool gives the ﬂexibility to tech-
nical stakeholders to handle the hydrological parameter data such as
runoff coefﬁcient and designed rainfall values for local area whilst the
non-technical stakeholders to perform calculations for required land
parcels and customize ﬂood management options align with hydrological
requirements. Then these facilities ensure an active and lively environ-
ment for the stakeholders to carry out the desired functionalities with less
difﬁculties.

the tool received a stakeholder satisfaction of 58%. The stakeholders
required dynamic map modiﬁcations with undo facility and the addition
of this to the tool increased the satisfaction to 65%. However, the satis-
faction level could be increased to 72% by adding the stakeholder re-
quests to enable on screen dynamic changes to the hydrology parameter
changes and manipulation of layer classiﬁcation schema. At this stage of
evaluation, a general request was for dynamic visualization of hydrologic
results with the inclusion of a ﬂood detention facility in the land parcel.
These modiﬁcations enhanced the stakeholder satisfaction of the dy-
namic nature of the tool up to 93%.

3.2.6. Stakeholder conﬁdence

Stakeholder evaluations with the selected sample indicated an
average overall satisfaction level of 92%, which can be considered as a
very high achievement under the present setting of tools, methods and
guidance material. Stakeholder conﬁdence is always relative to the vis-
ibility of present mechanisms and with respect to the time required for
reliable outputs. The present HydroGIS demonstrated a vast improve-
ment compared with the prevailing setup and highlighted the conﬁr-
the success of developed tool using stakeholder based
mation of
recognition of issues and evaluation of achievements. The present tool
removed many decision making barriers to achieve the required services,
accuracy and security. The present work demonstrates the need, possi-
bility and method of incorporating the most essential stakeholder role
when developing an urban ﬂood mitigation decision tool.

4. Discussion

5. Conclusions

Sustainable urban land development management is considered as
the key to urban ﬂood management. Such sustainability can be achieved

The present study has identiﬁed numerous stakeholders through a
scientiﬁc approach. Among them, there are two main groups as non-
technical decision makers and system developers whose concerns are

the key for successful HydroGIS development. The main stakeholder
requirements of the HydroGIS tool were identiﬁed as, the development of
an automated tool, selection of a suitable software platform, method of
software development ensuring the incorporation of stakeholder aspira-
tions, Data and System Security, Dynamic Decision Making capability
and User Friendliness. More importantly, it incorporated the easy facil-
itation of hydrologically as well as a stakeholder/decision maker agreed
land development. Then present work could identify in-depth stake-
holder concerns and successfully incorporated into the HydroGIS tool
with the substantial satisfaction of the potential stakeholders.

The main contribution of the present work is a demonstration of how
to identify, evaluate, incorporate and verify the stakeholders and their
concerns which is lack of documentations for HydroGIS tool at present.
Whilst the other works paying attention to stakeholders concern on
output, the present work reveals that input, process and output re-
quirements also to be automated for easy decision making. Those are
practically implemented in the developed tool through providing in-
terfaces to technical and non-technical stakeholders to evaluate, adjust,
redo/undo and visualize hydro and GIS inputs, processes and outputs.

Further, the entire work has carried out a detailed study on; suitable
hybrid software development methodology for stakeholder concerns
incorporation [69], provide spatial data security for the scenario [81]
and GIS-GUI development guideline [82]. Then those proved that the
present work has carried out a substantial effort to ﬁll the identiﬁed
research gap.

Finally, the present work demonstrates the purport and the imple-
mentation of a structured development approach and the way to verify
the incorporation of urban ﬂood management stakeholders’ needs with
the scientiﬁc hydrology model.
