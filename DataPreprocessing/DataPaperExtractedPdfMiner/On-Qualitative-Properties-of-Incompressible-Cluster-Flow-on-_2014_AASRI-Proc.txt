2. Ring network 

A ring network is a set of rings on the plane. Rings touch each other in the common nodes. Multiplicity 
(number)  of  touches  in  one  node  is  not  more  than  two.  Let’s  classify  ring  networks  by  number  of  touches, 
number of common nodes for one ring. This value is constant, except rings, which are located on the border of 
the network. Besides, the notion "regular networks" includes equidistribution of common nodes on the ring. 

3. Isolated movement of uniform clusters 

Isolated  movement  of  clusters  in  the  ring  network  is  a  movement  of  each  cluster  on  its  own  ring  in  a 
certain direction with the rule FIFO (first input, first output) of common nodes. Let all clusters be uniform. 
That is, they have equal density and, therefore equal velocity. Since the relative measure of the set of initial 
conditions, that lead to the competition of clusters for a common node within a limited period of time, equal 
to  zero,  we  will  not  consider  possible  scenarios  of  settling  conflicts.  However,  if  it  is  significant,  we  can 
consider the equiprobable method of regulating movement of two clusters through a common node.

4. Quantitative characteristics of movement 

Quantitative  characteristics  of  movement  both  on  a  separate  contour  and  in  the  network  as  a  whole  are 
considered.  As  previous  researches  have  shown[1],[2],[3],  the  movement  in  such  networks,  and  for  close 
movement rules of masses, has a number of interesting properties, such as self-adjustment of the system with 
minimization of conflicts (synergy), complete stoppage of movement (collapse), spectrum of velocities and 
others. 

Further  the  average  velocity  in  the  network  v*

nw  is  a  relative  measure  of  moving  clusters  in  the  fixed 
moment. Since each cluster either stops or moves with equal velocity, the average velocity is equal to constant 
v0 with relative measure of those part of clusters, which is moving now. Further let be 

1

. 

0 (cid:32)v

Similarly, the average velocity on the ring, with assumptions we have made above, is a relative measure 
of time in movement conditions of appropriate cluster. There are possible local manifestations of synergy and 
collapse, and other scenarios of complicated movement, which is also an object of research.

5. Two-element open necklace (molecule) 

The considered network consists of rings with one common node. Thus, the network structure is defined.

If xi, 0 ≤ i ≤ 1 are the lengths of clusters, every initial condition where a common node belongs to only one 

cluster is acceptable. 

Proposition 5.1: If x1 + x2  ≤ 2π, then for all acceptable initial positions, the system goes into a synergy 

state during the time of a complete turn. 

Proof: Is evident. 
Proposition 5.2: If x1 + x2  > 2π, then

Proof: The time of the clusters passage through the common node is equal to x1 + x2, with velocity equal to 
1. The time of a complete turn of each cluster during free movement is equal to 2π. Thus, the relative part of 
movement is defined by equation (1). 

6. Two-element closed necklace 

The simple variant of the network with two nodes on each contour is considered. 
Proposition 6.1: If x1 + x2  ≤ 2π, then synergy starts after limited period of time for all initial conditions. 
Proof: Is evident. 
Proposition 6.2: If min(x1,x2) > π, then collapse starts for all acceptable initial conditions. 
Proof: If the cluster K2 is approaching common node B. Then K1 must go through this node at this period 
of time, since node A is occupied by K2. Obviously, K2 can't go through B and stops, so K1 can't go through A. 

Proposition 6.3: If min(x1,x2) < π, then

Proposition 7.2: If  (cid:5) I = 1, …, 2n – 1; xi + xi+1 < 2π, then there are initial conditions, that are leading to 

synergy. 

Proof:  The  biggest  cluster  is  selected.  Further,  it  is  connected  to  the  neighbor  cluster.  Each  neighbor  is 
connected to their neighbor cluster and this gets a conflict-free distribution for the open necklace at the initial 
moment of time. 

Proposition 7.3: If  (cid:7) I, 1 ≤ I ≤ 2n – 1so, that xi + xi+1  > 2π, then 
Proof: Proper neighbor node can’t supply both clusters during any period of time, if cluster movement is

Proposition 8.1: If 

then there are initial conditions, that are leading to collapse for a short period of time.

Proposition 8.2: If

then for all initial conditions the collapse will start in a time period equal to half of the turnover period. 

Proof: If any i-cluster is located in both nodes, then at the current time (i-1) and (i+1) clusters are located 
in one node and the same arrangement with appropriate neighbor clusters. Then there is a cluster with length 
greater than π. This cluster is the last one without a node in this odd chain, so we receive a contradiction.

then there are initial conditions, that are leading to synergy. 

Proof: Follow from Fig. 5. 
Proposition 8.4:  If  (cid:5) I, 1 ≤ I ≤ 2n then xi + xi+1 ≤ 2π, is true and there are initial conditions that lead to 

synergy in a time period, equal to the turnover period. 

Proof: The structure from  Fig. 5.  All clusters are located symmetrically to (for example) position π/2 at 

the initial period of time. 

9. Potential flow function 

A closed necklace consisting of 2n rings is considered. The location of the cluster has been described on 

each contour by the indicator function f (t,x,K) = {1, x (cid:143) K; 0, x (cid:144)  K}, Ki = [ai (t),bi (t)], fi (t,x) = f (t,x,Ki).

where all contour pairs with one common node are summate. 

Some properties for function U are specified.

intersect and U(t) is equal to the maximum possible value 2nd. 

Proof: For both closed and open two-element necklaces this feature is verified using the following method: 
currently, each node is assigned one of three values Xi:1, if the proper item is nearly equal to t and is constant. 
Thus, there is a defined partially-linear function in the ordered and consecutively numbered set of nodes with 
values  0,1,-1,  according  to  vectors  X  =  (X1,...,  X2n).  It's  easy  to  see,  that  the  sum  of  coordinates  of  this 
periodical vector gives us a criterion of monotony U(t):

There  is  a  one-to-one  correspondence  between  each  coordinate  -1  of  vector  X  and  coordinate  1.  Indeed, 
coordinate -1 means, that neighbor contours don't interact, and are in anti-phase, moreover one of the clusters 
is located before the node, for example, on the right. Thus, on the right of coordinate -1 there is coordinate 1. 
While on the left of coordinate -1 there can't be coordinate -1. So, the sum of coordinates of vector X is non-
negative.  From  another  point,  there  are  nodes  with  interacting  contours  if  the  system  didn't  reach  maximal 
value. In this case, in order for the rate of change of the potential function to be equal to zero, it is necessary 
for interacting clusters and neighbor clusters with a negative velocity to be located in a definite location, that 
excludes constancy of the potential function. 

Proposition  9.3:  If  |Ki| = d,  i=1,..2n, d ≤ π, then  for  every initial condition  (cid:7) T*  < ∞, that  V(t) ≡ 2nd  = 

maxV(t)

(cid:5) t > T*. 

10. Program modeling 

The newly developed NODE model software allows for the creation of a cluster movement simulation in a 
closed necklace consisting of 2n rings. You can locate clusters, specify length and density of clusters and set 
the number of rings in the necklace n. Adjacent nodes are marked by a vertical line, which is crossing proper 
contours. 

The  software  calculates  and  simulates  a  movement  of  clusters  and  creates  a  diagram  of  the  potential 

function U(t). 

As  a  result,  by  means  of  the  NODE  model  software,  some  statements  about  the  potential  function  U(t), 
previously specified, are proven. Particularly, we proved that the function U(t) is a monotonous function and 
it reaches its maximal value 2nd in all initial conditions in a limited period of time.
