Abstract 

The ultra long tube models of single walled armchair (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes with different ratios of B, C and N atoms 
were  studied  with  density  functional  theory  of  B3LYP/3-21G*  and  the  periodic  boundary  conditions.  The  (2,2)  B-C-N 
nanotubes have specially serrated tube structures. The energies were calculated and the band gaps of tubes were within 
0.062 eV to 3.874 eV showing metal, semiconductor or insulator conductivity.

1. Introduction 

The ternary system boron carbide nitride (B-C-N) nanotubes have attracted extraordinary attention in past 
ten years in virtue of  potentially interesting properties. The tubes synthesized by CVD experiment were found 
to  be  of  semiconductor  conductivity[1].  Photoluminescence  studies  revealed  that  aligned  B-C-N  nanotubes 
were also semiconductors exhibiting a band gap of 1.0eV[2]. Additionally, BC2N nanotubes might act as blue 
and violet light emitting materials such as an efficient field emitter[3–4].

The  thinnest  armchair  carbon  nanotube  of  (2,2)  tubes  was  supposed  in  multi-walled  carbon  nanotubes 
(MWCNTs) preparation[5] and the cluster models of (2,2) tubes was studied by theory method[6]. In present 
work,  the  (2,2)  B-C-N  tubes  with  different  atom  ratio or  the  isomers  with  different  atom  arrangement  were 
studied in the ultra long tube models, it was extended the research to their structure and band structure. 

2. Calculation method 

The  density  functional  theory  functional  (B3LYP  3-21G*)  and  periodic  boundary  conditions  (PBC)  for 
one-dimensional  models  were  employed  by  the  Gaussian  series  packages[7]  in  this  paper.  All  the  tube 
structures,  model  energies  and  the  band  gaps  were  obtained  by  the  theoretical  calculation  for  optimized 
models. 

3. Result 

3.1. Structure parameter 

For  the  (2,2)  B-C-N  nanotubes  with  different  atom  ratios  (the  C  atom  ratios  of  1/4,  1/2  and  3/4)  and  
different  atom  arrangements,  eight  stable  models  were found  and  examined  as  shown  in  Figure  1(a)  to  (h). 
The tube structure parameters optimized with B3LYP/3-21G* were listed in Table 1.

As  shown  in  figure  1,  the  (2,2)  B-C-N  nanotubes  have  serrated  tubular  structures  as  the  pristine  (2,2) 
carbon nanotube(CNT)[8]. It was found that there were two different kinds of chemical bond, which were the 
perpendicular (circumferential) bond lengths L1(the subscript 1 denotes the bond being perpendicular to the 
tube axis) and the oblique(axial) bond L2(the subscript 2 denotes the bond being oblique with respect to the 
tube  axis), respectively. For most  of  (2,2) B-C-N  models,  L1were  larger  than  that  of  the pristine (2,2)  CNT 
where L1=0.1373 nm but  L2 were smaller than that  of the (2,2) CNT where L2=0.1512 nm[8]. 

The cross sections of (2,2) B-C-N tubes were distorted. Tube larger diameter (DL) or smaller diameter (DS) 
of  tube  models  denoted  the  largest  or  shortest  distance  of  two  atoms  in  a  same  cross  section.  The  slightly 
distorted  models  were  with  the  values  of  DL/DS  being  1.070  for  the  models  BC6N(II)  but  larger  values  of 
DL/DS being 1.212 for the models B4C2N2(II).  

The Mülliken atomic charges were obtained. The doped atom B were found to be positive values (about 
0.66~0.85e)  and  those  of  the  N  atom  were  negative  value  (about  -0.82~-0.59e),  respectively.  The  Mülliken 
charge was negative value for C atom adjacent to B atom but positive value for them adjacent to N atom. The 
results were  in  accordance with  the  electrone-gativities  of  B,  C  and N  atoms  (respectively  being  2.04, 2.55 
and 3.04 on the Pauling scale) [9].

3.2. Energy 

The doping energy ( Ed) as shown in Eq. (1) denoted the energy change between the doped and the pure 

cells averaged for each atom in the gas phase. 

Ed = [Ed,BxCyNz-NT – ECNT + (natom-y)EC atom – (x EB atom+zEN atom)] / natom                              (1) 
in which, Ed, Ed,BxCyNz-NT and ECNT denoted the energies of the unit cell model of the respective the (2,2) B-
C-N nanotube and the pristine CNT; EC atom, EN atom and EC atom denoted the energies of the single atom B, N 
and C; natom(i.e., natom =x+y+z =8 for (2,2) tube) was the number of the total atoms in a unit model. The doping 
energies  Ed for the (2,2) B-C-N nanotube models obtained by Eq.(1) were detailed in Table 2.  

It was obvious that the model (I) where the C atom ratio being  3/4 (i.e., BC6N(I) and BC6N(II)) were the 
more stable conformation due to the lower doping energies  Ed. For the same atom ratio models,  Ed of (I) 
was lower than (II) and (III), representing that the model (I) was the most stable conformation.

3.3. Energy gap 

The one-dimensional  band structures of armchair (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes in the Brillouin zone for different 
models were shown in Figure 2. The energies of the high occupied crystal orbits (HOCO) (EHOCO), the low 
unoccupied crystal orbits (LUCO) (ELUCO) and the band gap (Eg= ELUCO - EHOCO) were detailed in Table 3. 

The default k point of wave vector was adopted in this work. 

 point was the centre of the first Brillouin 
  point  to  X  point  was  a  half  of  Brillouin  zone.  It  was  found  the  models  of  B2C4N2(I),  B4C2N2, 
zone  and 
B3C2N3(I)  and  B3C2N3  (III)  have  direct  band  gaps  where  the  maximum  of  valence  bands  (occupied  bands 
described  by  solids  curves)  and  the  minimum  of  conduction  bands  (unoccupied  bands  described  by  dashed 
curves) being in a same k point. For the rest models, the band gaps show indirect gaps where the maximum of 
valence band and the minimum of conduction band being in different k point. The maximum of direct band 
gaps for the most of models were at X point besides of the models of B2C4N2 and C2B3N3(II).

We have found (2,2) carbon nanotube[8] showing semiconductor  whereas BN-NTs[10] being isolator. It 
was interesting that the energy gap values of  (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes were within 0.062 to 3.874 eV showing 
metal,  semiconductor  or  insulator  conductivity.  However,  the  band  structure  values  or  types  depending  on 
both  the  atom  ratios  and  the  types  of  atom  arrangement.  It  was  found  the  B4C2N2  showed  the  strongest 
metallic  with  the  structure  having  two  adjacent  B  atoms.  The  models  [BC6N(I),  B2C4N2(I)  and  B3C2N3(I)] 
containing  the  alternant  straight  -C-C-C-C  and  -B-N-B-N-  strain  were  typical  semiconductor  conductivity 
whereas BC6N(II), B2C4N2(II) and B3C2N3 (II) had larger gap.

4. Summary 

The ultra long model of single walled armchair (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes with different ratios of B, C and 
N  atoms  were  studied  with  density  functional  theory  of  B3LYP/3-21G*.  The  (2,2)  B-C-N  nanotubes  have 
serrated  tubular  structures.  The  band  gaps  of  tubes  were  within  0.062  to  3.874  eV  showing  metal, 
semiconductor  or  insulator  conductivity,  which  depend  on  both  the  atom  ratios  and  the  types  of  atoms 
arrangement.
