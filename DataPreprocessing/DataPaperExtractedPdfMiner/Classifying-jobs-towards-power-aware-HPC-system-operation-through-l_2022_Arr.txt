The efficient utilization of high-performance computing (HPC) system resources under rigorous electric power
budget or I/O workload constraints is among the most important goals set by system operators to deal with
the demanding requirements of application users. In most cases, the effective utilization of CPU and memory
devices, which is tightly linked to electric power consumption, is a counterpart metric of I/O activities in most
HPC jobs. Towards higher utilization of HPC systems under strict electric power consumption and I/O activity
management constrains, we must be careful to prevent hot-spots from developing in power consumption
or I/O operations that could lead to unstable system operations by exceeding electric power supply or I/O
subsystem capabilities. One of the feasible solutions is arranging compute node assignment not to have such
hot-spots in electric power or I/O operations. To address this issue, we analyzed vast amounts of log data
collected from the K computer and found strong positive correlations between CPU and memory device
utilization rates and electric power consumption levels. On the one hand, we also observed strong negative
correlations and reduced electric power consumption in relation to file I/O activities in a specific compute
node-layout, thereby indicating unique characteristics in some I/O-intensive HPC jobs in the node-layout. Our
investigation revealed that HPC jobs could be divided into two groups when classified in terms of required
electric power — jobs consuming high electric power levels and I/O-intensive jobs with reduced electric power
levels. Then, we achieved high levels of accuracy when classifying jobs in terms of electric power levels
using RandomForestClassifier among multiple machine learning classification models provided from
scikit-learn. The classification can prevent us from hot-spots in electric power consumption in compute
node assignment in job scheduling. Thus we demonstrated efficient job classifications towards power-aware
system operations in the supercomputer Fugaku, which is the successor to the K computer.

1. Introduction

In our current era, high-performance computing (HPC) systems
with huge numbers of CPU cores are now approaching exascale per-
formance levels. The primary mission of HPC systems is to provide
stable computing resources with high levels of utilization and usability
under specific constraints such as established power consumption and
I/O workload levels. However, increases in computing power require
advanced storage systems of a similar scale with equally high I/O
performance levels. Additionally, current and future HPC systems must
accommodate wide varieties of jobs, including compute-, memory-, and
I/O-intensive applications. In such situations, we have found that high
utilization levels of CPU and memory devices tend to lead to high
electric power consumption levels, while I/O-intensive operations tend
to result in reduced electric power usage.

Our current HPC system, the supercomputer Fugaku [1] (here-
inafter, Fugaku), is the successor to the K computer. Compared with
the K computer, Fugaku has advanced management functions for elec-
tric power consumption that ensure more stable and effective electric
power usage [2,3]. Even though the K computer was decommissioned
in August 2019, analyses of its power consumption during HPC job
executions have already provided some useful hints for more power-
aware operations using Fugaku. This is because, over its years of the
K computer operation, we collected a wide variety of system logs and
job stats, including performance counters related to CPU and memory
devices, file I/O activities, and even environmental metrics such as
system board airflow and CPU cooling water temperatures. However,
since the K computer did not have any electric power measurement
devices in its compute node modules, it was necessary to estimate

the electric power of each compute node using the abovementioned
temperature information and statistical information from our previous
study [4].

Our log analyses regarding jobs executed in the K computer revealed
unique correlations among CPU, memory, file I/O activities, and the
compute node-layouts used. After further analysis, we determined that
jobs could be split into two groups based on electric power levels
— jobs requiring higher electric power levels due to high CPU and
memory device utilization and jobs consuming relatively lower levels
of electric power such as I/O-intensive applications. These preliminary
results were reported in our conference paper [5]. Additional analyses
were made by using an additional classification model to examine the
usefulness of our approach. We also modified evaluation scheme for the
classification models by introducing Matthews Correlation Coefficients
(MCC) [6]. Furthermore, we conducted factor loading analyses of the
metrics used to examine contribution rates. Our approach, which we
discuss in this paper, is based on the following two-step method. First,
we analyze correlation coefficients among the metrics used in job
stats. Then, based on the results obtained in the first step, we perform
classifications using those metrics and a machine learning (ML) scheme.
The classification process leverages useful information towards more
effective power-aware compute node allocation and job scheduling that
is expected to be useful not only for Fugaku but for other HPC platforms
as well.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
present an overview of the K computer, including the file I/O sub-
systems and electric power-related metrics. Correlation analysis using
job stats log is then reported in Section 3, followed by a prediction
model discussion based on an ML approach in Section 4. We then
discuss related work in Section 5 before finally concluding the paper
and discussing our future work plans in Section 6.

2. K computer and its electric power log collection

2.1. K computer overview

After seven years of system operations, the K computer was decom-
missioned in August 2019. During its operational period, vast amounts
of log data on system operations, facility operations, and job stats
log were collected from the K computer, and were analyzed not only
for root-cause information concerning system failures or performance
degradation but also by researchers searching for ways to improve
system operation quality. Fig. 1 shows an overview of the K computer.
The K computer consisted of 82,944 compute nodes and 5,184 I/O
nodes. In operation, the compute nodes and I/O nodes were connected
via high speed and low latency interconnects named Tofu [7] developed
by Fujitsu. In the two-level file system that was introduced for the K

computer, the local file system (LFS) was a scratch high-performance
storage space dedicated to file I/O operations during computations,
while the global file system (GFS) was used to store programs and data
with high redundancy. An enhanced Lustre file system named Fujitsu
Exabyte File System (FEFS) [8] that was based on Lustre version 1.8
was used to build both of the K computer file systems. When combined
with asynchronous file staging scheme [9], this two-level file system
improved job scheduling efficiency and mitigated I/O interference.

Each compute node in the K computer had about 150 GB of local
disk space on the LFS, and every HPC job was assigned to compute
nodes with guaranteed amounts of available disk space. Free disk space
up to 100 GB per node was set for job scripts using the node-quota
option. However, when the node-quota description was not given in
job scripts, a minimum size (14 GB per node) was set as the default.
Specified programs or datasets in a job script were copied from the GFS
to the assigned disk space on the LFS in the stage-in phase. After job
execution, the specified output data in the script were copied back from
the LFS to the GFS in stage-out phase. When asynchronous file staging
was used in the K computer, successive HPC jobs could jump to the
stage-in phase once the K computer job scheduler system found enough
disk space for the jobs on target compute nodes. For other queued jobs,
the job scheduler system conducted periodic checks of the compute
nodes until the required disk space was available and then matched
those jobs to the appropriate compute nodes.

Fig. 2 depicts the configuration of compute nodes and I/O nodes
in a single cabinet of the K computer associated with the LFS. Every
cabinet consisted of two system racks, and each system rack consisted
of 96 compute nodes and six I/O nodes. Compute nodes and I/O nodes
were connected through the Tofu interconnect in a six-dimensional
(6D) mesh/torus network represented by 𝑋, 𝑌 , 𝑍, 𝐴, 𝐵, and 𝐶. Tofu
links of 𝑋, 𝑍 and 𝐵 were connected in a torus configuration, while
those of 𝑌 , 𝐴, and 𝐶 were connected in a mesh configuration.

Compute node allocation for each job was configured based on
the number of compute nodes or the node-layout specified in a job
script in a three-dimensional (3D) rather than 6D manner, in which
the first dimension represented 𝑋 × 𝐴, the second represented 𝑌 × 𝐵,
and the third represented 𝑍 × 𝐶. The minimum unit of compute node
allocation in the K computer consisted of 12 compute nodes configured
by the 2 × 3 × 2 in a 3D way. This layout was also represented by
1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 3 × 2 in a 6D expression. Therefore, if a specific node-
layout was desired, the users needed to give multiple numbers of 2, 3,
and 2 in the first, second, and third dimensions in a 3D manner. The
job scheduler searched for free adjacent compute nodes in a block-wise
manner using a variety of 3D patterns in which the number of nodes
in each axis was an integral multiple of the number of nodes in the
corresponding axis in the minimum unit. If a job script specified the
number of nodes or node-layout that did not fit the above condition,
the job scheduler attempted to meet the number of required compute
nodes by adding additional compute nodes in a way that allowed the
node-layout to fit the above conditions. The job scheduler also allocated
compute nodes among 3D candidates by rearranging the number of
nodes in each axis if there were no node-layout restrictions.

Note that the 𝑍-link torus configuration depicted by the vertical
connections in this figure was only available in I/O accesses through
I/O nodes. Once the compute node-layout was fixed, I/O nodes on
the same 𝑍-links were assigned to handle the I/O operations, and I/O
paths were routed to the corresponding I/O nodes with the help of
IO zoning scheme [10]. This I/O zoning scheme was introduced to
mitigate I/O interference happened at Object Storage Targets (OSTs)
and I/O nodes by assigning I/O nodes and OSTs to the same 𝑍-link used
by the compute nodes. In other cases, application jobs used the 𝑍-link
in the mesh configuration for inter-node communications. Since I/O
node-layout of the K computer was dependent on the compute node-
layout facilitated by the I/O zoning scheme, some I/O-intensive jobs
tended to specify fixed 3D node-layouts to guarantee I/O performance.
In such cases, the most promising way to avoid I/O interference was

found to be placing all the compute nodes on the same 𝑍-link by giving
32 ( = 16 × 2) in the last dimension of the 3D node-layout in the job
submission. This specification resulted in compute node layouts ranging
from 𝑍 = 1 to 16 at 𝐶 = 0 and 1 with the same values in 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝑋, and
𝑌 within the same cabinet.

2.2. Electric power log collection

As mentioned above, since the K computer did not have any electric
power measurement devices, we established a prediction model [4]
using the following two averaged temperature differences among the
following temperature sensors:

• Temperature sensors for CPU and inlet cooling water at each

compute node module (𝛥𝑇𝐶𝑃 𝑈 )

• Temperature sensors for inlet and outlet of air-flow at each system

board consisting of four compute node modules (𝛥𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑟)

We observed that the consumed electric power had strong correlation
with 𝛥𝑇𝐶𝑃 𝑈 and 𝛥𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑟. Therefore we assumed that the electric power
was proportional to the two temperature values. We obtained each
coefficient as a mean value using measured data about 33,500 jobs from
April 2014 to November 2014. The following formula was obtained to
predict the electric power used for the K computer (𝑃𝐾 ) in our previous
study [4]:

𝑃𝐾 [MW] = 0.802393382361262 × 𝛥𝑇𝐶𝑃 𝑈

+ 0.345223838880426 × 𝛥𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑟
+ 7.67202252302052

In order to evaluate correctness of the obtained formula, we made
regression analysis between measured electric power and estimated
one at the special rack which equipped with electric power meter for
this analysis. Consequently, we confirmed that the formula achieved
enough correctness through about 13,000 jobs from December 2014 to
February 2015 [4].

Note that the 10 MW value referred to electric power without any
computation and I/O loads, and it was included in the 𝑃𝐾 [4]. In
order to characterize each job through electric power fluctuations,
electric power values per compute node without the 10 MW (𝑃𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒)

were obtained by 𝑃𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒[MW] = (𝑃𝐾 [MW] − 10[MW])∕82944, where
82,944 is the total number of compute nodes in the K computer. Note
that the power measurement was carried out for the prediction study,
and we did not have any electric power data in the usual system
operation. Therefore, we have utilized the above formula to predict
electric power during the usual system operation.

The disk utilization ratio relative to the allocated disk space pro-
vides another insight into the file I/O status of each job and its
associated activities. In general, CPU and memory device utilization,
both of which are tightly associated with electric power consumption,
tend to decrease with an increase in I/O operation workload and vice
versa. Additionally, the same or similar job scripts are likely to be
used repeatedly in HPC jobs [11]. This indicates that investigating I/O
activities from past job stats log data can be expected to yield insights
about the electric power levels of each job. The results of such analyses,
when combined with job stats log data collected from the K computer,
can be expected to provide useful information towards ensuring more
power-aware HPC system operations in Fugaku.

For system operation analysis, we collected many metrics including
predicted electric power in the PostgreSQL database. Stored informa-
tion was accessible through our dashboard service built by Redash [12].
Some of principal metrics are listed in Table 1.

Note that 𝑃𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 values were predicted at five-minute increments
during each job execution, and the log information kept the maxi-
mum, minimum, and mean values of 𝑃𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 in 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒, and 𝑃 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 ,
respectively. We could have various offline analysis by extracting target
metrics from the redash service.

3. Correlation analysis of HPC job activities

Through our I/O activity analyses using job stats log data collected

from the K computer, the following questions arose:

• How much of the allocated disk space specified by node-quota did

the users utilize?

• Which metrics were most tightly related to I/O activities and

electric power?

• How can we include electric power awareness when classifying

HPC jobs for compute node allocations?

In our search for answers, using job stats log data from the second
half term of 2016 to the first half term of 2018 of the Japanese fiscal
year, we selected the following metrics for each job that ran equal to or
more than 10 min without any errors in the largest queue class named
‘‘large’’. There were two reasons for using log data during this two-year
term; the second half term of 2016 was chosen as the start time because
of also marked the establishment of the abovementioned electric power
prediction process using temperature log data, while the first half term
of 2018 was selected as the end time because we began conducting
cooling system examinations (in which cooling water temperatures
were intentionally changed) from the second term of 2018. This meant
we could not use the estimation model to predict electric power during
that period.

The following metrics were used from the log data:

• 𝑁𝑄: The allocated disk space per node by node-quota
• 𝑁𝐷𝑍 : The number of allocated compute nodes in Tofu 𝑍-link

direction

• 𝑅𝐷: The ratio of used disk space relative to the assigned disk space

specified by the node-quota option

• 𝑅𝐼∕𝑂: The ratio of used disk space relative to the maximum

achievable amount of I/O size

• 𝑅𝐹 : The ratio of sustained FLOPS relative to the peak FLOPS
• 𝑅𝑀 : The ratio of sustained memory bandwidth utilization relative

• 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥

to the theoretical bandwidth
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒: The maximum electric power per compute node in situa-
tions where the electric power basement has been removed

Note that the ‘‘large’’ queue class covered about 90% of the K computer
compute nodes and accepted jobs using from 385 to 36,864 compute
nodes. Hereinafter, we describe jobs executed in this queue class as
large jobs.

While four of the abovementioned metrics are related to file I/O
activities, the rest are related to electric power. The two file I/O-related
metrics, 𝑅𝐷 and 𝑅𝐼∕𝑂, are clarified as follows:

𝐷𝐼∕𝑂 = 𝑆𝐼∕𝑂∕𝑁𝐷𝑋 ∕𝑁𝐷𝑌 ∕𝑁𝐷𝑍

𝑅𝐷 = 𝐷𝐼∕𝑂∕𝑁𝑄

𝑅𝐼∕𝑂 = 𝐷𝐼∕𝑂∕𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑁𝑄, 𝐵𝑊 𝑚𝑎𝑥

𝐼∕𝑂 × 𝑇 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑡
𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑝𝑠𝑒)

𝐼∕𝑂 , and 𝑇 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑡

𝐷𝐼∕𝑂, 𝐵𝑊 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑝𝑠𝑒 are the actual file I/O size per node, max-
imum I/O bandwidth, and elapsed time limit, respectively. Note that
𝐵𝑊 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑝𝑠𝑒 is an achievable maximum I/O size amount if a job
utilizes 100% of the I/O bandwidth and is within the elapsed time

𝐼∕𝑂 × 𝑇 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑡

limit. However, it is limited by the node-quota. In this study, we assume
100 MB/s for 𝐵𝑊 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝐼∕𝑂 .

It was noted that I/O-intensive jobs tended to require compute
nodes in the fixed 3D node-layout in order to prevent I/O-intensive
applications from encountering I/O interference from other jobs. Con-
sequently, such jobs achieved high I/O bandwidth levels. However,
the CPU and memory utilization ratios of such jobs were lower than
those in other node-layout cases. Additionally, since jobs set in the
fixed 3D node-layout tended to utilize larger amounts of disk space
compared with other node-layout cases, we found some dependency
in the required compute node-layout in terms of file I/O.

The job stats were analyzed separately based on the requested
compute node-layout in one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D),
and 3D shapes. In the log information, 1D jobs had the number of
nodes only in 𝑅𝐸𝑄𝑋 and zero in 𝑅𝐸𝑄𝑌 and 𝑅𝐸𝑄𝑍 . 2D jobs had the
numbers in 𝑅𝐸𝑄𝑋 and 𝑅𝐸𝑄𝑌 and zero in 𝑅𝐸𝑄𝑍 . Lastly, 3D jobs had
the numbers in 𝑅𝐸𝑄𝑋 , 𝑅𝐸𝑄𝑌 , and 𝑅𝐸𝑄𝑍 . Since the number of 2D
jobs was negligibly small compared with 1D and 3D jobs, we analyzed
1D and 3D jobs from the large jobs. The 3D jobs were further separated
into two groups, with and without changes in the compute node-layout,
where we describe them as ‘‘3D(malleable)’’ and ‘‘3D(same)’’,
respectively. We separated 3D jobs into the 3D(same) if

(𝑅𝐸𝑄𝑋 = 𝑁𝐷𝑋 ) ∧ (𝑅𝐸𝑄𝑌 = 𝑁𝐷𝑌 ) ∧ (𝑅𝐸𝑄𝑍 = 𝑁𝐷𝑍 )

Otherwise we separated the job into the 3D(malleable) in this
study. Correlation analyses were performed among 𝑅𝐷, 𝑅𝐹 , and 𝑅𝑀 ,
where 𝑅𝐷 represents file I/O activities and 𝑅𝐹 and 𝑅𝑀 correspond to
computing activities. As mentioned previously, higher file I/O activities
in an HPC job tend to indicate lower electric power levels. In contrast,
higher computing activities in an HPC job tend to result in increased
electric power. For these correlation coefficient evaluations, we utilized
a Python module; and to eliminate the dependency of individual corre-
lation functions, we utilized the following three correlation functions
provided by the SciPy [13] package:

3.1. Correlation between 𝑅𝐷 and 𝑅𝐹

Since it is understood that I/O-intensive applications tend to lower
CPU utilization rates, we next examined the correlation between 𝑅𝐷
and 𝑅𝐹 with colored plots describing 𝑁𝑄 and 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥

𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 in Fig. 3.

In Fig. 3(a), it can be seen that the higher 𝑅𝐷 we have, the lower
𝑅𝐹 we achieved, and vice versa. It is also noted that several red-
colored plots near zero for 𝑅𝐷 are jobs that showed low disk space
utilization even though large amounts of disk space had been allocated
by the higher 𝑁𝑄 value. Separately, Fig. 3(b) indicates that some jobs
achieved a higher ratio in 𝑅𝐹 while they achieved a quite low ratio
near zero in 𝑅𝐷, thus resulting in higher electric power consumption.
Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) show that the jobs in this group are localized
with low values in both 𝑅𝐷 and 𝑅𝐹 in the case of 3D(malleable)
jobs, and that the 𝑁𝑄 values given in this case are also small. Mean-
while, 3D(same) jobs in Figs. 3(e) and 3(f) show two distinct groups.
Here, one group consists of I/O oriented jobs spreading from zero to one
in 𝑅𝐷 and localizing around zero in 𝑅𝐹 , while the other group consists
of compute-intensive jobs achieving higher ratios in 𝑅𝐹 , followed by
achieving higher 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥

𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒, as shown in Fig. 3(f).

3.2. Correlation between 𝑅𝐷 and 𝑅𝑀

Since memory bandwidth utilization is another key metric that
tightly corresponds to electric power, we examined correlation between
𝑅𝐷 and 𝑅𝑀 using colored plots describing 𝑁𝑄 and 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒, as shown in
Fig. 4.

The correlation between 𝑅𝐷 and 𝑅𝐹 shows similar behavior. Con-
cerning the 1D jobs shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), we can see that jobs
with lower 𝑅𝐷 tend to achieve higher ratios in 𝑅𝑀 , and that such
higher 𝑅𝑀 leads to higher 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒. It is also noted that we could separate
the 1D jobs into three groups about the 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 along 𝑅𝑀 , as shown in

Fig. 4(b). The lower group up to about 30 W contained jobs ranging up
to 0.2 in 𝑅𝑀 , the next group from about 30 W to about 60 W contained
jobs ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 in 𝑅𝑀 , and the last group, which exceeded
about 60 W contained jobs exceeding 0.5 in 𝑅𝑀 . This grouping scheme
in terms of 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥

𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 is discussed in greater detail in Section 4.1.
3D(malleable) jobs are localized in lower 𝑅𝐷 as shown in
Figs. 4(c) and (d), where lower 𝑁𝑄 values were specified and most of
the jobs achieved lower 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒. While the 3D(same) jobs in Figs. 4(e)
and (f) show two groups; one ranging from zero to one in 𝑅𝐷 with a
lower ratio in 𝑅𝑀 , and another that achieved a somewhat higher 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒
with an increase in 𝑅𝑀 at around zero in 𝑅𝐷.

3.3. Correlation between 𝑅𝑀 and 𝑅𝐹

As described previously, the major sources of electric power con-
sumption by compute nodes are CPU and memory devices, which
means that compute- or memory-intensive HPC jobs tend to consume
higher levels of electric power. We examined correlation between 𝑅𝑀
and 𝑅𝐹 with colored plots that indicate 𝑁𝑄 and 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒.

Fig. 5 shows the correlations between 𝑅𝑀 and 𝑅𝐹 of each job in 1D,
3D(malleable), and 3D(same) job cases with the 𝑁𝑄 and 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒
shown in colored plots.

It is notable that linear dependencies were detected between 𝑅𝑀
and 𝑅𝐹 with several coefficient rates since most of the 1D jobs were
compute- or memory-intensive. Fig. 5(a) shows some jobs with higher
values more than 50 GB/node in 𝑁𝑄. In Fig. 5(b), jobs requiring high
electric power levels with high utilization ratios in both 𝑅𝑀 and 𝑅𝐹
are shown in orange-colored plots. Here, it can be seen that the closer
the linear coefficient rate approaches one, the higher 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 increases.
We also noted that it is possible to separate the 1D jobs into the same
three groups in terms of 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒, as was done in Section 3.2. This will be
discussed further in Section 4.1.

When compared with the 1D jobs, the number of 3D jobs was
smaller, and the 3D job situations were different from the 1D jobs.
The figures in this group indicate lower utilization in both 𝑅𝑀 and
𝑅𝐹 . Jobs with 𝑁𝑄 values higher than 50 GB/node were observed with
lower values in the range from 0 to 0.2 in 𝑅𝑀 and 𝑅𝐹 , as shown in
Fig. 5(c). Fig. 5(d) shows us that most of the jobs consumed relatively
lower electric power and that jobs with relatively high electric power
around 40 W had low 𝑁𝑄, as shown in Fig. 5(c).

On the other hand, the 3D(same) job situation showed differences
from the 3D(malleable) job situation, and it was seen that there are
jobs with higher 𝑅𝐹 that have linear relationships with 𝑅𝑀 . In Fig. 5(e),

it can be seen that there are jobs with high 𝑁𝑄 at around 0 in 𝑅𝐹 and
in the range from 0 to 0.2 in 𝑅𝑀 . Meanwhile jobs with higher 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒
around 40 W show higher values in 𝑅𝐹 or 𝑅𝑀 in Fig. 5(f). These jobs
are somewhat more compute- or memory-intensive than I/O-intensive
because of their very low 𝑁𝑄 values.

3.4. Correlation coefficients among metrics

During the abovementioned correlation examinations, we also used
the Pearson(Log), Spearman, and Kendall functions to evaluate

node-layout case. In this examination, to ensure equal log data infor-
mation in each metric combination, we excluded log data that were
missing any of the metrics. The results obtained in the cases of 1D,
3D(malleable), and 3D(same) are summarized in Table 2.

In Table 2, strong or relatively strong positive correlation coeffi-
cients can be observed about 𝑅𝐹 and 𝑅𝑀 with 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 in every node-
layout case because high utilization levels in memory devices or CPUs
lead to high electric power levels. Among the three node-layout cases,
3D(malleable) shows very weak correlation coefficients for the
metrics associated with file I/O (𝑁𝑄, 𝑁𝐷𝑍 , 𝑅𝐷, and 𝑅𝐼∕𝑂) with 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒
compared with those in the other node-layout cases.

Another significant point is the relatively strong negative correla-
tion coefficients observed in 𝑁𝑄, 𝑁𝐷𝑍 , and 𝑅𝐷 of the 3D(same)
case. This is due to the I/O-intensive jobs observed at high frequency
in this node-layout case. This kind of jobs explicitly specified the fixed
compute node-layout due to its suitability for I/O operations. In such
jobs, higher disk space was given in 𝑁𝑄, and a higher value in 𝑅𝐷 was
observed. Additionally, unlike the other node-layout cases, those jobs
tended to use all the compute nodes in the Tofu 𝑍-link.

4. Job classification using machine learning

Large-scale HPC systems such as Fugaku must accept inflexible
restrictions in terms of electric power management in order to ensure

𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒
for three categorized groups, 𝑃𝑙𝑜𝑤, 𝑃𝑚𝑖𝑑 , and 𝑃ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ, by means of 𝑅𝐹 and 𝑅𝑀 .

stable system operations. Hence, prior to compute node allocation,
HPC system operations require job predictions to determine whether
or not each job will consume acceptable levels of electric power to
prevent compute nodes from developing electric power consumption
hot-spots [15–17]. Accordingly, we need the development of a predic-
tion model based on job stats recorded in the past job executions that
would identify, in advance, which jobs would consume high levels of
electric power.

𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 and/or between 𝑅𝑀 and 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥

In the correlation examinations discussed in the previous section,
we learned that there are relatively strong positive correlations between
𝑅𝐹 and 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒. However, we also found
that there are relatively strong negative correlations between 𝑅𝐷 and
𝑅𝐹 in the 3D(same) job case. Based on those results, we applied our
job stats log data to an examination of classification models using an
ML approach.

4.1. Potential of classification learned from correlation examination

Based on the correlation examination of HPC jobs as shown in
Figs. 4(b) and 5(b), we examined the 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 to determine whether or not
there was room to classify the jobs into three groups. Since 𝑅𝐹 and 𝑅𝑀
are tightly related to 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒, we examined the following classification for
𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 in terms of 𝑅𝐹 and 𝑅𝑀 :

• 𝑃ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ: 𝑅𝐹
• 𝑃𝑚𝑖𝑑 : (𝑅𝐹
• 𝑃𝑙𝑜𝑤: 𝑅𝐹 < 0.2 ∧ 𝑅𝑀 < 0.2

≥ 0.4 ∧ 𝑅𝑀
≥ 0.2 ∧ 𝑅𝑀 < 0.4) ∨ (𝑅𝐹 < 0.4 ∧ 𝑅𝑀

≥ 0.4

≥ 0.2)

𝑃ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ represents HPC jobs that consumed high levels of electric power
due to high 𝑅𝐹 and 𝑅𝑀 values, while 𝑃𝑙𝑜𝑤 is the group consuming low
levels of electric power, in which I/O-intensive jobs were frequently
observed. 𝑃𝑚𝑖𝑑 is an intermediate group between those two groups. In
our analysis, the numbers of large jobs categorized in 𝑃𝑙𝑜𝑤, 𝑃𝑚𝑖𝑑 , and
𝑃ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ were 111,721, 18,700, and 270, respectively. Most of HPC jobs
were in 𝑃𝑙𝑜𝑤, while very small number of jobs were categorized in 𝑃ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ.
However, impact of such high electric power jobs was very big in the
K computer operations to keep stable electric power supplies.

Fig. 6 shows the cumulative distribution function of the number of
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 based on the above

large jobs in the three groups in terms of 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
classifications.

Since, as can be seen in this figure, we can easily separate jobs in
the 𝑃ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ group from the 𝑃𝑚𝑖𝑑 and the 𝑃𝑙𝑜𝑤 groups at 60 W, and there
is sufficient room to predict high power-consuming HPC jobs with 𝑅𝐹 ,
𝑅𝑀 , and other metrics.

4.2. Job classification using imbalanced datasets

Based on the cumulative distributed function shown in Fig. 6,
we further examined electric power classifications for improved com-
pute node assignments in terms of electric power using an ML ap-
proach, where the following four classification models provided in
scikit-learn[18] Python library were examined:

• LogisticRegression (hereinafter, LOR)
• DecisionTreeClassifier (hereinafter, DTC)
• RandomForestClassifier (hereinafter, RFC)
• KNeighborsClassifier (hereinafter, KNC)

We used job stats log data recorded in the same period as those
used in the correlation coefficient examinations. More specifically, we
examined the four prediction models for the 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 using several metrics
combinations such as 𝑅𝑀 , 𝑅𝐹 , and 𝑅𝐷 with the help of the correlation
coefficient analyses reported in Section 3. Training and testing datasets
were prepared using train_test_split() from major group data
consisting of job information with lower electric power levels (X) and
minor group data consisting of job information with higher electric
power levels (y), which were obtained by splitting the log data infor-
mation at the given electric power threshold. The dataset preparation
was performed by

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
= train_test_split(X, y, random_state=42,
test_size=0.25, stratify=y)

X_train and y_train are training datasets for jobs with lower and
higher electric power levels, respectively, while X_test and y_test
are testing datasets for jobs with lower and higher electric power levels,
respectively. Note that since the stratify specification implies the
same y distribution characteristics for both training and testing, we
used the same datasets every time we performed examinations with the
same distribution characteristics. It should be also noted that 75% of
the data were assigned to the training dataset, and the remainder were
assigned to the testing dataset.

The large jobs can be divided into two groups easily, one in which
the 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 is greater or equal to 60 W and another in which the 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒
is less than 60 W, as can be seen in Fig. 6. Note that only the 1D job
case includes jobs that exceed 60 W in the 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒. We consider 30 W as
an another threshold candidate in the 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 because 𝑃𝑙𝑜𝑤 jobs are below
or equal to 30 W in Fig. 6. It is noted that setting 30 W for the threshold
in 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 leads to a mixed situation because each job case consists of jobs
that exceed 30 W in the 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒. We analyzed the classification models in
terms of 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 by setting 60 W and 30 W in the classification threshold.
In both threshold cases, we compared the precision of the models in
the three job cases (1D, 3D(malleable), and 3D(same)) and the
job case consisting of the three job cases (hereinafter, All) to examine
electric-power-aware compute node allocation in the supercomputer
Fugaku which is the successor to the K computer. Table 3 shows the
number of jobs assigned for the testing dataset.

Since the two job cases, ‘‘3D(malleable)’’ and ‘‘3D(same)’’,
did not have jobs above 50 W, we excluded those node layout cases
from the examination when classifying jobs at the threshold levels of
60 W and 50 W, even though both node layout cases had jobs below the
threshold levels. The dataset that was split at 40 W did not have jobs to
be analyzed at the ‘‘3D(malleable)’’ layout due to the same reason.
In the four classification models, we utilized GridSearchCV()
[19] to find the optimal parameter-set for each model, and then used
that set for classification. The argument parameters are summarized in
Table 4.

To improve analysis performance, the number of threads available
at a PC server was set for the num_thread to improve analysis perfor-
mance. The GridSearchCV() provides the best parameters from the
set of parameter candidates given in the param_grid.

Due to the existence of imbalanced datasets in which the number of
negatives (such as jobs above 60 W in 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒) outweighs the number of
positives (such as jobs less than or equal to 60 W in 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒), we evaluated
the precision–recall area under the curve (PR-AUC) using the methods
described in previous studies on binary classification evaluations of
imbalanced datasets [20–22]. Additionally, the precision, recall, and
F1-score of the target negatives were used to examine the precision
of the evaluated classification models. The MCC values of the used
classification models were obtained with the training dataset because
that value has been shown to be accurate even in an imbalanced
dataset [23]. In this paper, the overall score was defined in the range
from 0 to 1 when evaluating the predicted classification models using
the three tolerant measures, F1-score, PR-AUC, and MCC, as follows:
𝑂𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑙 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = 3√

𝐹 1-𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 × 𝑃 𝑅-𝐴𝑈 𝐶 × (𝑀𝐶𝐶 + 1)∕2

Higher overall scores indicate higher levels of precision for the pre-
dicted classification models. In this evaluation, we used the over-
all score to measure the classification effectiveness and the essential
metrics used in the classification.

Fig. 7 shows the evaluated values of the three classification models

in the 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥

𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 at 60 W in each node-layout case.

Note that only the 1D case has jobs exceeding 60 W, while DTC,
RFC, and KNC achieve near 1.0 in each measure using only 𝑅𝐹 and

𝑅𝑀 as shown in Figs. 7(b), 7(c), and 7(d), respectively. The MCC value
of the LOR model is around 0.9 with 𝑅𝐹 and 𝑅𝑀 . However, since this
model cannot achieve a score that is comparable to other models, as
shown in Fig. 7(a), it cannot be used in the LOR model with fewer
metrics from the evaluation.

Although the All case consists of the 3D(malleable) and
3D(same) jobs below 60 W, almost the same situation is observed
in the evaluated models, as shown in Figs. 7(e), 7(f), 7(g), and 7(h).
This is because of the smaller number of jobs (32,413–31,789 = 624
from Table 3) in the testing datasets for both 3D(malleable) and
3D(same).

The overall scores of the classification models in terms of the metrics

used are summarized in Fig. 8.

In the overall 1D scores shown in Fig. 8(a), the RFC model achieved
the highest score (0.98) for the evaluated models with only 𝑅𝐹 and
𝑅𝑀 . The RFC model also slightly improved scores up to 0.984 by
incorporating other metrics such as 𝑅𝐷 or 𝑅𝐼∕𝑂 and showed similar

scores in the All case, as shown in Fig. 8(b). Furthermore, this model
achieved the highest score (0.987) with 𝑅𝐹 , 𝑅𝑀 , and 𝑁𝐷𝑍 , which
indicates that it is the best choice in the classification at 60 W in the
𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒.

On the other hand, as we mentioned above, every job case has jobs
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒. Fig. 9 shows the evaluated values of each

exceeding 30 W in the 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
classification model when the jobs are split at the 30 W in the 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒.

Overall, the RFC model performed well compared with other mod-
els in relation to the two primary metrics related to electric power
used in model predictions, 𝑅𝐹 and 𝑅𝑀 . However, the precision of
the predicted models in the node-layouts of 3D(malleable) and
3D(same) became worse, especially in the 3D(malleable) case,
when compared with the cases of 1D or All. Furthermore, due to the
very weak correlation coefficients of metrics associated with file-I/O
in the 3D(malleable) case reported in Table 2, it was difficult to
improve the precision of the prediction models in comparison with
the other node-layout cases, even though the RFC and the KNC did

improve scores to levels equal to or exceeding 0.8 in F1-score, MCC,
and PR-AUC.

Based on the evaluated scores in F1-score, MCC, and PR-AUC, we
summarized the overall scores of the predicted classification models in
Fig. 10.

The RFC achieved the highest values of about 0.945, 0.832, and
0.944 in the cases of 1D, 3D(malleable), and All, respectively. In
the 3D(same) case, the KNC achieved the highest score of 0.942 but
the RFC achieved a comparable score of 0.929. In [24], the authors
reported that the RFC model performed well when used to classify a
large imbalanced dataset and we achieved a similar result with our
imbalanced dataset.

Since most jobs are 1D, we can see almost the same scores in All.
However, some degradation in the scores occurred if the number of jobs
in 3D(malleable) and 3D(same) increased when considering the
scores in the two cases mentioned above. This indicates that it might
be better to perform job classification separately in each node-layout.

We also made classification at 40 W and 50 W, and the overall scores

of them are shown in Figs. 11 and 12, respectively.

Compared with the results in Figs. 10 and 8, we have found degra-
dation in the overall score except the 3D(same) jobs in the case of
40 W. As we have noticed about Figs. 3(e) and 3(f) in Section 3.1, the

executed in the 1D case, similar behaviors for all six metrics used were
observed in the All case.

The behavior of two file I/O-related metrics, 𝑁𝑄 and 𝑁𝐷𝑍 , are
noteworthy because they showed different properties in each node-
layout. In the cases of 1D, 3D(malleable), All shown in Figs. 14(a),
14(b), and 14(d), the contribution rates of 𝑁𝑄 and 𝑁𝐷𝑍 to PC2 were
larger than those to PC1, while their contribution rates to PC1 increased
in the case of 3D(same), as shown in Fig. 14(c). This is because of the
I/O-intensive jobs that specified higher values in 𝑁𝑄 and which, to the
maximum extent possible, had compute nodes in the same Tofu 𝑍-link
of the 3D(same) node-layout.

From the above analysis in addition to correlation coefficients re-

ported in Table 2, we can state the following:

• Computing-related metrics, 𝑅𝐹 and 𝑅𝑀 , are major classification

metrics.

• File I/O-related metrics, 𝑅𝐷 and 𝑅𝐼∕𝑂, are counterparts to the

computing-related metrics.

• Other file I/O-related metrics, 𝑁𝑄 and 𝑁𝐷𝑍 , show distinct be-
haviors in the 3D(same) node-layout case due to the frequency
of I/O-intensive jobs in that case.

Taken together, these results indicate that it is preferable to clas-
sify HPC jobs in each compute node-layout rather than to perform
classification without separating the jobs into each node-layout.

5. Related work

To keep the HPC system operations within a limited power budget,
power management is currently one of the most important issues
in HPC system operations. Because of this, power capping has been
proposed as a way to control electric power consumption in order to
facilitate stable HPC system operations in numerous studies [15,16,25].
In the K computer operation, we also worked diligently to manage
system operations within our power budget. Although we did not
have electric power measurement devices, full-scale power predictions
were performed for jobs using our prediction models [4] in a few
days of special full-scale job execution period held once per month
according to the recorded metrics with their smaller jobs. In Fugaku,
which is the successor to the K computer, we have implemented power
control and power measurement functions for its CPUs, memory de-
vices, and compute node peripheral equipment. Along with the adopted
enhancements, we have also implemented power measurement and
control features in the operation software [2]. The metrics obtained
the measurement functions are also provided for users in a summary
data of the executed job to tune their applications, for instance.

Another aspect of controlling electric power consumption is I/O
operation management. Due to the negative correlation between I/O

case.

3D(same) jobs had two distinct groups: one group consisted of I/O-
intensive jobs, while other had compute-intensive jobs. As a result, we
have achieved higher scores only in the 3D(same) jobs.

4.3. Factor loading of metrics in the job classification

In order to examine the contribution rate of the principal com-
ponents and the factor loading of the metrics used in the princi-
pal components, we performed principal component analysis using
sklearn.decomposition.PCA() in scikit-learn after standardiz-
ing each metric. Fig. 13 shows cumulative contribution rate relative to
the number of principal components ranging from the most influential
principal component to the least influential one. This figure shows that
we can achieve higher HPC job classification levels of precision in the
cases of 3D(malleable) and 3D(same) than can be achieved for
the All case, which means that when performing job classification, it
is better to split the HPC jobs in each node-layout.

Fig. 14 indicates the factor loading of each metric relative to the

two major principal components, PC1 and PC2, in each node-layout.

In Figs. 14(a), 14(b), and 14(d), it can be seen that two file I/O-
related metrics, 𝑅𝐷 and 𝑅𝐼∕𝑂, are related to the first principal compo-
nent, PC1, at around 0.75 relative to the second principal component,
PC2, while Fig. 14(c) shows that the two metrics are related to both of
PC1 and PC2 around 0.5.

The computing related metrics, 𝑅𝐹 and 𝑅𝑀 , showed similar be-
havior expressing a higher contribution of 𝑅𝐹 to PC2, as shown in
Figs. 14(a) and 14(d), while Figs. 14(b) and 14(c) show different
behavior in each case. When compared with 𝑅𝐹 , it can be seen that
𝑅𝑀 has a smaller contribution to both PC1 and PC2 in the cases of 1D
and All, as shown in Figs. 14(a) and 14(d). Since most HPC jobs were

operations and electric power, another solution for power management
is monitoring I/O activities in HPC jobs and characterizing those jobs
based on their I/O intensity. Numerous studies have focused on log
analysis as a way to reveal the I/O activities of HPC jobs [26–28].
For example, Liu et al. [26] developed an application characterization
analysis framework that included I/O activities and successfully incor-
porated consideration for I/O activities in job scheduling. Separately,
Wang et al. [27] proposed a multilateral framework to investigate I/O
activities and the root causes of I/O problems, from a comprehensive
analysis of large-scale I/O log data, in which Darshan [29,30] was
introduced to collect I/O performance metrics. Lockwood et al. [28]
proposed a holistic analysis framework for use in investigating whole
HPC systems using numerous analysis and monitoring tools such as
Darshan. However, the abovementioned studies did not discuss electric
power issues, even though there have been studies that discussed power
management from the viewpoint of I/O activities [31,32]. For example,
Manousakis et al. [31] proposed a framework that can be used to mini-
mize electric power in I/O-intensive jobs, and Lee et al. [32] addressed
providing a framework that can be used to supply more electric power
to compute-intensive jobs using I/O aware power shifting algorithms.
Similar to these research efforts, we focused on using several I/O
activity metrics to classify HPC jobs in terms of electric power and
have observed some specific features of I/O-intensive HPC jobs, such
as node-layout specifications or required disk space allocations, through
correlation studies of those metrics. Through the Fugaku operation, we
have faced I/O contentions among jobs. Fugaku has different system

configuration where a subset of compute node also acts as I/O node.
Although I/O node tasks are assigned for extra CPU cores on such node,
there are risks that we may have a sort of interference among jobs shar-
ing the same I/O node, especially when such I/O node fail to operate
due to heavy I/O operations. Since our proposed ML classification also
shows inverse proportional among I/O activities and electric power,
such methodology can be one of the solutions to prevent such problems
in compute node allocation.

Here, it should be noted that ML has been actively and widely
introduced for huge scale log analysis in HPC systems [33–35]. For
example, He et al. [33] studied failure prediction by parsing logs,
followed by performing ML through system log analysis. To accomplish
this, they evaluated three supervised and two unsupervised methods in
their ML analysis. Separately, Das et al. [34] proposed a framework for
predicting failure nodes in HPC systems using their time-based phrase
(TBP) prediction scheme. The TBP framework was built with an ML
technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [36] with a Topics
over Time (TOT) [37] enhancement to take the time correlation aspect
into consideration. The effectiveness of that framework was demon-
strated in their log analysis of a Cray HPC system. Kim et al. [35] also
studied I/O performance prediction using an ML approach through log
analysis study in which their framework analyzed preferable metrics for
ML through correlation analyses conducted before the ML phase. Their
regression-based ML approach achieved higher prediction accuracy
in I/O-intensive applications from a number of different system logs
and the automatic selection of the best regression algorithm in each

prediction. However, in our work, which is focused on electric power
consumption using ML classification models with metrics recorded in
job stats log data, we found that correlation studies can produce rela-
tively strong positive associations between the utilization ratios of CPUs
and memory devices and electric power levels per node. Additionally,
correlation studies between disk utilization ratios and electric power
levels per node showed strong negative associations in a fixed 3D node-
layout case because I/O-intensive jobs were frequently executed in that
node-layout. Based on these results, we applied an ML-based approach
to classifying jobs in terms of electric power levels per node. The
major factors used to predict electric power levels are the utilization
ratios of CPUs and memory devices, but additional metrics such as the
disk utilization ratio have also improved the precision of the predicted
classification models. Finding preferable metrics through correlation
analysis and automatic selection of prediction models applied in [35]
is a process worth being introduced into our ML scheme.

One of the remaining that will be discussed in this paper is the
method used to evaluate predicted classification models for imbalanced
datasets in ML studies. In this context, He and Garcia reported im-
proved precision–recall curve efficiency, even in imbalanced datasets
in their paper [38] in which they clearly discussed the problems that
occurred in those datasets along with some state-of-the-art solutions
for those problems. Separately, Jauk et al. produced a survey paper
in which they discussed state-of-the-the-art studies about failure pre-
diction in many leading HPC systems [39]. Although they discussed
effective evaluations among different classification models in reference
to imbalanced datasets, they only touched briefly on studies that paid
close attention to the problem, despite the large number of research
papers surveyed. Additionally, they limited their remarks to stating that
no numerical or statistical analysis studies have yet been conducted
to address this problem. Contrastingly, in our research, we proposed
a combined evaluation score by introducing F1-score, PR-AUC, and
MCC for use in comparisons among different classification models using
imbalanced datasets. Although our proposal works acceptably in our
ML study using K computer log data, it will be necessary to propose an
improved or optimum method of conducting ML-based evaluations of
imbalanced datasets in the future.

6. Conclusions

Herein we reported the analysis of two years of job stats log data
collected from the K computer to classify HPC jobs in terms of electric
power levels per compute node. This study is part of efforts to facilitate
future advanced power-aware compute node allocation in accordance
with effective job scheduling in Fugaku, which is the successor of the K
computer. Our results showed that we need the ability to perform more
suitable compute node allocations in order to manage power consump-
tion within controllable conditions and to ensure stable operations in
such situations.

Based on the above, we studied classification methodology in terms
of electric power consumed by compute nodes through correlation
coefficient analysis and ML-based classification using associated metrics
in job stat log data and determined that there were relatively strong
correlations between electric power and CPU and memory bandwidth
utilization ratios. Additionally, there were relatively strong negative
correlations between metrics related to file I/O and electric power
in the node-layout in which I/O-intensive jobs were most frequently
executed. Based on this correlation study, we examined four classifi-
cation models provided from scikit-learn and discovered some specific
results related to allocated compute node-layouts. For example, we
established the overall score ranging from 0 to 1 to evaluated predicted
classification models using F1-score, PR-AUC, and MCC, which are
tolerant measures even in imbalanced datasets. Through that exam-
ination, we found that the RFC model achieved the highest overall
score (0.98) using only CPU and memory bandwidth utilization ratios
when classifying at 60 W in the maximum electric power per node.

Furthermore, in the classification at 30 W, that model achieved high
scores of up to 0.945, 0.832, and 0.944 among the evaluated models
in the three node-layout cases of 1D, 3D with layout changes, and all
node-layout cases, respectively. Although the KNC model achieved the
highest score (0.944) in the 3D node-layout without layout changes,
the RFC model achieved a comparable score. Classifying the jobs at
50 W or 40 W did not show good scores except the compute node layout
of 3D with layout changes because of difficulty in classifying jobs at
those threshold levels among mixed jobs about electric power levels
per compute node. Overall, we determined that the RFC was the best
model for use in our HPC job classifications in terms of electric power
levels per compute node if we adopted appropriate threshold level such
as 60 W or 30 W.

Through an analysis of the contribution rate of principal com-
ponents and the factor loading of the metrics used in the principal
components, we observed that the computing-related metrics, such as
utilization ratios in CPU FLOPS and memory devices, are counterparts
of the two file I/O-related metrics, which are the ratio of disk utilization
relative to allocated disk space and the ratio of used disk space relative
to achievable maximum I/O size amount. The other file I/O-related
metrics, the size of allocated disk space per node and the number of
nodes in the Tofu 𝑍-link direction, showed features that were similar to
the other file I/O-related metrics in the 3D node-layout without layout
changes. This is due to the fact that I/O-intensive jobs specified higher
values in the assigned disk space per node and in the occupancy in
compute nodes on the same Tofu 𝑍-link. Since every metric showed
different properties in each node-layout case, not only from this anal-
ysis but also from our correlation study, we concluded that when it
comes to facilitating power-aware HPC system operations, performing
job classification in each node-layout case is preferable to building a
job classification model without any attention to node-layouts.

Our future work will focus on automatic selection among evaluated
classification models based on target metrics like those explored in [35]
with periodical updates issued as we introduce our approach in Fugaku.
Since Fugaku supports an electric power measurement function inside
its CPU nodes, there is expected to be additional room for improving
the precision of the classification models used. Since we need to supply
stable electric power in Fugaku operation, optimization in compute
node allocation is one of the important aspects in future advanced
operation. We expect that classification of HPC jobs in terms of electric
power at the given threshold level using collected log data prevents
hot-spots in electric power in system racks containing a large num-
ber of compute nodes if such classification is introduced in compute
node allocation during job scheduling with the job script classification
reported in [11]. Within this context, another future work will be
proposing tolerant scoring in comparison among various classification
models using imbalanced datasets. However, to accomplish this, it will
be necessary to study other researches in leading HPC systems in order
to determine optimal scoring methods.
