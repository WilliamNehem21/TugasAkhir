Abstract 

A  new  solvent  extraction  method  that  removing  the  Ca(II)  from  calcium  lactate  by  Di-(2-ethylhexyl)  phosphoric  acid 
(D2EHPA) to produce lactic acid was proposed. The influences of composition of organic phase, phase ratio, temperature 
and calcium concentration, on extraction yield, were investigated. The optimal technological conditions of extraction were 
obtained: reaction temperature 323 K, phase ratio (O/W) 4:1, the initial calcium concentration 1.03 mol L 1, the D2EHPA 
volume fraction 40%, and 5% 1-octanol as modifiers. The reaction occurs at the interfacial zone possibly, and the rate is 
mostly controlled by chemical reaction. Reaction order with respect to H2A2, pH and Ca2+ was determined and the rate of 
calcium extraction could be expressed as: F = 10-6.81[Ca2+][H2A2]0.5[H+]-1.

1. Introduction 

Lactic acid is a chemical commodity utilized in chemical and pharmaceutical fields [1]. Approximately 90% 
of the total lactic acid produced worldwide is made by bacterial fermentation at present  [2]. Solvent extraction 
was  a  kind  of  method  to  recovery  lactic  acid  from  fermentation  broth,  and  the  lactic  acid  was  extracted  to 
organic phase. However, this process has drawbacks of consuming extra chemicals and forming a waste salt.

To resolve these shortcomings, the way of keeping lactic acid in aqueous phase was proposed in this paper. 
In  this  process,  calcium  lactate  solution  produced  by  the  addition  of  calcium  hydroxide  to  the  aqueous 
fermentation broth was contacted with D2EHPA (H2A2) to remove cations to organic phase, while lactic acid 
retained in aqueous phase. For this new approach of separating lactic acid by solvent extraction of cations, it is 
necessary  to  perform  detail  experiments  to  optimize  the  extraction  conditions  and  make  some  insight  of 
kinetic mechanism for finding out the determining step of the solvent extraction process.  

The aim of this study is to select an appropriate solvent composition for extraction of Ca(II) and optimize 
the extraction conditions, meanwhile, kinetic mechanism of solvent extraction was investigated. The effects of 
composition of organic phase, phase ratio, temperature, and concentration of calcium lactate were examined in 

effects of parameters on the extraction rate. 

2. Experimental techniques 

2.1. Materials 

The materials used in this study were calcium lactate (kindly provided by Henan Jindan Lactic acid Tech 
CO., Ltd.) which has an analytical purity of 98 %. The content of D2EHPA (Tianjin Chemical Co.ltd,) was of 
99  %.  1-octanol,  2-octanol  and  iso-octanol,  aromatic  free  kerosene  were  of  reagent  grade  and  were  used 
without pretreatment. Deionized water was produced by Millipore Milli-Q Water System. 

The aqueous medium was prepared by dissolving calcium lactate in deionized water at desired temperature, 
and  its  concentrations  were  measured  by  EDTA  complexometry  using  EBT  (Eriochrome  black  T)  as  an 
indicator. All other reagents were of analytical grade. 

2.2. Procedure  

The experiments  were carried out in 250  ml  conical flask.  Proportional volumes of aqueous and organic 
phases were shaken for 5 min at constant temperature on the  magnetic stirring apparatus, unless for the tests 
about reaction time effect on the result. The phase separations were carried out in 250 ml separatory funnels. 

After  phase  separation,  the  calcium  ions  concentrations  in  the  aqueous  phase  were  measured  by  EDTA 
complexometry using EBT (Eriochrome black T) as an indicator. The pH of aqueous phase was measured by 
a Mettler Toledo pH meter, and lactic acids concentrations could be calculated.  

The construction of the Lewis cell and the working procedure with the Lewis cell used in this investigation 
was  discussed  before  [3].  The  stirring  rate  was  controlled  at  180  rpm  except  the  effect  of  it  on  kinetic 
experiment. The aqueous concentration of calcium was estimated by sampling and complexometry. A Mettler 
Toledo pH meter  was  used  for pH measurements.  All experiment  were carried out at 293 K, the interfacial 
area was kept at 1.776 cm2 unless for the tests about temperature or interfacial area. 

3. Results and discussion 

3.1. The research of extraction process 

The  influences  of  H2A2  volume  fraction,  modifiers,  phase  ratio,  temperature,  and  calcium  concentration 
were researched, and the initial conditions were: reaction temperature 298 K, phase ratio (O/W) 4:1, the initial 
calcium  concentration  0.68  mol  L-1,  the  H2A2  volume  fraction  40  %,  and  5%  1-octanol  as  modifiers.  The 
major criterions to choose technological conditions were extraction yield and concentration of H+.

3.1.1. Influence of D2EHPAvolume fraction on extraction yield and concentration of H+ 

The D2EHPAvolume fraction ranged from 10 vol. % to 50 vol. % to research its influence on extraction 

yield and concentration of H+, and the result was plotted in Fig. 1 (a). 

Fig.  1  (a).  shows  that  the  calcium  extraction  yield  and  concentration  of  H+  increased  linearly  with  the 
increase of D2EHPA volume fraction, and inflection points appeared at 35 vol. % and 40 vol. %, respectively. 
These were because that more resultant was obtained.  Considering the extraction yield and concentration of 
H+, the H2A2 volume fraction was chosen as 40 vol. %. 

3.1.2. Influence of calcium concentration on extraction yield and concentration of H+ 

The  calcium  concentration  was  varied  from  0.28  to  1.44  mol  L-1,  to  research  its  influence  on  extraction 

yield and concentration of H+, and the result was shown in Fig. 1 (b).  

Fig.  1  (b).  shows  that  with  the  growth  of  calcium  concentration,  extraction  yield  fell  from  98%  to  89%, 
concentration  of  H+  grew  from  0.5  to  1.39  mol  L-1.  These  were  because  that  more  resultant  was  obtained. 
Considering the extraction yield, concentration of H+, the calcium concentration was chosen as 1.03 mol L-1. 

3.1.3. Influence of modifiers on extraction yield and concentration of H+ 

The volume  fraction of three modifiers ranged from 5 vol.  % to 25 vol. % respectively, to research their 

influence on extraction yield and concentration of H+, and the result was shown in Fig. 2.

Phase ratio

Fig. 3. The effect of phase ratio on extraction yield and concentration of H+. V(a) = 30 ml, T = 298 K, 1-octanol % = 5 (V/V), [Ca2+] = 
1.03 mol/L, t = 5 min, D2EHPA % = 40 (V/V). 

Fig.  2  shows  that  the  extraction  yield  and  concentration  of  H+  increased  with  the  increase  of  three 
modifiers, but not observably. The reason was that the addition of modifiers changed the polarity of organic 
phase,  and  made  more  D2EHPA  exist  as  monomers.  Meanwhile,  the  solubility  of  extraction  complex  was 
higher with the existence of modifiers. Considering that the absence of modifier caused the  solidification of 
organic  phase  when  it  cooled  to  room  temperature,  the  modifier  volume  fraction  was  chosen  as  5  vol.  %. 
However, the influences of three modifiers on extraction process were similar, so all of them could be chosen. 
In this research, 1-octanol was chosen as modifier.

3.1.4. Influence of phase ratio on extraction yield and concentration of H+ 

The phase ratio was varied from 2:1 to 6:1, to research its influence on extraction yield and concentration 

of H+, and the result was plotted in Fig. 3.  

Fig. 3. shows that the calcium extraction yield and concentration of H+ increased with the increase of phase 
ratio,  and  both  inflection  points  appeared  at  phase  ratio  of  4:1.  The  increase  of  phase  ratio  was  actually  to 
increase the amount of extractant, which conduced to increasing the extraction yield and concentration of H+. 
Considering the extraction yield and concentration of H+, the phase ratio was chosen as 4:1. 

3.1.5. Influence of temperature on extraction yield and concentration of H+ 

The  temperature  was  varied  from  293  to  353  K,  to  research  its  influence  on  extraction  yield  and 

concentration of H+, and the result was shown in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4. The effect of temperature on extraction yield and concentration of H+. V(o) = 120 ml, V(a) = 30 ml, D2EHPA % = 40 (V/V), [Ca2+] 
= 1.03mol/L, 1-octanol % = 5 (V/V), t = 5 min. 

Fig. 4. shows that the temperature had a slight influence on extraction yield but a remarkable influence on 
concentration  of  H+.  The  reason  was  that  the  distribution  ratio  of  lactic  acid  changed  with  the  change  of 
temperature,  so  more  lactic  acid  could  stay  in  aqueous  phase.  Considering  the  extraction  yield  and 
concentration of H+, the temperature was chosen as 323 K. 

The optimal technological conditions of extraction by D2EHPA were obtained: reaction temperature 323 K, 
phase ratio (O/W) 4:1, the initial calcium concentration 1.03 mol L-1, the H2A2 volume fraction 40%, and 5% 
1-octanol as modifiers. Under these conditions, the extraction rate could reach 91%, and the concentration of 
H+ could reach 1.4 mol L-1.

3.2.3. Extraction rate equation 

To obtain extraction rate equation, the influence of the parameters on should be studied [5].  
With other chemical parameter constant, the concentration of calcium H2A2 and H+ changed (Fig. 6.). With 
their linear relationships, the values of a, b, and c can be obtained, and a = 1, b = 0.5, c = -1. According to the

3.2.4. Identification of the nature of the kinetic regime 

The  most  important  criterion  that  enabled  to  distinguish  between  a  diffusion-controlled  and  a  kinetics 
regime  was  the  influence  of  extraction  rate  on  the  stirring  speed,  and  to  research  it,  the  stirring  speed  was 
varied between 60 and 210 rpm (Fig.7. (a)).  

When the stirring speed was lower than150 rpm, the extraction rate was influenced by stirring speed. When 
it  was  higher  than  150  rpm,  a  plateau  appeared,  and  the  extraction  rate  is  constant,  demonstrating  that  the 
interfacial area and the global transfer coefficient were constant.  

A further criterion was the experimental determination of the activation energy of the extraction process. 
Generally, when the rate is controlled by chemical reaction, Ea is above 40 kJ/mol; when the rate is controlled 
by a diffusion process, Ea is below 20 kJ/mol; and the rate might be a mixture controlled regime when the Ea 
value is between 20 kJ/mol and 40 kJ/mol [6].  

The influence of temperature on the kinetics of calcium extraction was shown in Fig. 7 (b).The extraction 

rate increased with increasing temperature and the experimental data obeyed Arrhenius equation:

The apparent activation energy of the reaction was 54.57 kJ/mol calculated from the Arrhenius plot, and it 

was above 40 kJ/mol. That suggested the extraction process was controlled by chemical reaction. 

The effect of interfacial area on the rate of extraction  was another important criterion to identify reaction 
mechanism.  The  relationship  between  interfacial  area  and  extraction  rate  was  showed  in  Fig.  7.  (c), 
demonstrating the reaction occurring at the interfacial zone possibly[7].  

4. Conclusion 

The following conclusions have been obtained: 
1. The optimal technological conditions of extraction by D2EHPA were obtained: reaction temperature 323 
K, reaction time 5 min, phase ratio (O/W) 4:1, the initial calcium concentration 1.03 mol L-1, the H2A2 volume 
fraction  40%,  and  5%  1-octanol  as  modifiers.  Under  these  conditions,  the  extraction  rate  could  reach  91%, 
and the concentration of H+ could reach 1.4mol L-1. 

2. In extraction equilibrium studies, the relationship between  pH, log [H2A2] and log D was investigated, 

and the thermodynamic extraction reactions is as follows: 
 CaA2·2HA + 2H+ 

Ca2+ + 2H2A2 
3.  The  reaction  occurs  at  the  interfacial  zone  possibly,  and  the  rate  is  mostly  controlled  by  chemical 
reaction.  Under the conditions prevailed in the Lewis cell, the rate of extraction at 293 K can be expressed as: 

F = 10-6.81[Ca2+] [H2A2]0.5[H+]-1
