Abstract The lower visibility of the satellite in the acquisition stage of a GPS
receiver under worst noisy situation leads to reacquisition of the data and thereby
takes a longer time to obtain the ﬁrst position ﬁx. If the impulse noise affects the
GPS signal, the conventional ways of acquiring the satellites do not guarantee to
meet the minimum requirement of four satellites to ﬁnd the user position. The per-
formance of GPS receiver acquisition can be improved in the low SNR level using
inverse spiking ﬁltering technique. In the proposed method, the estimate of the
desired GPS L1 signal corrupted by impulse noise (gn) is obtained by the predic-
tion error ﬁlter (hopt), which is the optimum inverse ﬁlter that reshapes the noisy
signal (yn) into a desired GPS signal (xn). In the proposed method, to detect the
visible satellites under weak signal conditions the traditional differential coherent
approach is combined with the inverse spiking ﬁlter method to increase the num-
ber of visible satellites and to avoid the reacquisition process. Montecarlo simu-
lation is carried out to assess the performance of the proposed method for C/N0 of
20 dB-Hz and results indicate that the modiﬁed differential coherent method

1. Introduction

At present GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) consists of two fully
operational global systems, the United States’ global positioning system (GPS)
and Russia’s GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS), as well as
the developing global and regional systems, namely Europe’s European Satellite
Navigation System (GALILEO), China’s COMPASS/Bei-Dou, India’s Regional
Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) and Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System
(QZSS). GPS is used in a large number of safety critical applications and has
become essential for precise timing reference and synchronization purpose in
telecommunications networks (Zhu et al., 2010). GPS signal power levels are
extremely low, due to the long satellite-receiver distance. The commercial GPS
receiver is easily affected by vulnerable effects of interference and noise. The
GPS receiver mounted on or inside manned or autonomous vehicles is easily
affected by impulse noise caused by motor emissions. This leads to a drop in
the carrier power to noise density ratio. Hence,
it is important to have an
effective method to detect and ﬁlter the noise. Spectral signal processing consists
of time and frequency excision, pulse blanking and pulse spiking techniques
which are used to prevent loss of lock caused by the effect of noise (Borio
et al., 2008).

The nominal power level of the received signal is only (cid:2)158.5 dBW. The highest
power density of the spread spectrum signal is (cid:2)220 dBW/Hz where the nominal
background noise level is approximately (cid:2)205 dBW/Hz, i.e. the signal strength lies
15 dB under the background noise level (Braasch and Van Dierendonck, 1999). A
GPS signal below (cid:2)158.5 dBW power level is categorized as a weak signal, so
there is a strong possibility of the cross-correlation peaks exceeding the autocor-
relation peaks. This will ruin acquisition and reduce satellite availability. The
pre-detection integration time plays a vital role in signal detection and in deter-
mining the feasible gain. This should be optimally selected to achieve the desired
acquisition sensitivity with the available processing power and to avoid false locks.
Hence the detection threshold should be optimally chosen to avoid false locks
which can be achieved by selecting a proper value of the false detection probability
(Hu and Fang, 2010). To ﬁnd the weak signal, the approach is to increase the data
length. Three approaches based on the integration time namely coherent, non-
coherent and differential coherent techniques are used during the weak signal

2 thereby increasing the SNR by

acquisition in order to improve the SNR. Dividing the set of input data into
smaller blocks then stripping the C/A code from the data and performing FFT
based parallel code phase search technique (performing an algebraic sum of the
signal) are known as coherent detection (Bao-Yen and Tusi, 2005). In the non
coherent integration method, summing the data blocks of squared correlation val-
ues of the acquisition process (performing an absolute sum of the signal) yields
good correlation. This increases the signal strength by a factor of 2 and noise
2 or 1.5 dB (Deshpande et al., 2004). This
by
improvement is less compared to the coherent integration method but requires
fewer operations. Also non-coherent integration is not affected by the navigation
data bit transition since the correlation results of the coherent integration time are
squared before summation. When the correlator output is multiplied with the
complex conjugate of the successive correlator output this method is termed as dif-
ferential coherent detection and thus by doing this a high degree of correlation is
being maintained. Hence, the SNR loss in differentially combining detection is de-
creased in comparison to non-coherent combining detection. Fallahi et al. (2012)
calculated probability of detection and the ROC (Receiver Operating Character-
istic) using coherent, non-coherent and differential detection at various power lev-
els of GPS signal.

The typical C/N0 value of a commercial GPS receiver is in between 37 and
45 dB-Hz. In the noisy environment of analyzing the GPS signal, the traditional
methods of coherent, non coherent and differential coherent ways of increasing
the integration time result in poor correlation. If the impulse noise distorts the
GPS signal, the parallel code phase search acquisition performed for single msec
data works only for C/N0 up to 35 dB-Hz of the GPS receiver. Hence, it is quite
obvious to use the coherent integration method for the lower C/N0 in the range of
35 dB-Hz and the non-coherent integration method with C/N0 up to 30 dB-Hz
(Deshpande et al., 2004). A longer coherent integration time means a smaller
Doppler bin size which increases the number of the Doppler bins to be searched.
The coherent integration time is limited by two factors, navigation data bit tran-
sition and the Doppler effect on the C/A-code. A navigation data bit transition
will spread the spectrum causing the output to be no longer a CW signal. This
spectrum spreading will reduce the acquisition gain and distort the acquisition
peak. An increase of 100 ms non coherent integration correlation can acquire
the signal having C/N0 up to 25 dB-Hz. But all the above mentioned techniques
cannot be applied for impulse noise affected GPS signal which has C/N0 less than
20 dB-Hz. In this paper, it is proposed to excise the impulse noise embedded in the
GPS signal with C/N0 below 20 dB-Hz through the inverse spiking ﬁltering tech-
nique. The structure of the paper is organized as follows. This section discusses the
existing methods available for weak signal acquisition. Section 2 describes the
mathematical formulation and theory of inverse spiking ﬁlter, Section 3 illustrates
the acquisition and tracking results of conventional and the proposed modiﬁed
differential methods of processing the noisy GPS signal as well as Montecarlo

cess. Section 4 gives the conclusions.

2. Inverse spiking ﬁlter based noise excision in GPS receiver

In this section, the spiking inverse ﬁlter based noise excision is proposed for excis-
ing the impulse noise. The received noisy GPS L1 signal which has a C/N0 below
20 dB-Hz is subjected to the spiking ﬁlter and the output of the spiking ﬁlter is
given to the A/D converter with a sampling frequency of 11.999 MHz .If 1 ms
of data is analyzed, the number of samples can be found as 1/1000 of the sampling
frequency (11.999 · 106/1000 = 11,999 samples) with a single bit resolution (Bao-
Yen and Tusi, 2005). The digitized data obtained after A/D is given as an input to
the acquisition process with peak search algorithm.(Mao et al., 2008).

The impulse noise (gn) and the GPS signal (xn) are related by the convolution

relationship

yn ¼ xn (cid:3) gn ¼

X

m

gmxn(cid:2)m

ð1Þ

The basic objective here is to recover xn from impulse noise affected signal yn.
The spiking de-convolution (Mathew and Narayana Dutt, 1993) is proposed to
compress the effect of impulse noise embedded in the GPS signal and to improve
the SNR value. The problem may be formulated as follows: To design a spiking
inverse ﬁlter hn corresponding to the impulse noise function gn, that is, hn \ gn =
dn. In the least-squares sense ﬁltering yn through hn will recover the desired signal
xn. If the given record of available noisy GPS data is yn = {y0, y1, y2 . . .., yN}, then
the inverse spiking ﬁlter coefﬁcients hn = {h0, h1, h2. . .. hM}, will reshape yn, into
the desired GPS signal x = {x0, x1, x2 . . .., xN}. The estimate of input signal is
given by the convolution relationship (Orfanidis, 1988).

As the optimality criterion, least square criteria aregiven by Jmin ¼ ke2k ¼ eTe

where Y is the (N + M + 1) · (M + 1) convolution matrix data matrix from
the noisy signal yn and x is the (N + M + 1)·1 vector of estimate of input
samples.

The

projection matrix with

‘‘performance’’ matrix P is

size
(N + M + 1) · (N + M + 1) and has trace equal to M + 1, while its eigenvalues
are either 0 or 1.For the sum of all the eigenvalues to be equal to M + 1, there
should be M + 1 eigenvalues that are equal to 1, and N eigenvalues equal to 0.
Therefore, the matrix P has rank M + 1 (Mathew and Narayana Dutt, 1993),
and if the desired vector x is selected to be any of the M + 1 eigenvectors belong-
ing to eigenvalue 1; the resultant estimation error will be zero. The desired vector x
is chosen as spikes or impulse i.e. x = dn. Here h is the best least squares approx-
imation that reshapes yn into a unit impulse. Considering the vector x to be a unit
impulse occurring at the i-th instant, x = d(n (cid:2) i).

The actual ﬁlter output from the spiking ﬁlter is given by

^x ¼ Px ¼ Pdðn (cid:2) iÞ

ð8Þ

Thus the i-th column of P matrix is the output of the i-th spiking ﬁlter which

reshapes yn into a spike with i delays. The corresponding i-th ﬁlter is

hopt ¼ R(cid:2)1YTdðn (cid:2) iÞ

ð9Þ

18

G. Arul Elango et al.

Hence the columns of the matrix R(cid:2)1YT are all the optimal spiking ﬁlters. The

estimation error of the i-th ﬁlter is

J ¼ ½dðn (cid:2) iÞ(cid:5)TðI (cid:2) PÞdðn (cid:2) iÞ ¼ 1 (cid:2) Pii

ð10Þ

where Pii represents the i-th diagonal entry of the projection matrix. Once the ma-
trix of inverse ﬁlters is computed, the optimum among them is selected as the one
which has the smallest error. Since the delay i may be positioned anywhere from
i = 0 to i = N + M, there are N + M + 1 such spiking ﬁlters, each with error J.
The ﬁlter which has the optimal delay i corresponds to the smallest of the error J
or, equivalently, to the maximum of the diagonal elements Pii. The particular col-
umn i of P for which Pii is maximum will give the extracted data; The correspond-
ing system model is shown in Fig. 1.

The steps involved in least-squares spiking ﬁlter design for a given signal yn,

n = 0, 1. . ., N (cid:2) 1 are summarized as follows:

1. Construct an autocorrelation matrix (YTY).
2. Calculate all inverse ﬁlters through pseudo inverse of an autocorrelation matrix.
3. Find i-th diagonal entry of a projection matrix which has maximum value.
4. Obtain i-th ﬁlter i.e. hopt.
5. Extract the data ^x by convolving hopt with noisy signal yn.

The performance of the spiking ﬁlter is determined by the diagonal values of the
performance matrix P. Based on the minimum mean square error value, the par-
ticular diagonal entry has a maximum value that determines the rank of the matrix
(Mathew and Narayana Dutt, 1993).

3. Experimental results

3.1. Software based GPS receiver acquisition performance assessment in the presence
of impulse noise

The GPS signal affected by the impulse noise with C/N0 of 20 dB-Hz is given to
the proposed ﬁlter model. The ﬁltered data are passed through an acquisition
block of peak search algorithm. As per the simulation parameters for the GPS
L1 signal mentioned in Table 1, the acquisition performances are tested for three
different scenarios and the outputs are tabulated in Table 2. For all the 3 cases the
peak algorithm proposed by Mao et al. (2008) has been used. The threshold con-
dition is set based on the maximum peak and the secondary peak values of the
decision statistic (S) in the acquisition process. The Threshold Condition used
for simulation is given as the Correlation max Peak – Mean Peak > 0.96 and
the Max Peak – Secondary Peak > 0. 5. Based on this condition, the simulation
is carried out for single msec data, and it is observed that the signal is absent
due to poor SNR and the typical parallel code phase search algorithm fails to de-
tect the distinct peak. Hence longer msec data of coherent integration are used for
improving the SNR of the signal, but there is no signiﬁcant improvement in strip-
ping the noise. On the other hand, even if non-coherent integration is performed,
the acquisition success percentage does not improve due to the large false alarm
peaks. The minimum requirement of 4 visible satellites was not attained in both
coherent and non coherent integration methods. Finally the spiking ﬁlter com-
bined with the differential coherent detection method is tested and it is able to sup-
press the impulse noise and able to locate more number of visible satellites. Table 2
shows the Satellite Vehicle Number (SVN) that is visible using the proposed
method.

The GPS signal and its corresponding spectrum are shown in Fig. 2a and b
respectively. Impulse noise power level of 12 dB is mixed with GPS L1 signal
and it is excised through spiking ﬁlter are shown in Fig. 2c and d. The spectrum
of the retrieved signal resembles the original signal spectrum and the noisy signal
power spectral density as shown in Fig. 2e and f.

The performance metric of the spiking ﬁlter is determined by the maximum
diagonal entry in a performance matrix or the error function (1 (cid:2) Pii) with respect
to the order of the ﬁlter which is shown in Fig. 3a and the impulse response of the
spiking ﬁlter of order 50 is illustrated in Fig. 3b.

The acquisition result of SVN-16 obtained by the conventional methods for sin-
gle msec, coherent, non-coherent and differential coherent detection for the noisy
data is shown in Fig. 4.This depicts that the start of C/A code is not perfectly
aligned with the incoming signal C/A code due to the many cross correlation peaks
that exceed the autocorrelation peaks. So the above mentioned traditional meth-
ods fail to detect the decision statistic or threshold condition of the visible satellite.
Processing of single msec data results in worst correlation. Similarly analyzing of
coherent and non-coherent detection also provides many cross correlation peaks.
By comparing the outputs in Fig. 4, the conventional differential coherent
approach gives a better performance of detecting SVN-16. Only 2 SVNs surpass
the threshold condition but minimum 4 SVNs are required to ﬁnd the user
position.

Next the same noisy data are tested with the spiking ﬁlter combined with differ-
ential coherent detection (modiﬁed differential coherent). Increased visibility of
the satellites [SVN 3, 9, 10, 13, 16, 23 and 30] in terms of distinct peak (perfect
alignment with C/A code) is shown in Fig. 5. This approach performs better com-
pared to other traditional methods and ensures that the corrected code phase and
Doppler frequency enhance the acquisition performance. The results of Table 3
show the visible satellites, their respective Doppler frequency and code phase.

3.2. Determination of acquisition success percentage using Montecarlo simulation

To examine the acquisition performance under noisy condition, all conventional
methods are tested using Montecarlo simulation. In this simulation, the locally

differential and spiking ﬁlter combined differential detection methods. Initially the
Coherent detection integration period of 10 ms is analyzed. Due to navigation
data transition problem, integration time cannot be extended beyond 20 ms and
this method can detect only 35 dB-Hz C/N0 level with 100% of probability of
detection. Non coherent integration period of 36 ms gives 100% probability of
detection only in the signal range of 30 dB-Hz. Both the methods fail to detect
the weak signal at 20 dB-Hz power level. Differential detection also fails to detect
the signal and it gives only 50% of detection with the same input power level. The
inverse spiking ﬁlter integrated with the differential detection performs better and
is able to locate the PRN 3 with 90% of detection.

3.3. Software based GPS receiver tracking performance assessment in the presence
of impulse noise

Acquisition stage gives only a rough estimate of the frequency and code phase of a
satellite signal. Hence it is required to reﬁne these values in order to conﬁrm
whether the acquired satellite metrics is correct or not i.e., code and carrier lock
is achieved with the incoming signal to keep track and demodulate the navigation
data for a particular satellite. Thus to track a GPS signal, two tracking loops are
used. One is code loop known as delay lock loop (DLL) or early-late tracking loop
which is used to track the C/A code phase and the another one is phase-locked
loop (PLL) which is used to track the carrier frequency of the incoming signal with
Doppler shift. Both loops are intercoupled. The impulse noise affected GPS signal
is given as the input to the tracking module and in-phase and quadrature part of

carrier replica with frequency 3.563 MHz is generated to wipe off the carrier from
the input signal. The two equally spaced (±0.5 chip apart) early and late versions
C/A code of visible satellites [SVN 3, 9, 10, 13, 16, 23 and 30] acquired in the
previous section is generated and correlated with the incoming signal to produce
two outputs. These outputs are ﬁltered, squared and compared using an early-late
normalized envelope discriminator. The phase lock loop (PLL) comprises of a
numerically controlled oscillator (NCO), carrier loop ﬁlter and a discriminator
(Kaplan, 1996). The output of the DLL is a signal only modulated with the
navigation data, which is also used as the input to the PLL. The Costas loop is
used for GPS signal tracking in the PLL stage. An arc tangent discriminator that
is insensitive to the phase transition of the navigation data bit transitions is used to
determine the phase shift in the carrier frequency (Kaplan, 1996).The tracking
loop parameters used for simulation are listed in Table 4. Once the lock has been
accomplished, the navigation data bits are extracted from the In-phase arm since
the local carrier signal is in-phase with the incoming signal and all the energy will
be in ‘Ip’.

The impulse noise affected signal processed through traditional differential
detection for SVN-3 is tested for tracking and the performance is given in
Fig. 7. SVN-3 is tested during the acquisition phase as this satellite does not satisfy
the threshold condition and is an invisible satellite. Here the PLL and DLL errors
are not considerably reduced to the minimum extent. The input and reference
signals are not in-phase and the Ip and Qp values contain only noise. The demod-
ulation of navigation data is not possible in this case due to loss of lock with the
incoming signal and the tracking fails to demodulate the navigation data. From
the results we conclude that the noise is not effectively excised; so reacquisition
of GPS data is required.

The tracking operation is next tested for spiking ﬁlter combined with differen-
tial detection. For this method, the carrier frequency settles after 100 ms period
and is shown in Fig. 8a. It is inferred that lock has been achieved for the GPS
signal power level of 20 dB-Hz. The code-phase error and PLL error of SVN-3

are plotted in Fig. 8b and c. The outputs show that the code and carrier loops are
tracking the incoming signal with good accuracy. When the input and reference
signals are in-phase, the I arm only contains the navigation data as indicated in
Fig. 8d and the Q arm contains only noise. The binary navigation data demodu-
lated from the I arm are shown in Fig. 8e.

4. Conclusion

In this paper, a method based on the least square spiking ﬁlter is proposed to
excise the impulse noise in GPS receivers. From the results, it is evident that by
replacing the traditional differential coherent approach by least square spiking
ﬁlter, the detection of the number of visible satellites is increased and the reacqui-
sition of GPS data is avoided. It is shown that coherent, non-coherent detections
handle the GPS signal with C/N0 only up to 35 and 30 dB-Hz, respectively whereas

differential detection is suitable in the range of 25 dB-Hz. The proposed method
efﬁciently excises the noise and provides 90% of probability of detection for
C/N0 of 20 dB-Hz and passes the tracking operation with successful demodulation
of the navigation data. Further tracking results can be passed onto the bit and
frame synchronization modules to ﬁnd the user position with good accuracy.
