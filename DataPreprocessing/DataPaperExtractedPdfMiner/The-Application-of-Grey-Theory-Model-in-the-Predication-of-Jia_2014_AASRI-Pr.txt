Jiangsu Province’s Electric Power Demand

Abstract 

Based on the grey system theory, the paper establishes an electricity demand forecasting model for Jiangsu province, and 
verifies  it  using  the  data  from  the  year  1997  to  2012.  The  result  shows  that  the  accuracy  of  this  forecast  model  is 
“superior". This  proved that  GM  (1,  1)  model used  for  the  electricity demand forecasting  of  Jiangsu  province can  fully 
meet the needs of the forecast of electricity. In the mean time, the electricity demand of Jiangsu from the year 2013 to 
2015(which year is the end of China's twelfth five-year plan) was forecasted by applying the model and the result shows 
that the electricity consumption in Jiangsu province will increase rapidly in the next few years. Up to the year 2015, it will 
reach  0.7187  trillion  kW·h,  which  requests  the  acceleration  of  the  generation  of  power,  so  as  to  meet  the  needs  of  the 
economic development of Jiangsu province in the next few years.

1. Introduction 

There are several factors that contribute to electricity demand: economic development, industrial structure, 
income levels, climate, geography, national policies (such as electricity price), and etc.. Some of these factors

are definite, while some are not. So it can be seen as a grey system, and the explanation and forecasting can be 
done with the theory and methods of Grey System [1].

Grey  System  Theory  is  a  kind  of  systematic  and  scientific  theory  initiated  by  Chinese  scholar  Professor 
Deng Julong in the 1980s. Currently, it has been widely used in the power demand forecast. The theory agrees 
that all the random sample varieties are  the changing grey varieties within a range, that is to say the whole 
random process is considered as the grey variety varying within a certain range. According to the past and the 
present  known  or  uncertain  information  and  with  the  approach  of  data  generation,  the  raw  data  can  be 
transformed into a greatly regular generating series and then the related research and modeling can be done. 
This  method  can  be  applied  when  there  are  few  raw  data,  and  the  accuracy  of  forecasting  can  be  highly 
increased  by  accumulating  the  data  certainty  relatively  enhanced  to  some  extent  and  the  data  uncertainty 
relatively  weakened  to  some  extent.  Grey  forecasting  model  is  predicting  with  the  model  of  GM,  which  is 
short  for Grey  Model.  GM Models  can be  divided  into GM  (1,  n)  model  and GM (1, 1)  model:  GM  (1, n) 
model  is  the  grey  model  established  by  the  first  order  differential  equations  with  n  variables,  which  is  a 
forecasting model established between the load and n influential varieties; while GM (1, 1) model is the most 
common grey model, which is established by the first-order differential equation only with a single variable 
and is also the special case of GM (1, n) model [2]..

A good forecasting model requires a rather small  C , that is, the best  C  is smaller than 0.35, and not bigger 
than 0.65. Another indicator by which to judge it is good or bad is a larger small error frequency  P , which is 
required to be bigger than 0.95 and not smaller than 0.7. According to the value of  P and C , there are four

3. Examples of model forecasting 

Through  the distribution  in  Jiangsu province  (from  1997  to 2012)  of  electricity  consumption,  population 
and  GDP  in  every  industry,  and  according  to  the  above  established  GM  (1,1)  grey  forecasting  system,  the 
annual  electricity  consumption  can  be  predicted  and  the  forecasting  accuracy  of  the  model  can  be  verified 
through correlation tests. 

3.1 Model data 

Social electricity consumption from 1997 to 2012 in Jiangsu province and its distribution in every industry 

are shown in Table 2.

(cid:712)the  precision  of  this  power  consumption  forecasting  model  can  be  seen  as 

This  essay  will  apply  the  established  model  to  forecast  the  social  electricity  consumption  from  2013  to 

2015, in which year China would have completed the 12th five-year plan.

4. Conclusion 

(1) The forecasting model of power consumption in Jiangsu province is established in this essay through 
the grey system theory. And the accuracy of the model is tested by the data from 1997 to 2012 and it turns out 
,  which  illustrates  that  the 
that  the  accuracy  is  “superior”,  for  the  indicator  value:
electricity consumption of Jiangsu province by GM (1, 1) is consistent with the electricity forecast.

35.0(cid:31)C

 and 

(2) The electricity consumption of Jiangsu from 2013 to 2015 is forecasted through this model, and it turns 
out that in the next few years, the electricity consumption in Jiangsu province will be increasing rapidly, and 
by the year 2015 it will reach 0.7187 trillion kW(cid:129)h, which requires to speed up generation of power to meet 
the economic development of the province in the next few years. 

(3) The next step will be to predict the power consumption in various industries according to the economic 
development  of  Jiangsu  province,  and  the  electricity  consumption  of  each  industry  and  its  corresponding 
contribution  value  to  GDP.  And  distribution  of  electricity  consumption  should  be  optimized  to  meet  the 
adjustment and upgrade of industrial structure during the rest years of the 12th five-year plan.
