Since December 2019, the world has been fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic. This epidemic has revealed a 
bitter truth that though humans have advanced to unprecedented heights in the last few decades in terms of 
technology, they are lagging far behind in the fields of medical science and health care. Several institutes and 
research  organizations  have  stepped  up  to  introduce  different  vaccines  to  combat  the  pandemic.  Bangladesh 
government has also taken steps to provide widespread vaccinations from January 2021. The Bangladeshi net-
izens  are  frequently  sharing  their  thoughts,  emotions,  and  experiences  about  the  COVID-19  vaccines  and  the 
vaccination process on different social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, etc. This study has analyzed the views 
and opinions that they have expressed on different social media platforms about the vaccines and the ongoing 
vaccination program. For performing this study, the reactions of the Bangladeshi netizens on social media have 
been collected. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model has been used to extract the most common topics 
expressed by the netizens regarding the vaccines and vaccination process in Bangladesh. Finally, this study has 
applied different deep learning as well as traditional machine learning algorithms to identify the sentiments and 
polarity of the opinions of the netizens. The performance of these models has been assessed using a variety of 
metrics  such  as  accuracy,  precision,  sensitivity,  specificity,  and  F1-score  to  identify  the  best  one.  Sentiment 
analysis lessons from these opinions can help the government to prepare itself for the future pandemic.   

1. Introduction 

The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  proclaimed  COVID-19  a 
pandemic in January 2020 [1]. COVID-19 has created substantial ram-
ifications on people’s everyday lives all across the world. According to 
reports, COVID-19 has affected over 380 million people, with over 5.68 
million individuals dying as of January 2022 [2]. Bangladesh is one of 
the  world’s  most  densely  inhabited  countries.  It  is  one  of  the  worst 
victims of this epidemic because of its large population. In Bangladesh, 
there  are  more  than  1.80  million  confirmed  cases  of  COVID-19  by 
January 2022, with over 28,000 deaths [3]. Various health precautions, 
such  as  keeping  social  distance,  wearing  masks,  and  maintaining 
appropriate sanitization, are necessary to avert this pandemic. However, 
taking adequate health precautions alone is not enough to remove this 
pandemic from the planet. Vaccination is the only method to stop the 

spread of this disease. Countries like the USA, China, Russia have come 
forward to produce vaccines. The developed countries are performing 
mass vaccination. The government of Bangladesh has also taken steps to 
begin vaccinations from early 2021. By January 2022, more than 160 
million  doses  of  vaccines  have  been  administered,  and  more  than  62 
million persons have been fully vaccinated [3]. 

The  number  of  individuals  who  use  social  media  has  increased  in 
tandem with the number of people using the internet. Different social 
media platforms have emerged as the primary means for internet users 
to express their emotions and reactions in recent years [4]. More than 2 
billion people regularly share their daily activities through social media 
platforms  [5].  According  to  a  study,  there  are  currently  3.50  billion 
internet users worldwide. One in every three persons in the world uses 
different  social  media  sites.  Some  of  the  most  popular  platforms  are 
Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. By 2019, there are around 2.40 billion

Zulfiker et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

Facebook users, 330 million Twitter users, and over 1.90 billion You-
Tube users [6]. 

Due to the simplicity of these social media sites, users rely heavily on 
these platforms for sharing news and information. These platforms have 
become  the  prime  sources  of  health-related  information  also.  In  the 
current  COVID-19  situation,  people  are  vastly  sharing  and  discussing 
their views on the pandemic, vaccines and the vaccination process. Users 
post both positive and negative news and opinions. Sometimes negative 
and  fake  information  about  the  vaccines  and  the  vaccination  process 
creates  vaccine  hesitancy,  leading  individuals  to  be  disinterested  in 
getting vaccinated. In 2019, vaccine hesitancy was enlisted as one of the 
ten most significant implications to global health [7]. Fake, as well as 
misleading  information  regarding  the  vaccination  procedure,  has  the 
ability to lessen a country’s vaccination rate. 

With  the  beginning  of  the  vaccination  program  for  COVID-19  in 
Bangladesh,  Bangladeshi  netizens  are  also  using  social  networking 
platforms to express their views and reactions. They have shown mixed 
reactions  to  the  ongoing  vaccination  program.  However,  very  few 
studies  have  been  conducted  to  analyze  the  opinions  and  feelings  of 
Bangladeshi  netizens  about  the  COVID-19  vaccination  program.  This 
work attempts to fill this gap. Based on different demographic attributes, 
this  study  looked  at  how  social  media  users  felt  about  the  COVID-19 
vaccines  and  the  ongoing  vaccination  campaigns  in  Bangladesh.  This 
study also aims to extract the most essential themes expressed by the 
Bangladeshi netizens regarding these campaigns. Finally, this research 
has suggested several machine learning and deep learning approaches 
for  assessing  the  polarity  of  social  media  users’  views  about  Bangla-
desh’s  vaccination  program  and  has  picked  the  best  model  that  can 
accurately identify the polarity of users’ emotions. 

By  utilizing  the  methodologies  and  approaches  described  in  this 
study, Bangladesh government and policymakers can be aware of the 
actual opinions and sentiments of the Bangladeshi residents towards the 
ongoing  vaccination  campaigns.  They  can  learn  about  the  most  con-
cerning issues raised by the citizens about these campaigns. Based on 
this information, the government may take appropriate actions to ensure 
that the people of Bangladesh receive enough services regarding vacci-
nation. Government can also be aware of the common misconceptions of 
the  Bangladeshi  citizens  about  the  vaccine.  By  analyzing  these  mis-
conceptions, they can take suitable initiatives to raise awareness among 
the  native  citizens  against  these  fallacies.  Besides,  lessons  from  these 
opinions  can  help  the  government  to  prepare  itself  for  the  future 
pandemic. 

The key contributions of this study are as follows:  

i.  Constructing  a  corpus  of  the  Bangladeshi  public  opinion 
regarding the COVID-19 vaccines and the vaccination campaigns. 
ii. Analyzing  the views of Bangladeshi citizens regarding  the  vac-

cines and the vaccination campaigns. 

iii. Exploring  various  deep  learning  and  machine  learning  ap-
proaches  to  anticipate  the  Bangladeshi  population’s  attitudes 
towards the vaccine and vaccination campaigns. 

The remainder of the paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 portrays 
the  related  works  of  the  study.  The  methodology  for  analyzing  the 
opinions of the Bangladeshi netizens regarding the COVID-19 vaccine 
and  the  ongoing  vaccination  program  is  delineated  in  Section  3.  The 
result of the study is exhibited in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes 
the paper by outlining some potential future scopes. 

2. Related works 

It  can  be  undoubtedly  said  that  COVID-19  has  posed  an  extreme 
threat to human lives. This threat also sparked the rapid development of 
its  vaccines.  Misinformation  communicated  through  online  social 
media,  on  the  other  hand,  frequently  contributes  to  negative  vaccine 
sentiments  and  hesitation.  Understanding  how  people  feel  about  the 

vaccine and the vaccination process as expressed on social media can 
help  with  disease  monitoring,  control,  and  eventual  eradication.  The 
threat  of  infectious  disease  has  a  significant  impact  on  how  people 
perceive and act in a variety of ways, and thus this is a complicated issue. 
In this part, we’ve looked into a variety of high-quality related research 
studies to understand the findings and limitations of each one. 

Naseem et al. [1] used a large dataset of ninety thousand COVID-19 
related tweets to examine public attitudes towards the pandemic. The 
study was conducted with a view to discovering the most popular issues 
discussed  by  Twitter  users  about  the  COVID-19  epidemic.  The  LDA 
model was used to perform the topic modelling. Different machine and 
deep learning-based models were employed for predicting the polarity 
of the public sentiments regarding the pandemic. According to the study, 
the  Bidirectional  Encoder  Representations  from  Transformers  (BERT) 
model showed the best performance in classifying the public sentiments. 
Chakraborty et al. [8] performed their study to analyze the polarity 
of public opinions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic also. According to 
this  study,  although  individuals  were  tweeting  mostly  positive  state-
ments  about  the  epidemic,  the  majority  of  the  retweets  represented 
negative feelings. The authors proposed a deep learning-based model to 
identify the polarity of the public sentiments regarding the epidemic and 
achieved an accuracy of 81%. They also proposed a fuzzy model based 
on  the  Gaussian  Membership  Function  to  determine  the  polarity  of 
public opinions. Doing so, they achieved an accuracy of 79%. 

Shim et al. [9] collected the public opinion regarding the COVID-19 
vaccine in Korea. This study utilized LDA to retrieve the most prevalent 
topics discussed by the Korean population about the COVID-19 vaccine. 
For identifying the polarity of the public attitudes towards the vaccine, 
this study proposed a Bi-Directional LSTM (Bi LSTM) model. This study 
found that initially, the ratio of positive and negative tweets about the 
vaccine was almost the same. However, there was a rise in the number of 
negative tweets about the vaccine with the increase in the number of 
COVID-19  affected  cases.  In  the  negative  tweets,  the  Twitter  users 
expressed their fear and disappointment about the vaccine. 

The reactions of the Filipino citizens to the Philippine government’s 
COVID-19  immunization  efforts  were  studied  by  Villavicencio  et  al. 
[10].  The  study  classified  the  polarity  of  sentiments  into  three  cate-
gories, namely positive, negative, and neutral. This study employed the 
Naive Bayes classifier to identify the polarity of the opinions and ach-
ieved an accuracy of 81.77%. 

The Naive Bayes classifier was also used by Pristiyono et al. [11] to 
analyze  the  sentiments  of  the  Indonesian  citizens  regarding  the 
COVID-19 vaccines. According to this study, the tweets regarding the 
vaccine were mostly dominated by negative sentiments. 

Lyu  et  al.  [12]  conducted  a  study  for  identifying  sentiments  and 
topics in COVID-19 vaccine-related social media discussions. This study 
also tried to detect the shifts in the topics and the emotions over time 
about the vaccine. They used LDA for topic modelling as well as senti-
ment and emotion analysis on a total of 1,499,421 tweets from 583,499 
different  persons.  Finally,  they  discovered  that  topic  modelling  of 
vaccine-related tweets produced 16 topics that were arranged into five 
main themes. However, due to the period of their data set, they did not 
investigate sentiments against individual vaccine brands. 

Machine learning (ML) algorithms were utilized by Kwok et al. [13] 
for extracting the sentiments and topics regarding COVID-19 immuni-
zation on Twitter. They examined tweets by displaying high-frequency 
word  clouds  and  relationships  between  word  tokens  after  collecting 
31,100 English tweets. They constructed an LDA topic model for iden-
tifying the common topics in the enormous numbers of tweets. Three 
topics were discovered as a result of their investigation. Only one-third 
of all tweets showed negative thoughts regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, 
with nearly two-thirds expressing positivity. The two most prominent 
positive sentiments among the eight basic emotions discovered in this 
study were trust and anticipation. 

Alam et al. [14] conducted a study to identify and untangle people’s 
diverse  sentiments  about  vaccination  using  deep  learning  techniques.

The  attitudes  of  people  towards  the  vaccines  of  various  kinds  were 
examined in this study using natural language processing (NLP) tech-
niques and they visualized the scenario by grouping the polarities of the 
received  feelings  into  three  categories,  i.e.  positive,  negative,  and 
neutral. The performance of the predictive models was evaluated using a 
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) including Long Short-Term Memory 
(LSTM) and Bi-Directional LSTM (Bi LSTM). Here, LSTM and Bi LSTM 
obtained an accuracy of 90.59% and 90.83%, respectively. 

Hayawi  et  al.  [15]  presented  a  unique  COVID-19  vaccination 
misinformation detection framework based on machine learning (ML). 
They used ML techniques to classify vaccination misinformation after 
collecting and annotating COVID-19 vaccine tweets. They categorized 
more than 15,000 tweets into two categories using credible sources and 
taking the help of specialists. This research work used Extreme Gradient 
Boosting (XGBoost), LSTM, and the BERT transformer model for classi-
fication.  Among  these  models,  the  BERT  model  showed  the  best  per-
formance. They concluded that machine learning-based algorithms are 
successful at detecting COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. 

Basiri  et  al.  [16]  proposed  a  unique  technique  for  analyzing  the 
sentiment  of  the  tweets  relating  coronavirus  from  eight  countries  by 
combining  different  deep  learning  and  traditional  machine  learning 
model.  They  also  used  Google  Trends  to  examine  coronavirus-related 
queries  to  better  understand  how  sentiment  changed  over  time  in 
different  locations.  The  coronavirus  drew  peoples’  attention  from 
various countries at different periods and with variable degrees of in-
tensity, according to their results. Additionally, their tweets reflect their 
attitudes on events and news in their countries, such as the number of 
new  cases  of  infection,  fatalities,  and  recoveries.  Furthermore, 
throughout  the  transmission  of  the  infection,  a  common  sentiment 
pattern is noticed in numerous countries. 

Nezhad  and Deihimi  [17] presented a study that analyzed Iranian 
people’s views on COVID-19 vaccination using Persian tweets. To begin, 
they extracted 803,278 Persian tweets from Twitter using various key-
words to determine their sentiments. For analyzing the sentiments of the 
tweets, they utilized a deep learning model based on CNN-LSTM archi-
tecture.  Finally,  they  discovered  a  slight  variation  in  the  number  of 
positive opinions towards domestic and imported vaccines. The study 
stated  that  the  imported  vaccines  had  the  majority  of  positive 
sentiments. 

Melton  et  al.  [18]  performed  sentiment  analysis  and  LDA  topic 
modelling  on  textual  data  obtained  from  13  Reddit  communities 
concentrating  on  the  COVID-19  vaccination.  To  discover  changes  in 

sentiment and to identify the latent topics of the opinions of the com-
munity  members,  data  was  aggregated  and  examined  by  month.  Ac-
cording to polarity analysis, these communities indicated more positive 
sentiments  than  negative  sentiments  towards  vaccine-related  topics. 
Topic  modelling  demonstrated  that  community  members  were  more 
concerned  with  adverse  effects  than  bizarre  conspiracy  theories. 
Throughout  the  LDA  topic  modelling,  keywords  indicating  vaccine 
hesitancy were discovered. 

Yang et al. [19] investigated the misconceptions and misinformation 
about  the  Covid-19  pandemic.  They  categorized  the  misconceptions 
regarding  Covid-19  into  five  groups.  They  found  that  majority  of 
Covid-19  misconceptions  addressed  the  spreading  of  the  virus.  More-
over, they also found that the misconceptions regarding the propagation 
of the virus and preventive methods spread quicker than the other cat-
egories. They employed a deep neural network-based model to identify 
the emotions of the tweets propagating misconceptions. They noticed 
that fear was the most prevalent emotion in these tweets. 

Zhou et al. [20] explored the dynamics of depression in the tweets of 
the citizens of a state of Australia during the Covid-19 pandemic. Ac-
cording  to  this  study, the  epidemic  increased  the  citizens’  depression 
levels.  For  analyzing  depression  among  the  inhabitants  of  that  state, 
they  extracted  multimodal  and  term  frequency-inverse  document  fre-
quency  (TF-IDF)  features  from  their  tweets.  To  identify  depression 
among  the  tweets,  they  utilized  different  state-of-the-art  machine 
learning algorithms. 

Zhou et al. [21] also investigated the dynamics of public opinions 
toward the Covid-19 outbreak. By analyzing the tweets of the residents 
of Australia’s New South Wales state, they discovered that the pandemic 
decreased the overall positive polarity of the sentiments. Furthermore, 
they  investigated  the  population’s  sentiment  patterns  in  response  to 
various social events and governmental decisions. They employed the 
Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER) model to 
analyze the polarity of the sentiments. 

Yin et al. [22] conducted a study to analyze the public attitudes to-
ward the Covid-19 vaccine. In addition, they identified the most com-
mon  and  discussed  vaccine-related  topics.  They  used  LDA  for  topic 
modelling and the VADER model to determine the polarity of the feel-
ings. According to the findings of this study, the majority of the netizens 
showed a willingness to be vaccinated. This study also showed that the 
netizens had unfavourable feelings regarding the news of adverse effects 
of the vaccines, shortfalls of the vaccines, and fatalities following taking 
the vaccines.

news portals, health organizations, etc. and, 83.35% of opinions were 
gathered from personal accounts. The organizational accounts included 
the pages of UNICEF Bangladesh, UNICEF South Asia, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, and various newspapers like The Daily 
Star, Dhaka Tribune, etc.

3.2. Data labelling 

Yin et al. [23] analyzed the dynamics of topics and sentiments on 
social networking sites. They found that tweets associated with home 
quarantine conveyed mostly positive views, and tweets discussing the 
mortalities due to the pandemic mostly expressed negative sentiments. 
Based on the preceding discussions, it can be stated that no research 
work  has  been  conducted  yet  to  analyze  the  opinions  of  Bangladeshi 
netizens regarding the vaccine and the vaccination process using ma-
chine  learning,  deep  learning  and  natural  language  processing  tech-
niques. This research has paved the way to fill this void. This study has 
utilized different deep learning and traditional machine learning tech-
niques to identify the polarity of the opinions of the Bangladeshi neti-
zens. Furthermore, this study has extracted the latent topics discussed by 
the Bangladeshis in social media regarding the COVID-19 vaccine and 
the vaccination campaigns. 

3. Methodology 

The following subsections cover the overall strategy for extracting 
the  most  common  topics  discussed  by  the  Bangladeshi  netizens  and 
identifying the polarity of their sentiments towards the COVID-19 vac-
cine and the vaccination program using a variety of deep learning and 
traditional machine learning algorithms. 

3.1. Data collection 

For conducting this study, we have constructed a dataset including 
1075 statuses, comments, and tweets of the Bangladeshi netizens. We 
collected the data between June 2020 and July 2021. Opinions written 
in  the  English  language  have  been  considered  only  to  generate  the 
dataset. Fig. 1 shows the monthly percentage of the gathered opinions 
from June 2020 to July 2021. From the trend in Fig. 1, we can state that 
people  were  reluctant  to  express  their  sentiments  and  emotions 
regarding the vaccines in 2020. But from January 2021, the number of 
opinions  regarding  the  vaccine  and  vaccination  process  increased 
rapidly with the initiation of the vaccination program. 

Fig. 1 indicates that the most opinions were acquired in May 2021, 
and the least opinions were acquired in November 2020. 25.30% of the 
total opinions were gathered in May 2021, but on the other hand, only 
0.65% of the total opinions were collected in November 2020. In May 
2021, China provided free vaccines as a gift to Bangladesh in several 
phases.  Besides,  a  Bangladeshi  pharmaceutical  company  took  the 
initiative to import the Moderna vaccine for the first time in Bangladesh. 
The netizens frequently expressed their opinions regarding these events, 
causing  a  surge  in  the  amount  of  posted  tweets,  status  updates,  and 
comments on social media. 

Fig. 2 depicts the percentage of opinions acquired from the organi-
zational and personal accounts. It shows that 16.65% of the total opin-
ions  were  collected  from  the  accounts  of  different  organizations  like 

For  labelling  the  polarity  of  the  statements,  we  employed  seven 
volunteers. The volunteers labelled the sentiment of each statement of 
the  dataset  into  two  categories:  positive  and  negative.  The  majority 
rating of the volunteers was used to determine the absolute polarity of a 
statement. 

The  inter-rater  reliability  score  for  labelling  the  statements  was 
estimated  using  the  Krippendorff’s  Alpha  [24]  and  the  Fleiss’  Kappa 
[25] reliability tests. Table 1 shows that both Krippendorff’s Alpha and 
Fleiss’ Kappa inter-rater reliability scores are more than 0.80. So, it can 
be  stated  that  the  strength  of  the  agreements  of  the  volunteers  in 
labelling the statements is high enough. 

After taking the majority voting of the seven volunteers, 595 state-
ments were identified to have positive polarities. On the other hand, 480 
statements  were  found  to  have  negative  polarities.  Fig.  3  shows  the 
monthly percentage of positive and negative opinions. 

From Fig. 3, it can be stated that the percentage of opinions having 
positive polarities is greater than the percentage of negative polarities in 
most of the months, except June 2020, August 2020, November 2020, 
December  2020,  and  January  2021.  The  Bangladesh  government  has 
started the vaccination program in the last week of January 2021. So, 
the positive sentiments of the Bangladeshi netizens towards the vaccine 
and the vaccination program have increased after January 2021. 

Fig. 4 depicts the sentiment dynamics of every ten days. Before the 
vaccination  campaign,  there  was  a  lot  of  skepticism  and  negative 
opinions  concerning  the  vaccines.  However,  after  January  2021,  the 
citizens overwhelmingly expressed positive opinions about the vaccines. 
The number of affected cases in Bangladesh increased dramatically 
in March 2021. As a result, there was a rise in the percentage of negative 
sentiments following the first week of March 2021. There was a shortage 
of  vaccines  in  mid-April  2021,  and  the  netizens  frequently  expressed 
unpleasant opinions in that timeline. Also, from the end of June to the 
middle  of  July  2021,  the  ratio  of  the  negative  sentiments  was  pretty 
high. During that time period, there was also a scarcity of vaccines in the 
country. 

Fig.  5  (a)  and  Fig.  5  (b)  show  the  10-Day  Moving  Average  of  the 
number  of  positive  and  negative  opinions  for  2021,  respectively.  In 
Fig. 5,  only  the  opinions  from January  2021  to  July  2021  have  been 
considered, as over 80% of opinions in the collected dataset are from this 
time period. 

Fig. 6 (a) and Fig. 6 (b) represents the word cloud of the opinions 

having positive and negative sentiments, respectively. 

3.3. Topic modelling 

Topic modelling technique extracts a text document’s latent topics. It 
also groups the documents into the topics and themes that have been 
discovered. In this study, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model

has been used to extract the most discussed topics among the Bangla-
deshi  citizens  regarding  the  vaccine  and  the  vaccination  process.  In 
2003, Blei et al. proposed the LDA model [26]. Documents are seen by 
LDA as a collection of topics. Topics, on the other hand, are treated as a 
blend  of  words.  The probability  of  each  word  appearing in  a  topic is 
measured. If a word has a high probability of appearing in a topic, all 
documents containing that word are tightly linked to that topic. 

This study has extracted the top five dominant topics from the corpus 
containing positive statements and the top five dominant topics from the 
corpus containing negative statements of the Bangladeshi netizens about 
the vaccine and the vaccination process. The top five prevalent topics 
were selected from the corpuses of the positive and the negative state-
ments based on the perplexity score. A lower perplexity score suggests a 
higher generalization ability. The perplexity scores for top n(cid:0)
topics 
(2 ≤ n ≤ 5) were measured. Table 2 shows that, the perplexity scores 
were the lowest for the top five dominant topics. 

Table  3  shows  the  top  fifteen  words  of  the  top  five  topics  in  the 

corpus containing the positive statements extracted by LDA. 
Some insights of the topics of Table 3 are as follows: 

Topic 1: It represents the appreciation of the netizens for the gov-
ernment’s  effort  in  allowing  to  start  the  manufacturing  of  the 
country’s indigenous vaccine, Bangavax. 
Topic 2: When millions of Sinopharm, Moderna, and Pfizer vaccines 
arrived in Bangladesh for mass immunization, people were ecstatic. 
Topic 3: When Globe Biotech announced that they had developed the 
COVID-19 vaccine, the netizens took it very positively. 
Topic 4: People stated that they had no side effects and were all right 
after taking the vaccine. 
Topic 5: After receiving their first/second dosage of vaccines, neti-
zens expressed their gratitude to the authority and the Bangladesh 
government. 
Table  4  shows  the  top  fifteen  words  of  the  top  five  topics  in  the 
corpus containing the negative statements extracted by LDA. 

Some insights of the topics of Table 4 are as follows: 

Topic 1: Even after taking the vaccines, many became infected with 
COVID-19. As a result, internet users raised their doubts regarding 
the originality of the vaccines. 

Array15(2022)1002045Md.S. Zulfiker et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

Fig. 5. Ten (10) day moving average of the positive and negative opinions.  

Topic 2: According to the netizens, different foreign countries were 
allegedly playing politics when it came to delivering vaccine doses to 
Bangladesh.  They  also  claimed  that  foreign  countries  were 
demanding a high price for vaccines. 
Topic 3: The netizens stated that different pharmaceutical companies 
and foreign countries were doing business regarding the vaccine. So, 
they encouraged others to avoid taking vaccines. 
Topic 4: Netizens were discussing the side effects of the vaccines. 
Topic  5:  When  the  government  failed  to  acquire  vaccines  despite 
making advance payments to other countries for vaccines, netizens 
expressed  their  dissatisfaction.  Moreover,  they  demanded  that  the 
government should take back the money that was paid in advance. 

3.4. Implementation procedures 

This section describes the procedures of predicting the polarity of the 
Bangladeshi netizens’ remarks on the vaccine and the vaccination pro-
cess. The entire technique is depicted in Fig. 7. 

The following subsections describe the whole procedures. 

3.4.1. Data cleaning 

Facebook  and  Twitter  users  frequently  use  different  emojis  and 
emoticons in their statuses and tweets. As this research only focuses on 

text  data,  these  emojis  and  emoticons  have  been  removed  from  the 
collected dataset. Netizens also utilize hashtags to symbolize a variety of 
trends and topics. The hash characters of the hashtags are removed in 
this  step.  Often  two  or  more  words  are  concatenated  in  the  hashtag 
words,  which  may  affect  the  performance  of  the  machine  learning 
models. So, the hashtag words have been segmented in this step. 

3.4.2. Tokenization 

Tokenization is the technique of splitting the words/terms of a string. 

In this step, each statement of the input dataset has been tokenized. 

3.4.3. Removal of punctuation marks and stop words 

The presence of punctuation marks and stop words may cause the 
models to perform poorly. The stop words are the most prevalent words 
in a language. They seldom have a significant impact in determining the 
polarity of a statement. So, the punctuation marks and the unnecessary 
stop  words  have  been  removed  after  performing  tokenization.  As 
negation  is  represented  by  words  like  “not”  and  “no,”  they  were 
excluded from the list of stop words. 

3.4.4. Vectorization of the statements 

In  this  step,  we  constructed  a  vocabulary  with  the  most  frequent 
words of the corpus. Then vectorization is performed by mapping each

3.4.5. Data splitting 

Here, the acquired dataset has been split into train and test data. 20% 
data of the dataset has been used for constructing the test dataset. The 
remaining 80% of the data has been utilized for training the models.

3.4.6. Models for classification 

Different  deep  learning  models  such  as  Long  Short-Term  Memory 
(LSTM),  Bi-Directional  LSTM  (Bi  LSTM),  1D  Convolutional  Neural 
Network (1D-CNN), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and some 
traditional machine learning models like Decision Tree (DT), Gradient 
Boost  (GB),  and  Support  Vector  Machine  (SVM)  have  been  used  to 
classify the polarity of netizens’ sentiments towards the vaccines and the 
vaccination campaigns. The architecture of the proposed deep learning 
models are portrayed in Fig. 8 (a)-(d). 

Each of the deep learning models has employed pre-trained word- 
embedding models. Both pre-trained word2vec and GloVe models have 
been employed in the embedding layer. 

The  proposed  LSTM  model  consists  of  two  LSTM  layers.  The  first 
LSTM layer has 256 LSTM units, whereas the second LSTM layer has 128 
LSTM units. Two dense layers with Rectified Linear Unit (RELU) acti-
vation function have been placed after the LSTM layers. Each of these 
LSTM and dense layers is followed by a dropout layer with a dropout 
rate of 0.2. Finally, Batch Normalization has been applied. After that, the 
final  dense  layer  has  been  added.  It  has  used  the  Softmax  activation 

Array15(2022)1002047Md.S. Zulfiker et al.

function. 

The proposed Bi LSTM model has an almost similar architecture to 
the proposed LSTM model. It also has two Bi LSTM layers. The first Bi 
LSTM layer consists of 100 units and the second Bi LSTM layer consists 
of 32 units. 

In the suggested 1D-CNN model, there are two 1D-CNN layers. The 
first CNN layer has 256 filters and the second CNN layer has 128 filters. 
Both layers have a kernel size of three. Before the first CNN layer, there 
is a Spatial Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.3. A dropout layer 
follows the first CNN layer, and a Global Max Pooling layer follows the 
second CNN layer. After the Global Max Pooling layer, there is a dense 
layer  with  512  hidden  nodes,  which  is  followed  by  another  dropout 
layer. Following this dropout layer, there is another dense layer with 
256 hidden nodes. This dense layer is also followed by another dropout 
layer. The dropout rates of all of these dropout layers are 0.3. The final 
dense layer utilizes the Softmax activation function and has 2 hidden 
nodes.  Before  the  final  dense  layer,  batch  normalization  has  been 
applied. 

The  proposed  TCN  model consists  of  a  single  TCN  layer  with  256 
filters. The kernel size of this layer is three. The TCN layer is preceded by 
a Spatial Dropout layer. After the TCN layer, there is a dropout layer. 
The model consists of four dense layers, including the final dense layer. 
The dense layers have 512, 256, 128, and 2 nodes, respectively. The first 
three dense layers are followed by dropout layers. The dropout rate of all 
of  these  dropout  layers  is  0.3.  Before  the  final  dense  layer,  batch 
normalization is applied. The final dense layer uses the Softmax acti-
vation function. 

In these deep learning models, Binary Cross Entropy has been used as 

the loss function, and Adam has been used as the optimizer. 

3.4.7. Performance evaluation and final decision 

In  this  step,  the  proposed  deep  learning  and  machine  learning 
models’  performances  have  been  assessed  using  several  performance 
metrics  like  accuracy,  precision,  specificity,  sensitivity,  and  F1-score. 
Based on these performance metrics, the best model for classifying the 
sentiments of the netizens has been chosen. 

4. Results and discussion 

For analyzing the performance of the proposed models, 215 state-
ments of the netizens have been used. Among the statements of the test 
dataset, 56.74% statements have a positive polarity and the rest, 43.26% 
statements have a negative polarity. Different performance metrics such 

as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1- score have been 
computed for assessing the performance of the suggested models using 
the following formulas.

• TPPolarity  (True Positive Polarity): When a proposed model iden-
tifies the polarity of a statement as positive and the original polarity 
of that statement is also positive, then the outcome is known as True 
Positive Polarity. 

• TNPolarity (True Negative Polarity): When a proposed model iden-
tifies the polarity of a statement as negative and the original polarity 
of that statement is also negative, then the outcome is known as True 
Negative Polarity. 

• FPPolarity  (False Positive Polarity): When a proposed model iden-
tifies the polarity of a statement as positive but the original polarity 
of that statement is  negative, then the  outcome is  known as False 
Positive Polarity.  

• FNPolarity  (False  Negative  Polarity):  When  a  suggested  model 
identifies  the  polarity  of  a  statement  as  negative  but  the  original 
polarity of that statement is positive, then the outcome is known as 
False Negative Polarity.

score of the proposed deep learning and traditional machine learning 
models are shown in Table 7 and Table 8, respectively. 

From Tables 7 and 8, it can be stated that the deep learning models 
have outperformed the traditional machine learning models to a great 
extent. 

Bi LSTM with the pre-trained word2vec embedding model has shown 
the  highest  accuracy  of  87.44%  among  the  deep  learning  models.  In 
terms of accuracy, the word2vec embedding based deep learning models 
have shown better performances than the GloVe embedding based deep 
learning models. The accuracies of LSTM, 1D-CNN and TCN models with 
word2vec embedding are 86.05%, 85.12%, and 86.51%, respectively. 
On the other hand, the accuracies of LSTM, Bi LSTM, 1D-CNN and TCN 
models  with  GloVe  embedding  are  85.12%,  85.58%,  84.19%,  and 
85.58%, respectively. 

Precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score play essential roles in 
evaluating  the  performance  of  machine  learning  or  deep  learning 
models, in addition to accuracy. Bi LSTM with the pre-trained word2vec 
embedding model has portrayed the best performance in terms of pre-
cision, and it has achieved a precision of 89.26%. This model has also 
shown  the  highest  specificity  and  F1-  score  of  86.02%  and  88.89%, 
respectively. GloVe embedding based deep learning models have shown 
better  performance  than  word2vec  embedding  based  deep  learning 
models  in  terms  of  sensitivity.  1D-CNN  with  the  pre-trained  GloVe 
embedding model has achieved the highest sensitivity of 93.44%. After 
the  GloVe  embedding  based  1D-CNN  model,  the  GloVe  embedding 
based Bi LSTM has shown the best sensitivity of 92.62%. 

SVM showed the highest accuracy of 63.72% among the traditional 
machine learning algorithms. The achieved accuracies of DT and GB are 
52.09% and 60.47%, respectively. SVM, DT, and GB attained precisions 
of 57.25%, 63.12%, and 64.67%, respectively. In terms of sensitivity, 
SVM outperformed DT and GB. It attained a sensitivity of 79.51%, while 
the  attained  sensitivities  of  DT  and  GB  are  61.48%  and  72.95%, 
respectively. The traditional machine learning models also showed poor 
performance  in  the  case  of  other  performance  metrics  like  specificity

and F1- score. 

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve with Area Under 
Curve (AUC) values of the deep learning models are shown in Fig. 9 (a)- 
(d). When a model’s AUC value is equal to 1, the model is regarded to be 
the perfect model for classification. If the AUC value of a model is equal 
to 0.5, then the model will provide random outcomes. That means the 
later model is unable to differentiate between different classes. The AUC 
values of all the proposed deep learning models are more than 0.9. So it 
can be stated that all of the suggested deep learning models are almost 
flawless. 

The ROC curve of a classifier is a two-dimensional graph that plots 
the true-positive rate of that classifier against its false-positive rate at 
various threshold levels. The better the performance of a classifier, the 
closer the ROC curve of that model is to the top left corner of the graph. 
Fig. 9 (a)–(d) shows that the ROC curves of LSTM, Bi LSTM, and TCN 
with  the  word2vec  pre-trained  embedding  is  closer  to  the  upper  left 
corner of the graph than the ROC curves of these models when they were 
using  pre-trained  GloVe  embedding.  Only  in  the  case  of  the  1D-CNN 
model,  while  using  pre-trained  GloVe  embedding,  the  ROC  curve  is 
closer to the top left corner of the graph than using pre-trained word2vec 
embedding. 

Fig.  10  shows  the  ROC  curves  as  well  as  the  AUC  scores  of  the 
traditional machine learning models. The AUC values of DT, GB, and 
SVM are 0.506, 0.646, and 0.639, respectively. The ROC curves of these 
models also prove their inefficiency. So, it is obvious that the traditional 
machine  learning  algorithms  have  shown  pretty  poor  performance  in 
terms of different performance metrics. 

By analyzing the performance of different deep learning and tradi-
tional  machine  learning  algorithms,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the 
word2vec  embedding  based  Bi  LSTM  model  has  surpassed  the  other 
models based on different performance metrics.

5. Conclusion and future works 

Public sentiments towards a vaccine play a crucial role in alleviating 
the adverse effects of an epidemic. And it also helps to identify whether 
the vaccine is working effectively or not. This study has analyzed the 
Bangladeshi citizens’ opinions towards the COVID-19 vaccines and the 
ongoing  vaccination  campaign.  To  do  so,  the  opinions  of  the  Bangla-
deshi netizens have been collected from different social media sites. This 
study considered the opinions of the netizens between the timeline June 
2020 and July 2021. The polarity of the statements of the netizens was 
labelled with the help of seven volunteers. For validating the reliability 
of the polarity labelling of the volunteers, inter-rater reliability tests like 
Fleiss’ Kappa and Krippendorff’s Alpha reliability tests were performed. 
By analyzing the polarity of opinions, it can be stated that the ma-
jority  of  the  statements  were  positive  regarding  the  vaccine  after  the 
vaccination  campaign  was  started.  Topic  modelling  using  the  LDA 
model  was  performed  to  extract  the  latent  topics  of  the  positive  and 
negative statements of the netizens. In the positive opinions, the neti-
zens  expressed  their  gratitude  towards  the  government  for  taking 

measures to manufacture the country’s first indigenous vaccine. They 
also  appreciated  the  governmental  steps  for  mass  immunization  pro-
grams. In most of the negative opinions, netizens raised their worries 
about the originality of the vaccines. They also expressed their dissat-
isfaction  with  the  authority’s  inability  to  acquire  sufficient  vaccines 
from  the  foreign  countries  amid  the  vaccination  campaign.  Different 
deep  learning  and  traditional  machine  learning  algorithms  were 
employed in this study to predict the polarity of the statements of the 
netizens. Bi LSTM model with the pre-trained word2vec embedding has 
outscored  other  models  in  terms  of  different  performance  metrics  for 
anticipating the polarity of the sentiments. The obtained accuracy of this 
model is 87.44%. 

This work has only considered the opinions of the netizens expressed 
in the English language. In future, opinions in the Bengali language can 
also  be  considered.  This  study  hasn’t  utilized  transformer-based  lan-
guage models like BERT, XLNET, ALBERT. A comparative study between 
the performance of the models used in this work and the performance of 
the  state-of-the-art  transformer-based  models  might  be  conducted  in 
future.
