Abstract 
In this paper, we propose a new a new risk model with two-type by-claims and delay period based on compound binomial 
distribution, in which every main claim induces two kinds of by-claims but either of the by-claims maybe delayed to the 
next period. The nature of the risk model with time-correlated claims is studied based on recursion of joint distribution 
functions. Through introducing three submodels, we obtain the expression of the joint distribution 
( , , )
f u x y  of the 
surplus just before ruin and deficit at ruin when initial surplus is 0 and the recursive formula of the joint distribution when 
initial surplus isu . In addition, when initial surplus is 0 the ruin probability of the risk model is given. At last, we provide 
the method to compute the ruin probability when initial surplus is u .

1. Introduction 
In the classical risk model, assumption of independence among claims is an important condition to the 
study of risk models. However, in many practical situations, this assumption is often inconsistent with the 
operation of insurance companies. Sometimes, claims are time-correlated, and it is necessary to study risk

models that are more realistic. Ambagaspitiya, 1998,1999 and Partrat,1999 studied the probability distribution, 
moment generating function and ruin probability of main claims under the condition of correlated aggregated 
claims; Yuen and Guo, 2001 studied the compound binomial model with time-correlated claims, in which 
each claim causes one kind of by-claim that maybe delayed, and obtained the finite survive probability; Xiao 
and Guo, 2007 obtained the recursive formula of joint distribution 
( , , )
f u x y of the surplus just before ruin 
and the deficit at ruin, but still only one kind by-claim. Unlike their models above, we studied a new risk 
model with practical significance. Consider the claims in a car accident, the vehicle damage may induce 
bodily injury or property damage at the same time or afterwards, so in this risk model each main claim causes 
two kinds of by-claims, and both kinds have the probability being delayed to the next time period. In our 
study, we give the recursive formula of joint distribution 
( , , )
f u x y  of the surplus just before ruin and the 
deficit at ruin, the ruin probability is also obtained. 
2. Depict of the model 
In this risk model, we assume each claim produces two kinds of by-claims. Denote the discrete time units 
by 
k � 0,1,2,...
.In time period (
1, ]
k
k
�
, a main claim happens with a probability of (0
1)
q
� q
�
, thus 
1
p
q
� �  is the probability of no main claims. We assume that the occurrences of main claims in different 
time periods are independent. The first by-claim and its associated main claim may occur in the same time 
period with probability 1r , or the occurrence of the by-claim maybe delayed to the next time period with 
probability 
1
1 r
�
; the other by-claim and its associated main claim may occur concurrently with 
probability
2r , or the by-claim maybe delayed and occur in the next time period with probability 
1 r2
�
. All 
claim amounts are independent, positive and integer valued. Main claim amounts

We assume initial surplus u  is a non-negative integer.

3. Joint distribution of the surplus just before ruin and deficit at ruin in simple case 
u � 0
 
There are four different cases when claims occur: a main claim and its two by-claims occur concurrently in 
some period, then the surplus process gets renewed but the initial value; a main claim and its first by-claim 
occur simultaneously in some period but its second by-claim is delayed and occurs in the next period; a main 
claim and its second by-claim occur simultaneously in some period but its first by-claim is delayed and occurs 
in the next period; a main claim occurs in some period but the two types of by-claims are both delayed to the 
next period. Then in the last three cases the surplus processes behave differently because of the delayed by-
claim occurring in the next period. Thus we define the following three new surplus processes:

In (0,1], along with the case when no claim occurs, there are five different cases altogether for surplus

The case u

 is special. When the total amount of claims is greater than  
1

because the surplus just before ruin is x , the relevant terms still exist. Thus:

With Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, we can compute the joint distribution of the surplus just before ruin and 
deficit at ruin when u  is of any value. Furthermore, sum 
( , , )
f u x y  over x  from 0 to � and y  from 1 
to�, we can finally have the ruin probability ( )
� u
 when initial isu . 
5. Conclusion 
Considering the claims in a car accident, and the vehicle damage may induce bodily injury or property 
damage at the same time or afterwards, we studied a new risk model with two-type by-claims and delay 
Period based on compound binomial distribution. The nature of the risk model with time-correlated claims is 
studied based on recursion joint distribution functions. The recursive formula of joint distribution 
( , , )
f u x y  
of the surplus just before ruin and the deficit at ruin, and the ruin probability are obtained. The results are 
helpful to research the other risk models from such as [6,7].
