In this article, we present a new data collection that combines information about earthquake damage with seismic
shaking. Starting from the Da.D.O. database, which provides information on the damage of individual buildings
subjected to sequences of past earthquakes in Italy, we have generated ShakeMaps for all the events with
magnitude greater than 5.0 that have contributed to these sequences. The sequences under examination are those
of Irpinia 1980, Umbria Marche 1997, Pollino 1998, Molise 2002, L’Aquila 2009 and Emilia 2012. In this way, we
were able to combine, for a total of the 117,695 buildings, the engineering parameters included in Da.D.O., but
revised and reprocessed in this application, and the ground shaking data for six different variables (namely, in-
tensity in MCS scale, PGA, PGV, SA at 0.3s, 1.0s and 3.0s). The potential applications of this data collection are
innumerable: from recalibrating fragility curves to training machine learning models to quantifying earthquake
damage. This data collection will be made available within Da.D.O., a platform of the Italian Department of Civil
Protection, developed by EUCENTRE.
1. Introduction
This article describes the procedure implemented for the creation of a
joint data collection of information on building damage and associated
ground shaking (referred to herein as ShakeDaDO) for Italy. The main
components used to develop this data collection are Da.D.O. (the Data-
base of Observed Damage, Dolce et al., 2019) compiled by the Italian
Civil Protection using damage assessment forms from sequences of past
Italian earthquakes1 and the ground shaking provided by the new
implementation of ShakeMap at INGV (Michelini et al., 2020). The data
collection was developed in three consecutive steps. The ﬁrst step
involved the reﬁnement of the information on buildings present in
Da.D.O.. In the second step, we have recovered from the literature (or
accessible web-services) the seismological information of the earth-
quakes within Da.D.O. to calculate maps of ground shaking with the
highest level of accuracy that is currently possible. The latest version of
ShakeMap (version 4.0), which implements updated ground motion
models and maps of local site corrections, was used for this purpose.
Finally,
each
point
of
Da.D.O.
was
paired
with
the
Mercal-
li–Cancani–Sieberg intensity scale (MCS hereinafter), the ground shaking
parameters, the distance between the point under examination and the
earthquake source, and the magnitude of the earthquake. The ground
motion parameters of interest are: MCS intensity, peak ground acceler-
ation, peak ground velocity, spectral acceleration at 0.3s, 1.0s and 3.0s,
and their relative uncertainties. These six parameters are calculated by
ShakeMap and were chosen because they give a comprehensive overview
of shaking. In particular, these three spectral acceleration are chosen to
display the amount of shaking experienced by structures sensitive to low
periods, intermediate periods, and long periods.
The publication of the Da.D.O. database (Dolce et al., 2019) has made
available a large amount of information on damage data of individual
buildings from ten strong sequences of earthquakes that affected Italy
since 1980. Around the same time, Michelini et al. (2020) published a
new release of ShakeMap for the Italian territory. This implementation is
based on the updated ShakeMap code architecture, which implements a
new and more sophisticated strategy for the integration of real ground
motion data and ground motion models (Worden et al., 2020). In addi-
tion, it uses the latest ground motion models and an updated site effects
map. Michelini et al. (2020) describe the new approach, quantify the
consistency between recorded data and the resulting maps and compare

the results obtained from the new conﬁguration with the previous one
that was fully described in Michelini et al. (2008).
In light of these developments, we have created a single data collec-
tion that merges information about the damage and the characteristics of
the individual buildings, with the associated ground shaking parameters
inferred at the individual points provided by Da.D.O.. Combining these
data and applications has allowed the construction of an extensive data
collection, the ﬁrst of its kind for Italy. Its application allows the impact
of earthquakes to be addressed through new strategies, such as through
the training of machine learning models.
The paper is divided into the following sections:
� reﬁnement of the Da.D.O. database;
� creation of the ShakeMaps for all M � 5:0 earthquakes belonging to
each sequence under examination;
� assemblage of the ShakeDaDO data collection.
In the following, we describe the steps and reasoning that led to the
creation of the joint damage/ShakeMap data collection. We also present
all of the maps that have been generated and a ﬁrst statistical analysis of
the data distribution.
2. Reﬁnement of the Da.D.O. Database
The damage data in the Da.D.O. database, described in Dolce et al.
(2019), required additional processing since it does not include all of the
undamaged buildings (except for the Irpinia event which included all the
buildings in the affected region). The Italian National Institute of Sta-
tistics (ISTAT) census data from either the 1991, 2001 or 2011 census has
been used to obtain an estimate of the total number of reinforced con-
crete and masonry buildings in each municipality at the time of each
event. Subsequently, the number of damaged buildings from Da.D.O. has
been removed from the total number of buildings to provide an estimate
of the number of undamaged buildings. It has not been possible to obtain

census data representing the building/dwelling statistics at the time of
the Friuli 1976 and Abruzzo 1984 events, and so in these cases it has not
been possible to estimate the undamaged buildings and they were thus
excluded from further study. For the remaining eight sequences, only
those municipalities where the inspection forms made up at least 80% of
the estimated total number of buildings in the municipality have been
considered in the calculations herein (as it cannot necessarily be assumed
that municipalities with few damage forms had few damaged buildings).
Due to a lack of municipalities that met this criterion, Emilia 2003 was
also excluded from this study. As for the Garfagnana-Lunigiana 2013
earthquake, this earthquake was only recently included in Da.D.O.
database. Six historical sequences of events in Italy have thus been
analysed herein: Irpinia 1980, Umbria-Marche 1997, Pollino 1998,
Molise 2002, L’Aquila 2009 and Emilia 2012. The following ﬁelds were
extracted from the Da.D.O. database:
� location (latitude and longitude of the building);
� number of ﬂoors/storeys;
� age of construction;
� structure (masonry or reinforced concrete);
� damage (where the original damage descriptions in Da.D.O. were
converted to DS0 to DS5 using the approach proposed by Dolce et al.
(2019), and where grade DS0 is for no damage; grade DS1 refers to
slight damage (e.g., hair-line cracks in few walls); grade DS2 refers to
moderate damage (e.g., fall of large pieces of plaster); grade DS3 re-
fers to heavy damage (e.g., large and extensive cracks in walls); grade
DS4 refers to very heavy damage (e.g., serious failure of walls) and
grade DS5 refers to destruction, the total collapse).
We also added an additional attribute representing the year in which
the municipality ﬁrst entered the seismic zonation classiﬁcation. How-
ever, it is noted that the calculation of undamaged buildings using Census
data, as described above, adds a signiﬁcant number of buildings for the
DS0 class which are missing data on the location, number of ﬂoors, and
age of construction. It was also found that there were also a few damaged
buildings from the Da.D.O. database which lacked these attributes. To be
able to complete these attributes for these buildings, we adopt the
following strategy to generate the missing data: number of storeys and
the age of construction are sampled on the basis of the frequency from the
same municipality, as available in Da.D.O. database; the location is
randomly sampled from the normalised density of population as avail-
able in LandScan (2015). In the following the details of the points
generated for each historical sequence is given, while in Table 1 a sum-
mary is provided.
2.1. Irpinia 1980
The Da.D.O. database information on buildings for this earthquake
belongs to 41 municipalities. Contrary to what happens for the data of the
other sequences, for Irpinia the locations of all the buildings within
Da.D.O. are placed at the coordinate of the town hall of the municipality
of reference, since more detailed geographical information is not avail-
able. To overcome this limitation, we have randomly distributed the
buildings within the municipality using the same method described
above for the buildings that were lacking location data. As before, the
distribution was made on a probabilistic basis, using the population
density available in LandScan (2015). For what concerns the buildings
with missing data, these are all buildings with damage grade DS0 and
they belong to 11 different municipalities; a total of 211 coordinates for
these buildings have been simulated. Table S1 in the supplementary
material summarises the information on all the buildings for which we
have added missing attributes. The ﬁnal database for Irpinia 1980 is
composed of 38,095 data points.
2.2. Umbria–Marche 1997
The Da.D.O. database data for this earthquake belong to 12 munici-
palities. For the buildings with missing attributes, these belong to 12

different municipalities, and 1661 coordinates have been simulated.
Table S2 in the supplementary material summarises the information on
all the buildings for which we have added missing attributes. For this
event there are some municipalities for which buildings with damage
grades other than DS0 have also been generated, such as Fiastra, Monte
Cavallo and Pieve Torina; the type of structure of the simulated buildings
are mainly reinforced concrete for damage grade DS0, and masonry for
the other damage states. The ﬁnal database for Umbria-Marche 1997 is
composed of 6980 data points.
2.3. Pollino 1998
The Da.D.O. database data for this earthquake belong to 6 munici-
palities. The buildings with missing attributes belong to 6 different mu-
nicipalities, and 330 coordinates have been randomly simulated.
Table S3 in the supplementary material summarises the information on
all the buildings for which we have added missing attributes, which are
mainly masonry buildings with damage grade DS0. The ﬁnal database for
Pollino 1998 is composed of 3966 data points.
2.4. Molise 2002
The Da.D.O. database data for this earthquake belong to 16 munici-
palities. The buildings whose attributes have been simulated belong to 13
different municipalities, and a total of 903 coordinates have been
simulated. Table S4 in the supplementary material summarises the in-
formation on all the buildings for which we have added missing attri-
butes. As for Pollino 1998, the majority of simulated buildings are
masonry with no damage (DS0). The ﬁnal database for Molise 2002 is
composed of 14,111 data points.
2.5. L’Aquila 2009
The Da.D.O. database data for this earthquake belong to 38 munici-
palities. The buildings with missing attributes belong to 32 different
municipalities, and a total of 1597 coordinates have been simulated.
Table S5 in the supplementary material summarises the information on
all the buildings for which we have added missing attributes. As for
Umbria–Marche 1997, for this earthquake, the simulation of buildings
not only includes those belonging to the DS0 class but also some of the
other categories. The municipalities of Castel del Mare, Pietracamela and
Calascio showed this behaviour. In the regional capital, L’Aquila, the
damage grade with by far the largest number of buildings to simulate is
DS0, with a reinforced concrete structure type. Contrary to other earth-
quakes, several points belonging to class DS1 have also been simulated.
The ﬁnal database for L’Aquila 2009 is composed of 52,679 data points.

2.6. Emilia 2012
The Da.D.O. database data for this earthquake belong to just 2 mu-
nicipalities. The buildings with missing attributes belong to both mu-
nicipalities, and 335 coordinates have been randomly simulated.
Table S6 in the supplementary material summarises the information on
all the buildings for which we have added missing attributes. The main
damage grade of buildings with missing attributes is DS0, in equal part of
structure type masonry and reinforced concrete; only a very limited
number of buildings in other damage grade is simulated. The ﬁnal
database for Emilia 2012 is composed of 1866 data points.
3. ShakeMaps
This section describes the generation of the ground shaking maps to
be associated with the historical sequences in the Da.D.O. database. Some
of the sequences that are of interest for this study are complex, consisting
of several earthquakes with comparable magnitudes, and which are
spatially very extended. This characteristic could inﬂuence the shaking
suffered by the different zones where buildings are located. We have
therefore calculated all the ShakeMaps related to events with magnitude
M � 5:0, which occurred during the whole sequence, and not just those
associated to the mainshock. For the seismological information, we used
the Engineering Strong-Motion (ESM) database (Luzi et al., 2016). The
ESM website gives the possibility to download through a web service the
peak values of the ground motion parameters in a format suitable for
ShakeMap. The ground motion variables we considered are macroseismic
intensity in MCS scale, PGA, PGV, SA 0.3s, SA 1.0s and SA 3.0s. More-
over, ESM gives the possibility to download the extended fault if it is

available in the literature. For stronger earthquakes, there are several
solutions for the extended fault in the literature, and it is not always
straightforward to deﬁne which is the best choice. In ShakeMap appli-
cations, the extended fault has an impact on the magnitude and shape of
shaking, especially in the near ﬁeld. This work has decided to select the
input data for the ShakeMap calculation from a single database (ESM). In
this way, we have aligned ourselves with the choice made in ESM for the
extended fault associated with the earthquake.

Michelini et al. (2020) describe the adopted ground motion models
and the new map of VS30 for the site effects. The software implemented is
the ShakeMap version 4.0 (Worden et al., 2020). Below we describe the
main features of the earthquakes we have considered and show the most
relevant ShakeMaps that have been calculated.
3.1. ShakeMaps for Irpinia 1980
There are 3 earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 5.0 for this
sequence, as shown in Table 2, with information on location, magnitude,
fault and number of stations available. Only for the ﬁrst earthquake, the
one with the larger magnitude, the extended fault model is available.
Also, for this earthquake, 21 stations have recorded the ground motion,
while for the other two earthquakes only few stations recorded the event.
Logically, the considerable difference in magnitude between the ﬁrst
earthquake and the other two implies that the main earthquake with
magnitude M 6.9 is responsible for the damage reported in the Da.D.O.
database. Fig. 1 instead shows the distribution of the Da.D.O. points on
panel a, while in panel b the ShakeMaps in MCS intensity of the main
earthquake. Figure S1 in the supplementary material shows the Shake-
Maps for all the ground motion values. The 1980 Irpinia earthquake was
undoubtedly the most devastating earthquake in Italy since the Second
World War. According to the most reliable estimates, it caused about
280,000 displaced people, about 9000 injured and 3000 dead. The
earthquake affected three regions, Campania, Basilicata and Puglia, with
an area aligned along fault strike longer than 60 km featuring MCS in-
tensity higher than IX.
3.2. ShakeMaps for Umbria–Marche 1997
The seismic sequence of Umbria–Marche 1997, which affected parts
of the two regions of central Italy, began in September 1997 and ended in
March 1998. On September 26 in the night, there was the ﬁrst of the
three main earthquakes (M 5.7), while in the late morning of the same
day there was the second earthquake (M 6.0). This second event was
responsible for the fall of the Giotto and Cimabue vault in the Basilica of
St. Francis in Assisi, which killed four people. The third main event (M
5.6) on October 14 caused the lantern in the Town Hall of Foligno to
collapse. Overall, there are 8 earthquakes with magnitude greater than
5.0 that have occurred in the time span September 1997 to April 1998, as
shown in Table 3.
A fault model is available for the three larger earthquakes. The
number of stations that have recorded the earthquakes changes consid-
erably during the sequence. In fact, after the September 26, several other
stations belonging to temporary networks were installed, which allowed
for a good coverage of the near ﬁeld for the 1 October 14 earthquake.
Fig. 2, panel a, shows the spatial distribution of earthquakes and the
points of the Da.D.O. database. As can be seen from the ﬁgure, the points
of the Da.D.O. database fall all in the Marche region. An important thing
to observe in the ﬁgure is that there are some points in the database that
are very close to the third largest event of the sequence (M 5.6 occurred
on October 14, 1997, pink star in Fig. 2, panel a) to the south, whereas
other Da.D.O. points are affected by the earthquakes of September 26,
1997, M 6.0 and M 5.7, dark green and violet stars in Fig. 2, panel a.
Fig. 2, panels b,c,d, shows the ShakeMap for the 3 mainshocks of the
sequence, in MCS intensity scale. Figures S2, S3, S4 in the supplementary
material show the ShakeMaps for all the ground motion values. From the
three ﬁgures, it is possible to notice that the second earthquake on
September 26 (M6.0) caused the most damage in area located northern
respect to the epicentres, with values of macroseismic intensity in the
epicentral zone corresponding to grade IX of the MCS scale. The area in
which the effects of the earthquake equal to grade VIII-IX is 20 km long,
along the north-west direction of the fault. The third earthquake (M 5.6)
which occurred further south, on the other hand, shows an extended area
of several km where the macroseismic intensity reaches grade VIII. The
same area in previous earthquakes had shown macroseismic intensity
equal to degree VI-VII on the MCS scale.
3.3. ShakeMaps for Pollino 1998
The sequence relating to the earthquake that struck Calabria in 1998
has only one earthquake with a magnitude greater than 5.0. Table 4
summarises the characteristics of this earthquake. No extended fault
model is available for this earthquake of moderate size; it was only
registered by 5 stations.
Fig. 3 instead shows the distribution of the Da.D.O. points on panel a,
while on panel b the ShakeMap in MCS intensity. Figure S5 in the sup-
plementary material shows the ShakeMaps for all the ground motion
values. The area of Pollino, in Calabria, has already been the scene of
signiﬁcant earthquakes in the past. The epicentre is located between the

municipalities of Castelluccio Inferiore, Castelluccio Superiore and Lau-
ria. The epicentre zone shows macroseismic intensity values equal to
grade VII-VIII of the MCS scale.
3.4. ShakeMaps for Molise 2002
The earthquakes with magnitude greater than 5.0 that occurred
during the seismic sequence of 2002 in Molise are two they are close both
spatially and temporally and also have the same magnitude. Table 5
summarises the characteristics of these earthquakes. Also in this case, as
with the 1998 Pollino earthquake, not many stations recorded the
earthquakes. The faults are available for both earthquakes and come from
the DISS (2010) and 10 stations recorded the events, but in both cases,
they are located far from the epicenters. The earthquake of Molise in
2002 is composed of two earthquakes of the same size that occurred
between October 31 and November 1, 2002, with the epicentre located in
the province of Campobasso, between the towns of San Giuliano di
Puglia, Colletorto, Santa Croce di Magliano, Bonefro, Castellino del
Biferno and Provvidenti.
Fig. 4 instead shows the distribution of the Da.D.O. points on panel a,
while the ShakeMap related to these earthquakes in MCS intensity scale
are presented on panels b and c. Figures S6 and S7 in the supplementary
material show the ShakeMaps for all the ground motion values for these
two earthquakes. In the ﬁrst event, the effects of the earthquake reached
a value equal to grade VIII on the MCS scale, while they were slightly
lower for the second event.
3.5. ShakeMaps for L’Aquila 2009
There are 8 earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 5.0 that have
occurred during this sequence, and they all occurred in the time span
from April 6 to April 13, 2009. Table 6 shows the main data underlying
ShakeMap. Comparing the number of recorded data with those of the
previous events, it is clear that the number of stations has increased. After
the ﬁrst earthquake, as happens when a damaging earthquake occurs,
INGV and other research institutes and universities have installed many
stations in the epicentre area. In this way, we can generate more con-
strained ShakeMaps in the epicentral area. It should be noted that the
higher number of stations in the ﬁrst earthquake depends on the fact that
the ShakeMap for earthquakes with magnitude greater than 6 is more
spatially extended than the others.
The main shock, which occurred on April 6, 2009, was felt throughout
central-southern Italy. This event is currently the most severe earth-
quake, in terms of the number of victims and damage, of the 21st century
in Italy. Also, in the city of L’Aquila, several strategic buildings, such as
the Prefect’s Ofﬁce, the Regional Hospital, the headquarters of the Uni-
versity, the Police Headquarters and the Student House suffered severe
damage. The city of L’Aquila and the entire basin of L’Aquila, since the
fourteenth century, has always been subject to earthquakes of severe or
medium intensity. Three other signiﬁcant earthquakes struck the area, all
with a macroseismic intensity value equal to the grade IX of the MCS
scale. Fig. 5 panel a, shows the distribution of the different earthquakes
with respect to the points of the Da.D.O. database. The important thing to

note in the ﬁgure is that there are several earthquakes north of L’Aquila,
near the Campotosto, with a maximum magnitude of M 5.4 that could
affect the damage to the buildings located in the northern area. We show
as an example the maps for 3 earthquakes in the sequence. The ﬁrst one is
for the mainshock M 6.1 of April 6, 2009 (Fig. 5, panel b). The maximum
macroseismic intensity reaches the values of IX of MCS scale, in the di-
rection south-east for the city of L’Aquila. The village of Onna, located in
this area, was destroyed. The second one shows the shaking related to the
earthquake M 5.5 of April 7, which affected the southernmost part of the
aftershock area (Fig. 5, panel c), with a maximum of macroseismic in-
tensity equal to VIII of MCS intensity. Finally, the ShakeMap of the
earthquake with M 5.4 of April 9, 2009 is presented, which occurred in
the northernmost part of the area affected by the sequence (Fig. 5, panel
d). The epicentral area of this earthquake suffers a macroseismic intensity
equals to grade VIII of MCS scale. Figures S8, S9, S10 in the supple-
mentary material show the ShakeMaps for all the ground motion values.
3.6. ShakeMaps for Emilia 2012
The sequence that hit the Emilia region in 2012 had two main shocks
of comparable magnitude but quite distant spatially, and several other
earthquakes with magnitude greater than 5.0 (see Fig. 6, panel a). The
seismic sequence has affected the Po Valley region, an area where strong
earthquakes occur at medium-low frequency. But historical information
has shown that already in the past earthquakes had happened in the area,
as in 1579 (M 5.4) with a maximum macroseismic intensity equal to
grade VIII and 1639 (M 5.3) with a maximum intensity equal to grade
VII-VIII of the MCS scale.
Table 7 and Fig. 6 show an overview of the data used to calculate the
ShakeMap and the spatial distribution of the epicentres of the earth-
quakes with respect to points in the Da.D.O. database. For this sequence,
we use the extended source for four out of six earthquakes. The number
of stations we have at our disposal is signiﬁcantly higher than those of
earthquakes that occurred several years ago. Moreover, after the ﬁrst
earthquake of the sequence, we notice an improvement in the station
coverage in the epicentral area, allowing a better constraint of the
shaking. The earthquakes caused massive damage to rural and industrial
buildings, water pipelines, historical buildings and monuments and old
stone buildings. The most damaged provinces are those of Modena and
Ferrara, where the territory affected has an area of about 1800 square
kilometres. We show as an example the maps in MCS intensity scale for 2
earthquakes in the sequence, related to the strongest earthquakes in the
sequence (Fig. 6 panels b and c), while Figures S11 and S12 in the sup-
plementary material show the ShakeMaps for all the ground motion
values.
4. Preparation of the damage and ground motion data collection
The last step in developing ShakeDaDO data collection consists of
associating the building damage to the level of the ground shaking
experienced at the same location, deﬁned by the coordinates in the
processed version of the Da.D.O. database described in Section 2, to
produce the ShakeDaDO data collection. To this end, we have imple-
mented the following strategy. For each point of the Da.D.O. database,
we have associated the maximum shaking that occurred during the whole
sequence as determined by the calculated ShakeMaps, as described in
Fig. 8. Association of the Da.D.O. points to the earthquakes ground shaking for the Molise 2002. Stars: earthquakes (coloured according to the legend in panel a), dots:
points in Da.D.O. database. The color of the dots indicates which earthquake the dot has been coupled with, for MCS (Panel a), PGA (Panel b), PGV (Panel c), SA 0.3s
(Panel d), SA 1.0s (Panel e), SA 3.0s (Panel f).

Section 3. In this way, we have tried to take into account the occurrence
of several earthquakes in close time and space. The six variables quan-
tifying the ground shaking are treated separately and independently of
each other. This choice implies that, for example, the same Da.D.O. point
may have the maximum shaking for the PGA ground value that is asso-
ciated with an earthquake from the sequence that is different to the
earthquake leading to the maximum PGV. Each ground motion variable
is associated with the epicentral distance and the magnitude. It is to be
noted that the new ShakeMap conﬁguration (Worden et al., 2020) allows
for the calculation of the ground motion values directly at the sought
target point. The shaking value is also associated with the uncertainty, as
speciﬁed in Worden et al. (2018). Finally, each building contained in the
Da.D.O. database is associated with the damage grade description, as
available in Da.D.O. database (Dolce et al., 2019) and described in sec-
tion 2, and the maximum ground shaking values of the six shaking pa-
rameters as derived from the largest events of the sequence. Whilst it
would have been very useful to use the date of damage evaluation in the
ShakeDaDo data collection (to ensure that all of the main events pre-
ceding the damage were included), this data is not publicly available
within Da.D.O.. Typically, damage surveys for large numbers of buildings
can take weeks to complete, and so it was felt to be appropriate to include
all the ground shaking from the potentially damaging aftershocks in the
days following the main event. The only event for which a wider range of
time has been considered is the Umbria-Marche sequence, which
occurred over a period of 6 months. The damage data is likely to have
been collected following each of the large events in this sequence, but as
mentioned previously, the actual damage survey date for each building in
the Da.D.O. database is not available.
Table 8 provides the ﬁnal list of parameters in the ShakeDaDO data
collection, where for reasons of privacy the actual location in terms of
latitude and longitude is not provided.
It is noted that for the Irpinia 1980 and Pollino 1998 earthquakes
there is only one earthquake responsible for the damage. For the
sequence relating to Emilia 2012, the earthquake with magnitude 6.1 on
May 20 is too far from the points in the Da.D.O. database compared to the
other strong earthquake in the sequence, which occurred on May 29 (see
Fig. 6). This spatial distribution implies that the Da.D.O. points, for all the
ground motion variables, are associated with the May 29 earthquake. For
the other four sequences the situation is not linear, and is described in
more detail in the following sections.
4.1. Umbria–Marche 1977 data collection
The sequence under examination consists of several earthquakes.
Fig. 7 shows which earthquakes the different points of the Da.D.O.
database are associated with, for the 6 ground shaking variables.
The MCS parameter (panel a in Fig. 7) shows that the Da.D.O. points
to the north are associated with the shaking caused by the earthquake
with largest magnitude (M 6.0 of September 26, 1997), the dark green
points in the Figure. In purple there are highlighted the Da.D.O. points
associated with the ﬁrst earthquake with M 5.7 that also occurred on
September 26, 1997. While the pink points further south are associated
with the October 14, 1997, M 5.6 shock. The association of the Da.D.O.
points concerning the different earthquakes in the sequence is substan-
tially the same for the other ground motion variables, with the exception
of SA 3.0s. In this case, the earthquake of October 14, 1997 M 5.6 has

greater values, as can be seen from Fig. 7 (panel f) where the contribution
of this shock (highlighted with pink dots) also extends in the north-
eastern direction. Probably, for this earthquake, the source mechanism
enhanced these longer periods.
4.2. Molise 2002 data collection
The sequence under examination consists of 2 earthquakes close in
space and with the same magnitude. Fig. 8 shows which earthquakes the
different points of the Da.D.O. database are associated with, for the 6
ground shaking variables.
From the MCS map (panel a in Fig. 8), we can see that the earthquake
of October 31, 2002 has higher shaking values than the one that occurred
the daylater, on November 1, 2002. Consequently, all the buildings
surveyed by Da.D.O. that are to the east and north of the two earthquakes
are associated with the maximum shaking of the ﬁrst earthquake. The
association of the Da.D.O. points with respect to the two earthquakes in
the sequence is substantially the same for the other ground motion
variables.
4.3. L’Aquila 2009 data collection
The sequence under examination consists of several earthquakes.
Fig. 9 shows which earthquakes the different points of the Da.D.O.
database are associated with, for the 6 shaking parameters.
The points in the Da.D.O. database relating to the L’Aquila 2009
earthquake are associated mainly with the mainshock, M 6.1 of April 6,
2009. Only a few points to the north are, for the PGA and SA 0.3s maps,

associated with earthquakes of magnitude M 5.2 and M 5.4 that occurred
further north than the main event.
5. Final data collection
This data collection is one of the ﬁrst attempt to combine engineering
information collected and harmonized in Da.D.O. Dolce et al. (2019) with
ground shaking data. TheUniversityof Cambridge has recently developed a
platform (Spence et al., 2011) with similar purposes as ShakeDaDO. The
main difference, however, is that ShakeDaDO provides data with a higher
level of detail and completely disaggregated. There are six ground shaking
variables: MCS scale intensity, PGA, PGV and SA at 0.3s, 1.0s and 3.0s. As
noted above, the shaking was calculated using the new version of Shake-
Map,withthelatestseismologicaldataandinformation.Eachshakingvalue
is associated with its uncertainty. The ﬁnal assembled data collection con-
sists of 117,695 data points; of the resulting table each row is associated
with a building. For each building, the information available is the type of
structure, the number of storeys, the age of construction, and the class of
damage.Theyearinwhichthemunicipalitywasclassiﬁedasaseismiczone,
as well as the value of Vs,30, that can be useful to get an idea of the type of
soil on which the building is built, are also available in the database. We
note, however, that the Vs,30 data is extracted from the Vs,30 grid used in
ShakeMap, and it is not provided from direct measurements.
Figs. 10 and 11 summarises the data collection according to the
building characteristics. Three-quarters of the available data come from
the sum of the information of the earthquakes of Irpinia 1980 and
L’Aquila 2009, while few data come from the earthquakes of Emilia 2012
and Pollino 1998 (see Fig. 10, panel a).

Concerning the type of structures, here divided only in masonry
(denoted as mu in Figure) and reinforced concrete (denoted as ca in
Figure), we ﬁnd that three-quarters of the buildings surveyed in Da.D.O.
database are of the masonry type, while only a quarter is in reinforced
concrete (panel c of Fig. 10). The damage grades are also not equally
populated. DS0 is by far the most populated, while few buildings have
suffered damage falling within the DS4 and DS5 categories (panel b of
Fig. 10). A signiﬁcant portion of the buildings have just a few ﬂoors, with a
considerable peak for the two or three-storey buildings (the sum of which
reaches three-quarters of the total dataset). Very tall buildings, on the
other hand, are not numerically relevant (panel a of Fig. 11). More than a
third of the buildings were built before 1910, while there are about 6%
constructed after 1990 (panel b of Fig. 11). The panel c in Fig. 11 shows the
year of seismic classiﬁcation of the municipalities. Slightly less than half of
the buildings belong to cities that have been classiﬁed since 1915. A sec-
ond big slice of buildings (about 30%) belongs to municipalities that have
been classiﬁed after 1984. About 12% of the buildings belong to the cities
that have been classiﬁed after 2004. The combination of information on
the age of construction and the year of seismic classiﬁcation has deﬁned
the parameter “Classiﬁcation Age” (in panel d in Fig. 10). 61% of the
buildingswerebuilt beforethemunicipalityenteredseismicclassiﬁcation,
against 27% of buildings constructed afterwards.
Going a little more into the details of the data collection elements,
Figs. 12 and 13 show how the different features are distributed in the six
different seismic sequences.
Fig. 12, in panel a, shows the damage distribution. DS05 and DS04 are
numerically relevant for the earthquakes of Irpinia 1980, Umbria Marche
1997, Molise 2002 and L’Aquila 2009, while it is nearly absent in the

earthquakes of Pollino 1998 and Emilia 2012. The DS0 and DS1 grades
are the most represented for all earthquakes. At the same time, class DS03
is more populated then class DS02 for the earthquakes in Umbria Marche
1997, Molise 2002 and Pollino 1998. As far as vertical structures are
concerned, in all sequences and in a somewhat similar way, masonry
buildings (deﬁned as mu in Figure) are more abundant than reinforced
concrete ones (deﬁned as ca, panel b in Fig. 12). Finally, in panel c of
Fig. 12, we see for all earthquakes a very high number of 2- and 3- storey
buildings, while only for L’Aquila 2009 and Molise 2002, 4-storey
buildings are also numerically relevant. If we analyse the features
related to the age of the buildings, from Fig. 13 panel a, we can say that
there is for the Irpinia 1980 a considerable part of the buildings that had
been built before 1900. This earthquake is also the only one in which the
number of buildings without this information is high. As far as the se-
quences of Umbria Marche 1997, Pollino 1998 and Emilia 2012 are
concerned, we observe a relatively pronounced peak of buildings built in
1910, and then very few other constructions. A similar situation also
exists for the earthquakes of Molise 2002 and L’Aquila 2009. Still, in
these cases, especially in the areas affected by the sequence of L’Aquila
2009, there are a signiﬁcant number of buildings built in other years. The
areas affected by these six sequences have a very different seismic clas-
siﬁcation history (Fig. 13 panel b). Referring to the area affected by the
Irpinia earthquake, many buildings belong to municipalities that entered
the 1930 and 1984 seismic regulations. The regulations of 1930 sub-
stantially affect the Irpinia area, which classiﬁed a large part of the ter-
ritory after the destructive earthquake of July 23, 1930, Mw 6.7. The
1984 regulations were the ﬁrst to classify a large part of the Italian re-
gion, as reﬂected in Fig. 13, panel b, where all areas have some munic-
ipalities classiﬁed in that year. A particular situation concerns the
L’Aquila area. Most of the buildings belong to cities that were classiﬁed
seismically already in 1915, following the devastating earthquake in
Marsica on January 13, 1915, Mw 7. Finally, the area affected by the
Emilia 2012 only entered into the last seismic regulations, dated 2004.
The union of the information of panels a and b of Fig. 13, leads us to the
deﬁnition of code to understand if a building was built before the seismic
regulations (panel c, Fig. 13). As already mentioned in commenting on
the previous two panels in Fig. 13, Italy has a fairly old building stock,
where except for L’Aquila 2009, a large proportion of the buildings was
built without the seismic regulations in place.
As regards the seismological information, for each of the 6 shaking
parameters under examination, in addition to the value of the variable
itself and the relative uncertainty, the distance between site and
epicenter and the magnitude of the event under examination are also
provided. The distance used is RJB when the ﬁnite source is available, and
epicentral distance in other cases.
Fig. 14 shows the histograms of the ground motion variables included
in the data collection. The intensity values range between a minimum of
6.0 and a maximum of 9.0 on the MCS scale. With the exclusion of two
prominent peak at 7.4 and 8.3, the intensities distribute rather homo-
geneously for intensities larger than 6.5. Instead, data with MCS less than
7.0 are less abundant.
Looking at ground motion data, PGA has a predominant peak at 0.3 g,
a second smaller peak at 0.2 g, and it ranges between 0.02g and 0.45g.
The values of PGV from 5 to 9 cm/s are all equally highly populated. A
second peak is at 24 cm/s. Values between 10 cm/s and 26 cm/s are
distributed over a plateau of frequencies that are comparable to each
other. At the same time, values from 28 cm/s to 44 cm/s are also spread
over a plateau but with a much lower frequency. SA at 0.3s has a peak at
0.7; the values of this variable range between 0.05 g and 1 g, with an
almost uniform distribution. SA at 1.0s has a predominant peak at 0.07 g
and a smaller peak at 0.3 g. The ranges of values are between 0.03 g and
0.6 g. SA at 3.0s has two predominant peaks 0.015g and at 0.05 g, and it
ranges between 0.003 g and 0.075 g; there are some values of SA 0.3s
higher, but their frequency is negligible.
Fig. 15 shows the scatterplot of the six ground motion values ac-
cording to distance, differentiated according to the earthquake identiﬁer.
What we can deduce from the ﬁgure is that Pollino 1998 and Emilia
2012, which are the two least populated sequences of the data collection
have a different ground motion distribution. Pollino 1998 has points that
are further away as if the majority of the inhabited centres were not close
to the epicentre. On the contrary, Emilia 2012 has many points very close
to the epicentre, and no point is more than 80 km away. The data for the
earthquake in L’Aquila 2009 and Umbria Marche 1997 are those that
show a greater scatter. In fact, for the same distance, there are shaking
values that cover a wide range. The data relative to Irpinia 1980 are
instead those with less scatter. The greatest shaking values for all six
variables are those of Irpinia 1980, followed by Emilia 2012, L’Aquila
2009 and Umbria Marche 1997.

6. Conclusions and future applications
The ShakeDaDO data collection presented in this work combines for
the ﬁrst time damage data and peak ground shaking for Italy within a
single structure allowing further research and applications to be under-
taken by the community. In particular, the analysis of the relative de-
pendencies between parameters or, possibly, deep dependencies between
sets of parameters could lead to fast, euristic determinations of earth-
quake
impact.
Overall,
we
believe
there
are
multiple
possible
applications. For example, there has been a signiﬁcant effort since the
publication of the Da.D.O. database to produce empirical fragility func-
tions for the Italian building stock (e.g. DelGaudio et al., 2017, 2018;
Rosti et al., 2020a, b). However, these efforts have been limited by a lack
of ground shaking data for many of the events in the Da.D.O. database.
We thus believe that the ShakeDaDO data collection can help greatly
improve the research related to the development of empirical fragility
functions in Italy. We also expect this database to be useful to test new
and benchmark existing applications of new applications of Machine

ment, see for example Xie et al. (2020); Riedel et al. (2015). The

database, will be distributed within the Da.D.O. GIS platform.
