The completeness of interactive student networks are investigated in this paper, which can be used to
improve middle school students’ independent environment for their study outside class. This paper takes
covering approximation spaces as mathematical models of interactive student networks and character-
izes completeness of interactive student networks by connectivity of covering approximation spaces.
Further, this paper gives a simpler and practical method to check completeness of interactive student net-
works. Consequently, a way to communication among students is explored and applied in education.

1. Introduction
In the world, middle school students’ knowledge acceptance
may be divided into three stages: preview before class, classroom
learning and review after class. We observe the three stages, the
problems arise more frequently in preview stage or review stage
than in class learning. The most part of the problems can be solved
in classes, but if they are solved outside class in previewing or
reviewing, the effectiveness will be more beneﬁcial. However,
due to students’ independent environments outside classes, it is
difﬁcult for students to solve these problems by themselves. In
the past years, some more recent researches on using ‘‘social meth-
ods” in education has aroused more and more scholar’s wide inter-
ests and many interesting results were obtained [1,5,14,19].
Having gained some enlightenments from these researches, we
carry out the research for the following issue supported by a major
project of Chinese postdoctoral scientiﬁc foundation.
1.1. Issue
How can we make use of modern educational technology to
transform middle school students’ environment in preview and
review such that students can contact each other.
As an interesting exploration on the above issue, Z. Xia, the ﬁrst
author of this paper, designed a interactive student network for a
group of twelve students in Suzhou No.3 High School (see the fol-
lowing 1.4). Students, who use the interactive student network,
can send and receive information each other. This network created
a new environment for these students and would promote the
interaction among these students. We state the concept of interac-
tive student network as follows, which is similar to wireless net-
work system in [9].
1.2. The interactive student network ðV; BÞ
A interactive student network is a pair ðV; BÞ satisfying the fol-
lowing conditions, where V is a collection of some information
points and B is a collection of some base stations.
(1) Every information point in V can send information to some
base stations in B and receive information from these base
stations in B.
(2) Every base station in B can send information to some infor-
mation points in V and receive information from these infor-
mation points in V.
1.3. Completeness of interactive student networks
Let ðV; BÞ be a interactive student network.
(1) An information point u in V and an base stations B in B is
called to have a contact if u and B can send and receive infor-
mation each other.
(1) Two information point u and v in V is called to have a contact
if there are some information points u1; u2; . . . ; un in V and

some base stations B1; B2; . . . ; Bn�1 2 B such that for each
i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n � 1, not only ui and Bi have a contact but also
uiþ1 and Bi have a contact, where u1 ¼ u and un ¼ v.
(2) ðV; BÞ is called complete if u and v have a contact for all pair
u;v of information points in V.
Thus, any pair of students can send and receive information
each other by using a complete interactive student network. In
fact, let two students P1 and P2 use information points u and v in
V respectively, where ðV; BÞ is a complete interactive student net-
work. Then there are some information points u1; u2; . . . ; un 2 U
and some base stations B1; B2; . . . ; Bn�1 2 B such that for each
i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n � 1, not only ui and Bi have a contact but also uiþ1
and Bi have a contact, where u1 ¼ u and un ¼ v. Since u1 and B1
have a contact, with the help of u ¼ u1; P1 can send information
to B1. Also, since u2 and B1 have a contact, B1 can send information
to u2. Thus, P1 can send information to u2. Successively, P1 can send
information to un ¼ v. Moreover, with the help of v ¼ un; P2 can
receive information sent by P1.
1.4. Xia’s interactive student network
Now we state Xia’s interactive student network ðV; BÞ, which is
described in the following table (Table 1).
Here, V ¼ fu1; u2; u3; u4; u5; u6; u7; u8; u9; u10; u11; u12g is the col-
lection of twelve information points, B ¼ fB1; B2; B3; B4; B5; B6g is
the collection of six base stations, and the number, which lies in
the cross of the row labeled by u (u ¼ u1; u2; u3; u4; u5; u6; u7;
u8; u9; u10; u11; u12) and the column labeled by B (B ¼ B1; B2; B3;
B4; B5; B6), is 1 or 0 by u and B can send and receive information
each other or can not.
By the method of enumeration, it is not difﬁcult to check that
Xia’s interactive student network ðV; BÞ is complete. Thus, any pair
of students in Suzhou No.3 High School, who use information
points in ðV; BÞ, can send and receive information each other. As
a further work, Xia tried to establish interactive student networks
in a larger scale. However, it is necessary to design more informa-
tion points and base stations in such an interactive student net-
works, which make it complicated and difﬁcult to check the
completeness of interactive student networks by the method of
enumeration. This brings the following question.
1.5. The open question
For a interactive student network, how to check its complete-
ness? More precisely, are there a simpler and practical method to
check completeness of interactive student networks?.
To investigate the above question, it is necessary to analyze
data collected from interactive student networks. In the research
of modern sciences, in order to extract useful information hidden
in data, many methods in addition to classical logic and classical
mathematics have been proposed. Rough set theory, which was
proposed by Pawlak [15], plays an important role in applications
of these methods. Their usefulness has been demonstrated by
many successful applications in information sciences and com-
puter sciences [2,4,12,18,21,22]. In particular, rough set theory is
also applied in education widely [3,7,17,20]. In the past years, with
development of information sciences and computer sciences,
applications of rough-set theory have been extended from Pawlak
approximation spaces to covering approximation spaces in many
research ﬁelds [10,11,13,16,23,24].
1.6. The purpose of this paper
This paper launches an investigation around Question 1.5 by
covering approximation spaces. The purpose of this paper is to give
a simpler and practical method for checking completeness of inter-
active student networks.
2. Covering approximation spaces
In this section, we state basic concepts and theories of covering
approximation spaces.
Deﬁnition 2.1 24. Let U, the universe of discourse, be a ﬁnite set
and K be a family of nonempty subsets of U.
(1) K is called a cover of U if SfK : K 2 Kg ¼ U.
(2) The pair ðU; KÞ is called a covering approximation space if K
is a cover of U.
Remark 2.2. Let ðU; KÞ be a covering approximation space. If ; 2 K
and K is closed with respect to both the union and the ﬁnite inter-
section of elements of K, then ðU; KÞ is a topological space [6].
Now we state connectivity of covering approximation spaces
(see [8,9], for example) and give its discussion again.
Deﬁnition 2.3. Let ðU; KÞ be a covering approximation space and
x; y 2 U.
(1) A subfamily fK1; K2; . . . ; Kng of K is called a chain between x
and
y
if
x 2 K1; y 2 Kn
and
Ki
T Kiþ1 – ;
for
each
i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n � 1.
(2) x is called to be chain connected to y if there is a chain
between x and y.
Remark 2.4. Let ðU; KÞ be a covering approximation space. Then
the relation for ‘‘chain connected” is an equivalent relation, i.e.,
the following hold for all x; y; z 2 U.
(1) x is chain connected to x.
(2) x is chain connected to y ) y is chain connected to x.
(3) x is chain connected to y and y is chain connected to z ) x is
chain connected to z.
Proof. Obviously, (1) and (2) hold. Let x be chain connected to y,
and y be chain connected to z. Then there are K1; K2; . . . ; Kn 2 K
such that x 2 K1; y 2 Kn; Ki
T Kiþ1 – ; for each i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n � 1;
and
there
are
Knþ1; Knþ2; . . . ; Knþm 2 K
such
that
y 2 Knþ1; z 2 Knþm; Knþi
T Knþiþ1 – ;
for
each
i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; m � 1.

Consequently, there are K1; K2; . . . ; Kn; Knþ1; Knþ2; . . . ; Knþm 2 K such
that
x 2 K1; z 2 Knþm
and
Ki
T Kiþ1 – ;
for
each
i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n þ m � 1. This proves that x is chain connected to z.
So (3) holds. h
Deﬁnition 2.5. A covering approximation space ðU; KÞ is called
connected if for each pair x; y 2 U; x is chain connected to y, i.e.,
there is a chain between x and y.
As a classical result in topology, a topological space ðX; T Þ is
connected if and only if ðX; T Þ has no non-empty clopen proper
subset. Note that there is not concept for clopen subset for covering
approximation spaces. So we need to introduced a class of new
subsets of covering approximation spaces, which has relation with
the following covering upper approximation operator.
Deﬁnition 2.6. Let ðU; KÞ be a covering approximation space. For
each X # U, Put
SHðXÞ ¼
[
fK : K 2 K and K
\
X – ;g:
Then SH : 2U�!2U is called a covering upper approximation opera-
tor, and SHðXÞ is called a covering upper approximation of X.
The above covering upper approximation operator SH is called
the second type of covering upper approximation operation in [24].
Deﬁnition 2.7. Let ðU; KÞ be a covering approximation space and
X # U. X is called an SH-subset of ðU; KÞ if SHðXÞ ¼ X.
The following theorem is an important result of this paper,
which characterizes connectivity of covering approximation spaces
by their SH-subsets.
Lemma 2.8. Let ðU; KÞ be a covering approximation space and x 2 U.
Put X ¼ fu 2 U : x is chain connected to ug. If X ¼ U, then ðU; KÞ is
connected.
Proof. Assume that X ¼ U. Let u;v 2 U ¼ X. Then x is chain con-
nected to both u and v. By Remark 2.4(2), (3), u is chain connected
to v. So ðU; KÞ is connected. h
Theorem 2.9. Let ðU; KÞ be a covering approximation space. Then the
following are equivalent.
(1) ðU; KÞ is connected.
(2) ðU; KÞ has no non-empty proper SH-subset.
Proof.
(1) ) (2). Suppose that ðU; KÞ is connected. Let X be a non-
empty SH-subset of ðU; KÞ. Then SHðXÞ ¼ X – ;. We only
need to prove that X is not a proper subset of U, i.e. X ¼ U.
Let x 2 U. Pick y 2 X, then y is chain connected to x, i.e., there
are
K1; K2; . . . ; Kn 2 K
such
that
y 2 K1; x 2 Kn
and
Ki
T Kiþ1 – ; for each i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n � 1. Since y 2 K1
T X –
;; K1 # SHðXÞ ¼ X.
Furthermore,
K2
T X � K2
T K1 – ;,
so
K2 # SHðXÞ ¼ X. In the same way, we can obtain that
Kn # SHðXÞ ¼ X. Thus, x 2 Kn # X. This proves that U # X. It
follows that X ¼ U.
(2) ) (1). Suppose that ðU;KÞ has no non-empty proper SH-
subset. Let x 2 U. Put X ¼ fu 2 U : x is chain connected to ug.
Then x 2 X –; by Remark 2.4(1). Let y 2 SHðXÞ. Then there
is K 2 K such that y 2 K and K TX – ;. Pick z 2 K TX. Then x
is chain connected to z, and z is chain connected to y. So x
is chain connected to y by Remark 2.4(3). It follows that
y 2 X. This proves that SHðXÞ#X. On the other hand, It is
clear that X #SHðXÞ, and hence SHðXÞ ¼ X. Thus, X is a SH-
subset of ðU;KÞ, it follows that X ¼ U. By Lemma 2.8, ðU;KÞ
is connected. h
3. The method of checking completeness of interactive student
networks
In this section, we establish a relation between completeness of
interactive student networks and connectivity of covering approx-
imation spaces. By this relation we give a method to check com-
pleteness of interactive student networks.
Proposition 3.1. Let ðV; BÞ be a interactive student network. For
every base station B in B, let KB be a set of some information points in
V such that u 2 V is an information point in KB if and only if u and B
have a contact. Put U ¼ V and K ¼ fKB : B 2 Bg. Then ðU; KÞ is a
covering approximation space.
Proof. It sufﬁces to prove that K is a cover of U. Let u 2 U, i.e., u is
an information point in V. By 1.2(1), there is a base station B in B
such that u and B have a contact. So u is an information point in
KB, i.e., u 2 KB. This proves that K is a cover of U. h
By the above proposition, we can take covering approximation
spaces as mathematical models of interactive student networks.
Here, the covering approximation space ðU; KÞ is called to be
induced by the interactive student network ðV; BÞ.
Lemma 3.2. Let ðV; BÞ be a interactive student network, and let
ðU; KÞ be a covering approximation space induced by ðV; BÞ. Then the
following are equivalent for all u;v 2 V ¼ U.
(1) u and v have a contact in ðV; BÞ.
(2) There is a chain between u and v in ðU; KÞ.
Proof.
(1) ) (2): Let u and v have a contact. Then there are some infor-
mation points u1; u2; . . . ; un 2 U and some base stations
B1; B2; . . . ; Bn�1 2 B such that for each i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n � 1, not
only ui and Bi have a contact but also uiþ1 and Bi have a con-
tact, where u1 ¼ u and un ¼ v. Note that ðU; KÞ is induced by
ðV; BÞ. For each i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n � 1; KBi 2 K, we put Ki ¼ KBi.
Then K1; K2; . . . ; Kn�1 2 K, and for each i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n � 1;
ui; uiþ1 2 Ki. It follows that u ¼ u1 2 K1;v ¼ un 2 Kn�1, and
for each i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n � 2, uiþ1 2 Ki
T Kiþ1 – ;. This shows
that K1; K2; . . . ; Kn�1 is a chain between u and v.
(2) ) (1): Let K1; K2; . . . ; Kn is a chain between u and v, i.e.,
u 2 K1;v 2 Kn and Ki
T Kiþ1 – ; for each i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n � 1.
Put u1 ¼ u, unþ1 ¼ v, and for each i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n � 1, choose
uiþ1 2 Ki
T Kiþ1.
It
follows
that
ui; uiþ1 2 Ki
for
each
i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n. Since ðU; KÞ is induced by ðV; BÞ, there are base
stations
B1; B2; . . . ; Bn 2 B
such
that
Ki ¼ KBi
for
each
i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n. Thus, for each i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n, ui; uiþ1 2 KBi, i.e.,
not only ui and Bi have a contact but also uiþ1 and Bi have
a contact. This proves that u and v have a contact. h
By Lemma 3.2, we obtain the following theorem immediately,
which shows that the completeness of interactive student net-
works and the connectivity of covering approximation spaces are
equivalent.

Theorem 3.3. Let ðV; BÞ be a interactive student network, and let
ðU; KÞ be a covering approximation space induced by ðV; BÞ. Then the
following are equivalent.
(1) ðV; BÞ is complete.
(2) ðU; KÞ is connected.
Now we give a simpler and practical method for checking com-
pleteness of interactive student networks.
Method 3.4. Let ðV; BÞ be a interactive student network. The
method for checking completeness of ðV; BÞ consists of the
following ﬁve steps.
(1) By Proposition 3.1, we convert ðV; BÞ to a covering approxi-
mation space ðU; KÞ, where ðU; KÞ is induced by ðV; BÞ.
(2) By Deﬁnition 2.6, we endow the covering upper approxima-
tion operator SH on ðU; KÞ.
(3) By Deﬁnition 2.7, we obtain all SH-subsets of ðU; KÞ by a sim-
ple algorithm.
(4) By the above (3) and Theorem 2.9, it is known that whether
ðU; KÞ is connected.
(5) By the above (4) and Theorem 3.3, it is known that whether
ðV; BÞ is complete.
4. Some applications
In this section, we give some applications to show that our
approach does work. This work is to assess completeness of inter-
active student networks.
4.1. Check of Xia’s interactive student network
(1)
Description of Xia’s interactive student network ðV; BÞ
(see 1.4 in Section 1).
(1.1)
V ¼ fu1; u2; u3; u4; u5; u6; u7; u8; u9; u10; u11; u12g is the col-
lection of twelve information points.
(1.2)
B ¼ fB1; B2; B3; B4; B5; B6g is the collection of six base
stations.
(1.3)
Contacts between information points and base stations.
(1.3.1)
B1 and ui have a contact for i 2 f1; 5; 6; 7; 8; 11g.
(1.3.2)
B2 and ui have a contact for i 2 f2; 3; 5; 8; 10; 12g.
(1.3.3)
B3 and ui have a contact for i 2 f1; 2; 7; 9; 11; 12g.
(1.3.4)
B4 and ui have a contact for i 2 f1; 3; 4; 9; 10; 12g.
(1.3.5)
B5 and ui have a contact for i 2 f3; 4; 6; 7; 8; 9g.
(1.3.6)
B6 and ui have a contact for i 2 f2; 4; 5; 6; 10; 11g.
(2)
The covering approximation space ðU; KÞ induced by
ðV; BÞ.
(2.1)
Put U ¼ V.
(2.2)
For each i 2 f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6g, let Ki be a set of some infor-
mation points in V such that u 2 V is an information
point in Ki if and only if u and Bi have a contact.
(2.2.1)
K1 ¼ fu1; u5; u6; u7; u8; u11g.
(2.2.2)
K2 ¼ fu2; u3; u5; u8; u10; u12g.
(2.2.3)
K3 ¼ fu1; u2; u7; u9; u11; u12g.
(2.2.4)
K4 ¼ fu1; u3; u4; u9; u10; u12g.
(2.2.5)
K5 ¼ fu3; u4; u6; u7; u8; u9g.
(2.2.6)
K6 ¼ fu2; u4; u5; u6; u10; u11g.
(2.3)
Put K ¼ fK1; K2; K3; K4; K5; K6g.
(2.4)
It is clear that ðU; KÞ is a covering approximation space
induced by ðV; BÞ.
(3)
The connectivity of ðU; KÞ.
By a simple algorithm, it can be obtained that if X is a
non-empty SH-subset of ðU; KÞ, then X ¼ U. In fact, let
X be an SH-subset of ðU; KÞ and X – ;. Then there is
ui 2 X
for
some
i 2 f1; 2; . . . ; 12g.
If
u1 2 X,
then
Ki
T X – ; for i ¼ 1; 3; 4. Thus, X ¼ SHðXÞ ¼ SfK : K 2
K and K T X – ;g � K1
S K3
S K4 ¼
fu1; u2; u3; u4; u5;
u6; u7; u8; u9; u10; u11; u12g ¼ U. It follows that X ¼ U. By
the same method, we can obtain that if ui 2 X for
i 2 f2; 3; . . . ; 12g, then X ¼ U. This shows that ðU; KÞ has
no non-empty proper SH-subset. It follows that ðU; KÞ
is connected from Theorem 2.9.
(4)
The completeness of ðV; BÞ.
By Theorem 3.3, ðV; BÞ is complete.
4.2. A simulative interactive student network
As a re-examine of our method, the following gives a simulative
interactive student network.
(1)
Description of the simulative interactive student net-
work ðV; BÞ.
This network is described as follows.
(1.1)
V ¼ fu1; u2; u3; u4; u5; u6; u7; u8; u9g is the collection of
nine information points.
(1.2)
B ¼ fB1; B2; B3; B4; B5; B6g is the collection of six base
stations.
(1.3)
Contacts between information points and base stations.
(1.3.1)
B1 and ui have a contact for i 2 f1; 3; 8; 9g.
(1.3.2)
B2 and ui have a contact for i 2 f1; 4; 9g.
(1.3.3)
B3 and ui have a contact for i 2 f3; 4; 8g.
(1.3.4)
B4 and ui have a contact for i 2 f2; 6; 7g.
(1.3.5)
B5 and ui have a contact for i 2 f2; 5; 7g.
(1.3.6)
B6 and ui have a contact for i 2 f5; 6; 7g.
Similar to Xia’s interactive student network, we can describe
the simulative interactive student network by the following table
(Table 2).

mation points in V such that u 2 V is an information
point in Ki if and only if u and Bi have a contact.

It is clear that ðU; KÞ is a covering approximation space
induced by ðV; BÞ.
(3)
SH-subsets of the covering approximation space ðU; KÞ.
By a simple algorithm, we obtain all SH-subsets of ðU; KÞ. They
are Ø; U; f1; 3; 4; 8; 9g and f2; 5; 6; 7g.
(4) The connectivity of ðU; KÞ.
By the above (3), ðU; KÞ has two non-empty proper SH-
subset. So ðU; KÞ is not connected from Theorem 2.9.
(5) The completeness of ðV; BÞ.
By Theorem 3.3, ðV; BÞ is not complete.
Remark 4.1. In Xia’s interactive student network and the simula-
tive interactive student network, fewer information points and
base stations are designed. However, if we establish interactive
student network in large-scale, then voluminous information
points and base stations should be designed in general. It is note-
worthy that the method for checking their completeness is the
same, which can be achieved by some simple algorithms under
the help of computer technology.
5. Conclusion
Conclusion 5.1. The main results of this paper are to investigate
completeness of interactive student networks. Here, interactive
student networks are used to transform middle school students’
independent environment in preview and review such that
students can contact each other by using the complete interactive
student networks. In order to investigate completeness of interac-
tive student networks by mathematical methods, this paper takes
covering approximation spaces as mathematical models of inter-
active student networks and establish a relation between com-
pleteness of interactive student networks and connectivity of
covering approximation spaces. Further, this paper introduces SH-
subsets of covering approximation spaces to characterize their
connectivity. By converting completeness of interactive student
network to connectivity of covering approximation spaces, this
paper gives a simpler and practical method for checking com-
pleteness of interactive student network. In the end of this paper,
two examples are given to demonstrate applications of this
method.
Remark 5.2. This paper focuses on check of completeness of inter-
active student networks, without dealing with the method of
establishing them. How do we establish a complete interactive stu-
dent network? This is an interesting question, which deals with
either mobile communication project or virtual organization
framework. We will discuss this question in our future work.
