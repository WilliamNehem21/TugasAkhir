Abstract
This paper proposes and evaluates the novel utilization of small world network proper-
ties for the formation of team of players with both best performances and best belongingness within
the team network. To verify this concept, this methodology is applied to T-20 cricket teams. The
players are treated as nodes of the network, whereas the number of interactions between team mem-
bers is denoted as the edges between those nodes. All intra country networks form the cricket net-
work for this case study. Analysis of the networks depicts that T-20 cricket network inherits all
characteristics of small world network. Making a quantitative measure for an individual perfor-
mance in the team sports is important with respect to the fact that for team selection of an Inter-
national match, from pool of best players, only eleven players can be selected for the team. The
statistical record of each player considered as a traditional way of quantifying the performance
of a player. But the other criteria such as performing against a strong opponent or performance
as an effective team member such as ﬁelding, running between the wickets, good partnership
deserves more credential. In this paper a revised method based on social networking is presented
to quantify the quality of team belongingness and efﬁciency of each player. The application of
Social Network Analysis (SNA) is explored to measure performances and the rank of the players.
A bidirectional weighted network of players is generated using the information collected from T-20
cricket (2014–2016) and used for network analysis. Thus team was formed based on that ranking
and compared with their IPL (Indian Premier League) performances of 2016.

1. Introduction
Watts and Strogatz [1] deﬁned Small-World networks as the
class where networks are highly clustered like regular lattices,
but with small characteristic path length similar to random
graphs. Social network analysis provides analytical informa-
tion about the interrelationships between the members of the
network and the network dynamics. In this work we have gen-
erated a small world network [2] of international cricket teams

using the nodes as the players and interactions between them
as the edges. The focus of this paper is to apply the social net-
work analysis techniques such as clustering coefﬁcients and
centrality measurements to quantify the belongingness of an
individual player within the team along with their individual
performances. As a result, the quality of the players as a team
member reﬂected in team formation which is very important
for team sports. Based on that characterization the key players
(in a role based approach) can be selected for a team
formation.
Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams,
consisting eleven players in the both team, on a cricket ﬁeld.
One team is the batting team, attempts to score as many runs
as possible, while their opponents are the bowling team, which
give ﬁelding and bowling and try to take as many as wickets
and restrict the runs of the batting team. In short term cricket,
the length of each innings ranges from 20 overs of six bowling
deliveries per side (T-20 cricket) to 50 over deliveries per side
(one day cricket) and in case of Test cricket, there is a maxi-
mum of four innings played over ﬁve days, and per day max-
imum 90 overs can be played.
In this paper, a ranking system based on both players’ per-
formance statistics and belongingness is proposed. To capture
the belongingness of a player, centrality measures and cluster-
ing coefﬁcient are considered. The data for network generation
for this research work are collected from international T-20
cricket matches for the session 2014–2016. Statistical records
of top ten countries Australia, England, South Africa, New
Zealand, India, West Indies, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh
and Zimbabwe are considered. From late 2000, ICC (Interna-
tional Cricket Council, the highest parenting body of cricket)
introduced the shortest format called T-20 cricket which are
played for twenty-twenty overs and durations of the matches
are approximately three hours [3]. Players are selected based
on their centrality measures and clustering coefﬁcient and
ﬁnally a pool of players are formed from where a team of ele-
ven players can be selected. Best team according to the pro-
posed approach is also compared with IPL 2016 teams.
We are comparing our results with IPL 2016 teams. Most of
the countries that played Test Cricket have a domestic cup
competition, and in case of India it is Indian Premium League,
often abbreviated as IPL. The IPL is the most attracting form
of cricket in the world and ranks sixth among all sports lea-
gues, contested every year during April–March by franchise
teams representing Indian cities from different states. There
are currently 8 teams playing in this tournament, and each
member of the team is selected by auction of players done
by the franchisees. Each franchise can select a squad of 14
players based on their different performance matrices, and
from them 11 of the players are played in the day of match.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
the related works are discussed. The proposed approach for
team formation is discussed in Section 3. This section high-
lights small world characteristics of T-20 cricket network. Dif-
ferent centrality measures and clustering coefﬁcient technique
from the view point of cricket network are also discussed. In
Section 4, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is evalu-
ated and compared with IPL T-20 session 2016. In Section 5 a
brief discussion is made comparing other best team formation
approaches with proposed approach. Finally, the paper con-
cludes in Section 6.
2. Related work
In recent research trends, several works have been done for
performance measures of a team, where team belongingness
of individual performance along with their individual perfor-
mances in team sports plays a signiﬁcant role. Different tech-
niques used in analysing team sports like football can be
found in [4–8]. In [9,10], interactions among players are anal-
ysed in other ball sports such as baseball and basketball
respectively. Another network analysis approach has been
done on Spanish Teams performance during FIFA World
Cup 2010 [11]. They have done a temporal analysis of the
resulting passes network, taken into account the number of
passes, length of the chain of passes, and centrality, clustering
coefﬁcient measure of the players. Some researchers also con-
sider the basic fact of a team sports and instead of measuring
simple statistics as number goals or number assists, they put
emphasis on the players ability a team member by generation
a ﬂow network [12]. In [13,14] network based approaches are
used for performance analysis of players in tennis. In [15,16]
a network was generated using the interaction of players for
cricket. Performances of water polo also quantiﬁed through
network-based approach.
Not only in sports, network based approach in team build-
ing is more recent trend of analysis along with data mining and
web mining tools [17,18]. Though these papers focussed on for-
mation of network, social network characteristics are not used
for ranking systems or team formation.
3. Proposed approach for team formation
This work presents a social network analysis based approach
to form a team. Both the performances and belongingness of
players are considered here. Initially, from the data of T-20
cricket session 2014–2016 a pool of players is created o the
basis of their performance. A player is included in the pool
as a batsman if he has scored more than 900 runs in T-20 inter-
national matches during 2014–2016. Similarly, a player is
selected as a bowler if he has taken more than 35 wickets
during that period in T-20 international matches. The major
steps of the proposed approach are (1) network formation of
the T-20 cricket, (2) identiﬁcation of small world properties
in the network, and (3) formation of a pool of players with
respect to high centrality and clustering coefﬁcient measures.
From this pool, four teams are selected on the basis of players’
betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, node degree distri-
bution and clustering coefﬁcient. Players are also assigned
ranks according to these measures in the corresponding team.
These four teams are compared with present IPL teams, 2016.

3.1. Network formation
Cricket database is created from match by match statistics col-
lected from www.espncricinfo.com Web site, and imported on
excel sheet as an adjacency matrix as shown in Table 1. This
adjacency matrix deﬁnes the number of matches played
between players. We have formed a player vs. player matrix,
where we deﬁne the number of matches common between
two players. Firstly this was done by individual team basis
and the intra network is formed. A small sample network is
shown in Fig. 2 Each team member is deﬁned as a node in
the graph, and connection between them represents the edges
of the graph. The weighted directed edges are created from
the ratio of common matches and total number of matches
played by that player. From the reference ﬁgure it is clear that
the thick edges represent profound relationship between two
players whereas thin edges represent less interaction. Then a
team vs. team matrix was formed for all the countries under
consideration and thus network of networks of all countries
is formed as shown in Fig. 3. This network is executed in
Gephi (https://gephi.org/), which is a free and open source
software. Finally, the network parameters are calculated. A
partial data table showing the derived parameters is shown
in appendix as Table 4.
3.2. Small world characteristics of T-20 cricket network
It is important for the cricket network to be a small world net-
work [1], as our idea is to use the centrality measures and clus-
tering coefﬁcient to detect the key players in the network.
However, most of the nodes are not directly connected in a
small world, but the distance (i.e., number of hops) between
two nodes is signiﬁcantly less and the nodes connecting other
nodes play signiﬁcant role in the network.
In a network, small world coefﬁcient r can be deﬁned as.
r ¼ ðCActual=CRandomÞ=ðLActual=LRandomÞ:
This value should be greater than 1 for being a small world
network [1].
Here CActual and CRandom signify the clustering coefﬁcients of
players’ network and random network respectively. Similarly,
LActual and LRandom respectively signify the average path lengths
of players network and random network.
At ﬁrst, we have generated network for T-20 cricket net-
work. Fig. 4 shows the random graph and T-20 cricket net-
work
graph
with
same
number
of
nodes.
Clustering
coefﬁcient and average path length for the network are calcu-
lated. Clustering coefﬁcient for T-20 is derived as 0.702 and
average path length is calculated as 2.147. Now to calculate
r, a random network [19] is generated using random rewiring
probability. Clustering coefﬁcients of random network with
same number of nodes (as the actual T-20 cricket network)
are 0.14 and average Path Length is 2.081. Thus, the small
world coefﬁcient, i.e., r of T-20 cricket network is calculated
as 4.86 which is not only greater than 1, but shows higher value
than small world coefﬁcients of karate (1.65) and the Internet
networks (2.38) [20]. This result clearly depicts that the T-20
cricket network inherits small world phenomenon.
3.3. Clustering coefﬁcient
Clustering coefﬁcient of a node (player) in the network signi-
ﬁes characteristics of that node (player) forming local cluster
that is numbers of nodes (players) those are inﬂuenced by that
particular node (player). In this context, the dense local cluster
signiﬁes that node (player) has great inﬂuence to other nodes
(players). In social networks, especially in small world net-
works, generally all nodes are highly connected and the cluster-
ing coefﬁcient is also quite high valued than the average
clustering coefﬁcient of random network. The local clustering
coefﬁcient of a node is also deﬁned as the number of complete
graph (clique) that can be formed using the neighbor of that
node. This property was ﬁrst introduced by Watts and Stro-
gatz [1] for deﬁning small world coefﬁcient. The clustering
coefﬁcient varies between 0 (no clustering) and 1 (maximum
clustering) [20].
Let graph G ¼ ðn; lÞ denotes set of nodes n and a set of links
l connecting the nodes. An edge lij denotes the connection
between node ni with node nj. Neighborhood Ni for a node
ni can be expressed as node’s connected neighbors and can
be denoted by following expression [21]:
Ni ¼ fnj : lij 2 l; lji 2 lg
Here, we consider an undirected graph with identical weight
for lij and lji. Thus if node ni has ki neighbors, kiðki�1Þ
2
edges can
be exist between the nodes within local neighborhood. There-
fore, local clustering coefﬁcient can be expressed as [21]

If kGðnÞ denotes number of triangles on n 2 G for an undi-
rected graph G, kGðnÞ is total number of subgraphs of G with 3
edges and 3 nodes, sGðnÞ be the number of triples on n 2 G.
Then clustering coefﬁcient can be deﬁned as below [22].
Ci ¼ kGðnÞ
sGðnÞ
Clustering can be measured in different ways also. One
common procedure for measuring is to ﬁnd existing triangles,
i.e., to check that when two edges share a node, and then in a
network with high clustering, it is highly probable that a third
edge exists to form a triangles [22]. Small world networks have
the characteristics of highly clustered nodes. From the analysis
it can be stated that the cricket network is highly clustered as
maximum players have high clustering coefﬁcient value. Aver-
age clustering coefﬁcient is the mean value of individual clus-
tering coefﬁcients. In this work, a total number of 39,784
triangles are formed in the T-20 network and average cluster-
ing coefﬁcient is calculated as 0.702. The maximum clustering
coefﬁcient is derived as 1 and distribution graphs of players in
the role of batsman and bowler (only for the players who qual-
iﬁed for the performance pool) respectively are shown in Figs. 5
and 6.
3.4. Average path length
In a graph G ¼ ðV; EÞ of order n the average path length is
deﬁned as the average distance between any two pair of
vertices [21]. It is denoted by the arithmetic mean of distance
between any two randomly chosen nodes or players. Thus,
average path length can be deﬁned as [21]:
lðGÞ ¼
1
n

�

u;v�V
dðu; vÞ
Average path length signiﬁes how well the players in the
network are connected to the other players in the player net-
work. The characteristics of small world network are that aver-
age path length is comparatively smaller compared to random
or scale free network.
3.5. Betweenness centrality
Betweenness centrality is a widely used centrality measure. For
each single node present in the network, betweenness centrality
of that node can be deﬁned as proportionality of total shortest
paths passing through that nodes to all possible shortest paths
present in network [23]. A player with high value of between-
ness centrality measure has large inﬂuence on the other play-
ers. Betweenness centrality of node n can be expressed as [23]
CBðnÞ ¼
X
s–n–t
rstðnÞ

where rst deﬁnes total number of shortest paths and rstðnÞ
deﬁnes the number of shortest paths passing through n. As dis-
cussed, betweenness centrality signiﬁes the inﬂuence of a par-
ticular
node

the

betweenness centrality play important roles within the net-
work. In the computation, total number of shortest paths is
derived as 51,302, for 227 numbers of players. Normalized
betweenness centrality distribution graphs for players in the
role of batsman and bowler respectively are shown in Figs. 5
and 6.
3.6. Closeness centrality
In a graph representing a small world network, closeness cen-
trality measures how close a node is to others in the network.
In other words, the closeness centrality of a node in a network
is the inverse of distance between two nodes in that network.
By the use of closeness centrality one can determine the efﬁ-
ciency of each node with respect to others for spreading infor-
mation in the network. The shorter the distance between two
nodes, the larger the closeness centrality and thus ensures the
more efﬁcient spreading in the network. There are various
algorithms for deﬁning closeness centrality measurements by
calculating all pair shortest paths. A node is considered as
an important node if that node is relatively close to other
nodes. Closeness is reciprocal of farness. To calculate closeness
centrality of a node the equation can be deﬁned as [21]
closenessðuÞ ¼
X
v
1
dvu
where u is the focal node, v is another node in the network, and
dvu is the shortest distance between these two nodes. In T-20
cricket network, closeness centrality value ranges between 1
and 52.3. Figs. 5 and 6 shows the normalized closeness central-
ity distribution of players in the role of batsman and bowler.
3.7. Node degree distribution
Among all centrality measures degree distribution is the sim-
plest one. Degree of a node in a network is determined by
the total number of outgoing and ingoing edges from that
node. In case of directed graph we have two types of degree
distribution namely out-degree and in-degree distribution for
each node. Although in case of undirected graph there is no
such classiﬁcation. When analysing the weighted networks,
degree has generally expressed as sum of nodes. For calculat-
ing the total degree distribution of a node in a directed graph,
all the incoming and outgoing edges should be added. The in-
degree and out-degree of node u is the total number of connec-
tions onto and from node u respectively. Basically degree dis-
tribution captures only a small amount of data of a small
world network, but that information gives us the important
clues about the network. Nodes with highest number of degree
have greatest inﬂuence on connection the other nodes and
working as the hub of the network. In T-20 cricket, the value
of node degree centrality ranges from 22 to 68 for the players
selected in the performance pool and the distribution (normal-
ized) of players in the role of batsman and bowler is shown in
Figs. 5 and 6.
4. Selection of player
From the pool of players who meet the criterion of perfor-
mance, based on the clustering coefﬁcient, betweenness cen-
trality, closeness centrality and node degree distribution, the
key players are selected in a ranked manner. Each cricket team
has batsman, bowler, all-rounder and wicketkeeper which can
be designated as the role of the players in the team. Based on
the role required for a cricket, a team is selected from the pool
of players formed using the proposed approach.
In this work, T-20 cricket network is formed for a total of
227 players (session 2014–2016) and total number of shortest
paths is derived as 51302. As discussed earlier, performance
data (runs, wickets, ﬁelding) are collected for each player.
Then those designated players are sorted according to their
betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, clustering coefﬁ-
cient and degree in descending order and normalized those val-
ues. Now from the pool of players with high performances,
players in different roles are selected based on their centrality
measures and clustering coefﬁcients. From the analysis, the
best teams are shown in Table 2.
For the comparison, we show the ﬁrst eleven (based on the
maximum appearance) from the squad of 25 players of IPL
2016 teams in Table 3. It depicts that almost all players of
the best teams are included in the ﬁrst eleven. Statistics also
reﬂect that performance of these players has a great contribu-
tion for their teams. 19 players are appeared in ﬁrst eleven of
eight IPL teams out of 22 players that belong to our best four
teams (refer to Tables 3 and 2) Proposed team matching index
with IPL is 86.36%, whereas for ICC best rank players (22
numbers) matching index is 14 out of 22, i.e., 63.63% (exclud-
ing players from Pakistan). In other words, more than 86%
players in the team formed using our proposed approach are
included in the ﬁrst eleven team (excluded the players from
Pakistan as they didn’t participate in this season of IPL) as
compared to 63% of the best ranked players of ICC T-20
ranking.
It is interesting that team Royal challenger Bengaluru have
most players in the role of batsman from our proposed pool of
players. However, none of their bowlers are from this pool. In
the real scenario, the team Royal challenger Bengaluru per-
formed very well and they were the ﬁrst qualiﬁer for the ﬁnal
of IPL season 2016, however their comparatively poor bowling
section was a drawback of their performance. Now the other
three teams that include maximum number of players from
our proposed best teams are Rising Pune Supergiant, Sunrisers
Hyderabad and Gujarat Lions. From these four teams except
Rising Pune Supergiant, other teams are top three teams of
IPL 2016.

5. Discussion
In this paper, we have presented an approach which includes
both performance and bonding with the teammates. It is
become important to select the players who have maximum
potential and have the capability of playing team game, which
builds the success of the team. Moreover for each role/position
it requires a proper balance so that the team can play with
maximum coordination.
For the ranking of the players, other approaches such as
neural network is applied to the selection of players. For exam-
ple, in the case of annual Australian Football League (AFL)
national draft, team formation involves mathematical and sta-
tistical approach for extracting knowledge from the neural net-
work [24]. A recent study have been made, where the
researchers model a decision-making process of a single sports
franchise, which takes a combination of the players estimated
value along with the value of the other players currently avail-
able, and the position wise analysis required for that particular
team [25]. But all these techniques ignore the fact that interac-
tion of the players can play an important role for team perfor-
mance. We are trying to incorporate this property and ﬁnd
that it is more closure to the real team selection.

6. Conclusion
The focus of this paper is team formation based on the prop-
erties of small world network in T-20 Cricket. This paper uses
three centrality measures betweenness centrality, closeness cen-
trality, node degree distribution and clustering coefﬁcient for
evaluation of players. Few key players, that exhibit higher cen-
trality values or clustering coefﬁcient may inﬂuence many
other players and take a signiﬁcant role in team formation.
In this work, we put an emphasis on quantifying the perfor-
mance of players from the history of previous years’ data
about their batting, bowling performances, as well as taking
a qualitative measure based on clustering coefﬁcient and cen-
trality measures derived from the network of players. Both
the characteristics are used as team formation strategy and a
role based team was formed.
