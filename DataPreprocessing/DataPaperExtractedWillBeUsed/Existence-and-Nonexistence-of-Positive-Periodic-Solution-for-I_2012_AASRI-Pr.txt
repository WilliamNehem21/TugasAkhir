Abstract 
In this paper, impulsive Nicholson's  blowflies  model is studied. By using  Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem , we 
obtain some sufficient conditions for the existence of  positive periodic solution. In addition,  the nonexistence of positive 
periodic solution is also investigated. Our results extend and improve the previous literatures.

1. Introduction 
As we know, population dynamics  have received great attention  from  many  authors. In the natural 
ecological  systems,  there exist a lot of discontinuous, impulsive phenomena, for instance, people release or 
harvest a species at fixed time, many species are given birth instantaneously and seasonally, and so on. 
Introducing the impulsive effect to ecology model can describe the species and  the ecological systems more 
truly and reasonablly. Impulsive differential equation has become a hot and important study topic[1-3,5,11-
14].

A very basic and important ecological problem in the study of population dynamics concerns the existence 
of positive periodic solutions. Recently, many authors investigated the existence of positive periodic solution 
by using  Krasnoselskii cone fixed point theorem and  Mawhin's coincidence degree theory[9-14].  
In this paper,we consider impulsive Nicholson's blowflies model

In [7][8],the oscillation and global attractivity of Nicholson's blowflies model  were studied. The purpose of 
this  paper is to obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of positive  periodic solutions of system (1.1) by 
using Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem. Furthermore, we also investigate the nonexistence of positive  
periodic solutions of system (1.1).

  is the � -periodic solution of equation (1.1) if  and only if  x  is the fixed point 
of operator T . We can check that operator T  is completely continuous. 
The following Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem (see Theorem 6.5.4 in [4] )  is an important tool in our 
proofs.

Remark .
In the study of periodic  solution, most of the previous literatures  required that f is superlinear or 
sublinear. However, in this paper,

 ,which is neither superlinear nor sublinear.We obtain 
sufficient conditions for the existence of positive periodic solution in case that f is neither superlinear nor 
sublinear ,which extend and improve the results of previous literatures.In addition, we also obtain sufficient 
conditions for the nonexistence of  positive periodic solution.
