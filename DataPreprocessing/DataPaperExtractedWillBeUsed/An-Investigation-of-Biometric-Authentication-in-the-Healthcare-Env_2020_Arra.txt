A vast amount of growth has taken place in the ﬁeld of biometrics and in the healthcare industry. Biometrics
provides the ability to identify individuals based on their physical and behavioral characteristics. The fusion of
biometrics and information systems in the healthcare environment has provided a new approach to determine the
identity of patients. In this paper, we investigate the biometric system and the authentication process using
periocular biometrics speciﬁcally. We integrate this approach with the healthcare system to provide an advanced
method to identify the patients securely. We propose a new technique that fuses the use of periocular biometrics
and the electronic master patient index in healthcare information systems to identify humans in the healthcare
environment. A comparative analysis of different periocular biometric recognition methods is conducted and
assessed against various traditional and deep learning-based methods in our research study.
1. Introduction
Over the past decade, biometrics has evolved into an extremely
popular ﬁeld of study. A vast amount of interest and extensive research
has led to the development of biometric data as a result. Biometrics, in
the simplest deﬁnition, is the measurement of a human being using the
physical and behavioral characteristics. It enables a human to be iden-
tiﬁed and authenticated through a set of recognizable and veriﬁable
biometric data [1], such as face, ﬁngerprint, iris, and voice data (which
are classiﬁed as physiological characteristics [2]). These biometric
identiﬁers are the distinctive, measurable characteristics that are used to
label and describe individuals [3]. Behavioral biometrics are used to
identify humans through their unique interactions with technology and
devices. In the early stage, biometric applications, and devices appear to
be consuming the entire world [4]. The global biometric market is ex-
pected to grow from 10.60 billion USD in 2016 to an estimated 41.39
billion USD by 2025, a 17.06% compound annual growth rate from 2017
to 2025 [4].
People go to hospitals and clinics, where various forms of physical
identiﬁcation are provided to a medical professional to determine the
identity of the individual seeking medical attention. In emergency
situations, where the individual is unconscious or unresponsive and
without any form of identiﬁcation, the medical professional will identify
the person as Jane Doe or John Doe until their identity is established. In
this situation, having a biometric system that can identify an individual
based on the periocular region of their face would enable medical prac-
titioners to identify the unconscious individual more rapidly. In smart-
phone technology, additional sensors and security features have been
incorporated in the device to effectively authenticate an individual. This
allows the individual to have access to their smartphone without a
password or personal identiﬁcation number (PIN).
In this research, we investigate the use of biometrics, in particular
periocular biometrics, in conjunction with healthcare information sys-
tems. (The periocular region is the facial region in close proximity to the
eyes [5].) We begin our research study by providing an overview of
biometric systems. Next, periocular biometrics is explored to give more
detailed information concerning biometrics. A deeper analysis is pro-
vided concerning how modules operate in the biometric system, with
explanations of the enrollment, identiﬁcation, and veriﬁcation processes.
The periocular region would be a suitable biometric for smartphones to
use to authenticate individuals also. The periocular biometric indicates
that it is not a biometric that is easily impersonated. Afterwards, we

provide an overview of how the healthcare information system is struc-
tured and explain how patients interact with the healthcare system.
After assessing biometric and healthcare systems, this research illus-
trates how a biometric system will capture the periocular biometrics of a
patient in the healthcare environment. The biometric information will
then be enrolled in the patient biometrics identiﬁcation system. This
information will then be connected and associated with the patient’s
enterprise master patient index (EMPI), which is a unique identiﬁer used
in the healthcare information system to identify every patient. As patients
seek additional medical treatment, the biometric systems will be used to
identify them and present their medical history, insurance information,
and any other relevant information. To the authors’ knowledge, there is
no technology in existence providing this capability to patients in the
healthcare system.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next sec-
tion, an overview of a biometric system is presented, and an analysis of
periocular biometrics is given indicating the advantages for this type of
biometrics. Section 3 discusses biometric system functionality pertaining
to the system modes and modules. It also includes the biometric system
performance in terms of True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate
(FPR), False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR). The
overview of the healthcare system is discussed in Section 4. This section
also gives the explanation of the master plan index (MPI) and the EMPI as
they relate to the Health Information Management System (HIMS). In-
formation pertaining to the patient arrival and registration process is
assessed, and the functionality of HIMS is presented in Section 4 also.
Section 5 presents the literature review which provides information
about biometrics, healthcare systems, and security concerns. Section 6
explores our proposed approach for the healthcare system with the
integration of biometrics. Lastly, Section 7 concludes with the summa-
rization of our research and provides insights for our future work.
2. Biometric Systems
Seven factors have been identiﬁed for assessing the suitability of any
trait/characteristic for biometric authentication. Four of the factors are
related to the human physiological characteristics and the remaining
three are for constructing a biometric system based on human charac-
teristics. The factors include universality, uniqueness, permanence,
measurability, performance, acceptability, and circumvention [6]. Jain
et al. explains these characteristics as follows [6]:
� Universality indicates that every person possesses the characteristic.
� Uniqueness means that the characteristic should be sufﬁciently
different to distinguish one individual from the other.
� Permanence implies that the characteristic is not varying over time.
� Measurability (or collectability) is the measurement of the trait/
characteristic should be able to be measured easily.
� Performance relates to the accuracy of the system based on opera-
tional requirements.
� Acceptability indicates the comfort individuals will have using their
biometric characteristics that are captured and assessed by the
system.
� Circumvention relates to the ease with which a characteristic might
be imitated using fraudulent means.
We assess periocular biometrics for identiﬁcation in this research. The
authors are aware of the integration of biometric features in smartphone
technology as they are used to assist with the identiﬁcation of an indi-
vidual. In the next section, an overview of periocular biometrics is
introduced.
2.1. Periocular Biometrics
Periocular biometrics is one of the most distinctive subsets of bio-
metric information of an individual and it can be used to assist with
building a robust biometric authentication system. This form of biometric
authentication system is good for desktop/laptop computers, smart-
phones, and tablets as these devices are less affected by PINs, or screen
lock patterns for authentication purposes, swipe screen, password, and
ﬁngerprint. The periocular region includes the eyes, eyelids, eyelashes,
eyebrows, irises, and tear ducts. The important aspect of the inclusion of
the periocular region in a biometric authentication system is that this
region of the human face remains almost unchanged with aging, typi-
cally. Also, human irises are unique to each individual, and the iris of the
left eye is different from the right eye of any individual. Therefore,
mimicking the iris is quite impossible for the imposter attempting to
attack the biometric-based authentication system. Some other advan-
tages of using periocular biometric information includes that it may lack
information on the iris (as sometimes prominent iris features cannot be
captured due to an uncontrolled environment) or other parts of the re-
gion under consideration and still provide the highest accurate classiﬁ-
cation during biometric authentication. As the periocular region contains
sufﬁcient sets of biometric features, the feature set extraction from the
original images becomes feasible, and the subsequent training and vali-
dation during testing becomes robust and highly accurate. Previous
research [7,8] shows that periocular biometrics can provide accurate
methods of authentication.
3. Biometric System Functionality
In the following two subsections, the discussion is centered on the
functionality of system modes and modules in the biometric system.
3.1. System Modes
There are two modes of authentication in a system where biometrics
are used for authentication. The modes are enrollment and veriﬁcation
(or authentication). In the enrollment mode, a user’s biometric infor-
mation is captured by a biometric reader and stored in a template within
the database. The stored template contains the user’s identity to enable
authentication. Once the user has been enrolled in the system, the bio-
metric information is detected by the biometric sensor and related to the
information that is stored in the database during the time of enrollment
[9]. The transactions with this information need to be executed in a
secure manner. During the veriﬁcation mode, the user’s biometric in-
formation is captured by the sensor, where a one-to-one evaluation is
conducted with the biometric template from the database to make a
determination (or veriﬁcation) of whether the user is in fact the person
who they claim [10]. In the veriﬁcation process, there are three steps that
must take place, which are [10]: 1) models, also referred to as reference
models, are created for all the users in the system and stored in a model
database; 2) some samples are matched with the reference models in
order to produce the genuine and impostor scores and to compare with
the threshold; and 3) testing process is conducted. In the veriﬁcation
mode, ‘positive recognition’ is used often, “where the aim is to prevent
multiple people from using the same identity” [2]. In the identiﬁcation
mode, the user’s biometric information is captured by the sensor; how-
ever, in contrast to the veriﬁcation mode, a one-to-many evaluation is
performed with the biometric templates from the database to establish
the identity of a user who is unknown [10]. During the evaluation, if the
system successfully identiﬁes the user based on the biometric template in
the database, where the assessment is within a previously set threshold,
then a match is found. Identiﬁcation mode can be used either for ‘positive
recognition’ (so that the user does not have to provide any information
about the template to be used) or for ‘negative recognition’ of the person
“where the system establishes whether the person is who he/she
(implicitly or explicitly) denies to be” [2]. These three modes of the
biometric system are illustrated in Fig. 1.

3.2. System Modules
There are four important mechanisms within the biometric system [9]
that are distributed through ﬁve modules. The ﬁrst module is the bio-
metric sensor, where the biometric information of a user is captured. This
is the interface between the real world and the biometric system. In our
research, we are capturing biometric information related to the user’s
periocular region. All the required pre-processing of the image is con-
ducted in the next module. The third module is the feature extractor. This
is the module where the biometric information captured by the sensor is
processed to extract feature values. This includes removing artifacts
introduced by the sensor, enhancing the input, or even conducting
normalization if necessary. The fourth module is where the matching is
conducted. The feature values are evaluated in comparison to the values
contained within the biometric template to compute a matching score.
This is a critical module, where the correct features of the periocular area
are extracted in the optimal manner. An image of speciﬁc attributes is
used to create a biometric template. The biometric template [11] is a
numeric template that is a binary representation of speciﬁc points in the
periocular region of the face. The ﬁfth module is where the decision
making occurs. This is where the user’s identity is established or a
claimed identity is accepted or rejected based on the information from
the previous module [9]. Fig. 2(a) is an illustration of how the modules
ﬂow in a biometric system.

3.3. Biometric System Performance
A biometric-based authentication system is a fundamentally complex
system and its overall system performance depends on the hardware
conﬁgurations, the software used, the tools selected, the hardware
compatibility, the behavior and response time, and external factors that
have direct impact on the input sensors connected to the system. In re-
ality, high end system performance using a biometric authentication
system is possible under controlled environments. In contrast, an un-
controlled environment adversely impacts the input sensors and reduces
the system’s performance. For example, periocular images taken in a low-
light background will reduce the matching accuracy of the test objects
during the validation process. The performance measurements of a bio-
metric system are closely tied to the FAR and FRR. Ideally, for both FAR
and FRR, the values are expected to be zero, i.e., the biometric authen-
tication system should accept all genuine users and reject all the imposter
attacks on the biometric authentication system. Also, by their very na-
ture, FAR and FRR are inversely proportional. Fig. 2(b) provides the steps
in biometric classiﬁcation for authentication.
4. Healthcare Systems
The aim of a healthcare system is to take care of the health of the
population in all possible ways considering the available resources and
competing needs. Healthcare systems are described as combining orga-
nizational and ﬁnancial work delivered to people. Concerns include
problems of access (for whom and to which services), expenses, and re-
sources. Hospitals, clinics, and all other health organizations can differ in
various environments. Healthcare systems are complex and there are
many types of operations that exist in the healthcare environment that
we need to know related to healthcare systems and their providers. An
examination of healthcare systems includes the consideration of the ways
in which a system addresses commonly held values. From a technical
perspective, indexes have been created in the information system to track
information for patients using the MPIs and EMPIs. The next section will
provide an overview of the health information management system.
4.1. Health Information Management System
In 2009, the United States Government created the American Rein-
vestment & Recovery Act (ARRA) to modernize the infrastructure of the
United States of America, which included the “Health Information
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act” [12,13].
The concept of the electronic health records (EHRs) was included in the
HITECH Act. HITECH proposed the meaningful use of interoperable
EHRs throughout the United States healthcare delivery system as a crit-
ical national goal [12]. The United States Congress decided not to deﬁne
“meaningful use” in the law, however they allowed the Department of
Health and Human Services to complete this action [14], which was done
in 2010. The concept of “meaningful use” rested on the following ﬁve
pillars [12]: 1) improving quality, safety, efﬁciency, and reducing health
disparities; 2) engage patients and families in their health; 3) improve
care coordination; 4) improve population and public health; and 5)
ensure adequate privacy and security protection for personal health
information.
It is important to understand that EHRs are more than a digitized
version of paper charts and other records that healthcare providers must
maintain for patients [14]. The implementation of EHRs creates a
reduction in the amount of paperwork that exists in the healthcare in-
dustry. Large sums of money were not invested to merely digitize patient
medical records. Policy makers view EHRs as the core of an emerging
health information technology infrastructure that will improve the na-
tion’s healthcare system and the health of Americans [14].
The HIMS functions in the role of maintaining the structure and or-
ganization of information in healthcare and for the health of the patient.
There are various components of HIMS that are responsible for different
parts of capturing information about the patient as it relates to health-
care, such as the electronic medical records (EMRs), MPI, EMPI, and
EHR. This research focuses on MPI and EMPI, which are discussed in the
following sub-sections.
4.1.1. Master Patient Index
When a person undergoes a visit to any healthcare facility, such as the
clinic, hospital, etc., to receive any form of treatment, demographic in-
formation is captured about the patient, as illustrated in Fig. 3. This in-
formation is captured in the MPI. A MPI is an index that is maintained
separately from the medical record [15]. It has two main functions,
where it ensures the registration data of a patient is clean and that
redundant records do not exist, as well as linking patient records that are
present across various Patient Registration Systems (PRS) [16]. As data is
entered in the PRS it is supplied to the MPI in real-time. Some of the
common information that is captured is as follows [17], patient infor-
mation (which includes medical record number, ﬁrst and last name,
address, phone number, social security number, etc.), visit information
(which contains location, date of the visit, account number), insurance
information, providers, and related people (such as emergency, guar-
antor, and physician contact information). The information within a MPI
is an extremely important component in the accuracy of patient infor-
mation, such as identiﬁcation of allergies, medication lists, and prior
visits [17]. According to the HIMS standard, MPI is a valuable reference
for basic demographic information and resident activity within one
source [15].
4.1.2. Enterprise Master Patient Index
Industry efforts like health information exchange (HIE) and the
Nationwide Health Information Network deﬁne EMPI as the combination
of MPIs of two or more organizations [17]. When coupled with the
beneﬁts of cloud computing, an EMPI that is continuously maintained
and updated can enhance the scalability and performance of the patient
matching engine [18]. The patient matching engine is a component of an
EMPI that can classify different database records as they are related to the
same patient, which is depicted in Fig. 3.
The functionality of the EMPI expands more than just matching pa-
tient records. Once an EMPI exists, it has the ability to synchronize PRSs,
locate history about patients outside of the EMR, prevents interfaces in
the system from creating duplicate records, as well as raise alerts when
patients are present in the hospital or healthcare facility [16].
4.2. Hospital Registration and Information Systems
Various healthcare locations have different registration processes
when a patient arrives for the ﬁrst time. When a new patient arrives at the
hospital for the ﬁrst time [19], the patient signs in by completing regis-
tration forms given by the receptionist(s) at the front desk of the
healthcenter facility where treatment is being acquired. Once the regis-
tration form is completed and submitted, the patient provides their
health insurance identiﬁcation card to the receptionist to have it copied
and have the information on it stored in the healthcare system. The front
ofﬁce veriﬁes the health insurance information of the patient on the
payer’s website. Once the veriﬁcation process is completed, the front
ofﬁce collects or mails the co-pay fees and issues the receipt of the
transaction to patient. The front ofﬁce creates a new medial chart for the
patient and then notiﬁes the back ofﬁce of a new patient arrival. This
process is presented in Fig. 4.
The focus of a hospital information system (HIS) is the integration of
various capabilities and beneﬁts. A HIS is also called the clinical data
framework, which is intended to deal with the clinical, authoritative, and
money related parts of a medical facility. Once a patient is enrolled in the
HIS, all the information of that patient goes to the HIS database, which
supplies information for the Patient Management System (PMS). A HIS
provides the ability to manage clinical information thus allowing the
professional staff to better manage appointments and billing for the

Array 8 (2020) 100042

patients [20]. All the information received by the PMS goes to the Patient
Information database, where it refreshes the electronic records of the
patients. Once an electronic record gets refreshed, the information of the
patient via the MPI in the database is refreshed simultaneously. Fig. 5
provides an illustration of how the HIS connects to the PMS.
5. Related Work
Patient records are viable for patient care, but incomplete patient
records or wrong information in a patient’s record can lead to prescribing
the wrong prescriptions and misdiagnosis. The issue of security is
oftentimes a concern when it comes to conﬁdentiality of medical

information [21]. HIMS is comprised of systems that automate the pro-
cess to collect patient information, which eliminates bulky paperwork in
hospitals and addresses the shortage of healthcare personnel [22].
Consequently, a health management system with integrated ﬁngerprint
biometrics could provide some level of security for patients and health-
care professionals, as it has been shown in Ref. [23]. Patients want to
have assurance that the privacy of their records are well kept [24]. With
the advent of Information Communication Technologies (ICT), re-
searchers are working on ways of using ICT to deliver healthcare services
at low costs. This has led to the development of the Telemedicine,
Ehealth, and Wellness (TEW) systems. Besides, the application of ICT to
remotely collect and disseminate information in a sensitive domain like
healthcare, raises a number of security related issues. Therefore, in
Ref. [25] they have investigated a number of TEW systems and have
analyzed their technologies and security implementations. Patient re-
cords that are misrepresented or not well stored have a negative conse-
quence resulting in prescribing the wrong prescriptions for patients. The
evolution of advanced technology through biometric authentication
provides security and privacy in the healthcare system.
The research in Ref. [26] implemented a HIMS, called CareMed,
which utilizes two-factor authentication practices, speciﬁcally password
and/or PIN and ﬁngerprint biometrics. The security is incorporated in the
system to secure patient health records that are contained within the
system as it is used by healthcare providers. The authors of [27] devel-
oped Gellos HMS, which is an HMS using Uniﬁed Modeling Language
(UML), Visual Basic.Net, and a Microsoft Access database. Gellos HMS
provides access to the administrator, patient registration process, the
doctor, and the nurse modules. Multi-factor authentication is incorpo-
rated into the system, where ﬁngerprint biometrics and passwords
and/or PINs are used.
In [28], the authors focused on how to preserve patient records with
biometrics identiﬁcation in health management systems. The main
functionalities of the design and implementation of the system were
achieved with UML and Visual Basic.Net. The client application provides
access to patient records implemented with Microsoft Access. A dual
authentication technique using a PIN and biometrics was utilized for the
purpose of securing the system. Unlike normal authentication processes
invoked by a user to access the network, biosensors with healthcare
applications normally need to be validated automatically, followed by
data transmission to the remote server without any explicit request.
A novel tri-factor user authentication protocol with mutual access is
proposed in Ref. [29]. In a tri-factor authentication scenario, a smart card
is physically issued to the user who ﬁrst registers to a system. Each user
possesses a smart card for later login and authentication. Integrated
Pulmonary Index (IPI) patterns are used for biometrics authentication
because body sensor networks have ability to collect IPI patterns and
transmit it to MGW (Management at Gateway) network to form ﬁnal
authentication. IPI is an index which uses information from capnography
and pulse oximetry to provide a single value that describes the patient’s
respiratory status [29]. The question was raised by the researchers, “how
can we provide an effective form of authentication that is supremely
accurate, fast, and convenient, operates on multiple devices, platforms
and software?” The best solution to these kinds of problems is the use of
biometric techniques for authentication. The authors identiﬁed there are
lots of biometric methods that have been used for authentication prac-
tices in hospitals already.
In [30], the authors reviewed the different biometric techniques used
in healthcare systems such as palm vein scanning, ﬁngerprint identiﬁ-
cation systems, proximity authentication, right patient model and bio
key. As more hospitals and healthcare systems migrate to computerized
physician order entry and electronic health records, and more HIEs are
built to coordinate care across networks, there is a great need to effec-
tively manage data integrity to ensure it is kept free from corruption,
modiﬁcation, or unauthorized access [31]. Healthcare can only be
effective if the right care is provided to the right patient, using the right
patient information [32].
The performance of combining the use of online signature and voice
biometrics in order to perform robust user authentication is analyzed in
Ref. [33]. Signatures are veriﬁed using the dynamic programming
technique of string matching. Voice is veriﬁed using a commercial off the
shelf, software development kit. In order to improve the authentication
performance, they combine information from both the online signature

and voice biometrics.
In [34], the authors propose a template protection scheme as random
rectangular hashing to strengthen the multimodal biometric system. The
performance of the proposed template protection scheme is measured
using the ﬁngerprint FVC2004 and PolyU palmprint databases. A bio-
metric system automatically recognizes the person based on his/her
physiological or behavior characteristics [35].
An understanding of the utilization, attitudes, and concerns of
healthcare consumers and providers regarding biometrics is presented in
Ref. [36]. Data was analyzed from a survey of 324 adult subjects,
including 167 healthcare consumers and 157 healthcare providers.
Healthcare providers were found more accepting of biometric technol-
ogies than consumers. Feelings about the potential uses and limitations of
biometrics were found to be more differentiated among providers than
consumers. Based on the ﬁndings, the authors suggest the need for
additional research into the types of biometrics adopted in diverse
healthcare settings and into the nature of innovators or early adopters.
Some of the practical implications were if biometrics is to gain accep-
tance, there seems to be a need for different promotion strategies for
providers and consumers. Identity is important when it is weak. The
human body lies at the heart of all strategies for identity management.
Secure identiﬁcation is critical in the healthcare system, both to control
logic access to centralized archives of digitized patients’ data, to limit
physical access to buildings and hospital wards, and to authenticate
medical and social support. There is also an increasing need to identify
patients with a high degree of certainty. Thereby, future works on bio-
metrics technology will include DNA (Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid) analysis,
neural wave analysis, and skin luminescence [37].
Biometrics has been implemented in several ﬁelds, such as smart-
phone technology from un/locking smartphones using ﬁngerprint data or
facial recognition technology, boarding ﬂights and clearing customs
using facial recognition or ﬁngerprint data. However, there are several
concerns that have been raised regarding biometrics. If someone’s bio-
metric data is compromised, it is not possible to get another one. In 2015,
5.6 million individuals’ ﬁngerprints were stolen in a massive breach from
the Ofﬁce of Personnel Management (OPM) [38]. OPM stated that [38],
“The ability to misuse ﬁngerprint data is limited. However, this proba-
bility could change over time as technology evolves.”
In [39], a conceptual framework for biometrics in healthcare is pre-
sented, which consists of four main areas, such as (1) identifying basic
elements; (2) examining important processes with special attention to the
digital signature process; (3) reviewing relevant biometrics technologies;
and (4) presenting a set of criteria and tradeoffs for evaluating the
applicability of biometrics elements.
The essential components of biometrics technologies, along with
multi-biometrics fusion for healthcare systems are presented in Ref. [40].
There are critical points in the biometric system when biometric data is
classiﬁed as a ‘high risk’. They are when the biometric data is enrolled in
the biometric system as well as when the biometric data is updated [41].
There is a possibility the data could get altered with fraudulent data. For
example, companies are producing applications that require biometric
data to access an application. A company like Wells Fargo says that it will
not store the original images of the biometric data that is used in the
authentication process, however the data will be encrypted [42]. None-
theless, there have been several instances where biometric hacking has
occurred on a large scale.
Some additional security concerns are that a biometric sensor could
be fooled and the accuracy of the sensor. If the biometric data of a bio-
metric system is compromised, it is not possible to reverse the damage
that has been done. Some vital privacy concerns are present when
considering biometrics as a form of identiﬁcation. In Refs. [43] several
privacy concerns are identiﬁed as 1) any collection of data could even-
tually get hacked; 2) biometrics may become so commonplace that
people become complacent; 3) the data stored in a biometric database
may be more vulnerable than any other kind of data; 4) some pieces of
your physical identity can be duplicated; 5) laws governing biometrics
are a work in progress, which means your rights might be different from
state to state. The researchers are aware of these security concerns and
will be taken into consideration when designing and implementing the
biometric system.
6. Proposed Periocular Authentication Module
We propose utilizing periocular biometrics to identify patients in the
hospital/healthcare information systems instead of using a physical de-
vice for identiﬁcation. The periocular biometric enables giving more
attention in biometric authentication systems. The periocular is the area
surrounding the eye. Nowadays, most mobile devices (e.g., tablets and
smartphones) have a camera, which we use to acquire periocular images
non-invasively. The periocular image is suitable when the camera is not
detailed enough for an iris acquisition. In addition to being resilient to
camera quality, the periocular biometric is not as affected by certain
factors as is the facial biometric. Such factors include facial pose, changes
in expression, and occlusion of the face. The authentication module can
be replaced and used for other biometrics including the face, ﬁngerprint,
and iris.
Biometric authentication systems incorporate classiﬁcation tech-
niques to distinguish the real person from imposters. Deep learning
techniques have played a pivotal role in biometric-based authentication
systems recently [44]. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based
method to classify the biometric data generated by the patients
enrolled in the healthcare authentication system. During the enrollment
process, biometric information from the patient is collected through
sensors and image capturing tools installed by the hospital. The enrolled
image samples will then be trained using a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) [44]. Through the use of a CNN, a pre-trained neural
network can be deployed, which can reduce the amount of training and
processing time.
This research develops a deep CNN [45] to train and test the peri-
ocular samples from the patients. Inspired by the AlexNet proposed and
implemented by Krizhevsky, A. et al. [45], we implemented a multiclass
CNN, denoted as “modiﬁed AlexNet”. We select our input image datasets
under controlled environments, for the real time enrollment, training,
testing and accuracy validation. The modiﬁed AlexNet (Fig. 6(a)) has a
total of 3 discrete convolution 2D layers, 3 Max Pooling 2D Layers, 1
Flatten layer, and 2 Dense 2D layers. We use the sigmoid function instead
of soft-max approach for faster classiﬁcation and validation. Also, we use
Binary Cross Entropy, Adam Optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01. In
Fig. 6 (b), we show the main components of the modiﬁed AlexNet. We
modiﬁed the traditional AlexNet to make the model applicable to peri-
ocular authentication. Also, the modiﬁed AlexNet works well for sparse
training data.
6.1. Enterprise Master Patient Index
Previously, in Section 4, we discussed how current information sys-
tems (HIS, MPI, etc.) operate in the healthcare environment. We are
proposing our biometric system, which uses periocular biometric infor-
mation read by the biometric sensors to identify patients. The biometric
system will retain its original functionality. The biometric modes of
enrollment, identiﬁcation, and veriﬁcation will operate as previously
discussed; see Section 4 for more information. Additional components of
our system will be placed where the biometric template that is stored in
the system database links to the patient’s index in EMPI, as seen in Fig. 7.
The EMPI will connect with the information systems to locate various
EMRs and information of the patient within the HIS. This will reduce the
amount of work for the front desk receptionist when interacting with
patients as they arrive. This will also assist nurses, doctors, medical ex-
aminers, and others in identifying patients, especially when looking up
their medical histories. Patients can be identiﬁed with their unique EMPI
from different clinical, ﬁnancial, and administrative systems. The bio-
metric information will be stored in the cloud in a database. Fig. 8

illustrates the process of how a patient’s biometric information ﬂows
through the process and is connected to their EMPI.
6.2. Architecture
In any generic architecture for health organizations, patients must
register ﬁrst to continue with system services. Our proposed architecture
is based on the scenario where a patient is not registered in the HIS. The
process begins with the patient’s periocular biometric data being
captured and stored in the cloud for the ﬁrst time using biometric tech-
nology. Fig. 9 is a depiction of the sequence of how the biometric
authentication system captures the patient’s periocular biometrics.
Next, a patient index number will be generated and associated to the
biometric data of the patient. The generated patient index becomes the
EMPI. A registered patient will allow the scanning of their periocular
biometric data by the biometric sensor technology, which will check the
associated patient index, using the EMPI, for the patient’s biometric in-
formation and records in the HIS. At this point in the process, the patient
will be able to access all of the appropriate services without wasting any
additional time for data matching. In our architecture, we include veri-
ﬁcation, identiﬁcation, and enrollment processes using the CNN archi-
tecture, which secures and matches the data. We are using these
strategies because they create a strong, robust, and secure architecture to
match periocular biometric data with the EMPI of the particular patient,

AlexNet. (ReLU: Rectiﬁer Linear Unit).

which gives high accuracy for the matching phase. In summary, the
system will serve the purpose of securely matching a patient’s periocular
biometric data to get the patient’s EMPI. Once the patient’s data is
matched, the newly registered or already registered patient will have an
appointment processed by the front desk personnel, who will pass all the
required information to the nurse. The nurse will forward all the medical
information of the patient to the doctor. After the completion of the
appointment, all the charges for lab services and the pharmacy are
updated in the HIS, which directly connects with the EMPI, as we have
shown previously. Thus, the new information is added and updated in the
patient’s record. Whenever the patient comes for the next appointment,
their periocular biometric data will be matched with the updated EMPI in
a secured manner, as shown in Fig. 10.
6.3. Results for Periocular Biometric Authentication
We implemented a prototype framework based on periocular bio-
metric data. We used the Biometric and Image Processing Lab (BIPLab)
Mobile Iris CHallenge Evaluation – Part I (MICHE-I) [46] periocular
dataset, which contains color periocular image datasets that are collected
using Apple iPhone5 and Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphones, where the
subjects are about 10 cm away from the device. The pixel resolution of
the Apple iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy S4 are of high quality.
The Apple iPhone5 has a resolution of 960 � 1280, and the Samsung
Galaxy S4 has a resolution of 1080 � 1920. For the Apple iPhone5
datasets, the images were taken from the FaceTime HD (front) camera of
1.2 megapixels (MP). For the Samsung Galaxy S4 datasets, the images
were taken from the CMOS (front) camera of 2.0 MP. The dataset

contains 75 classes of periocular image sets per person. Each class has 16
images of the same person. In total, we used 1200 images taken from the
Apple iPhone 5, and 1200 images taken from the Samsung Galaxy S4
smartphones.
This research applies the multiclass CNNs for identiﬁcation of each
individual, and their successive validation and testing. We applied the
modiﬁed AlexNet on the BIPLab MICHE-I [46] periocular dataset for
experimental evaluation. The modiﬁed AlexNet is lighter in its layer
structure and is much faster than the traditional AlexNet, as proposed in
Refs. [45]. The training pattern of the CNNs varies depending on the time
and the memory availability of the CPUs/GPUs. To conduct a realistic
experiment, we ran our CNN architecture on the BIPLab MICHE-I data-
sets [46] for multiple times, observed the performances and minute
variations, and recorded the results.
Figs. 11 and 12 are the experimental results for the classiﬁcations on
the BIPLab MICHE-I Apple iPhone 5 periocular image dataset. We ach-
ieved signiﬁcant training accuracy and validation accuracy even though
75 training classes were used. As the training goes on, the training loss
decreases, as expected, but the validation loss ﬂuctuates due to
overﬁtting. The validation loss did not go below 46.59%, where we
needed to adjust the early stopping range to a negative value to complete
the validation. After 20 iterations, we achieved a training accuracy of
88.44%, a validation accuracy of 93.33%, and a test accuracy of 88.75%.
We achieved a precision of 0.92, recall of 0.89, and the f1-score of 0.89.
Figs. 13 and 14 are the experimental results for the multiclass clas-
siﬁcations on the BIPLab MICHE-I Samsung Galaxy S4 periocular image
dataset. We achieved signiﬁcant training and validation accuracies even
though 75 training classes were used. We noticed that the training loss
decreased as expected as the training progressed, but the validation loss
ﬂuctuated again due to the overﬁtting. The validation loss did not reduce
below 46.59%, where we adjusted the early stopping range to a negative
value to complete the validation. After 20 iterations, we achieved a
training accuracy of 90.31, a validation accuracy of 93.65% before the
overﬁtting started, and a test accuracy of 88.36%. We achieved a preci-
sion of 0.93, recall of 0.88, and the f1-score of 0.89.
In the next level of our experiment, we focused on different feature
extraction techniques and compared the performances. The image-based
feature extraction can only be possible through the formation of feature

vector sets during the training and enrollment steps, and the extracted
features are matched during the recognition steps. There are several
popular image feature extractions techniques available for periocular or
face recognition [47–49]. In this research, we extracted local features,
gradient features, and texture-based features from periocular images. To
demonstrate the performance of the deep learning-based approaches and
their effectiveness with the popular feature extraction methods, we
applied three widely used feature extraction methods. Such methods

include the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) [47] for the local
object features extraction, the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG)
[48] for the gradient object detection, and the local binary pattern (LBP)
[49] for the texture-based image feature extraction. Fig. 15 shows the
feature elicitation approaches using SIFT, HOG, and LBP. Tables 1 and 2
show the comparative analysis of the approaches applied on Samsung
Galaxy S4 and Apple iPhone 5 images.
The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves show the veri-
ﬁcation performances on the iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy S4 datasets.
The ROC curve shows the performances of the TPR vs FPR for both of the
datasets, as demonstrated in Figs. 16 and 17. From Figs. 16 and 17, we
see that the modiﬁed AlexNet shows a reasonable TPR of 98% of on both
of the datasets. The ROC curves in Fig. 18 show the performance of FAR
vs FRR. The average error rates for our proposed model is in the range of
(3.2%–6.2%), as shown in Fig. 18. The test accuracy reported in this
research for the modiﬁed AlexNet was signiﬁcant, according to its deep
network architecture. The training and validation processes are reason-
ably faster than the other approaches. The modiﬁed AlexNet used opti-
mum CPU/GPU memory and efﬁciently handled high resolution color
images with precision.
From Table 1, we found that SIFT produced a test accuracy of 83%,
whereas the HOG and LBP produced the test accuracies of 80.03% and
85.01%, respectively on the Samsung Galaxy S4 periocular dataset dur-
ing the time of recognition. We also observed that the execution time of
HOG was lower than the SIFT and LBP approaches, as shown in Table 1.
Furthermore, we feed the extracted features elicited from SIFT, HOG, and
LBP to our modiﬁed AlexNet individually. We obtained classiﬁcation
accuracies of 85.21%, 82.78%, and 85.7% using the SIFT, HOG, and LBP
with the modiﬁed AlexNet, respectively. We also found that the modiﬁed
AlexNet alone received a highest accuracy of 88.36% on the Samsung
Galaxy S4 dataset. The test losses are also shown in Table 1. Modiﬁed
AlexNet achieved the lowest loss of 11.64%. We found from Table 1 that
the modiﬁed AlexNet took the lowest computation effort of 1134.071 s.
Table 2 shows the results obtained based on the Apple iPhone 5
dataset. SIFT, HOG, and LBP achieved the accuracies of 80.49%, 89.5%,
and 85%, respectively. We obtained the classiﬁcation accuracies of
87.11%, 86.52%, and 88.14% using the SIFT, HOG, and LBP, respectively
when applying with the modiﬁed AlexNet. The modiﬁed AlexNet alone
achieved an accuracy of 88.4% on the Samsung Galaxy S4 dataset.
Table 2 also represents the overall comparison of testing losses and
computational efforts. The HOG obtained the lowest testing loss of
10.5%. It is observed from Table 2 that HOG outperformed the other
approaches in terms of testing accuracy and loss; however, the modiﬁed
AlexNet took the lowest computation time of 116.837 s.

7. Conclusion & Future Work
A human can be identiﬁed through the measurements of their body.
We refer to these measurements as biometrics. The integration of bio-
metric data and the physical world offers society biometric applications
and devices.
We propose a biometric system for the healthcare environment. Our
biometric system presents a novel approach in identifying patients, both
new and registered, in healthcare information systems. This form of
biometric authentication is also very applicable for desktop/laptop
computers, smartphones, and tablets. We propose capturing the peri-
ocular biometrics of each patient with their knowledge and consent. The
periocular region is the area of the face that includes the eyes, eyelids,
eyelashes, eyebrows, and irises. Periocular biometrics are unique to each
individual. We propose linking an individual’s biometric data with their
EMPI, which is the identiﬁer used in healthcare information systems to
locate electronic healthcare records. The EMPI is unique to each patient.
Our newly introduced system will assist with protecting data and reduce
computation time relating to patients. We have conducted tests using the
BIPLab MICHE-I dataset of our proposed system implemented as a pro-
totype framework. The prototype framework utilized multiclass CNNs,
speciﬁcally, a modiﬁed version of AlexNet, to test the accuracy of iden-
tifying the patient for each periocular biometric image captured on a
smartphone; the TPR achieved approximately 98%. We also compare the
performances of the deep neural network architectures with the
traditional and widely used feature extraction approaches, including
SIFT, HOG, and LBP.
Our future work consists of investigating how to incorporate our
periocular biometrics authentication system for employees of healthcare
and hospital systems, such as doctors, nurses, physicians, and surgeons,
etc. We plan to implement the appropriate physical devices and software
to capture the periocular data. Then we plan to have volunteers between
the ages of 18–60 years assist with generating our own dataset for our
proposed system. We will continue using the modiﬁed AlexNet CNN
machine learning approach to get a better understanding of possible
implementations of our proposed biometric system. We plan to investi-
gate the appropriate mechanisms to use to integrate and incorporate the
biometric technology into the healthcare information system.
