1. Introduction 
With the development of manufacture technology towards high precision, high efficiency and high 
automation, the thermal deformation control of machine tool in process has become a key issue to ensure the 
precision of machine tool. The thermal deformation is the expansive deformation of the components of the 
machine tool caused by the heat which is produced by friction and movement in working process of machine

The machine tool is affected by many kinds of heat sources in working process and the heat is transferred 
to the machine tool by different ways. In working process, the heat resources which affect the processing 
precision can be divided in two categories, the first is internal heat resources and the other is outside heat 
resources [1, 2]. The practice shows that the internal heat resources are the main reasons which cause the 
thermal deformation, which include cutting heat and the heat which is caused by internal friction. 
In this paper, the designed spindle system of machining center mainly includes spindle, sleeve with cooling 
system, bearing and other accessories such as distance sleeve and so on, which is shown in Fig 1. The main 
heat source of spindle system is friction heat caused by spindle and bearing, the higher is the rotating speed of 
the spindle, the bigger is the thermal value and the heat dissipation mode is to bring the heat by coolant in the 
cooling system with convection heat transfer. The finite element method is used to simulate the bearing 
heating and the temperature distribution and result of thermal deformation is obtained by analyze steady state 
analysis, thus guides the design of spindle system.

2. Finite  Element Modelling and Analysis of The Spindle system 
2.1. Finite element modelling 
First, the solid model of spindle system is built by using Pro/E and the structure which has no effects on the 
analysis result such as thread hole, keyhole, chamfer, fillet and so on are simplified. Considering the high 
rotational speed of spindle, the ball in bearing can be replaced by a circular ring with constant cross section. 
Importing the simplified solid model to ANSYS, the Solid70 element of ANSYS and the free meshing 
method are adopted. The finite element model is shown as Fig 2. 
2.2. The thermal analysis of spindle system 
The emphases of thermal characteristic analysis using finite element method are the determination of heat 
source, heat transfer type and heat transfer coefficient. Because the motor of spindle of this machining center 
is far away from the spindle, the effect of motor heat on spindle can be ignored. The cutting heat is taken 
away by coolant and chip, the main heat source is the friction heat of bearing. The thermal transfer types 
needed to be considered are the forced convection heat transfer of coolant in sleeve and the forced convection 
heat transfer caused by the flow of the air around spindle. The thermal value of rolling bearing is calculated 
by the following equation:

The heat of bearing is used to treat the essential boundary in condition in the form of heat generation rate. 
The comparative analysis of spindle with cooling system and spindle without cooling system is made to 
ensure the designed spindle system satisfy the practical needs. At the room temperature, the temperature field 
distribution of spindle without coolant is shown in Fig. 3. The highest temperature appears at the front bearing 
end, because the front bearing is angular contact ball bearing and the heat is bigger, the highest temperature is 
29.84� and the biggest temperature rise is 4.84�.

Under the same condition, the temperature field distribution of spindle with coolant is shown in Fig. 4 and 
the temperature field slightly decreases comparing with the spindle system without coolant. The highest 
temperature is 27.212�, and the biggest temperature rise is 2.212� which is decreased by 2.628� 
comparing with the spindle system without coolant. The coolant has a good effect on heat dissipation of 
spindle system. 
3. Thermal-structure Coupling Analysis of The Spindle System 
The above two temperature field distribution is regarded as load and the thermal-structure coupling 
analysis of spindle system is made. The nephogram of thermal deformation of spindle system without coolant 
is shown in Fig. 5-Fig. 7, the biggest deformation in radial direction is 0.0126mm and 0.0767 in axial 
direction, the synthetic deformation is 0.771mm. The nephogram of thermal deformation of spindle system 
with coolant is shown in Fig. 8-Fig. 10, the biggest deformation in radial direction is 0.00859mm and 
0.0521mm in axial direction, the synthetic deformation is 0.0524mm. The deformation of spindle with coolant 
is smaller.

4. Experimental Validation 
The data acquisition experimental of temperature field and thermal deformation is carried to better 
understand the change of temperature field and the thermal deformation of spindle in practical situation and 
verify the reliability of analysis result. The spindle is free running on the rotational speed of 8000r/min and 
the sampling period is 5 minutes at room temperature. References are cited in the text just by square brackets

The measuring system is composed of 8 intelligent temperature sensors DS18B20, a development board 
based on 89C51 chip, serial port line and computer. The distribution of temperature sensors is shown in Fig. 
11. Generally, the more the sensors, the more the measuring system could reflect an actual situation of 
temperature field. Considering the actual structure of the spindle of the machining center, the 8 sensors are 
installed on the spindle at equal distance. The first sensor is located at the front bearing and the last sensor is 
located at the rear bearing, the sensors can reflect the change of temperature of the whole spindle. The 
temperature data obtained by the sensor DS18B20 is transferred to computer real-time by the development 
board and serial port line and the data is stored in the computer to process the data later. The data acquisition 
interface is shown in Fig. 12.

Every sensor selects 30 values of temperatures every 5 minutes. Then, the deformation in axial direction is 
measured. The biggest temperature rise appears around the front bearing which is proved to be the biggest 
heat source, as shown in Fig. 13. It is the same as the analysis result. In initial stage of experimental, 
temperature changes greatly, then the change of temperature becomes flat. The temperature of front bearing 
gets the highest temperature first and the farther from the heat source, the more slowly the temperature rises. 
The biggest error in axial direction is 0.0556mm, as shown in Fig 14, and the biggest error does not appear at 
the highest temperature but appears a period of time after reaching the highest temperature.

5. Conclusion 
In this paper, a high speed and high precision machining center is taken as the research object. The finite 
element analysis method is adopted to make the thermal analysis and the distribution of temperature field and 
the thermal deformation are predicted effectively. In the experimental, the data of temperature field and axial 
error are captured according to the actual processing situation. The results prove the reliability of the finite 
element analysis which can provide reference for design of spindle system and thermal error compensation.
