Abstract 
The state parameter and work state of Aero-engine in the whole flight envelope are change greatly. So the controller 
should deal with parameter perturbation, disturbance and the change of external condition. In this paper the neural 
network sliding mode variable structure decoupling controller based on model reference adaptive for the aero-engine is 
designed. RBF neural network is used as the output of the sliding mode control, and sliding mode switching function is 
used as the neural network input. The weight of RBF network is adjusted adaptively by the error between reference model 
output and actual output. The results of simulation show that Model Reference Adaptive Neural Sliding Mode Controller 
(MRANBSMC) has a good control effect in the whole flight envelope. It eliminates the chattering phenomenon 
effectively and decouples well, which has a good robustness and control tracking performance in the disturbance and 
parameter perturbation.

1. Introduction 
 In the actual project the controlled parameter is hoped to change along the certain desired track, which will 
made the system characteristics to be basically accordant to an ideal model and improve the control 
performance of the control system. Model reference adaptive control (MRAC) is the most extensive control

form of the follower and an effective way of control.  
MRAC has the characteristics of clear performance and simple design method. The original adaptive 
model tracking control is designed either based on Lyapunov stability theory or the conception of hyper-
stability to cope with the system parameter change or external disturbance. The two methods can ensure the 
error to be zero in finite time, but the common weakness of which is they can’t quantitative design the 
transient performance of error. To solve this problem, variable structure control has been highly thought of by 
its good transient performance and resistance to a wide range of parameters change ability. Since the 70s 
extensive research has been conducted on tracking model based with this method [1]. 
This paper proposes a combination of neural network and sliding mode control (SMC) is to control the 
aero-engine based on MRAC theory. SMC system includes reachable stage and sliding stage [2][3]. And only 
at sliding stage the system has robust to parameter perturbation and external interference. So the NN SMC 
scheme enable the system to be at sliding mode at began and keep it, and therefore eliminate the reachable 
stage. At the same time the NN can compensate the sliding mode switch control by introducing neuron control. 
When there is disturbance or parameter perturbation, the deviate state trajectory can automatic convergence to 
the sliding surface. The controller not only keeps the system to be robust under perturbation and external 
disturbance, but also to deceases or eliminates the chattering.  
2. Design of  MRANBSMC 
2.1. Structure of controller 
The switching function is taken as the input of RBF NN and sliding mode variable structure controller is 
taken as the output of RBFNN [4][5]. The error between the output of reference model and real engine output 
is corrected by using the learning functions of neural network so that the aero-engine can track the reference 
model and turbofan decoupling control is obtained.

2.4. Structure of reference model 
In the variable structure sliding mode control system the design reference model should satisfy two 
conditions[6]: 
reference model should reflect desired control performance index, 
it should meet 
completely tracking model match condition (8).Double variable control system is studied, which will cause 
coupling effect. So the reference should be decoupling system. In this paper the proper reference model that 
confine with performance index, is gained through state feedback decoupling and pole assignment for the 
engine model.  
A certain type of turbofan engine mathematical model is [7].

3. The simulation result and analysis 
In order to control multiple point control model of each region in the whole flight envelope of certain 
turbofan, we design reference model for every aero-engine mathematical model at the nominal point in each 
region. So all control system for different point in each region can track their respective reference model.       
The chosen three points are (0,0),(2,1.4),(17.3,1.82).In the simulation the initial state is

As is seen in fig.3, fig.4 and fig.5, when altitude and Mach number are (0,0),(2,1.4),(17.3,1.82) 
respectively, step response curve of control system has no overshoot. When input is [1,0],adjusting time is 
about 2s , When input is[0,1],adjusting time is about 1.2s,and the steady state error is zero. It is also shown 
that there is no chattering in the control of MRANBSMC.   
4. Conclusion 
The Model Reference Adaptive Neural Sliding Mode Controller can decouple very well for the engine 
low-pressure rotor and turbine rear total temperature. And when disturbance and parameter perturbation exist, 
the response curve of control system does not obviously change. Nominal point and non nominal point of the 
same region in the whole envelope will get good results. This result proves that the control system has strong 
anti-jamming capacity, robustness and fairly good accuracy in its static and dynamic control. The controller 
enhances robustness of the control system, avoids the chattering in sliding-mode control, and improves the 
tracking converge.
