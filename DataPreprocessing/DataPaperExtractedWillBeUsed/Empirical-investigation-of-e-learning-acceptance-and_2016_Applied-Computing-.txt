Abstract
E-learning has become progressively more vital for academia and
corporate training and has potentially become one of the most signiﬁcant
developments and applications in Information Technologies (ITs). This study
used a quantitative approach seeking a causative explanation of the decision
behavior of individuals toward the acceptance and assimilation of e-learning in
academic settings. A survey of 286 participants (students) was conducted to col-
lect the research data. Our study framework was based on the third version of the
Technology Acceptance Model (i.e., TAM3) and the data were analyzed using
structural equation modeling in order to determine the factors that inﬂuence
the learners’ intention to use e-learning. Results show the predicting (promot-
ing/inhibiting) factors of e-learning technology acceptance, while also examining
some related post-implementation interventions expected to contribute to the
acceptance and assimilation of e-learning systems. Our results also indicate that
TAM3 holds well in the Arabian culture and also outline valuable outcomes such
as: managerial interventions and controls for better organizational e-learning
management that can lead to greater acceptance and effective utilization. Hope-
fully, this study provides a roadmap to more understanding of the success factors

1. Introduction
The Internet and networks, as the backbone for modern communications, trans-
formed our world into ubiquitous connectivity; that is, anytime, anywhere, access
is always available to the digital network and digital services. The evolution (and
revolution) in information and communications technologies (ICT), that recently
fueled remarkable economic and social changes, will only pick up the pace as we
apply managerial interventions and controls for better ICT acceptance and
assimilation.
The Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC) in
Saudi Arabia has launched a longitudinal study which asserts that Internet pene-
tration is relatively high among educational institutions, as 75% of them are being
connected to the internet [16]. However, a striking ﬁnding of the study, declares
that only 39% of university/college students are able to access the Internet by
2007 and that e-learning is also not very popular among the educational
institutions in Saudi Arabia.
Technology-assisted learning via ICT (or e-learning) has become progressively
more vital for academia and corporate training. Furthermore, e-learning has
potentially become one of the most signiﬁcant developments in ICTs [46].
Motivated by such compelling advantages as: geographical reach, learner control
(in terms of ﬂexibility and convenience), and cost effectiveness in course delivery
and management, educational institutions and professional organizations are
embracing e-learning by implementing an expanding array of technology-
enabled platforms [27].
Recently, Saudi Arabia has called for a national plan to adopt IT spanning the
country. The plan strongly recommends the implementation of e-learning and
distance learning, and their prospective applications, in higher education. In a
major transformation of conventional education, the Saudi Ministry of Higher
Education has recently launched the National Centre of E-learning & Distance
Learning, set up a repository to organize the change, and prepare e-learning mate-
rials to help universities adopt the system and transform to a scheme of e-learning
quickly [39].
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM3) by Venkatesh and Bala [44] provides
valuable rational explanations into how and why individuals make a decision
about the adoption and use of ITs, particularly the work on the determinants of
perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Moreover, TAM3 enlightens
managers to make informed decisions about interventions that can be in charge

of greater acceptance and effective utilization of ITs. This study draws heavily on
the seminal work of Venkatesh and Bala [44] and Baker et al. [9] due to their
interrelated nature dealing with IT acceptance and adoption testing as a common
thematic issue. More speciﬁcally, Venkatesh and Bala [44] provide TAM3 as a
theoretical base model while Baker et al. [9] provide the quasi replication and
testing approach of a theoretical model in a different culture.
This study sets out an empirical research for investigating e-learning acceptance
and assimilation in Saudi Arabia as having a unique culture that is different from
the Western culture where TAM originated. The fundamental contribution of this
study is to exploit TAM3 to predict technology acceptance of e-learning in Saudi
Arabia as a developing country, in addition to inquiring for some related post-
implementation interventions that might contribute to the acceptance and assim-
ilation of e-learning systems in developing countries. The speciﬁc objectives of this
study are: (i) to develop a customized Technology Acceptance Model using TAM3
for the determinants of the acceptance and assimilation of e-learning; (ii) to
employ survey research to test the customized e-learning model per se; and (iii)
to outline outcomes of the study, such as, the antecedents of e-learning technology
acceptance and managerial interventions and control for better organizational
e-learning management. It is hoped that this project provides a roadmap to a bet-
ter understanding of the success factors and post-implementation interventions
contributing to the acceptance and assimilation of e-learning systems in develop-
ing countries in general.
1.1. Related work
Mirza and Al-Abdulkareem [30] reviewed the current situation of e-learning in the
Middle East (ME). They presented drivers and barriers to e-learning, the different
types of e-learning initiatives, steps being taken toward overcoming the challenges,
and a possible future of e-learning through a case study of ongoing developments
of e-learning in Saudi Arabia. Educational organizations in the ME are varying in
their engagement in e-learning as some are pioneering while the majority are pro-
gressing visa-vis those that are still laggards.
To provide more insight into how to promote e-learning acceptance among
students in Saudi Arabia, Al-Harbi [7] investigated the factors that inﬂuence
e-learning by analyzing the perceptions and attitudes of Saudi university students
using a survey conducted to investigate the acceptance of e-learning as perceived
by students. Al-Harbi used a combined factor model of the original TAM and the
Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) [3] to explain signiﬁcant perceptional and
attitudinal
factors
related
to
the
acceptance
of
e-learning.
The
ﬁndings
demonstrated that attitudes toward e-learning, subjective norms, perceived

control

were
critical
determinants of students’ behavioral intention to use e-learning.
Empirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation
29
Advanced technologies facilitating a new environment of higher education
e-learning have been investigated in Saudi Arabia such as the adoption of smart
phones and tablets which is known as mobile learning or m-learning [13,32,37].
These studies report prevailing of these technologies to some extent indicating that
the acceptance and adoption level of m-learning is on rise as the majority of stu-
dents express positive attitudes toward m-learning due to the ﬂexibility of learning
methods and timings, and improved communication among learners. However,
Chanchary and Islam [13] pointed out that there are many more challenges still
to overcome like giving proper training to students (a type of intervention as
per TAM3) so they can have a sense of security in the new environment in an
attempt to take full advantage of e-learning.
Jordan is a good example of developing countries in the ME, exemplifying an
IT hub for the region, ﬁrst introduced e-learning in the Arab Open University
in 2002 [1]. Abbad et al. [1] and Al-Adwan et al. [4] explored students’ acceptance
of e-learning in Jordanian universities using the original TAM. Their ﬁndings,
respectively, indicated that students’ beliefs about usefulness and ease of use
partially mediate the relationships between external factors (subjective norms,
internet experience, system characteristics, self-efﬁcacy, and technical support)
and intention to use and actual use of e-learning systems; and that intention to
use e-learning systems is only predicted by perceived usefulness as students’
attitude did not signiﬁcantly affect intention to use e-learning, while perceived ease
of use was found to signiﬁcantly predict both usefulness and attitude toward
e-learning.
Lately, Singh and Hardaker [38] conducted a broad search of the literature (for
more than 300 articles) regarding barriers and enablers to the adoption and diffu-
sion of e-learning that were analyzed as three main categories: (1) macro-level
studies investigating the higher education context of e-learning, (2) micro-level
studies probing on individual and social factors, and (3) studies probing on
management issues of the adoption and diffusion of technological innovations.
Fortunately, our study seeks an empirical investigation of e-learning acceptance
and assimilation using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM3) as a frame-
work covering the second and third categories suggested by Singh and Hardaker
beforehand.
1.2. Theories of technology acceptance – Technology Acceptance Model 3
The original TAM [19,20] proposed that two belief constructs, perceived useful-
ness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU), are primary determinants of an
individual’s behavioral intention (BI) to use an IT. BI was theorized as the pri-
mary predictor of actual usage behavior. There were successive developments of
TAM: TAM2, UTAUT, and ﬁnally TAM3. Fortunately, the original TAM,
TAM2 and UTAUT were tested in the Arabian context and showed to hold very
well [5,9,6], respectively).
30
S.S. Al-Gahtani
In this study, following Baker et al. [9], TAM3 is tested in the context of Saudi
Arabia,
a
technologically-developing
Arab
nation.
Since
the
Technology
Acceptance Model is built on the foundation of an individual’s beliefs, it is
rational to expect that the application of any given Technology Acceptance Model
in the two different cultural contexts could produce different results [9]. It is hoped
that the ﬁndings of this study shall help to improve our understanding about the
antecedents of e-learning technology acceptance and assimilation in Saudi Arabia,
thereby providing us an opportunity to reﬁne the model to suit this country’s
unique cultural context and offering a path to investigate technology adoption
characteristics in other developing countries [5,9]. This paper was part of a scien-
tiﬁc project which evolved over more than 3 years since 2010. The agenda for this
project was summarized and published in the second international conference of
e-learning and distance education by the ministry of higher education in Saudi
Arabia [22].
1.3. Technology Acceptance Model 3 – TAM3
The most recent and comprehensive developments of TAM are manifested in
TAM3. Venkatesh and Bala [44] synthesized prior research on TAM and devel-
oped a theoretical framework that represents the cumulative body of knowledge
from TAM research that accumulated over the years, that results in four different
types of determinants of PU and PEOU – individual differences, system
characteristics, social inﬂuence, and facilitating conditions. According to Venkatesh
and Bala [44], ‘‘individual difference variables include personality and/or demo-
graphics (e.g., traits or states of individuals, gender, and age) that can inﬂuence
individuals’ perceptions of PU and PEOU’’, while, ‘‘system characteristics are
those salient features of a system that can help individuals develop favorable (or
unfavorable) perceptions regarding the usefulness or ease of use of a system’’,
whereas, ‘‘social inﬂuence captures various social processes and mechanisms that
guide individuals to formulate perceptions of various aspects of an IT’’, ﬁnally,
‘‘facilitating conditions represent organizational support that facilitates the use
of an IT’’ (p. 276). In summary, Venkatesh and Bala [44] combined TAM2 [42]
and the model of the determinants of PEOU [41], and developed an integrated
model of technology acceptance which they called: TAM3. TAM3 presents a com-
prehensive nomological network of the determinants of individuals’ IT adoption
and use, as shown in Fig. 1.
In the context of IT adoption and use, social inﬂuence processes (i.e., compli-
ance, identiﬁcation, and internalization) represent how important referents believe
about the instrumental beneﬁts of using a system [42]. Prior individual informa-
tion and perceptions – about how easy a system is to use from important referents
– are unlikely to be stable as individuals need to form these stable perceptions
based on their own general computer beliefs and hands-on experience with the sys-
tem [21]. In TAM3, three constructs – subjective norms (SN), image (IMG), and

31
voluntariness (VOL) – capture the social inﬂuence processes on perceived useful-
ness [44].
However, according to Venkatesh and Bala [44], the inﬂuence of cognitive
instrumental processes on perceived usefulness is captured by four constructs:

job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, and perceived ease of use.
‘‘The core theoretical argument underlying the role of cognitive instrumental pro-
cesses is that individuals form perceived usefulness judgment in part by cognitively
comparing what a system is capable of doing with what they need to get done in
their job’’ [42, p. 190]. TAM3 theorizes that job relevance and result demonstra-
bility directly affect perceived usefulness while output quality operates as a
moderator of the relationship of job relevance with perceived usefulness. Table 1
presents the constructs deﬁnitions of social inﬂuence processes followed by the
cognitive instrumental processes.
Four anchors were suggested by TAM3: ‘‘computer self-efﬁcacy, computer
anxiety, computer playfulness, and perceptions of external control (or facilitating
conditions). The ﬁrst three of these anchors represent individual differences (are)
general beliefs associated with computers and computer use. Computer self-
efﬁcacy refers to individuals’ control beliefs regarding his or her personal ability
to use a system. Perceptions of external control are related to individuals’ control
beliefs regarding the availability of organizational resources and support structure
to facilitate the use of a system. Computer playfulness represents the intrinsic
motivation associated with using any new system’’ [44, p. 278]. Notably, Venkatesh
and Bala [44] also suggested that ‘‘while anchors drive initial judgments of per-
ceived ease of use, individuals will adjust these judgments after they gain direct
hands-on experience with the new system’’ (p. 278).
Perceived enjoyment and objective usability were – two system characteristic-
related adjustments – suggested by Venkatesh and Bala [44] to be included in
TAM3 as determinants of perceived ease of use with enduring effects even after
individuals gain experience with the new system. Following Venkatesh [41],
Venkatesh and Bala [44] theorized that, in TAM3, the role of two anchors –
computer self-efﬁcacy and perceptions of external control – will continue to be

strong despite user’s gaining more experience with the system, in contrary, with
the effects of the other two anchors – computer playfulness and computer anxiety
– which were theorized to diminish over time. Moreover, TAM3 theorized that
with more hands-on experience with the system, the effects of adjustments –
perceived enjoyment and objective usability – on perceived ease of use were
escalating. The constructs deﬁnitions of anchors and adjustments are shown in
Table 2.
TAM received special attention from prominent scholars in the IS ﬁeld. The
Journal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS) devoted a special crit-
ical issue (volume 8, issue 4, April 2007) about TAM ‘‘Quo Vadis TAM – Issues
and Reﬂections on Technology Acceptance Model’’ [26]. The scholars’ reviews
varied dramatically from ‘‘TAM is a blessing and indisputable’’ on one end to
‘‘TAM is a curse’’ on the other end. TAM3 was ﬁrst developed and published
in May 2008 which resolved a number of shortcomings with the TAM model.
Viswanath Venkatesh, Fred Davis (as the innovator of TAM), and Mike Morris
commentary on the JAIS special issue was ‘‘We conclude that there has been excel-
lent progress in technology adoption research. However, as a next step, we call for
research focused on interventions, contingencies, and alternative theoretical per-
spectives (to the largely social psychology-based technology adoption research’’
[43, p. 267]. Hence, TAM3 came as a response to the JAIS special issue to focus
on interventions, and therefore, we believe that TAM3 is a sound theoretical
framework to investigate the factors affecting individual acceptance and assimila-
tion of e-learning in various settings which is much more developed than previous
editions of TAM. Several previous studies (e.g., [4,7,1,36] used old versions of
TAM as a framework to study e-learning from different perspectives. Moreover,
this study – to the best of our knowledge – is the ﬁrst one to use the latest version
of TAM (i.e., TAM3) as a framework to study e-learning.

2. Research model and hypotheses
TAM3 is the most recent reformulation of TAM as reﬂected in the seminal work
published by Venkatesh and Bala [44]. The nomological network of TAM3 as per
Fig. 1 reveals that both social inﬂuence processes (subjective norm (SN), volun-
tariness (VOL) and image (IMG)) and cognitive instrumental processes (job rele-
vance (REL), output quality (OQ), result demonstrability (RES), and perceived
ease of use (PEOU)), establish the determinants of perceived usefulness (PU).
The anchors (computer self-efﬁcacy (CSE), perceptions of external control
(PEC), computer anxiety (CANX), and computer playfulness (CPLY)), and the
adjustments (perceived enjoyment (ENJ) and objective usability (OU)) establish
the determinants of perceived ease of use (PEOU). PU, PEOU, and subjective
norm (SN) determine behavioral intentions (BI) to use an IT. Ultimately, BI deter-
mines IT usage behavior. Venkatesh and Bala [44] reported that TAM3 accounted
for 52–67% of the variance in usefulness perceptions, 43–52% of the variance in
ease of use perceptions and 40–53% of the variance in usage intentions.
However, this study research model differs from TAM3 in three basic aspects.
Firstly, in this study, our survey data on the model constructs were collected at a
single point in time, as opposed to a longitudinal methodology (i.e., collecting
several measurements over time). Our focus is on how well the social inﬂuence
processes, the cognitive instrumental processes, the anchors and the adjustments
predict e-learning technology acceptance, in particular the implicit cultural effects
on these processes and factors which affect technology acceptance and assimila-
tion. Secondly, the usage construct of TAM3 model was excluded, because we
intend to collect cross-sectional data at a single time point, instead of longitudi-
nally, the choice to measure technology acceptance with intention is appropriate,
since measuring usage would require assessments of people’s beliefs and attitudes
in a preceding period. Thus, the use of intention is appropriate for our study and
allows us to measure acceptance and beliefs contemporaneously [2].
Objective Usability (OU) used to be operationalized consistent with the key-
stroke model from human–computer interaction (HCI) research and prior user
acceptance research [41]. The suggested guideline for operationalizing this con-
struct is to compute a novice-to-expert ratio of effort. Speciﬁcally, the time taken
by an expert to perform a set of tasks using the system in an error-free situation is
compared with the time taken by a novice (subject) [41]. Accordingly, a set of
e-learning tasks should be assigned and completed by the respondents (students).
The time taken by each individual student to complete the tasks should be
recorded by the Learning Management System (LMS), which will be compared
later to the time taken by an expert to arrive at a ratio that would serve as the mea-
sure of OU for the particular subject (student). The higher the OU estimate
(student-to-expert ratio), the harder the system is to use from an objective
standpoint [41]. Unfortunately, the LMS technology used in our university
(Blackboard) does not support the keystroke model to measure OU. Therefore,
Empirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation
35
this construct was dropped from the research model which reﬂects the third differ-
ence of this study from TAM3.
In view of that, the current research main hypotheses are as follows:
H1: The original TAM will hold well in the Saudi Arabian environment.
H2: The extended TAM (TAM3) will hold well but differently from Western
cultures (i.e., the culture where TAM3 originated).
H3(a): The social inﬂuence process variable (SN) will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
behavioral intention (BI) to use the e-learning system,
H3(b): The social inﬂuence process variables (SN and IMG) will signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence perceived usefulness (PU) of the e-learning system,
H3(c): The social inﬂuence process variable (IMG) will mediate the inﬂuence of
subjective norm (SN) on perceived usefulness (PU) of the e-learning system,
H3(d): The social inﬂuence process variable (VOL) will signiﬁcantly moderate
the inﬂuence of SN on behavioral intention (BI) to use the e-learning system,
H4(a): The cognitive instrumental process variables (REL, RES, and PEOU)
will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence perceived usefulness (PU) of e-learning system,
H4(b): The cognitive instrumental process variable (OQ) will signiﬁcantly mod-
erate the inﬂuence of JREL on perceived usefulness (PU) of the e-learning
system,
H5: The four anchor variables (CSE, PEC, CANX, and CPLY) will signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence perceived ease of use (PEOU) of the e-learning system,
H6: The adjustment variable (ENJ) will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence perceived ease of
use (PEOU) of the e-learning system,
H7: Experience (EXP) as a moderator in TAM3 will signiﬁcantly moderate the
seven intended paths as shown in Fig. 1.
3. Research methodology
3.1. Sampling procedure
A ‘‘convenience sample’’ amalgamated with ‘‘quota sample’’ was thought to be the
most appropriate sampling procedure for this study. Convenience sampling was
deemed appropriate by the virtue of the researcher’s accessibility to the respon-
dents while quota sampling was considered appropriate in terms of achieving rel-
ative proportions of respondents in different categories such as gender, course
major, and study level [12]. Six sites, (three male colleges: Science, Business, and
Engineering, and three female colleges: Science, Arts and Literature, and Girls’
Study Center), as subsidiaries of a large Saudi Arabian university in the southern
region, were chosen according to this sampling procedure for data collection.
These sites were mature in e-learning experience and provided with high speed
internet connectivity. To achieve this goal, the data collection method thought
to be most appropriate was a survey questionnaire. Newsted et al. [33] argue that
36
S.S. Al-Gahtani
surveys are among the more popular methods used by the information systems
(IS) research community.
3.2. Structural Equation Modeling approach
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques are a second-generation multi-
variate technique [24] that has been widely used for instrument validation and
model testing in research in the ﬁeld of marketing and organizational behavior.
The SEM technique has also been introduced to MIS and started gaining popular-
ity among researchers in the ﬁeld who have adopted this approach in several stud-
ies recently reported in the literature. Conceptually and practically, SEM is similar
to using Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA). However, causal models developed
following the SEM approach are superior to MRA in many ways. As this study
seeks a causative explanation of the decision behavior of individuals toward the
acceptance and assimilation of e-learning, SEM came in front of other potential
approaches to achieve this purpose. Chau et al. [14] reported that Bagozzi [8] enu-
merated the advantages that causal models developed using the SEM approach
possesses, such as: ‘‘(1) they make the assumptions, constructs, and hypothesized
relationships in a researcher’s theory explicit; (2) they add a degree of precision to
a researcher’s theory, since they require clear deﬁnitions of constructs, opera-
tionalizations, and the functional relationships between constructs; (3) they permit
a more complete representation of complex theories; and (4) they provide a formal
framework for constructing and testing both theories and measures’’ [14, p. 314].
The most widely used statistical software packages that adopt the SEM
approach include LISREL and PLS. Although they are both SEM based, they
are quite different in their estimation approaches and objectives. The primary
measures used in LISREL are overall goodness-of-ﬁt measures that assess how
well the hypothesized model ﬁts the observed data. Hence, the analysis is
‘‘theory-oriented, and emphasizes the transition from exploratory to conﬁrmatory
analysis’’ [29, p. 270]. PLS-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is
based on least squares estimation with the primary objective being to maximize
the explanation of variance in the dependent constructs of a structural equation
model. PLS is essentially targeted for causal-predictive analysis as PLS is more
appropriate to analyze highly complex causal models with low theoretical substan-
tiation for the purpose to maximize the determinants’ predictive power toward the
dependent construct.
In summary, the researcher decided to use PLS-SEM to analyze this study data
for several reasons:
1) PLS-SEM is, as the name implies, a more ‘‘regression-based’’ approach that
minimizes the residual variances of the endogenous constructs [25].
Empirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation
37
2) Indeed, TAM3 is relatively a new theoretical model developed by Venkatesh
and Bala [44] that presently undergoes empirical test in the Arabian culture.
Because of its prediction orientation, PLS-SEM is, thus, the preferred
method when the research objective is theory development and prediction
[25].
3) PLS-SEM can be a powerful method of analysis because of the minimal
demands on measurement scales, sample size, and residual distributions
[15]. In fact, our study sample size is comparatively small with skewed vari-
ables indicating that it is not normally distributed.
4) Hair et al. [25] conclude that PLS-SEM path modeling, if appropriately
applied, is indeed a ‘‘silver bullet’’ for estimating causal models in many the-
oretical models and empirical data situations.
3.3. Research instruments
All the survey items used to operationalize the constructs investigated in our
research model were adapted for this study from Venkatesh and Bala [44].
However, these scales were originally developed and tested in the English lan-
guage, and therefore developed in a different environment and culture. To adapt
them for the current research in Arabic, the Brislin [11] back translation method
was used. The items were translated back and forth between English and Arabic
by two teams of bilingual professors. The process was repeated until both versions
converged. The Arabic version instruments that emerged were subject to two
Arabic judges to make sure that the instruments are suitable for application for
the present research project.
4. Data analysis
4.1. Sample analysis
Six hundred copies of a ﬁve page questionnaire were distributed among the tar-
geted six colleges. The returned and usable responses were 286, thus achieving a
response rate of 47.67%. Table 3 shows the sample distribution by gender and
study major.
5. Results
Following Baker et al. [9], the research model shown in Fig. 1 was analyzed using
SmartPLS 2.0, a Partial Least Squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM)
software tool Ringle et al. [35]. One of the essential features of SmartPLS is the
simultaneous assessment of the psychometric properties of the measurement model
(i.e., the reliability and validity of the scales used to measure the model variables),
as well as the estimation of the parameters of the structural model (i.e., the strength
38
S.S. Al-Gahtani
of the path relationships among the model variables). The subsequent paragraphs
present the analysis results of the psychometric properties of the measurement
model and the estimation of the parameters of the structural model.
5.1. The measurement model
The measurement model testing results revealed a strong evidence of the robust-
ness of the constructs’ measures denoted by their internal consistency reliabilities
as manifested by their composite reliabilities presented in Table 4. The range of the
composite reliabilities of the measures was 0.70–0.91. Almost all of these reliability
indices properly exceed the threshold of 0.70 recommended by Nunnally [34].
Additionally, the average variance extracted (AVE) for each measure far exceeds
the lower bound threshold value of 0.50 recommended by Fornell and Larcker
[24], as the AVEs for the measurement constructs ranged from 0.763 to 0.919.
Smart PLS generates the convergent validity tests of the scales by extracting the
factor loadings and cross loadings of all items (indicators) to their own respective
constructs. Table 5 presents these results indicating that all items (after dropping
two items: CSE1 and ENJ3): (1) loaded on their own particular constructs from a
lower bound of 0.700 to an upper bound of 0.909 (the bolded factor loadings), and

(2) loaded more highly on their own particular construct than on any other
construct (the non-bolded factor loadings). According to Yoo and Alavi [40], a
common rule of thumb to indicate convergent validity is that all items should load
greater than 0.7 on their own construct, and should load more highly on their own
respective construct than on the other constructs. Moreover, our measurement
analysis shows that each item’s factor loading on its respective construct was
highly signiﬁcant (p < 0.001). Table 4 presents the loadings conﬁrming the con-
vergent validity of the measures for the research model latent constructs.
5.2. The structural model
The results of the structural model are presented in Fig. 1. The direct inﬂuence of
each exogenous construct on the endogenous construct is indicated by the beta
value of the path coefﬁcient presented numerically on the solid arrow leading from
the exogenous construct to the endogenous construct with asterisk(s) of the signif-
icance level. Those insigniﬁcant relationships are presented in dotted arrows. The
following is a summary of the signiﬁcant connections between the factors of our
study. The current research ﬁndings conﬁrm that BI (as the primary dependent
factor) is predicted by three factors: PU, PEOU and SN whereas PEOU is signif-
icantly moderated by experience while SN is signiﬁcantly moderated by both expe-
rience and voluntariness. PU is predicted by PEOU, SN, Image, and job relevance
whereas PEOU and SN are signiﬁcantly moderated by experience while job rele-
vance is signiﬁcantly moderated by output quality. Finally, PEOU is predicted
by computer self-efﬁcacy, perceptions of external control, computer anxiety, and
perceived enjoyment with the latter signiﬁcantly moderated by experience. Details
are found in the discussion and implications section. Fig. 1 also presents the vari-
ance explained (R2) in each of the four endogenous constructs by their predictors.
6. Discussion and implications
In interpreting the results presented in Fig. 1, this study draws on the guidelines
provided by Chin et al. [15]. The results of the direct and moderator effects and
post-implementation interventions are discussed subsequently.
6.1. Direct effects
All of the direct relationships between the core constructs of the original TAM
exhibited strong positive effects. More speciﬁcally, perceived ease of use (PEOU)
attained a strong positive direct inﬂuence on PU (beta = 0.206, p < 0.001). In
addition, PEOU simultaneously showed a strong direct effect on behavioral
intention (BI) (beta = 0.252, p < 0.001). PU achieved a strong positive direct
inﬂuence on BI (beta = 0.374, p < 0.001). These results strongly indicate that
the original TAM holds very well in the Arabian culture. Hence, H1 is supported.
Empirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation

Additionally, our ﬁnding related to the PU strong impact on BI supports similar
ﬁndings by Al-Adwan et al. [4].
All social inﬂuence process variables and all cognitive instrumental process
variables (except result demonstrability) exhibited signiﬁcant relationships as
determinants of perceived usefulness. Also, all anchor variables (except CPLY)
and computer enjoyment as the single adjustment variable exhibited signiﬁcant
relationships as determinants of perceived ease of use. Besides that, experience
exhibited ﬁve out of seven signiﬁcant moderating relationships speciﬁed in
TAM3. Furthermore, by comparing the variance explained (R2) in this study vs.
TAM3: BI (0.420/0.400), PU (0.424/0.520), and PEOU (0.450/0.440), respectively,
one can conclude that they are similar with regard to BI and PEOU but different
in PU. As a result, TAM3 holds well in the Arabian context but somehow differ-
ently from Western cultures (i.e., the culture where TAM3 originated).
The main dependent variable in this study is behavioral intentions (BI) of stu-
dents to accept and use an e-learning system which solely predict and determine
actual system usage and, consequently, the success of new ITs, as per TAM3.
However, rather than PU which exhibits the strongest inﬂuence on BI in Western
culture, this study reports that subjective norm (SN) exhibits the strongest inﬂu-
ence on BI (beta = 0.349, p < 0.001 compared to the insigniﬁcant SN ﬁ BI rela-
tionship in (TAM3: Venkatesh and Bala [44]). Indeed our ﬁnding conﬁrms a
pronounced effect of SN on BI in Saudi Arabia, a ﬁnding which is not usually
observed in Western contexts. This adds further evidence and supports the impor-
tant role of SN reported by Al-Harbi [7]. Therefore, H2 is supported.
Social inﬂuence captures various social processes and mechanisms that guide
individuals to formulate perceptions of various aspects of an IT. Social inﬂuence
processes (SN, IMG, VOL) proved to signiﬁcantly affect perceived usefulness both
direct (SN ﬁ PU = 0.349, p < 0.001 and IMG ﬁ PU = 0.133, p < 0.001) and
moderating relationships (by EXP and VOL) besides SN to signiﬁcantly affect
BI both direct (SN ﬁ BI = 0.349, p < 0.001) and moderating relationships (by
EXP and VOL) to be explained below. Additionally, SN ﬁ IMG relationship is
signiﬁcant (SN ﬁ IMG = 0.435, p < 0.001). Therefore, H3(a), H3(b), H3(c) are
fully supported.
TAM2 postulates that three social inﬂuence mechanisms – compliance, identi-
ﬁcation, and internalization – will play a role in understanding the social inﬂuence
processes [42]. These three mechanisms can be brieﬂy interpreted in the context of
IT adoption and use such that: compliance: represents a situation in which an indi-
vidual adopts and uses an IT in order to attain certain rewards or avoids punish-
ment; whereas identiﬁcation refers to an individual’s belief that adopting and using
an IT will elevate his or her social status within a referent group because important
referents believe s/he should do so; however, internalization is deﬁned as the incor-
poration of a referent’s belief into one’s own belief structure. This would ensure
the adherence to the compliance and identiﬁcation of the social inﬂuence
42
S.S. Al-Gahtani
mechanisms. However, the internalization mechanism will be manifested as a
result of continuous adherence of individuals to the compliance and identiﬁcation
mechanisms as it is expected that with time the incorporation of important refer-
ent’s belief into one’s own belief structure will take place.
We believe that underpinning the notion of IT acceptance and assimilation onto
these three social inﬂuence mechanisms in the bounds of Saudi Arabia’s cultural
context with the pervasiveness of the Saudi hierarchical conforming society in
the workplace [10] would open a new outlook in this issue. Accordingly, we con-
tend that Saudi individuals would show a high regard for authority and would
conform to the expectations of those elites/managers who occupy senior roles in
the organizational hierarchy while embracing IT take-up tendency, would lead
to IT acceptance and assimilation. This perspective is ‘‘especially true in light of
the heavy promotion of technology adoption through governmental policy and
where there are typically more rigid cultural and organizational structures of
authority between managers and subordinates’’ [9, p. 49].
In TAM3, four constructs – job relevance, output quality, result demonstrabil-
ity, and perceived ease of use – capture the inﬂuence of cognitive instrumental pro-
cesses on perceived usefulness. This study proved that two cognitive instrumental
processes (REL and PEOU) signiﬁcantly affect perceived usefulness as per TAM3
(REL ﬁ PU = 0.380, p < 0.001; PEOU ﬁ PU = 0.206, p < 0.001) while OQ
signiﬁcantly moderate REL ﬁ PU relationship (explained below). Result demon-
strability (RES) was the only exception, as RES did not signiﬁcantly affect PU
which might indicate that participants do not believe that the results of using
the LMS are tangible, observable, and communicable [31]. Hence, H4(a) is par-
tially supported.
The anchors suggested by TAM3 are computer self-efﬁcacy, computer anxiety,
perceptions
of
external
control
(or
facilitating
conditions),
and
computer
playfulness. The ﬁrst three of these anchors proved to signiﬁcantly affect PEOU
in this study (CSE ﬁ PEOU = 0.176, p < 0.001; CANX ﬁ PEOU = �0.105,
p < 0.05; PEC ﬁ PEOU = 0.454, p < 0.001). However, computer playfulness
did not signiﬁcantly affect PEOU indicating the absence of intrinsic motivation
associated with using the LMS. Perceptions of external control exhibited the
strongest effect among anchors indicating how individuals’ control beliefs regard-
ing the availability of organizational resources and support structure facilitate the
use of the system. This ﬁnding supports the important role of perceptions of exter-
nal control reported by Al-Harbi [7]. Hence, H5 is partially supported.
As indicated earlier, only one system characteristic-related to adjustments – that
is, perceived enjoyment – was investigated in this study which proved to play a con-
siderable role in determining perceived ease of use after individuals gain experience
with the system. This study proved that enjoyment signiﬁcantly affects PEOU
(ENJ ﬁ PEOU = 0.201, p < 0.001). Therefore, H6 is supported.

6.2. Moderators effects
TAM3 posits that subjective norm (SN) has a positive signiﬁcant effect on
behavioral intention (BI) and to continue in voluntary usage contexts. Our ﬁnd-
ings indicate that SN has positive direct effect on BI and that voluntariness
(VOL) positively moderates the effect of SN on BI (VOL · SN ﬁ BI = 0.14) indi-
cating that the positive direct effect of SN on BI will not attenuate in voluntary
usage contexts. The positive interaction of voluntariness on the effect of SN on
BI could be interpreted such that, users in more voluntary usage contexts are
inclined to be positively affected by signiﬁcant others’ opinions regarding their
intention to use LMS. In this milieu, it is likely that the effect of subjective norm
on intention to use LMS will not diminish with increasing voluntariness, as
reported in Venkatesh and Davis [42]. Speciﬁcally, they found that SN inﬂuenced
BI only in mandatory usage contexts, and that in voluntary usage contexts, SN
had no direct effect on BI. We contend that the signiﬁcant effect of SN on BI,
in both mandatory and voluntary usage contexts, can be explained within Saudi
Arabia’s cultural context. In light of these Saudi cultural impacts, even if the con-
text of usage was voluntary, SN would continue to be a signiﬁcant predictor of BI.
Indeed, our ﬁndings do conﬁrm a pronounced effect of SN on BI in Saudi Arabia,
a ﬁnding which is not usually observed in Western contexts. Hence, H3(d) is
supported.
Venkatesh and Davis [42] deﬁned job relevance as the degree to which an indi-
vidual believes that the target system is applicable to his or her job. This study
reports on a strong positive direct effect of job relevance (REL) on perceived use-
fulness (PU) that will increase with higher output quality. OQ positively moder-
ated the effect of REL on PU (OQ x REL ﬁ PU = 0.152). Job relevance and
output quality will have a moderating effect on perceived usefulness such that
the higher the output quality, the stronger the effect job relevance will have on per-
ceived usefulness as reported in Venkatesh and Davis [42]. Thus, H4(b) is
supported.
The positive direct effect of subjective norm on both behavioral intention and
perceived usefulness will attenuate with increased experience. EXP negatively
moderated the effect of SN on BI (EXP
· SN ﬁ BI = �0.10) and PU
(EXP · SN ﬁ PU = -0.05). These relationships are supported. These negative
coefﬁcients could be interpreted to indicate that more experienced individuals
are possessing stable perceptions about LMS usefulness besides their afﬁrmed
intention to use LMS regardless of referent opinion in this issue. In other words,
more experienced users’ tendencies are less likely to be affected by signiﬁcant
others’ opinions regarding their perceptions of LMS usefulness and their intention
to use LMS. In this context, contrary to the ﬁndings of [42], our ﬁndings indicate
that it is likely that the effect of subjective norm on perceived LMS usefulness and
on intention to use LMS will diminish as users gain more experience with the sys-
tem. Hence, management should concentrate on users to acquire more experience
44

with the system, instead of relying on referent opinions, to ensure higher levels of
system acceptance and assimilation.
The positive direct effect of ease of use on both behavioral intention and per-
ceived usefulness will not attenuate with increased experience. EXP positively
moderated the effect of EOU on BI (EXP · PEOU ﬁ BI = 0.101) and PU
(EXP · PEOU ﬁ PU = 0.083). These relationships are supported. We interpret
these positive coefﬁcients as an indication that more experienced individuals are
still inclined to be affected by signiﬁcant system ease of use regarding the perceived
usefulness of, and intention to use, LMS. In this context, it is likely that the effect
of ease of use on perceived usefulness and intention to use a system will not dimin-
ish with increased experience. In fact our ﬁndings conﬁrm a pronounced effect of
PEOU on both PU and BI in Saudi Arabia, which should not be overlooked dur-
ing system design.
EXP did not signiﬁcantly moderate the negative inﬂuence of computer anxiety
(CANX) on PEOU (EXP · CANX ﬁ PEOU = -0.035). In this context, it is less
likely that the effect of computer anxiety on system ease of use will diminish with
increasing experience, as reported in Venkatesh and Davis [42]. This is a sign of the
impediment effect of anxiety with LMS users which persists even with increasing
experience. However, EXP did positively moderate the positive inﬂuence of enjoy-
ment (ENJ) on PEOU (EXP · ENJ ﬁ PEOU = 0.076). Hence, it is likely that the
effect of system enjoyment on ease of use will increase with increased experience,
as reported in Venkatesh and Davis [42].
Computer playfulness (CPLY) is theorized to signiﬁcantly affect perceived ease
of use (PEOU) as per TAM3. However, our ﬁndings indicate that computer play-
fulness fails to impact LMS ease of use which indicates that participants couldnot
achieve an acceptable level of intrinsic motivation while using the LMS in order to
foster their perceptions regarding LMS ease of use. Thus, users feel that the system
has no playfulness merit which otherwise would let users to perceive the system as
easy to use rather than being awkward and complex. This situation did not change
when
the
CPLY ﬁ PEOU
relationship
was
moderated
by
experience
(EXP · CPLY ﬁ PEOU = 0.007). The insigniﬁcant interaction of experience on
the effect of CPLY on PEOU could be interpreted such that, gaining more
experience has an unconstructive role with regard to how computer playfulness
impetus LMS’ ease of use. In other words, even experienced users still perceive
LMS with no playfulness merit because they couldnot achieve an acceptable level
of intrinsic motivation which in turn fails to inﬂuence their perceptions regarding
LMS ease of use.
Venkatesh [41] posited that the effects of adjustments on perceived ease of use
(PEOU) were stronger with more hands-on experience with the system. Our study
conﬁrmed that the positive effect of enjoyment (ENJ) on PEOU (ENJ ﬁ PEOU)
relationship
was
signiﬁcant
when
moderated
by
EXP
(EXP · ENJ ﬁ
PEOU = 0.076, p < 0.05). Although this study lacks a longitudinal merit, our
ﬁndings indicate that more experienced users will enjoy using the system which will

45
enable them to perceive the system as more easy to use. In summation, experience
(EXP) as a moderator variable was signiﬁcantly moderating ﬁve paths of the seven
relationships identiﬁed in TAM3 as shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, H7 is partially
supported.
7. Interventions
It has been advised by academics and practitioners that managers need to develop
and implement effective interventions in order to maximize end-users’ IT adoption
and use [28]. Therefore, identifying interventions that could inﬂuence adoption
and use of new ITs can aid managerial decision making on successful IT imple-
mentation strategies [28]. TAM3 paved the way to comprehend the role of inter-
ventions in IT acceptance and assimilation contexts, based on delineating the
predictors of PU and PEOU. In TAM3, Venkatesh and Bala [44] classiﬁed inter-
ventions into two categories: pre-implementation and post-implementation interven-
tions motivated by the stage models of IT implementation and type of intervention
(e.g., design characteristics, user participation, incentive alignment, training, orga-
nizational and peer support). TAM3 also contributes to management with respect
to interventions by supporting managerial decision making with two complement-
ing alternatives [44]: Firstly, managers are provided with a framework to decide
what interventions to apply during pre- and post-implementation stages and for
what types of systems. Secondly, managers can decide on resource allocation
for each speciﬁc intervention anchored by the impact of such intervention on dif-
ferent determinants of IT acceptance and assimilation, and system type.
As noted earlier, this study has the shortcoming of lacking a longitudinal merit
and thus cannot justify pre-implementation interventions from the ﬁeld. However,
participants clearly acknowledged that they strongly desire to be given the choice
between LMS alternatives based on ample presentations and demonstrations in
order to alleviate initial resistance and develop genuine perceptions of system fea-
tures, capabilities, and relevance to enhance future system acceptance and
assimilation.
7.1. Post-implementation interventions
Post-implementation interventions represent a set of organizational, managerial,
and support activities that take place after the deployment of a system to enhance
the level of system acceptance by users [44]. Post-implementation interventions can
be vital so that users are able to go through the initial shock and react favorably to
changes associated with the new system. The core theme of post-implementation
interventions should be to make users feel that the new system is an opportunity
to enhance their job performance, and give them the ability and necessary
resources to use the new system smoothly [44]. TAM3 suggests a group of
post-implementation interventions: training, organizational support, and peer
46
S.S. Al-Gahtani
support that will be particularly relevant to each of the determinants of PU and
PEOU.
In the following, we reﬂect on the concept of post-implementation interventions
to our study ﬁndings by giving an example of one determinant of perceived useful-
ness and one determinant of perceived ease of use which were not signiﬁcant and
apply the suitable intervention, as alleviation, to each case.
(a) Our study reports that result demonstrability as a predictor of perceived use-
fulness was not signiﬁcant which might indicate that participants do not
believe that the results of using LMS are tangible, observable, and commu-
nicable [31]. In order to alleviate this situation, TAM3 suggests a bunch of
post-implementation interventions such as: training, organizational support,
and peer support which will be particularly relevant in this situation.
(b) Our study reports that computer playfulness as a predictor of perceived ease
of use was not signiﬁcant which might indicate that participants could not
achieve an acceptable level of intrinsic motivation while using the LMS so
as to perceive LMS as easy to use. In order to soothe this situation,
TAM3 suggests training as the sole post-implementation intervention which
will be particularly relevant and adequate to let users feel spontaneous and
playful while using the system.
8. Limitations
Our study has its own limitations. This study was set to utilize TAM3 to empiri-
cally investigate the acceptance and assimilation of e-learning in a developing
country. However, our study is not an exact replication of the study conducted
by Venkatesh and Bala [44] to develop TAM3. Our study applied cross-
sectional design and used a sample from a single organization compared to the
Venkatesh and Bala study which used a longitudinal design with a sample of sub-
jects included from four different organizations. Venkatesh and Bala [44] used
conventional regression analysis (MRA), as the statistical technique to analyze
their data. In contrast, our study employed PLS-based structural equation model-
ing (PLS-SEM), a more powerful technique to conduct the data analysis. We hope
this analytical technique is a credit providing additional support for the validity of
the results of our model.
With this study only having tested a single LMS technology (Bb) in one devel-
oping country, the generalizability of our ﬁndings are quite limited as well. There
is a need to conduct additional studies applying TAM3 to developing nations to
gain further support for the ﬁndings of this study as discussed below in the future
studies of e-learning acceptance.
Empirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation
47
8.1. Future studies of e-learning acceptance
Singh and Hardaker [38] suggest that future studies of e-learning acceptance
should target both the micro-level reﬂecting on several aspects such as: individu-
alist perspective considering the different backgrounds, experiences and motiva-
tions
of
individual
academics;
and
the
macro-level
considering
various
organizational and environmental settings. This study supports this recommenda-
tion and suggests that future research needs to close the gap between these two
approaches by developing a more integrated theoretical framework that provides
a means to diminish the overshadow effects of organizational roles and organiza-
tional and environmental settings over the personal characteristics inspiring fruit-
ful future research ﬁndings.
Additionally, future studies could be conducted to examine TAM3 using sam-
ples of students and instructors from different geo-locations and a wider range of
e-learning systems. This could involve testing TAM3 by including the technology
usage behavior construct omitted from our research model, which would increase
the predictable levels of e-learning acceptance. Furthermore, the full TAM3 model
could be tested in future studies by including the objective usability construct
which needs special research design to enable the key stroke model which we
referred to in the research method above.
9. Conclusions
Contemporary organizations spend vast amounts of resources in ITs which are
becoming progressively complex, and implementation costs are tremendously
escalating with time. Implementation failures of many of today’s ITs cost millions
of dollars to organizations. In addition, low acceptance and adoption manifested
in high underutilization of ITs have been a major problem for organizations.
This study develops our understanding of the determinants of e-learning accep-
tance and assimilation in a developing country by testing a nomological network
based on TAM3 using structural equation modeling. It also partially advocates the
concept of interventions – as per TAM3 – that can favorably inﬂuence these deter-
minants so that management can proactively decide on implementing the right
interventions to minimize resistance to this relatively new IT, and maximize its
effective utilization.
All hypotheses of direct effect relationships, as per TAM3 in Fig. 1, were sup-
ported except two relationships: computer playfulness (CPLY) ﬁ perceived ease
of use (PEOU) and result demonstrability (RES) ﬁ perceived usefulness (PU).
Seven out of nine hypotheses of moderating effects relationships, as per TAM3
in Fig. 1, were supported. We hope that this adds further conﬁdence in our
research design and we also hope that future studies can refer to these ﬁndings
for comparison and discussions.
