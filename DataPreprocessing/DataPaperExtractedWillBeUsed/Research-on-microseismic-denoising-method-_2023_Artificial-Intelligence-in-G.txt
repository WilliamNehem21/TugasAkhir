Noise suppression is an important part of microseismic monitoring technology. Signal and noise can be
separated by denoising and filtering to improve the subsequent analysis. In this paper, we propose a new
denoising method based on convolutional blind denoising network (CBDNet). The method is partially modified
for image denoising network CBDNet to make it suitable for one–dimensional data denoising. At present, most
of the existing filtering methods are proposed for the Gaussian white noise denoising. In contrast, the proposed
method also learns the wind noise, construction noise, traffic noise and mixed noise through the strategy of
residual learning. The full convolution subnetwork is used to estimate the noise level, which significantly
improves the signal-to-noise ratio and its performance of removing the correlated noise. The model is trained
with different types of real noise and random noise. The denoising result is evaluated by corresponding indexes
and compared with other denoising methods. The results show that the proposed method has better denoising
performance than traditional methods, and it has a superior noise suppression level for oil well construction
noise and mixed noise. The proposed method can suppress the interference of time–frequency overlapped end
to end and still have noise suppression and event detection capability even if the signal is superimposed on
other types of noise.
1. Introduction
Microseismic monitoring technology can be used in unconventional
oil and gas development, mine disaster monitoring, CO2 capture, uti-
lization and storage (CCUS) and other fields. For microseismic moni-
toring technology, denoising is an important part of its data processing
technology (Dai et al., 2019). Because the amplitude of the microseis-
mic (small magnitude) signals is always much weaker than that of
seismic signals, and the measured data is always polluted by noise,
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is much lower than that of active source
seismic events. It is difficult to directly pick up arrive time and locate
events from the original observation data.
In order to suppress noise and improve the accuracy of arrival
time picking and localization, many efforts have been made to develop
many effective denoising methods. Traditional microseismic noise sup-
pression methods are proposed based on domain transform algorithms
and some thresholding methods, including wavelet transform (Cao and
Chen, 2005; Gaci, 2014; Liu et al., 2016; Mousavi et al., 2016; Mousavi
and Langston, 2017), continuous wavelet transform (CWT) (Mousavi
and Langston, 2016b,a), short time Fourier transform (STFT) (Allen and
Rabiner, 1977), S-transform (Tselentis et al., 2012), radon transform

transform (WPT) (Galiana-Merino et al., 2003; Shuchong and Xun,
2015), meander transform (Neelamani et al., 2008), empirical mode
decomposition (EMD) (Liu et al., 2014; Bekara and Baan, 2009; Chen
et al., 2016; Han and Baan, 2015) and so on.
In recent years, denoising methods based on deep learning have
been gradually applied to microseismic data processing. Among them,
the most widely used denoising method for microseismic data is fil-
tering based on convolution neural network (CNN) (Li et al., 2018;
Liu et al., 2021; Mandelli et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018; Si and Yuan,
2018; Kim et al., 2019). In addition, denoising convolutional neural
network (DnCNN) (Zhang et al., 2017) and convolutional networks
for biomedical image segmentation (U–Net) (Ronneberger et al., 2015)
were first used for image denoising and image segmentation tasks,
in which DnCNN used end-to-end neural network models to reduce
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), and for the first time used
residual learning strategy in the field of image reconstruction. Then,
some researchers applied structures based on DnCNN and U–Net to
seismic data processing, including but not limited to denoising and
seismic phase identification.
Zhu et al. (2019) made some adjustments and improvements in
the network structure and training strategy, taking the seismic signal

after STFT as the input, and then decomposing the input data into
signal and noise by the mask determined by the network. Zhang
et al. (2020) applied the denoising method based on multi–layer U–
Net neural network to the denoising of microseismic data. By learning
the sparse characteristics in the time domain and frequency domain
at the same time, as well as the mask correlation mapping function
for signal separation, it can work well when the noise and signal
frequency bands are similar. Zheng et al. (2021) built an end-to-end
noise residual learning network through DnCNN, making it more timely
in microseismic data denoising.
At present, in the field of microseismic denoising, most of the
denoising methods based on deep learning are proposed for Gaus-
sian white noise. When these methods encounter more complex real
noise, the denoising performance is often greatly reduced. Therefore,
we propose a microseismic denoising method based on convolutional
blind denoising network (CBDNet). Compared with DnCNN network,
an input noise intensity parameter 𝜎 is added to this network, and a
full convolutional network is added to learn this parameter, so as to
better adapt to different types of real noise.
The structure of this paper is as follows. Firstly, the proposed denois-
ing method and its principle are introduced. Next, the performance of
the denoising network is verified through experiments, and the denois-
ing performance of the network for different types of noise is analyzed
and compared with the traditional single–channel denoising method.
The CBDNet used in training can be seen in the image processing
network at the earliest (Guo et al., 2019), which will be adjusted and
improved according to the prior information of microseismic signals.
2. Methods and network training
2.1. Methods
Single–channel microseismic data can be regarded as the superpo-
sition of effective signal and noise.
𝑦 = 𝑠 + 𝑛
(1)
y represents the real microseismic data, s represents the signal to be
extracted, and n represents the noisy data except the effective signal.
The feedforward process of deep convolution neural network can be
expressed by Eq. (2).
𝑦out = 𝑓𝜃
(𝑥𝑖𝑛
)
(2)
𝑦out is the output of the network, 𝜃 represents the parameters of the
network, and f represents a nonlinear generating network that maps 𝑥𝑖𝑛
to 𝑦out . 𝑥𝑖𝑛 is the network input after preprocessing.
𝑥𝑖𝑛 = (𝑦 − mean(𝑦))∕(max(𝑦) − min(𝑦))
(3)
With the supervised learning method and different learning strate-
gies (waveform learning, noise residual learning), the network can be
expressed into the following Eq. (4) (5).
̂𝑥 = 𝑓𝜃1(𝑦)
𝜃1 = arg min
𝜃 loss(̂𝑥, 𝑥)
(4)
̂𝑛 = 𝑓𝜃2(𝑦)
𝜃2 = arg min
𝜃 loss(𝑦 − ̂𝑛, 𝑥)
(5)
̂𝑥 represents the distribution of effective signals predicted by the
network. ̂𝑛 represents the distribution of noisy signals predicted by the
network. 𝜃1 𝜃2 finds the best network parameters for minimizing the
loss function. The mean square error is used to constrain the difference
between the target signal and the estimated signal. The formula is as
follows:
loss (𝑦out , 𝑦label
) = ‖‖‖𝑓𝜃
(𝑥in
) − 𝑦label ‖‖‖
2
(6)
𝑦label is the label data produced.
The microseismic denoising network proposed in this paper is in-
spired by the image denoising network CBDNet (Guo et al., 2019), on
the basis of which relevant improvements are made. The whole network
can be divided into two subnetworks. One is the noise estimation
subnetwork, which is a 3–layer fully convolutional networks (FCN)
structure to learn the value of noise estimation. The second is the
denoising subnetwork, which is a 9–layer U–Net structure. The input
of the subnetwork is the output of the noise estimation subnetwork
and the noisy–signal. The denoising subnetwork adopts the noise resid-
ual learning strategy, and the network learns noise instead of signal.
Moreover, the network deals with one–dimensional signals, so the two–
dimensional convolution operation is converted into one–dimensional

convolution operation. The denoising processing framework is shown
in (Fig. 1). (Fig. 2) shows the network architecture.
In the original CBDNet, its loss function is mainly composed of three
parts. This paper has adjusted the details of its parameters. The overall
formula of the original network loss function is shown below.
𝐿 = 𝐿rec + 𝜆asymm 𝐿asymm + 𝜆𝑇 𝑉 𝐿𝑇 𝑉
(7)
𝐿rec is used to measure an error of the reconstructed signal of the
denoising network, which is represented by the mean square error:
𝐿1 = ‖(y − ̂𝑛) − 𝑥‖2
2
(8)
Where 𝑦 is the noisy–signal, ̂𝑛 is the noisy data predicted by the
denoising subnetwork, and 𝑥 is the clean microseismic signal.
𝐿asymm , 𝐿𝑇 𝑉 is used to constrain the noise estimation subnetwork,
𝐿asymm
is the constructed asymmetric loss to avoid the low noise
characteristics of the output of the noise estimation subnetwork.
𝐿asymm =
∑
𝑖
∣ 𝛼 − I(̂𝜎(𝑦𝑖)−𝜎(𝑦𝑖))<0 ∣ ⋅ (̂𝜎 (𝑦𝑖
) − 𝜎 (𝑦𝑖
))2
(9)
Where ̂𝜎 (𝑦𝑖
) is the estimated noise level of the subnetwork, and 𝜎 (𝑦𝑖
)
is the real noise value. When 𝑒 < 0, I𝑒 = 1. Otherwise, it is 0, and 𝛼 is
the set penalty.
𝐿𝑇 𝑉 is a regularization term introduced to constrain the rate of
change of noise features. The detailed calculation formula is as follows:
𝐿𝑇 𝑉 = ‖∇̂𝜎(𝑦)‖2
2
(10)
Where, ∇̂𝜎(𝑦) represents the gradient change of features. The original
CBDNet is aimed at image denoising and needs to constrain the gradient
change of noise features in both the height and width directions. This
paper mainly focuses on one–dimensional microseismic signals, so there
is only one constraint term.
2.2. Network training
The high SNR microseismic signals were acquired using forward
simulation, setting a sampling window of 1.5 s, a sampling interval of
0.3 ms, a total of 5000 sampling points, and intercepting 2000 sampling
points with signals as the length of the input signal. Data enhancement
was carried out by adding Gaussian noise with different signal-to-noise
ratios, wind noise from field acquisition, construction noise, traffic
noise and mixed noise to the signals respectively. As the real noisy
signals do not exactly satisfy the characteristics of Gaussian distribution
and are more relevant to the situation in the field, the generalization
ability of the network can be improved. A total of 300,000 training
samples were constructed, with 20% of the samples used as a validation

set to determine hyperparameters and prevent the network from being
overfitted for best results, 20% as a test set to evaluate the performance
of the network, and the rest as a training set. The network was trained
on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU using the Adam optimizer with a
learning rate of 0.0001 and a min–batch size of 128. (Fig. 3) shows
the change of the loss function for each epoch of the training set and
the validation set.
3. Results
3.1. Synthetic tests results
Compared with indoor or urban environment, the ambient noise
at the oilfield site is more complex and has different intensity and
frequency. In order to improve the denoising effect of deep learning
denoising in the face of field noise, in addition to Gaussian random
noise, a large number of wind noise, construction noise, traffic noise
and mixed noise including multiple noise are added to the data set. The
noisy signal was formed by superimposing the clean signal with noise.
We get clean signal through forward simulation, and the noise includes
Gaussian random noise and real noise. The denoising results of some
noisy data selected from the test data set are shown in Figs. 4 to 8. It can

be observed that the proposed method can successfully separate noisy
data with different characteristics into estimated signals and estimated
noise.
The proposed method has good denoising performance for micro-
seismic signals with noise which have different types and different
intensities. Wherein, the noisy signal in Fig. 4(a) is the microseismic
signal with Gaussian random noise, and Fig. 4(b) is the corresponding
time–frequency domain signal; Fig. 5 shows the noisy signal after
adding the real wind noise from the field. Fig. 6 shows the noisy signal
added with the real construction noise; Fig. 7 shows the noisy signal
added with the real traffic noise; The noise added in Fig. 8 is a mixture
of various ambient noise, including construction noise, traffic noise,
wind noise, etc. (hereinafter referred to as mixed noise), which is more
complex than a single type of real noise. The algorithm can restore
the denoised signal with high accuracy, and can well suppress the
Gaussian random noise and various types of practical noise commonly
seen in field construction. The shape and amplitude characteristics
of the predicted signal have also obtained high similarity fidelity. In
addition, since the training set adopts a large amount of real noise, the
proposed method has high applicability to the field data that need to
be preprocessed.

3.2. Analysis of test results
After the network training is completed, in order to verify the
denoising effect, some indicators for evaluating the denoising perfor-
mance are also needed for analysis, and we mainly analyzes the effect
before and after denoising through three indicators: SNR, mean square

of each sample, and n is the sample length.
𝑅 = cov(𝑠, ̂𝑠)
𝜎𝑠 × 𝜎̂𝑠
(13)
where s is the original data and ̂𝑠 is the denoising data.
The denoising performance of the network can be well evaluated
by using SNR, mean square error and similarity coefficient. As shown
in Fig. 9(a), which is the histogram of the SNR distribution before and
after denoising the noisy signal of some test sets. The average SNR of
the input noisy signal is about 5.576 dB, and the average SNR after
denoising treatment reaches about 13.814 dB, an average increase of
about 8.238 dB, and an increase of about 147.8%. The mean square
error of denoising is 0.04, and the average similarity coefficient reaches
0.95, which shows that the proposed method has a better denoising
performance.
The method achieve a good denoising performance for randomly
generated Gaussian random noise with different SNR. As shown in
Fig. 9(b), it is the data containing Gaussian random noise. The average
SNR of the input noisy signal is about 7.189 db. After denoising,
the average SNR reaches about 16.287 db, with an average increase
of about 9.098 db. Fig. 9(c) shows the data with wind noise. After
denoising, the average SNR is increased by 5.997 db. Because of the
higher complexity of real noise, compared with the Gaussian random
noise, the denoising performance of the network for the real wind
noise is relatively weak. Fig. 9(d) shows the data containing oil well
construction noise. After noise removal, the average SNR has increased
by 8.610 db. It is higher than the average performance of various noise
except the Gaussian random noise, indicating that the network has a
good denoising performance for oil well construction noise. Fig. 9(e)
shows the data with traffic noise. It can be found that the SNR is
increased by 5.810 db on average through denoising. Therefore, the
ability of the network to reduce traffic noise is relatively weak, which
is lower than the average performance of denoising. Fig. 9(f) shows
the data with real mixed noise, and the average SNR is about 7.445 db
higher. Compared with various types of real noise, the denoising per-
formance of the proposed method for mixed noise is higher than that of
wind noise and traffic noise, and lower than that of construction noise.
In practical engineering, the real noise often does not obey the
Gaussian distribution, which will increase the difficulty of denoising. In
this paper, microseismic signals containing different types of real noise
are added to the training set to improve the denoising performance.
Through comparison of evaluation indexes, it is concluded that the
method performs well in removing Gaussian noise, oil well construction
noise and mixed noise. In addition, it has certain denoising performance
for wind noise and traffic noise. The denoising method has superior
adaptability in the face of the common noise in practical engineering.
4. Comparison with other methods
4.1. Synthetic data
In order to further verify the denoising performance of the proposed
method, we compared the proposed denoising method based on CBD-
Net with the ensemble empirical modal decomposition (EEMD) and
wavelet threshold transform (WT) denoising methods. Among them,
sym8 wavelet base, 5–layer wavelet decomposition and fixed threshold
calculation are selected in the wavelet threshold transformation. As
shown in Figs. 10, three indicators are used to compare the denoising
performance of the three filtering methods: SNR, similarity coefficient
and mean square error of noisy signals and estimated signals.
By comparing Figs. 10(a) and 10(b), it can be seen that although the
proposed denoising method is better to EEMD filtering and WT filtering
in terms of the denoising performance of Gaussian random noise, the
noise suppression levels of the three filtering methods are relatively
close when the original SNR is high, that is, when the signal is relatively
high quality. However, in the face of more complex and changeable real
noise, the proposed method achieves a better denoising performance
than EEMD filter and WT filter.
Compared with EEMD filtering and wavelet threshold transform
filtering, the proposed method has the largest improvement in SNR,

which is much higher than the traditional denoising method, with an
average increase of 8.238 db. The average EEMD filtering is about
3.288 db higher, and the average WT filtering is about 4.432 db higher.
As shown in Figs. 10(c) and 10(d), the average similarity coefficient
of EEMD filtering is about 0.83, and the average mean square error
is about 0.09; The average similarity coefficient of wavelet threshold
transform filtering is about 0.86, and the average mean square error
is about 0.08. Since the average similarity coefficient of the proposed

method is higher than that of the two traditional methods, and the
average mean square error is lower than that of the EEMD filter and
WT filter, it can be seen that the denoising performance of the wavelet
threshold transform filter is slightly higher than that of the ensemble
empirical mode decomposition filter method, but it is not as good as
that of the CBDNet based denoising method.

4.2. Field data
In addition to applying the network to synthetic data, we still
need to verify its denoising performance for real data. Therefore, two
sets of field data are used as denoising examples, one with a single
microseismic event and the other with multiple microseismic events.
As shown in Figs. 11, the noisy data set 1 were collected in
Shizhuang Town, Qinshui County, Jincheng City, Shanxi Province. And
the noisy data set 2 were collected in Mabi Town, Anze County, Linfen
City, Shanxi Province. Figs. 12 and 13 show the denoised results using
four different methods. Figs. 14 and 15 are the detailed denoising
waveforms of the field data in the corresponding areas. We compare
the proposed method with a deep neural networks–based method
named DeepDenoiser, which can properly handles a variety of colored
noise and non–earthquake signals (Zhu et al., 2019). Comparing the
four denoising methods, the EEMD method has the weakest denoising
performance can be shown clearly. The WT method can remove partial
noise but the improvement of SNR is limited. Although DeepDenoiser
has more noise suppression than the proposed method, the proposed
method can retain more waveform details and each event can be picked
up more precisely. Although the field data acquisition area and ambient
noise are different, the proposed method can clearly separate the signal
and noise from the data. Therefore, the proposed method has better
denoising performance than traditional denoising method, and has
advantages over other deep learning methods.
5. Conclusions
We propose a microseismic signal processing method based on
CBDNet neural network which is mainly for denoising of the surface
microseismic monitoring. Different from other common deep learning
methods, the proposed method simultaneously learns the Gaussian
random noise, wind noise, construction noise, traffic noise and mixed
noise through the residual learning strategy, which can significantly
improve the SNR, and has better universality and signal authenticity.
When encountering different types and different intensities of ambient
noise in field work, even if the signal and noise are superposed, the
proposed method can still suppress certain noise and extract the signal,
and the denoising performance will be different when facing different
types of noise.
The results show that the proposed method performs well in remov-
ing oil well construction noise and mixed noise, while the denoising
performance for wind noise and traffic noise is relatively weak. But
both can better extract the waveform characteristics of microseismic

with the traditional denoising method, which only has an excellent
performance to suppress linear noise, the proposed method has better
adaptability, and also has an excellent performance to denoise complex

the proposed method has better signal retention and integrity, which
can be well applied to the microseismic signal processing and signal
analysis in the geophysical field.
