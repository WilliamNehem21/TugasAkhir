Abstract 
In the paper we suggested a method for video sequence handling with the aim of producing a single noise- free image. An 
algorithm for the image alignment based on the approaches of dot matches search and the resolution capacity enhancement 
has been elaborated. A method for multiple images stacking has been proposed to produce a single noise-free picture. The 
proposed method has been successfully experimentally tested using developed software tools.

Introduction 
Image enhancement is widely applied in various domains, namely cartography, photogrammetry, medicine, 
astronomy, etc. This task involves processing of a single or a series of images, aiming to produce a single 
noise-free picture. 
As the research results [1, 2] have revealed that methods and algorithms, aimed at single picture processing 
slightly enhance the PSNR (for estimating the quality of the noise reduction methods the noise-free pictures

are overlapped by White Gaussian Noise, further on the tested filtering algorithm is applied, and the output 
picture is compared to the original one with PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio[3, 4]) assessment), whereas 
filters based on video sequences reach high values of the given parameter. 
So, while elaborating a method of image quality enhancement based on the analysis of image series, 
received from the same foreshortening, it was decided to implement a method of multiple images stacking. 
However one should take into consideration the particularity of receiving images series – certain images of 
the sequence can be displaced relative to each other. That is why the proposed method of receiving a single 
noise-free image based on image series handling implies two steps:  
� alignment of images series; 
� multiple images stacking in order to receive a single noise-free picture    
Further on the proposed algorithms of these steps implementation are thoroughly considered. 
1. An Algorithm of Image Series Alignment Based on Dot Matches Search and the Resolution Capacity 
Enhancement 
Having analyzed the open sources it has been found out that known approaches based on dot matches 
search possess the high alignment accuracy [5], whereas program implementation of the methods based on 
resolution power feature the performance are of high rate [6]. 
This paper suggests a combined algorithm of image alignment based on the dot matches search and the 
resolution capacity enhancement methods. 
The proposed algorithm allows to reach a pixel by pixel accuracy of the image alignment due to approach, 
based on the dot matches search in the pictures, as well to high rate due to the iterative resolution capacity 
enhancement based method application. Fig 1 presents the structure of the image alignment combined 
algorithm. 
Let us consider this algorithm functioning in details. Suppose, we have two black and white (monochromic) 
images, ImageRef and ImageCurrent. Each image is  represented as HxW  elements matrix. It is necessary to 
find a transformation of ImageCurrent matrix into ImageRef matrix which would minimize the luminance 
difference of the images (with minimal luminance difference of the images).  
The essential idea of the algorithm is to process consequently the images of the video sequence in order to 
align the images to the pivotal image ImageRef. It is the first image that is chosen to be the pivotal one.  Every 
image ImageCurrent undergoes the iterative handling. Under each iteration the picture resolution grows 
bigger and the dot math search is performed [7, 8]. Further on, from the dot matches found matrix 
transformation operators are calculated.  
Displacement and rotation operators are considered as matrix transformation operators. Rotation 
transformation similar to that while considering flat geometrical objects, allows to turn the original image’s 
angle. 
The rotation around the centre of the image is performed, with two rotation options being possible: 
� image parts that fall outside its limits, are truncated, while the blank  parts are filled with pixels with zero 
luminance; 
� � new image size is calculated based on the rotation angle so, that the rotated image fits the new 
dimensions. The blank parts are also filled with pixels with zero luminance. 
In any case the rotation transformation [9] is calculated using the following formula:

C -  is the luminance of the pixels filling the blank parts of the image; 
� – is the clockwise rotation angle  in radians. 
The presented formula rounds off the transformed coordinates. However, using a bilinear interpolation is 
also possible, when the pixel luminance is calculated as weighted sum of the luminance of the four 
neighboring pixels.    
Following this, pixel by pixel image alignment is performed to ImageCurr and ImageRef. For pixel by 
pixel image alignment ImageRef is compared to 9 variants of the ImageCurr (with the original ImageCurr 
being shifted 1 pixel upwards/downwards and 1 pixel in diagonals), and the correlation coefficient (kor) being 
analyzed by formula [1]:

where

One of the 9 variants of the shifted image ImageCurr featuring the highest value of the correlation 
coefficient kor is chosen as pixel by pixel aligned image to ImageRef. 
2. Algorithm of Multiple Images Stacking for a Single Noise- free Image Production  
The submitted algorithm is based on defining the coefficient of the contribution that each image makes to 
the common sum.  The contribution coefficient k is the marker of the image noisiness; the higher the noise, 
the lower is the coefficient, similarly the lower the noise the higher is the contribution coefficient. The 
possible contribution coefficient value lies within the range of 
k �[0,1]
. 
Lets us denote a sequence of original images as I, the total number of images in a sequence as n.  Let us 
hold that the images in the sequence are all taken from the same exposure and the same illumination of the 
visible object; then the signal intensity S will be the same in every image 
iI , however images of 
the
iI sequence have different noise level  
i
N caused by various disturbances (for instance by impulse noise of 
the electronic equipment). 
To estimate the quality of the single image of the sequence let us take the parameter SNR (signal-to-noise 
ratio, that is a nondimensional value equal to the ratio of the useful signal power to the noise power [10]), for 
the i image of the sequence the SNR parameter is calculated by the formula: 
i
i
i
SNR � S
N                                                                                                                                                 (3) 
77
 I.S. Korovin and M.V. Khisamutdinov  /  AASRI Procedia  6 ( 2014 )  73 – 81 
 
As the 
iI  images have the same signal level S but the different noise level 
i
N , it means that their 
i
SNR correlation  is in inverse ratio to 
i
N , while the contribution coefficient 
ik  is calculated by the formula:

where 
1
N  - is the noise level of the least noisy image of the I sequence, i.e. the image featuring the highest 
SNR.     
In order to search for the least noisy image 
1I  we use the brightness histogram analysis.  
With regard to the found coefficients
ik for every 
iI the total resulting image
Isum
 is calculated by the 
formula:

As the noise for every image is considered to be random and independent, the noise composition is 
performed in second degree. Knowing the value of the
i
SNR parameter for every image of the
iI  sequence, it 
is possible to calculate the

The submitted algorithm of the image quality enhancement comprises 5 basic steps.  
1. The search for the least noisy image   in the I series based on the brightness histogram analysis.  
To select the least noisy image   in the series I, the averaged luminance histogram  construction based on 
averaging of all images  histograms  is carried out. Further search for histogram Hist  closest to Histmed is 
made, and the image is marked as 
1I . 
2. Selecting zones in the image 
1I , corresponding to the noisy areas Narea. 
It is carried out as follows: the entire image 
1I  area is assigned to Narea, then local areas of singular points 
Nlocal are excluded, searched according to [11]. From the area Narea1 the desired area Narea = Narea1 – Nlocal, 
corresponding to the noisy areas in the image 
1I , is obtained. 
3. Calculation based on the found areas Narea of the value 
i
N  for each image 
iI . 
For each image 
iI  noise level value 
i
N .
1
N �1
 is calculated, since the given image is the least noisy in 
the series, other values 
i
N  are defined as the standard deviation of pixel brightness of 
Narea
 area between the 
image 
1I  and image 
iI .  
4. Calculating the coefficients 
ik . 
For each image 
iI  contribution factor 
ik  is calculated by the formula (4). 
5. Median addition of images 
iI  in the series I with the calculated contribution factor 
ik , in order to 
obtain one perspective non-noisy image 
Isum
. 
At this stage, median addition of images I series taking into account factor 
ik  is performed. The essence of 
the classical median method consists in choosing a new pixel brightness value - the average value of the 
sorted array of pixel brightness. In this work we propose an approach that takes into account the noisiness of 
each image 
iI  in the series I, in accordance with the contribution factor 
ik . Scheme of image median addition 
algorithm, taking into account the contribution factor of each image is shown in Fig. 2. 
With a probability, equal to the value of this coefficient 
ik �[0,1]
, addition of image

value to the array of pixel brightness for the median method of image quality improvement is made. Thus, the 
most noisy images contribution factor of which 
ik � 0
, will not participate in the formation of the final 
image 
Isum
. As the result of the algorithm work the final image 
Isum
 is received.

2. Experimental Research and Benefits 
On the basis of the proposed method of image quality enhancement software tools has been developed [12] 
It has been tested on images obtained from standard television camera (TC) of water-cooled power reactor 
(WCPR) in the process of preventative maintenance (this procedure is performed every year on nuclear power 
plants in Russian Federation). On the single images, obtained from TC, impulse noise caused by work of 
common radio and electronic test equipment is found. In Fig. 3 a comparison of a single grayscale series 
image and of the enhanced image, obtained by stacking image series by the proposed method of image quality 
improvement, is shown.

Experimental comparison of the proposed image quality enhancement method with well-known image 
quality improvement methods has been carried out. Experiments have been conducted using grayscale images 
from the image database USC-SIPI [13].  
For the experiment images 5.1.09 - Moon surface � 7.1.03 – Tank have been chosen. Next, two test video 
sequence have been generated using the mentioned images. White Gaussian noise has been imposed on every 
single image of video sequences and image quality of received video sequences has been improved applying 
various methods, in particular, by median composition of images sequence method, by the method, 
implemented in RegiStax (This program is designed for equalization, addition and image processing in 
formats BMP, JPEG, FITS, TIFF , or  series of AVI frames) [14] and the proposed method of image series 
stacking taking into consideration the contribution factor of each image. Quality enhancement results are 
presented in Tables 1 and 2:

As there can be seen from the tables, the proposed method outgoes the method of median images series 
addition, and can be compared with the image series addition method, implemented in the program RegiStax; 
and in determined conditions (discrete number of images in the series) outgoes RegiStax methods in PSNR 
values.

Conclusion 
While conducting research and development relating to the topic of this paper a method of video sequence 
processing in order to receive a single non-noisy image has been suggested. The images series alignment 
algorithm has been developed on the basis of dot matches search and of resolution capacity improvement 
approaches. The multiple images stacking algorithm has been developed to receive a single non-noisy image. 
The proposed method of image quality enhancement is different from the existing ones by using the 
analysis of each series image contribution factor that minimizes the impact of noisy images on the final result. 
It is proved that in comparison with the method of images series median addition the proposed method 
provides the best PSNR value. It is shown that the proposed method is comparable with the image series 
addition method, implemented in the program RegiStax, and when a certain number of images in the series it 
outgoes it in terms of PSNR.
