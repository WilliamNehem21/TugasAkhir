With the evolution of mobile technologies and its applications, more and more government agencies are
putting forth a huge effort to encourage citizens to use mobile government services. Hence, the citizens’
opinion is important to enhance the services and improve their engagement in the government services.
Hence, this study has critically reviewed and explored the existing technology acceptance models and
theories in order to develop an evaluation framework. The proposed framework is empirically tested
by structural equation modeling using data collected from a structured questionnaire. Furthermore,
the validated research model contains important variables to ensure the acceptance of mobile services.
We hope that the implications of this study will help the public organizations and governments to gain
more understanding about what drives the development and acceptance of mobile government services.

1. Introduction
Through the rapid growth of information technology and the
demand for effective and efﬁcient government services, the gov-
ernments have adopted e-governments to provide online services
and more information to citizens, businesses, government agencies
and others [1,2]. Thus, one of the most popular technology is the
mobile technology which is signiﬁcantly changing communication,
learning activities and most importantly changing human–com-
puter interaction [3]. Mobile government is an important case for
the citizens because it has the potential to facilitate the citizens
life; by making the government services available on the mobile
phone instead of them using the traditional way of visiting the gov-
ernment agency and ofﬁces to ﬁll the forms, request information or
apply for a service which requires a lot of efforts and more time to
be wasted traveling to the agency location. Making the govern-
ment services available on phone and accessible anywhere and
anytime, saves effort of traveling physically to the government
agency. It’s just the future of every service in our daily life.
Mobile government helps to enhance the citizen’s accessibility
to online services and facilitates the traditional ways of tasks per-
forming by the government agencies. For instance, citizens using
mobile government can respond ﬁrst to instant information about
trafﬁc accidents. Police or agency inspectors can use Smartphone
or PDA to submit report or data back to home ofﬁces while they
are still in the accident’s location [4]. In addition, governments
can use the mobile services to provide emergency-related informa-
tion (about homeland security, wildﬁres, natural disasters) to citi-
zens [1].
The use of mobile technology is rapidly increasing in our life
nowadays. In 2015, the number of mobile users increased rapidly
in the working places. For example, nowadays 64% of the employ-
ees are using Smartphone’s in their work [5]. Mobile government
can make the government services available and accessible any-
where and anytime, and almost to anyone. Further, aside from
the new technology evolution that takes a place to facilitate mobile
government, several cultural and organizational changes are also
needed [6]. This requires willingness and ﬂexibility to change the
governmental ﬁeld accordingly [7]. One of the critical success fac-
tors of mobile government is the user acceptance [8]. This study
aims to measure the users’ acceptance of mobile governments by
investigating the important factors that play a main role in the cit-
izen’s perspective.

provided system or application. In the ﬁeld of user behavior, there
are two models that have been used popularly namely: Technology
Acceptance Model (TAM) [9] and the Uniﬁed Theory of Acceptance
and Use of Technology (UTAUT) [10].
Different researchers consider different factors to measure
users’ acceptance. For example, in terms of e-banking, some
researchers claimed that perceived ease of use, perceived useful-
ness, privacy and security are the most signiﬁcant variables that
might inﬂuence users’ adoption of the new services [11]. Mean-
while, Lee et al. (2002) argue that self-efﬁcacy and social inﬂuence
factors signiﬁcantly inﬂuence perceived ease of use and perceived
usefulness of using mobile Internet [12]. Consequently, there are
several variables that appear in different theories and models
which are highly similar to the factors used in the technology
acceptance model [13]. In the next section, we are going to
describe the factors used in this study to examine the citizens’
acceptance of mobile government. In the following subsections,
we are going to discuss the model factors and hypotheses which
have
been
adopted
by
previous
researches
and
the
main
approaches in the ﬁeld of user acceptance.
2.1. Social Inﬂuence (SI)
The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and the Theory of Planned
Behavior (TPB) indicate that social inﬂuence (SI) is an important
factor that determines technology usage and acceptance. SI seems
to be more signiﬁcant in the earlier phases rather than the later
phases, to motivate the social and to study the culture needs before
providing new technologies; will increase the usage and the accep-
tance of such technologies [14]. Consequently, the following
hypotheses are proposed:
H1a. Social inﬂuence will have a positive effect on behavioral
intention to use mobile government services.
H1b. Social inﬂuence will have a positive effect on usage behavior
of mobile government services.
2.2. Cost of Service (CS)
To ensure the user acceptance of the price of service provided
by mobile government compared to normal ofﬁce services; the
user beneﬁts should be promoted and clariﬁed, speciﬁcally when
we propose new services to the market. Also, its value must be
in reasonable prices in order to allow users to use such new ser-
vices [15]. The cost of service might affect user’s access to the gov-
ernment services and information either positively or negatively.
Also, the cost of services must reﬂect the value of the speciﬁc
services.
H2. Cost of services will have a negative effect on behavioural
intention to use mobile government services.
2.3. Perceived Trust in Technology (PTT)
PTT plays a vital role in reducing perceived risks of using new
technologies, especially for transactions involving uncertainty.
Since the adoption of mobile government is still in the early stage
in some countries, the users are not clear about the technical capa-
bility of their service provider to provide m-service and about the
security and reliability of the provided services [16]. Citizens’
adoption
behavior,
preferences
and
requirements
might
be
affected by cross-cultural characteristics. The mobile government
adoption behavior should be analyzed focusing on cultural differ-
ences [17].
H3. Perceived trust in technology will have a positive effect on
behavioral intention to use mobile government services.
2.4. Perceived Usefulness (PU)
PU focused on the importance of the provided information. Its
concerns are on how meaningful, informative, relevant, important,
signiﬁcant and helpful is the information or services for user’s deci-
sion [18,19]. It is more about the beneﬁt that user can earn from
using speciﬁc service or application. Hence, the following hypoth-
esis is proposed:
H4. Perceived usefulness will have a positive effect on behavioral
intention to use mobile government services.
2.5. Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU)
PEOU is common factor employed widely in the investigation of
the acceptance of new proposed technology [20]. In past studies’
results, PEOU has an indirect effect on behavioural intention to
use new technologies and a direct effect on attitude toward using
technology [19–21]. PEOU represents the user friendly, the ease of
using services and the error free usage. Thus, the following hypoth-
esis is proposed:
H5. Perceived ease of use will have a positive effect on perceived
usefulness of mobile government services.
2.6. Behavioral Intention (BI)
BI is a major factor aims to predict the user intention to using
the new technology again. This predictor assumes that behavioural
intention will have a positive effect on attitude toward using the
proposed technology [22]. A user’s intention to use the mobile gov-
ernment service is related to real usage of the services [14,23]. The
user’s intention commonly is represent the user’s loyalty which is
depends on several factors such as social inﬂuence, perceived trust
and ease of use. Accordingly, the following hypothesis is proposed
(see Fig. 1):
H6. Behavioral intention will have signiﬁcant effects on the usage
behavior of using mobile government services.
3. Research method
The research method explains a few aspects about the data col-
lected for this study and the sample proﬁle. In the next section, we
are going to discuss the data collection method.
3.1. Data collection
Young citizens are the important target of this study due to
their familiarity with the new technology of mobile devices and
wireless technology. This study adopted a set of questionnaire
raised by past research and studies, as well as concerns mentioned
in the literature related to this study [14,24–26]. The survey items
are measured using 5 point-Likert-scales ranging from strongly
disagree to strongly agree.
The data collection for this study started in February 2016 in the
city of Dammam in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. The data
I. Almarashdeh, M.K. Alsmadi / Applied Computing and Informatics 13 (2017) 194–199
195
were collected randomly from 468 citizens who have used, or have
interest in using, mobile government. The researcher then con-
ducted reliability tests for each construct to assess the goodness
of measure, and indicate accuracy in measurement. The question-
naire consisted of 7 sections. The ﬁrst section collected the demo-
graphic data while the next sections elicited information about the
factors used in the research model (Questionnaire items are pro-
vided in the appendix).
3.2. Sample proﬁle
As shown on the result of the data of the demographic distribu-
tion, 44% were males and 56% of the respondents were females
demonstrating the sufﬁciency of the variety of responses in gener-
alizing the results in both genders. Furthermore, the participants of
this study include a variety of age level from 18 to above 65 years
old. Table 1 shows that most of the respondents (72%) were in the
age level of 18–34 years old. This indicates that this group of peo-
ple represents the major ages of this study.
Fig. 2 explains how the citizens get information about the new
services provided by the local governments. The results show that
25% of the citizens get information about the new services from the
internet source, 22% from television and 20% from the newspaper.
On the other hand, the lowest notiﬁcation comes from magazine
(11%), word of mouth (10%), radio (10%) and SMS messages (2%),
respectively. Even though SMS nowadays is more popular as an
easy way to reach the citizens, still it’s rarely used to notify citizens
about new services.
4. Data analysis
AMOS is the most widely used Structural Equation Modeling
(SEM) to validate the structured data. AMOS version 18.0 was used
in this study to analyze the hypotheses generated. We conducted 2
types of analysis; the ﬁrst was the analysis of the measurement
model while the second was the analysis on the structural model
as recommended by the literature [27].
4.1. Measurement model
The total reliability test of the 28 items (the questionnaire items
available in the appendix) used in this study is 0.902. According to
Hair et al. (2010), the reliability of 0.70 or above is considered to be
acceptable data structured [28]. Hence, as can be seen from Table 2,

the reliability test shows values above 0.70 for all constructs which
shows well-structured data. Table 2 shows the mean value and the
reliability test for all items and constructs (every construct con-
tains 3 items minimum) used in this study.
4.2. The structural model
Using the SEM analysis technique provides the researchers with
different methods of analysis such as conﬁrmatory factor analysis,
latent variable analysis, path analysis, linear structural relation
analysis and covariance structure analysis [27]. Therefore, SEM is
the best for analyzing the strength of casual relationship of the
constructs. Table 3 below summarizes the ﬁt indices used to
observe the structural model as recommended by the previous
studies [29].
The result in Table 3 shows that all measures are above the rec-
ommended values which indicate a good model ﬁt. The model in
Fig. 3 below shows the regression test of the model hypothesis
which indicates that the stringer effect on citizens’ behavioral
intention to use mobile government services is the social inﬂuence
(SI) with value of 0.34, followed by perceived trust in technology
(0.28) which indicates a very strong effect on citizens’ intention
to use mobile government services. The paths analysis shows that
all model hypotheses are supported and have signiﬁcant affect at
the 0.01 level.
5. Discussion
Measuring user acceptance of the provided services is not a
question that we can easily answer but it’s a variable that plays
an important role in the user decision which needs to be examined.
These variables could be money or social or it could be the service
itself, e.g. the service is not important, not useful, not easy to
understand or use. Social Inﬂuence (SI) commonly plays an impor-
tant role in inﬂuencing the individual’s behavior of accepting new
technologies. SI is one of the important variables that have a large
share among technology adoption studies. Social factors or culture
reﬂections heavily inﬂuence individuals who may or may not
accept the new technology based on their beliefs and social back-
ground [30].
The result from the path analysis shows that among all inde-
pendent variables, social inﬂuence has the strongest effect on citi-
zen’s intention to use mobile government (C.R = 0.34). It also
affects the actual use behavior of the mobile government with
regression value of 0.28. Those results give the social inﬂuence fac-
tor the ﬁrst priority among the factors that might affect user accep-
tance of mobile government. The second priority is given to
perceived trust in technology, which affects user intention signiﬁ-
cantly in regression value of 0.30. In contrast, the cost of services is
negatively affecting the citizen’s intention to use mobile govern-
ment. The value of �0.18 indicates that, if the cost of services
decreases that means the citizens intention will increase.
According to the results, perceived usefulness has a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence
on
user
intention
to
use
mobile
governments
(C.R = 0.17). Also, the ﬁndings conﬁrmed that perceived ease of
use has signiﬁcant effect on behavioral intention (C.R = 0.18) which
is in line with TAM’s results in previous studies. Thus, the ﬁndings
indicate that behavioral intention to use mobile government
services is affecting the actual usage behavior (C.R = 0.20). These
results are in accordance with AlAwadhi and Morries (2009),
TAM and UTAUT studies [21,31,32]. These results are contrary to
what Liu et al. (2014) who stated that future research should be
cautious when using TAM and perceived usefulness to interpret
the service adoption in mobile government context [33].
The path analysis indicates that all independent factors have
signiﬁcant positive correlation. Among those factors, the largest
correlation is between social inﬂuence and perceived trust (0.66).
This indication shows that trust can change the society to use
mobile government more and if the trust of technology goes lower,
the social inﬂuence will go low too and that will affect the citizen’s
intention to use mobile government negatively. Also, cost of
service is correlated positively with social inﬂuence (0.63). This
large correlation shows that if the cost of service is cheap the
society will talk about it more and the intention to use mobile
government will be higher.
The implications of this study are directed to implementers and
developers or governments. These bodies need to guarantee the
usefulness, the ease of using mobile government and the secured
trusted technology with lower cost of accessibility. Those factors
will enhance the actual users’ use of mobile government and will
attract the citizen’s intention to use mobile government. That will
enhance the government’s performance and save the cost and time
of both citizens and organizations. Gaining the citizens trust is the
key that motivate the society to use and talk about the mobile gov-
ernment and that will increase the intention to use.
This study contributes to the previous studies by analyzing the
effect of social inﬂuence, perceived usefulness, cost of service,

perceived trust and perceived ease of use on behavioral intention
to use mobile government. At the same time, this effect has been
inﬂuenced indirectly by the correlations between those indepen-
dent variables which inﬂuenced the total effect on behavioral
intention to use mobile government, and the usage behavior. In
our future research, we are going to study the mediated factors
that might affect the citizens’ acceptance of mobile government.
6. Conclusion
This study has critically reviewed and explored the existing
technology acceptance models and theories. The related impor-
tant factors of the existing technology acceptance models are dis-
cussed in view of developing mobile government services and
then integrated into the proposed research model in order to
measure the user’s acceptance of mobile government services.
The proposed model attempts to measure the acceptance of
mobile government among citizens using SEM AMOS18 to test
the research hypotheses. The results of this research show that
independent variables (perceived usefulness, social inﬂuence, cost
of service, perceived ease of use and perceived trust) has signiﬁ-
cant direct effect on the citizens’ behavioral intention to use
mobile government and indirect effect on the actual use behavior.
Among all those affects, social inﬂuence has the strongest effect
on the user’s intention to use mobile government. These implica-
tions indicate that perceived trust in technology is the key for
gaining the social intention to use mobile government services.
Furthermore, we hope that the implications of this study will help
the public organizations and governments to gain more under-
standing about what drives the development and acceptance of
mobile government services. Since this research is limited to a
few factors, we believe that measuring the effect of perceived risk
in the user acceptance of mobile services will bring valid result
for the future research.
