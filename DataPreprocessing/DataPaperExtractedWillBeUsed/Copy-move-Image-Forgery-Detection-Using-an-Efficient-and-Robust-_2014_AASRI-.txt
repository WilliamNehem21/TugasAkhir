Abstract 
In the present digital world, digital images and videos are the main carrier of information. However, these sources of 
information can be easily tampered by using readily available software thus making authenticity and integrity of the 
digital images an important issue of concern. And in most of the cases copy- move image forgery is used to tamper the 
digital images.  Therefore, as a solution to the aforementioned problem we are going to propose a unique method for 
copy-move forgery detection which can sustained various pre-processing attacks using a combination of Dyadic Wavelet 
Transform (DyWT) and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). In this process first DyWT is applied on a given image 
to decompose it into four parts LL, LH, HL, and HH. Since LL part contains most of the information, we intended to 
apply SIFT on LL part only to extract the key features and find a descriptor vector of these key features and then find 
similarities between various descriptors vector to conclude that there has been some copy-move tampering done to the 
given image. And by using DyWT with SIFT we are able to extract more numbers of key points that are matched and thus 
able to detect copy-move forgery more efficiently.

1. Introduction 
In this digital savvy world “seeing is no more believing”. Most of the information is carried in a digital 
form especially in the form of either digital images or digital videos. Thus, they form the main stream of the 
information carrier. These sources can be manipulated very easily. In this paper, we will focus on image 
forgery, which has become a topic of serious concern. The image editing software such as Adobe Photoshop 
is readily available using which any given image can be easily doctored, which can lead to serious 
consequences, as these tampered images can be presented as a part of evidence in the court room leading to a 
wrong decision  and creating the false belief in many real-world applications. Therefore the issue of 
authentication of the images has to be taken very seriously. Most of the forgery detection techniques are 
categorized into two major domains: intrusive/non-blind and non-intrusive/blind [1] as shown in the Fig.1 
Fig.1. Classification of image forgery detection technique 
Intrusive method which is also known as a non-blind method requires some digital information to be 
embedded in the original image when it is generated, and thus it has a limited scope. Some of the examples of 
these methods are watermarking and using digital signature of the camera and not all the digital devices can 
provide this feature. On the other hand, non-intrusive method which is also known as a blind method does not 
require any embedded information. A digital image is said to be forged when its original version is tampered 
by applying various transformations like that of rotation, scaling, resizing, etc. It may also happen that an 
image is tampered by adding noise or by removing or adding some objects to hide the real information [1]. 
Most commonly used image tampering method is copy-move image forgery in this a part of the original 
image is first copied and then pasted on other parts once or may be multiple times to hide some information.

Since it is very easy and effective to implement that makes it most common type of image forgery [2]. A 
copy-move forgery example is presented in Fig.2.

The remaining contents of the paper are presented in following manner. Next section deals with all 
previous work related to image forgery detection. Section 3 completely explains the proposed method, section 
4 deals with simulation results and evaluation of performance parameter and in the end, we have conclusion 
and references. 
2. Related Work 
In this section, we have reviewed most of the blind methods of copy-move image forgery detection. 
Muhammad et al. [3] presented a blind and robust technique using dyadic (undecimated) wavelet transform 
(DyWT) which has better results than Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Li et al. [4] discussed methods 
which reduce the overall computation load. It first applied DWT to decompose the given image into four 
different sub-bands LL, LH, HL, and HH. Since most of the information is present in the low frequency band 
thus low-frequency sub-band, i.e. LL band is divided into overlapping blocks. By doing this number of blocks 
have been reduced and the overall process has speed up. On these blocks, they applied SVD (singular value 
decomposition). H. Huang et al. [5] used SIFT algorithm to represent the features of the given image. SIFT 
algorithm is invariant to changes in illumination, rotation, scaling, etc. Amerini et al. [6], deals with detecting 
whether an image has been forged or not specially using copy-move forgery by using Scale Invariant Features 
Transform (SIFT). SIFT allow to understand that copy-move forgery has occurred, and it also recovers from 
geometric transformation used for cloning. Using this method we can also deal with multiple copy-move 
forgery. Hashmi et al. [10] provided an algorithm by combining DWT and SIFT to detect copy-move image 
forgery. Al-Qershi et al. [11] provided a state-of-art of passive detection of copy-move forgery in digital 
images. The key current’s issues are discussed for developing robust passive copy-move forgery detection. 
Leida Li et al. [12] proposed an efficient method using local binary patterns, in this image is first image is 
filtered and then divided into overlapping circular blocks; features of these blocks are calculated using local 
binary patterns to detect the forged regions. Birajdar et al [13] summarized a complete survey on digital image 
forgery detection using passive techniques, which discussed currently available forgery detection techniques 
87
 Mohammad Farukh Hashmi et al. /  AASRI Procedia  9 ( 2014 )  84 – 91 
and also provide further recommendation for future research. Mahalakshmi et al [14] provided detection of 
digital image forgery by exploring basic image manipulations done on the images. Here they have presented 
techniques to detect image is manipulated using basic method like copy-move, region duplication, splicing etc.
Anand et al. [16] proposed an algorithm to detect the digital image copy move forgery to overcome the 
sustained attacks using SIFT and DyWT methods. 
3. Proposed Methodology 
Through this paper, we are going to propose a new technique for copy-move forgery detection. First image 
is transformed into wavelet domain and SIFT is applied on the transformed image to obtain the features. As 
wavelet produces multispectral components, features are more predominant [7]. Thus after obtaining  interest 
point feature descriptor we go for finding matching between these feature descriptors to conclude whether 
tampering is done to the given image or not. Our works confirm that SIFT features are an optimal solution 
because of their high computational efficiency and robust performance. 
3.1. Dyadic Wavelet Transform (DyWT) 
In related work, we have seen that many previous techniques use DWT for copy-move forgery detection. 
DWT has its own drawback like it is shift invariant and thus less optimal for data analysis. Mallat and Zhong 
[8] introduced the DyWT to overcome the drawback of DWT. DyWT is shift invariant and is different from
DWT because in DyWT there is no down-sampling like that of DWT. The DyWT of an image is computed 
using the algorithm [1]. 
3.2. Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) 
A four stage filtering approach is used in the SIFT algorithm [9]: 
a) 
Detection of Scale space Extrema which are the interest key points   
b) 
Localization of key-points by taking into account only the stable key points 
c) 
Orientation Assignment to the selected key points 
d) 
Key-point Descriptor    
After getting key point matching it may happen that to region of an image may have the same features 
legitimately. So we next go for clustering of key point and forgery detection and in final step estimates 
geometric transformation if tampering has been done to the given image. 
3.3. Algorithm combining DyWT and SIFT 
In order to determine copy-move forgery; first of all we apply dyadic wavelet transform on the given 
image which will decompose the given image in four parts LL, LH, HL, and HH. Since most of the 
information is contained in LL part thus  we apply SIFT feature extraction on LL part as a result we have the 
feature descriptor vectors of the interest points, and finally, we go for finding the match between these feature 
descriptor vectors to mark the forged regions. The proposed algorithm block diagram is shown in Fig. 3.

3.4. Testing robustness against various attacks 
In order to test the robustness of our proposed method, we applied our method on a standard database 
MICC-F220 which contains non-tampered images as well as tampered one having scaled version and some 
have rotation and some have a combination of two or more attacks. Figures in Fig. 4 describe the forgery 
detection results under various attacks

4. Simulation Results 
In result analysis, we applied the proposed algorithm over a standard dataset MICC-F220 [6]. This 
simulation has been performed on MATLAB 2012a software with 32GB Ram and core i7 processor. DyWT 
of the test image is first calculated and on the low-frequency component of DyWT we apply SIFT to extract 
the features which are nothing but descriptor vectors of the object of interest in the test image and the final 
step is to go matching these features to detect copy- move forgery.  
Images shown in Fig. 5 describe various processes involved in proposed method, Fig. 5(a) is the tampered 
test image on which our algorithm is applied, and finally, we got 2395 key-points and 66 matches, thus 
concluding that the given test image is forged.

We are focusing on two major performance parameters at the image level to determine the fact that an 
image has been tampered or not. Considering the image level some of the important measures are described in 
Table 1. 
Table 1. Evaluation Measures Description

  False Negative (FN) 
Number  of  images that have been falsely missed but they are forged.

5. Conclusion 
We thoroughly assessed different types of forgery techniques and decided to develop an algorithm which 
encompasses better performance and robustness for detecting the most common copy-move forgery.  We 
proposed a method which combines DyWT with SIFT. Our efficiency of detection ranked much higher than 
the previously available methods.  DyWT does not incorporate down sampling so the image size is intact and 
low frequency component contains most of the information on which SIFT is applied to extract the features 
and then matching is obtained between the feature descriptors to conclude that a given image is forged or not. 
Our algorithm has higher matching rate, and it is robust to most of the attack and pre-processing techniques 
and also we have better performance parameter’s values on which we can conclude that it’s a feasible one.
