1. Introduction 
The traditional land area measurement technology, in the past, has been on simple of arrows or tapes as 
measurement tools, and the area is general rules, but if meeting irregular shape or large plot, these tools are 
not so precise as other advanced ones. On the other hand, in modern society, many aspects are closely related 
to area measurement, for instance, farm machinery homework charges, farmland contracting measurement, 
enterprise land tax, etc. So it is difficult to meet the requirements if still using the traditional measuring 
methods, and the digital measurement method is effective to resolve that problem.  
2. General Scheme 
The scheme is manipulative to make use of satellite: firstly, the device receives the data sent by the satellite, 
which to interpret the needed information to extract (namely longitude, latitude and altitude). And then

For any latitude point M,  whose distance to the coordinates of the origin is N(N>0)�can be set to 
( N*cos(latitude), N*sin(latitude)). Take it into elliptic epuation, at the same time, have

So for the point(latitude, longitude, height are known), the distance from the origin of ellipsoid is 
R=N+height�At its center to coordinate the origin, establish coordinate as shown in figure 3 below. For any 
point M, in XOY plane projection for P, can draw | OM | = N + height, so M in the Z axis on coordinate is : 
 
           z=(N+height)*sin(latitude)                                                                   �2� 
then�            |OP|=(N+height)*cos(latitude)                                                              �3� 
In XOY plane, the point P on the X axis in the coordinate x and Y axis in the coordinate y, can express as: 
x=|OP| cos(longitude)                                                          �4� 
y=|OP| sin(longitude)                                                          �5� 
By�����available: for any point M, the conversion equation that convert height, longitude and latitude 
into three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate are as followed   
X=(N+height)*cos(latitude)*cos(longitude) 
 
                                  �6� 
Y=(N+height)*cos(latitude)*sin(longitude)                                                              �7� 
Z=( N+height)*sin(latitude)                                                                                              �8� 
And N=a/sqrt(1+(eq) *sin(latitude)*sin(latitude)) ; eq=(a*a-b*b)/(b*b) ; 
3.2 Area Calculation Formula 
Any point’s three-dimensional coordinates caculated in the front can be regarded as x, y, z, take the x, y 
as the projection in the XOY plane. Due to little latitude variation, all latitudes can be regarded varying 
around the average latitude. then the only working needed to do is to calculate the area of projection, 
according to a series of two-dimensional coordinates for

we must utilize the Green’s Calculus Formula. As shown in figure 4, regional D is a close area surrounded by

4. Software Design 
Systematic software basically has the following three parts: GPS data receiving and reading, GPS data 
conversion and storage, the area calculation and display. 
The GPS data is mainly received by the hardware Gstar-89m-J satellite receiving engine, which gets current 
GPS data around the location every short interval. Then it can read the information of latitude, longtitude and 
height by the data. GPS data conversion formulas as the ���have shown. As to data storage, dynamic data 
storage is used in the scheme combined with area calculation formula .To display, call the program after the 
finish of calculation of area, assume the attachment between the last survey point and starting point which 
composes a simulative polygons to display before a not complete measurement, which can provide access to 
view the area during the measurement.   
The software design flow chart is shown as the figure 5.  
5. Results and Analysis 
After mapping ten pieces of areas of different size by two measurement instruments every time with mark
�(the author developed) and mark�the difference, and finally conclude the data as the Table 1 shows : 
From the above table of data, it is known that the measurement area differs from the actual area in some 
errors, but this error is not very big, the minimum error is 0.2635%, the maximum error is 3.086%. At the 
same time we can calculate the average error is 1.172496%. 
To improve the accuracy, the author thinks that the following aspects can be lucubrated: 1.Take the average 
number of latitude as the projection latitude to reduce the errors in the conversion formulas. 2. Take the 
average height as the set height, do not fix on a certain height value.3.Use more sophisticated GPS 
reciever.4.Use the optimal algorithm, so as to improve the accuracy of conversion value and area value, which, 
however, is difficult to achieve for it is not so easy to come up with.

6 Conclusion 
Methods based on the GPS land area measurement have developed for irregular measurement instruments. 
The experimental results show that the instrument is able to quickly and efficiently achieve the function of the 
land area of irregular measurement. And for some projects related to area, the instrument, whose prospect is 
inestimable, has special application value.
