Motor Imagery Brain Computer Interface (MI-BCI) provides a non-muscular channel for communication to those
who are suffering from neuronal disorders. The designing of an accurate and reliable MI-BCI system requires the
extraction of informative and discriminative features. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) has been potent and is
widely used in BCI for extracting features in motor imagery tasks. The classiﬁers translate these features into
device commands. Many classiﬁcation algorithms have been devised, among those Support Vector Machine
(SVM) and
Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) have been widely used. In recent studies, the researchers are using deep
neural networks for the classiﬁcation of motor imagery tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of
dominant feature extraction methods and classiﬁcation algorithms in brain-computer interface for motor imagery
tasks. Authors discuss existing challenges in the domain of motor imagery brain-computer interface and suggest
possible research directions.
1. Introduction
A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) utilizes signals to establish a
connection between a person’s state of mind and a computer-based signal
processing system, which interprets the signals [1]. BCI provides a direct
communicational channel between the brain and an external device
without involving any muscular activities. These systems either use
electroencephalogram (EEG) activity recorded from the scalp or the ac-
tivity of individual cortical neurons recorded from implanted electrodes
[2].
EEG has relatively short time constants, and requires simple and
inexpensive equipment; therefore at present EEG-based BCI systems are
widely used [2–6]. Various forms of electrical brain activities have been
used to discern EEG based BCI systems, such as mu rhythm [7,8], slow
cortical potential [9], event-related p300 [10] and steady-state visual
evoked potential [11,12]. Among various types of electrical brain ac-
tivities, the one related to motor tasks is mu rhythm [13].
Motor imagery (MI) is deﬁned as the cognitive process of imagining
the movement of your own body part without actually moving that body
part [14]. Motor imagery based Brain Computer Interface (MI BCI)
provides an interface for the patients with motor impairment or those
who are in completely locked-in-state to interact with the environment
by controlling robotic prostheses, wheelchairs, and other devices [15].
MI BCI has a wide range of applications, such as controlling a
wheelchair, virtual reality, neurorehabilitation and controlling devices
such as quadcopters in 2-D/3-D space [16–19].
The EEG signal processing for MI BCI involves feature extraction and
classiﬁcation. In feature extraction phase the EEG signal acquired for MI
BCI reveals task-speciﬁc features in both spectral domain and spatial
domain [20]. Several spectral processing methods such as wavelet
transform [21–23], fourier transform [24], autoregressive model [25]
and spatial method such as common spatial pattern (CSP) [26–29] have
been used in literature to extract the features from these EEG signals. CSP
algorithm is the most successful and is widely used in MI BCI due to its
high recognition rate and computational simplicity [30].
The goal of classiﬁcation is to translate the signal features provided by
the feature extractor into commands or orders that carry out user’s intent
[2]. In MI BCI, classiﬁers convert discriminative features into different MI
tasks such as left-right hand movement, foot movement, tongue move-
ment or word generation. Copious classiﬁcation algorithms, such as
support vector machines [31,32], linear discriminate analysis (LDA)
[26–28] neural networks [22,33,34], and deep neural networks [23,24,
35–38] have been applied on MI BCI.

2. Related work
The relevant reviews available on signal processing techniques mostly
focus either on feature extraction methods or on classiﬁcation tech-
niques. Table 1 shows all reviews that are related to feature extraction
and classiﬁcation techniques. The label Yes in table implies that article
presented that particular technique and label No implies vice versa.
Swati Vaid et al. [39] describe the model of BCI system. The author
categorized the techniques into basic techniques and advanced tech-
niques. The basic techniques are time domain and frequency domain
techniques. Advanced techniques are classiﬁed into time frequency
domain and space-time frequency domain. Further, they have summa-
rized the features and its techniques in respective domains.
M. Rajya Lakshmi et al. [40] brieﬂy describe the feature extraction
techniques, which are Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent
Component Analysis (ICA), Auto Regressive Model (AR), Wavelet
Transform (WT) and Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD). Further-
more, the paper has explored the signal processing methods used in each
stage of brain computer interface.
Amjed S. Al-Fahoum and Ausilah A. Al-Fraihat [25] discuss the
feature extraction techniques in frequency domain and time frequency
domain such as fast fourier transform, auto regressive model, wavelet
transform, eigen vectors and time frequency distribution. The authors
have provided recommendations based on the performance.
Lotte et al. [41] discussed the classiﬁcation algorithms used for EEG
based brain computer interfaces. The authors described the properties of
algorithms in detail and compared the performances of the classiﬁers.
Based on the performances the authors provide the guidelines for
selecting the best-suited classiﬁer.
Rupal Chaudhary et al. [42] described the different stages of BCI. The
authors provided a review of classiﬁcation of motor imagery tasks. It has
provided a summary of the paper selected and studied by the author.
All the works discussed in Table 1 provide brief description about any
one of the two important components of signal processing, that is feature
extraction or classiﬁcation. Though M. Rajya et al. has discussed both
feature extraction and classiﬁcation but discussion is not comprehensive.
Certainly, the description and discussion of various signal-processing
components needs further elaboration. It is understood that it would be
more helpful if all the elements of signal processing were presented in a
comprehensive and holistic manner. Based on this perspective the au-
thors have summarized the algorithms available for feature extraction
and classiﬁcation for brain computer interfaces.
Authors in this paper have presented the variants available for feature
extraction methods and all the components are classiﬁed appropriately.
Recently Deep Learning has been introduced as the classiﬁcation
methods for brain computer interfaces [23,24,35–38], which has not
been discussed in previous related works listed in Table 1. As beneﬁts of
deep learning in BCI has been highlighted by different researchers
[35–38], authors in this paper have included a discussion on deep
learning classiﬁcation methods for BCI. Furthermore, the review also
critically examines the various challenges of different modules of BCI.
3. Working principle of BCI system
The working of the BCI system requires three modules that are signal
acquisition module, signal processing, and application module. This
section describes the working of each module. Fig. 1 shows the compo-
nents of BCI and their interactions.
3.1. Signal acquisition module
The Signal Acquisition Module is liable for recording the electro-
physiological signals that provide input to the BCI. These signals are
recorded from the scalp or from the surface of the brain or neuronal
activity [43]. BCI might use either invasive methods or non-invasive
methods for signal acquisition. Invasive methods are electrocardio-
grams (ECoG) and single-neuron recordings [43,44] and have better
signal quality as compared to non-invasive methods. Non-invasive
methods
are
Electroencephalogram
(EEG),
Magnetoencephalogram
(MEG), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRs) [44].
The acquired signals are ampliﬁed to enhance the strength and are
digitized before they are used by any of the computer application.
3.2. Signal processing module
3.2.1. Preprocessing
The task of preprocessing is to prepare the recorded signals for pro-
cessing by enhancing the signal –to- noise ratio (SNR). The part of EEG
signal that comes from muscular activity of head, and eye movement
generate electrical activity that is unrelated to the brain. Such part of
signal is considered as artifact and should not be processed in order to
preserve and exhibit the relevant information; therefore preprocessing is
done to remove artifacts in EEG signals. In BCI research, the proper
preprocessing of EEG signal is important in order to obtain high classi-
ﬁcation accuracy. Preprocessing of BCI is based on the Covariance Matrix
Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) which obtains the spatial and
frequency selection ﬁlters automatically [45].
3.2.2. Feature extraction
After preprocessing the signal is fed into one or more type of feature
extraction algorithms. This component extracts features in the time
domain and frequency domain that encode messages or commands [43].
Wide varieties of feature extraction methods are used in BCI system;

some of these methods include amplitude measures, band power, Hjorth
parameters, autoregressive models, and wavelets and spatial ﬁlters [9].
3.2.3. Classiﬁcation
The task of the classiﬁcation component is to translate the features
provided by the feature extractor to a category of brain patterns; that is
the independent variable is converted into the dependent variable. The
classiﬁcation algorithms may use linear methods like Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) or non-linear
methods such as neural networks.
3.3. Application module
For most current BCIs, the output device is a computer screen and the
output is the selection of targets, letters, or icons presented on it [19].
Some BCIs provide an output, such as cursor movement toward the item
prior to its selection.
The output generated by the output device is the feedback provided to
the user to notify the user about the recognized brain activity pattern.
This pattern is then used to sustain and enhance the accuracy and speed
of communication.
There are various key components in the BCI closed loop, one is
feature extraction and the other is classiﬁcation. There is a large diversity
of feature extraction and classiﬁcation methods that have been explored
in BCI for motor imagery tasks. This paper gives an extensive review of
these two components that are described in the following sections.
4. Feature extraction techniques
During Feature extraction, features are extracted from the signals in
either time domain or frequency domain. As shown in Fig. 2 the feature
extraction process involves frequency ﬁltering, windowing in which
short segments are selected, feature extractor and the feature selection
which outputs the selected features that are being fed into the classiﬁer.
In BCI, frequency band power features and time domain features repre-
sent EEG signals. Band power features represent the power of EEG signals
for a given frequency band averaged over a time window and time
domain features are the combination of EEG signals from all channels. MI
BCI extensively uses band power features. Based on the literature found
and studied as shown in Table 4 it has been noticed that most of the used

or referenced techniques for feature extraction in motor imagery brain
computer interfaces are Short Term Fourier Transform (STFT), Auto
Regressive Model (AR), Wavelet Transform (WT), and Common Spatial
Pattern (CSP). This section gives detailed description of the varied
feature extraction methods used for motor imagery tasks.
4.1. Fast fourier transform (FFT)
The ﬁrst feature extraction method used for MI BCI was based on Fast
Fourier Transform [25] that is applied to estimate the power at chosen
frequency bands in FFT generated spectra. Fourier analysis decomposes
the signal into its frequency components and determines their relative
strengths. FFT does not consider time information, thus it is not able to
analyze
non-stationary
EEG
signals.
In
order
to
represent
the
non-stationary signal the author uses Short Term Fourier Transform
(STFT) [25,46]. In STFT, the signal is divided into small overlapping
frames on which FFT is applied by placing a window function on time
axis as shown in Fig. 3.
When ﬁxed time window function is applied to STFT, it produces
ﬁxed time-frequency resolution that limits the use of STFT. This means
that one can only trade time resolution for frequency resolution or vice
versa.
4.2. Autoregressive (AR) model
The Autoregressive model is the parametric approach that estimates
the Power Spectrum Density (PSD) of the signal. Typically, short epochs
are preferred over longer epochs for analysis in order to characterize the
rapid changes that occur in EEG signal. The spectra obtained from FFT on
short epochs have poor resolution when compared to an autoregressive
model. Although the resolution of FFT could be improved by applying
window function such as Hanning window, but still it have poor reso-
lution as compared to autoregressive model as shown in Fig. 4. The
validity of spectral estimate depends on the selection of proper model
order where model order roughly determines the number of spectral
peaks that need to be captured. If the model order is too low, AR yields
smooth spectrum whereas, if it is too high the spectrum has spurious
peaks [19]. The model order for EEG ranges from 3 to 20 [47].
4.3. Wavelet transform (WT)
Wavelet Transform is the feature extraction technique that extracts
features in time-domain and is used to represent the function by an
inﬁnite number of wavelets where each wavelet has speciﬁc time-
frequency characteristics. The above two techniques, FFT and AR
model uncover only spectral characteristics of signals and do not obtain
good performance with non-stationary EEG signal. Wavelet Transform
combines frequency information and time domain information, which
gives better performance as compared to FFT or AR [25]. WT uses
varying size window such that high frequencies are evaluated on the
shorter window and low frequencies over longer window [48,49] thus
WT performs better in time resolution of high frequencies as compared to
STFT as shown in Fig. 5. The other extensions of WT have also been used
in MI BCI such as Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) [50] and Wavelet
Packet Best Basis Decomposition (WPBBD) [51].
4.4. Common spatial pattern (CSP)
In MI BCI, spatial information is required in multichannel EEG re-
cordings to discriminate intent patterns and therefore, the spatial ﬁlters
have been used to extract spatial information from the signal. Common
Spatial Pattern generates spatial ﬁlters that minimize the variance of one
class and maximize the variance of other class simultaneously. The
multichannel EEG signal is passed into bandpass ﬁlter for selecting the
frequency. After frequency ﬁltering, spatial ﬁltering is performed that
uses spatial ﬁlters and FIR ﬁlters. The process of common spatial pattern

is shown in Fig. 6. CSP is one of the most effective feature extraction
methods used in binary motor imagery task classiﬁcation.
In brain computer interface the objective of spatial ﬁltering used by
the CSP algorithm is to compute features whose variances are optimal for
discriminating two classes of EEG measurements [52]. The performance
of this spatial ﬁltering depends on the operational frequency band of
EEG.
Several
approaches
have
been
proposed
to
ﬁne-tune
the
subject-speciﬁc frequency range for CSP algorithm. One such approach is
the Common Spatio-Spectral Pattern (CSSP) [53], which optimizes sim-
ple ﬁlters with a spatial ﬁlter. Another approach was the Common Sparse
Spectral-Spatial Pattern (CSSSP) [54]. It improves the CSSP algorithm by
performing simultaneous optimization of an arbitrary FIR ﬁlter within
the CSP algorithm.
An alternative approach called Sub Band Common Spatial Pattern

(SBCSP) [55] was proposed in which EEG signals are decomposed into
sub-bands. CSP is applied to each sub-band that deﬁnes sub-band score
and then these scores are fused together to derive the ﬁnal decision.
SBCSP has improved classiﬁcation accuracy when compared to CSSP and
CSSSP.
As compared to SBCSP, a more generalized approach called Filter
Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) [56] was proposed that
comprised of four stages: frequency ﬁltering, spatial ﬁltering, feature
selection, and classiﬁcation. It deploys a small subset of effective spatial
ﬁlters that reduces computational complexity against SBCSP. A variant,
named Discriminative FBCSP (DFBCSP) [57] was proposed to enhance
classiﬁcation accuracy. DFBCSP extracts subject speciﬁc discriminative
frequency bands from the set of ﬁlters instead of using ﬁxed frequency
bands for all subjects as in FBCSP.
In 2016, Separable Common Spatio Spectral Patterns (SCSSP) [20]
had been proposed that jointly processed the data in both spectral and
spatial domains and had low computational cost over FBCSP. This
approach was suitable for wearable mobile BCI systems. FBCSP used the
ﬁxed partition of a frequency band that leads to loss of information in the
frequency domain. The augmented CSP [58] based on varying partition
of the frequency band with different bandwidths had solved the problem
of information loss.
Some other variants of CSP found in literature are sparse CSP [59]
that impose sparsity on weights by adding regularization factor on spatial
ﬁlter, stationary CSP [60] that uses stationary subspaces, divergence CSP
[61] that utilizes information from other subjects and enforce different
invariance formulating divergence maximization problem, and probabi-
listic CSP [62] that solves the problem of overﬁtting.
While all these variants improve the standard CSP algorithm, they are
still unable to characterize temporal (time-related) dynamics; thus, more
sophisticated techniques that consider time-related information are
required. The features extracted from CSP are then fed into various
classiﬁers for classiﬁcation.
The different prominent feature extraction techniques used for MI BCI
along with advantages and limitations are summarized in Table 2.
5. Classiﬁcation techniques
The classiﬁcation is a process of predicting the target variables or
classes from the given input. To build the classiﬁcation model, learning
algorithm is applied in the training phase to adjust the parameters of the
model as shown in Fig. 7. The same model is then used in the testing
phase to extract the output. In motor imagery brain computer interface
the features extracted by various feature extraction techniques are con-
verted into different motor imagery tasks like hand movements, foot
movement, word generation and alike through classiﬁcation algorithms.
The authors have classiﬁed the classiﬁcation algorithms used in the
literature as linear classiﬁers, neural networks, non-linear classiﬁers, and
deep neural networks. Linear Classiﬁers use the linear function to
distinguish classes. Two main types of linear classiﬁers are Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [26–38] and Support Vector Machine (SVM)
[29,31,63] and have been commonly used in testing of BCI. Neural
Network (NN) is an assembly of different artiﬁcial neurons, which en-
ables to produce nonlinear decision boundaries. The NN speciﬁcally
created and used for BCI is Gaussian Classiﬁer [41]. Non-linear classiﬁers
produce non-linear decision boundaries and are generative. These clas-
siﬁers are not widespread and not popular as the linear classiﬁer and
neural networks in MI BCI. Deep Neural network (DNN) is an artiﬁcial
network with multiple layers called as hidden layers between input and
output layers and is used to model complex non-linear relationships. The
classiﬁers based on deep neural networks have been used in MI BCI
research to improve the accuracy of multiclass signal analysis.
This section gives a detailed description of the linear classiﬁer,

classiﬁer based on neural network and the deep neural network that is
used in the ﬁeld of MI BCI.
5.1. Linear discriminative analysis (LDA)
LDA classiﬁer has the low computational requirement that makes it a
commonly used classiﬁer in EEG based BCI applications. LDA projects
data into new space using projection y ¼ wTx that minimizes the scatter
within the class and maximizes between the classes as illustrated in
Fig. 8.
LDA has been successfully used for classiﬁcation of right and left-hand
motor imagery [41]. The main drawback of LDA is that it provides the
poor result on complex nonlinear EEG data [65]. Regularized Fisher LDA
[27], an enhancement of LDA has also been used for right and left-hand
motor imagery that uses decision boundary or hyperplane in feature
space for classifying features in distinct classes. Fisher LDA obtains better
generalization capabilities and gives better results than LDA [65].
5.2. Support vector machine (SVM)
Support Vector Machine has been very popular in BCI research. SVM
selects the hyperplane that maximizes the distance from the nearest
training points. Linear SVM uses the linear function as decision bound-
aries while nonlinear SVM uses the kernel function to map the data into
higher dimensional space [29]. Linear SVM and non-linear SVM is shown
in Fig. 9.
Md Rabiul Islam et al. (2017) [63] uses SVM on features with reduced
dimension obtained by employing multiband TSM and PCA respectively
for four class classiﬁcation problems. Some other ﬂavors of SVM like
Transition Detection based SVM (TD-SVM) [31] and Evolved ﬁlters based
SVM [32] have been used for MI BCI. In TD-SVM, the classiﬁcation
problem is divided into two sub-problems: detecting class transitions and
determining the class for sequences of instances between transitions.
Evolved
ﬁlters
based
SVM
algorithm
optimizes
spatial
and
frequency-selection ﬁlters by means of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation
Evolution Strategy. SVM is known to have good generalization properties
and is insensitive to the curse-of-dimensionality [64].
5.3. Neural network (NN)
SVM gives high-quality results but is not able to handle the multiclass
problem and dynamic nature of EEG signal effectively. Robust classiﬁers
give better performance but need more time; therefore, there is a tradeoff
between accuracy and speed. As the neural network provides reasonable
tradeoff, it has been extensively used in BCI research. There are several
NN architectures used in the ﬁeld of BCI, the one that has been
speciﬁcally created for BCI is the Gaussian classiﬁer [65,66]. Each unit of
this NN is a Gaussian discriminant function representing a class proto-
type. This classiﬁer has been applied with success to motor imagery [22]
and mental task classiﬁcation [34]. Other NN architectures such as
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), neural network based on Radial Basis
Function (RBF), spiking neural network [67] that uses Online Meta
neuron based Learning Algorithm (OMLA) has been applied for classiﬁ-
cation of MI tasks. NN has also been successfully applied for multiclass
multiuser MI tasks [22] classiﬁcation.
5.4. Deep learning
In the traditional neural network, weights have to be chosen very
carefully. This is a major obstacle in the effective use of the neural
network in many applications of BCI. In recent studies, researchers have
been using deep learning approach as deep neural network has high
descriptive power and thus improves the accuracy of the system. Deep
learning has successful performance in the ﬁeld of computer vision and in
recent years has also been applied in classiﬁcation of motor imagery tasks
[24,68]. Initially, Na Lu et al. [24] proposed an approach to use manually
extracted features from the channels based on FFT and then feed them
into a Deep Belief Network (DBN). Among various deep learning archi-
tectures Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is effectively used for
classiﬁcation of motor imagery tasks [23,35–38,69] due to its regulari-
zation structure and degree of translation invariance. The Convolutional
neural network is a class of deep feed-forward artiﬁcial neural network
that uses a variation of multilayer perceptrons. A simple CNN is a
sequence of layers, and every layer of a CNN transforms one volume of
activations to another through a differentiable function. CNN architec-
ture consists of the input layer, convolution layer, pooling layer, fully
connected layer and output layer as shown in Fig. 10. The Convolutional
layer is the core building block of CNN and does most of the computation.
Pooling layer reduces the spatial size of representation and neurons in
fully connected layer have full connections to the previous layer.
Siavash et al. [36] and Huijuan et al. [58] proposed CNN architecture
that uses dynamic energy based features for classifying multiclass motor
imagery EEG signals. In Ref. [36] the author proposed a parallel archi-
tecture that uses 3 layered MLP for static energy features and CNN for
dynamic energy features with dropout regularization. The predictions
from both the networks are joined via averaging. The framework yields a
signiﬁcant increase in classiﬁcation accuracy as compared to the support
vector machine. In Ref. [58] the author proposed an architecture that
uses augmented CSP for feature extraction. The energy features are ar-
ranged on a 2D matrix and CNN is then trained on this matrix to
discriminate the features. Further, the feature maps are selected by using
the map selection algorithm after the convolution.
In the past, CNN has been used for classiﬁcation of left and right
motor imageries that use time-frequency representation as input [23,35].
The author [23] proposed an architecture that uses Continuous Wavelet
Transform with morlet and bump wavelets for feature learning. The 1D
convolution is conducted at convolution layer to analyze spectral char-
acteristics
over
time.
The
framework
has
achieved
promising
performance.
More recently, CNN has been applied for the classiﬁcation of multi-
class motor imagery tasks using temporal representations [38]. Another
framework [37] that is applied for multiclass motor imagery task consists
of temporal feature extractor, spatial feature extractor and a classiﬁer
that is learned jointly in an end-to-end manner. The framework uses
recurrent convolution layers and has shown acceptable performance.
The classiﬁers in the ﬁeld of MI BCI, along with their advantages and
limitations, have been described in Table 3.
6. Literature cited
According to various studies reviewed in this paper, it has been found
that most of the work is based on publicly available dataset and is limited

to upper limb imageries. Among the classiﬁcation methods, SVM is
commonly used and has promising results. Although Shallow CNN has
shown the promising results in MI BCI research; still the deep neural
networks is lagging in performance due to unavailability of the large
training dataset. The earlier studies focus on two class motor imagery
that is now shifting towards multiclass and multilabel motor imageries in
recent studies.
Table 4 presents the summary of the literature studied related to the
motor imagery brain computer interface.
Table 5 shows the performance comparison of Common Spatial
Pattern and Wavelet Transform with different classiﬁcation techniques
using publicly available dataset BCI Competition III. The table reveals
that the Wavelet Transform has accuracy of 86.20% with CNN classiﬁer,
which is highest among all other classiﬁers, used with Wavelet Trans-
form. Moreover, Common Spatial Pattern is also effective with the clas-
siﬁcation techniques that are based on Deep Learning or Deep Neural
Network.
7. Challenges
Various feature extraction and classiﬁcation algorithms have been
applied successfully for EEG based BCI for motor imagery tasks and ob-
tained good accuracy results, still, there are some unresolved issues and
challenges that attract attention from researchers from varied domains.
Pertaining to open issues and challenges are listed in Table 6.
7.1. Feature extraction
EEG signal is usually very noisy and time-variable; therefore, it is
challenging to extract relevant features from EEG measurements in a very
short time window. Although Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and its
variants are popular and extensively used in BCI, it does not consider the
temporal structure of the signal that results in loss of temporal infor-
mation (time-related information) [77]. Thus, sophisticated time series
modeling techniques are required that consider temporal dynamics.
There has been some research [28,36,38] in recent years that has
considered temporal dynamics and improved the classiﬁcation accuracy
to some extent. The author in Ref. [38] proposed a parallel MLP and CNN
architecture where MLP uses log energy based features and CNN uses a
temporal representation of selective EEG channels from FBCSP algo-
rithm. The combination of architecture used by the author resulted in a
small and consistent increase in all subjects. The author has suggested
research directions in preprocessing of data, optimization of hyper-
parameter in parameter selection and in proposing a modiﬁed architec-
ture that should be based on the combination of static and dynamic
energy features.
The author in Ref. [28] presents an algorithm for determining fea-
tures that used a combination of temporal, spectral and spatial infor-
mation. The proposed algorithm is a four-phase method based on the
static selection of subject-speciﬁc information to reduce classiﬁcation
error. The authors suggested that automatic subject selection and
multivariate feature selection methods might be used further to enhance
the accuracy of the system.
Owing to the efﬁciency of CSP for binary classiﬁcation, it has been
extensively used in brain computer interfaces to overcome the limitation
of the subject-speciﬁc frequency band. However, the performance of CSP
and its variants in multiclass classiﬁcation remain an open challenge due
to the dramatic increase in the number of feature subsets in MI tasks.
7.2. Classiﬁcation
The challenges related to classiﬁcation have been discussed in three
articles where Na Lu et al. [24] suggested that the classiﬁcation algo-
rithms available needed large computation and are unsuitable for online

processing. Thus, there is a need to test and validate classiﬁcation algo-
rithms online as they are computationally efﬁcient and can be used in
real time. Further, in order to provide a reasonable tradeoff between
accuracy and efﬁciency, robust classiﬁers have to be developed that can
be easily used online and are able to work with non-stationary data
efﬁciently. Furthermore, the authors in Refs. [19,74] suggested a new
generation of classiﬁcation methods considering the user in the loop has
to be developed to ensure efﬁcient brain computer interfaces.
7.3. Hardware and BCI functioning
Chih-Yu Chen et al. [26] proposed a novel classiﬁcation method that
has used CSP for feature extraction and LDA for classiﬁcation to solve the
misclassifying problem. The proposed method is efﬁcient and has high
accuracy. The author also suggested having algorithm-device integration
to make the system more efﬁcient and practicable.
In traditional methods of signal processing, feature extraction and
classiﬁcation was performed separately which associates heavy compu-
tational burden. The concept of neural network combines the feature
extraction and classiﬁcation in one pipeline and has been explored for
binary classiﬁcation [24]. However, the use of neural network is suc-
cessful in binary classiﬁcation but increases the calibration time in BCI
[38]. The author suggested adopting transfer learning and domain
adaptation to have calibration free BCIs. Moreover pipelining in multi-
class classiﬁcation is still a challenge [29].
7.4. Data collection and modality
Deep architectures have been successful in computer vision and other
ﬁelds due to their high learning capacity and being trained on the huge
amount of data. In EEG-based BCI researches, gathering subject-speciﬁc
data and capturing non-stationary nature is a hindrance to classiﬁca-
tion accuracy of MI tasks [36].
Other challenges could be signal modality [36] and lack of training
data [36] that hinders the development of efﬁcient brain computer
interfaces.
The above-stated challenges can be explored in different domains,
which are machine learning, signal processing, and hardware speciﬁca-
tions. Correlation between reported challenges in Table 4 and the pro-
spective research domains have been represented by Fig. 11.

8. Conclusion
The paper presented the comprehensive comparison of prominent
feature extraction techniques used for EEG based BCI for motor imagery
tasks. Currently CSP is the most preferred method of feature extraction.
The presented review highlighted the various features like frequency
band, spatial ﬁlters, and presence of artifacts in the signal on which the
performance of CSP is highly dependent.
This paper also discussed the various classiﬁcation methods currently
used for motor imagery BCI. Classiﬁcation methods are detailed by
various categories: linear, non-linear, neural network and deep learning.
Support vector machine is the commonly used classiﬁer as it is insensitive
to curse of dimensionality. In recent studies, several deep learning ar-
chitectures were also used as a classiﬁcation method for motor imagery
tasks, among that shallow convolutional neural network is the prominent
architecture
and
has
outperformed
the
traditional
methods
of
classiﬁcation.
Authors have explored the various challenges of different modules of
BCI and these challenges were mapped with the domains of machine
learning, signal processing and hardware speciﬁcations.
Future work related to MI BCI should focus on developing informa-
tion extraction techniques that consider the automatic selection of sub-
ject relevant temporal information. Additionally, robust classiﬁers needs
to be evolved so as to work with noisy signals and high dimensionality
data. There is also a need to develop the new generation of classiﬁcation
methods that should consider the user in the loop to provide feedback
from which the user can learn; and help to build an accurate and efﬁcient
BCI system.
