The ability to characterize rapidly and repeatedly exchangeable potassium (Kex) content in the soil is essential for
optimizing remediation of radiocaesium contamination in agriculture. In this paper, we show how this can be
now achieved using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a large Mid-Infrared (MIR) soil
spectral library (40,000 samples with Kex determined with 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7), compiled by the National Soil
Survey Center of the United States Department of Agriculture. Using Partial Least Squares Regression as a base-
line, we found that our implemented CNN leads to a signiﬁcantly higher prediction performance of Kex when a
large amount of data is available (10000), increasing the coefﬁcient of determination from 0.64 to 0.79, and
reducing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error from 135% to 31%. Furthermore, in order to provide end-users
with required interpretive keys, we implemented the GradientShap algorithm to identify the spectral regions
considered important by the model for predicting Kex. Used in the context of the implemented CNN on various
Soil Taxonomy Orders, it allowed (i) to relate the important spectral features to domain knowledge and (ii) to
demonstrate that including all Soil Taxonomy Orders in CNN-based modeling is beneﬁcial as spectral features
learned can be reused across different, sometimes underrepresented orders.

1. Introduction
Remediation of radioactive contamination of farmland requires ac-
curate soil data. In case of nuclear emergencies affecting food and agri-
culture, exchangeable potassium (Kex) plays a major role. As potassium
competes with radiocaesium in soil-to-plant transfer, it can help reduce
the crop uptake of this major fallout radionuclide. Information on potas-
sium content in the soil is essential for optimizing remediation of radio-
active contamination as happened in 1986 in Chernobyl or in 2011 in
Fukushima (Komatsu et al., 2017). The ability to characterize Kex
rapidly and repeatedly will inform and facilitate decision making, and
signiﬁcantly reduce the cost of analyses needed for remediation over
the years.
Traditional methods for characterizing soil properties, such as Kex,
through wet chemistry can provide high accuracy and precision, but it
is often cost and time prohibitive (Viscarra Rossel et al., 2006). For
several decades, soil scientists have been successfully using visible,
near and mid-infrared spectroscopy techniques to estimate a wide
range of soil physical, chemical, and biological properties (Viscarra
Rossel et al., 2006; Frost et al., 2007; Shepherd and Walsh, 2007;
Bellon-Maurel et al., 2010; Grinand et al., 2012; Peng et al., 2014;
Torres Astorga et al., 2018; Dangal et al., 2019; Ng et al., 2022). MIRS
is often more accurate and produces more robust calibrations than
near-infrared reﬂectance spectroscopy (NIRS) when analyzing ground,
dry soils (Viscarra Rossel et al., 2006; Ng et al., 2019b). However, models
developed to estimate soil characteristics are often limited in scope, as
only small and region-speciﬁc MIR spectral libraries of soils are available
(Viscarra Rossel et al., 2008; de Sousa Mendes et al., 2022). The lack of
standardization of wet chemistry methodologies (Viscarra Rossel and
Bouma, 2016) coupled with situations of low data availability, or so-
called low data regimes, also have long caused calibration models
overﬁtting small and often noisy datasets (Torres Astorga et al., 2018).
To avoid such overﬁtting often involves careful data pre-processing
and dimensionality reduction (Viscarra Rossel et al., 2022), which are
all pervading themes in MIRS soil data processing and statistical learn-
ing in general (Hastie et al., 2009).

The situation of data scarcity is, however, changing rapidly today
with the availability of large, and growing, high-quality and less
region-speciﬁc libraries of MIR-scanned soil samples. A strong example
is the spectral library maintained by the National Soil Survey Center
(NSSC) Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) from the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA-NRCS), which is available to the
global scientiﬁc community.
The unprecedented volume and diversity of data now available,
often released in accordance with open data policies, allows soil science
researchers to increasingly shift their focus from traditional modeling
techniques such as Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to classes
of Machine Learning (ML) models of higher complexity, such as
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
CNN is a class of deep neural networks commonly applied to data
that has a grid-like topology, such as images, audio or time series. A no-
table characteristic of deep neural networks is their ability to learn and
detect patterns in a hierarchical way. For instance, in the context of
image recognition tasks, it has been shown that the ﬁrst convolutional
layers learn low-level features such as diagonal, horizontal and vertical
edges while further layers learn higher-semantic components such as
corners, circles or even complex images (Zeiler and Fergus, 2013).
Harnessed recently in Mid-infrared soil spectroscopy, CNN has proved
to be capable to learn, hence automate, spectra preprocessing steps
and to relate complex absorption peak patterns to the presence of soil
properties to be characterized and predicted (Ng et al., 2019b).
The performance gain of CNN compared to PLSR may not be signiﬁ-
cant for some parameters that are easy to predict such as soil organic
carbon or calcium carbonate. However, recent studies showed that,
under a large data regime, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) out-
perform PLSR on most soil property predictions (Wijewardane et al.,
2018; Ng et al., 2019b; Shen and Viscarra Rossel, 2021; Shen et al.,
2022; Ng et al., 2022). Further, performance of property prediction
through PSLR can be often very low for some certain soil parameters
(Ng et al., 2019b; Wijewardane et al., 2018), in particular when the re-
lationship between the spectra and these properties is non-linear as
for instance for Kex. This inferior performance is known to be related
to the fact that this soil property has no direct or strong spectral
features to support the calibration model and is only inferred in
relation to other spectrally active soil components (Janik and
Skjemstad, 1995; Sanderman et al., 2020).
However, if such a relationship exists and can be learned, it is neces-
sary to have classes of models such as CNN capable of (i) extracting in-
depth information from the spectra for better calibration purposes and
(ii) exploiting a large and diverse spectral library. To the best of our
knowledge, the estimation of Kex at a level of performance sufﬁcient
for nuclear remediation using a large MIR spectral library and a CNN
algorithm has never been tested until KSSL database has been made
available to the public recently.
Moreover, when intended to be used to derive new scientiﬁc
insights, inform decision-making and policies during large-scale crisis
responses, machine learning algorithms not only need to demonstrate
enough predictive power, but must also equip end-users with interpre-
tive keys allowing to understand on which basis, on which features
(spectral regions) of the input data these predictions are made.
In theory, based on vibrational spectroscopy principles, and under
controlled conditions with deﬁned mixtures of soil constituents, charac-
teristic infrared electromagnetic radiation absorption patterns can be
attributed to functional groups and chemical bonds (Socrates, 2004).
In practice, this is more challenging based on the measurement condi-
tions and when analyzing soil constituents like Kex that are in lower
concentrations and only being observed by correlation with other
spectrally active major soil components (Sanderman et al., 2020). Yet,
the interpretation and the ability to assign spectral features to
fundamental vibrations of speciﬁc soil properties is key (i) to develop
more
parsimonious
models
through
the
selection
of
speciﬁc
wavenumbers, known as important, during the preprocessing, feature
extraction and modeling phases (Viscarra Rossel and Lark, 2009;
Mehmood et al., 2012; Ng et al., 2019a), (ii) to better understand
model output, and provide insight into how these models can be
further improved (Viscarra Rossel and Behrens, 2010), (iii) to
potentially shed new lights on the current state of knowledge of the
soil processes being modeled (Lundberg and Lee, 2017) and (iv) to
foster end-users trust and facilitate adoption of machine learning-
based technologies (Molnar et al., 2020).
So far, methods used to interpret the contribution of each input
feature (i.e., the absorption of electromagnetic radiation at a particular
wavenumber)
to
a

output
are
either

speciﬁc
(Terhoeven-Urselmans et al., 2010; Viscarra Rossel et al., 2016;
Clairotte et al., 2016; Wijewardane et al., 2018; Landre et al., 2018;
Gomez et al., 2020) or have a high computational cost (Ng et al.,
2019b). In addition, those methods average features' importance over
all predictions whereas importance for individual or a group of predic-
tions, for instance by Soil Taxonomy Order, is of crucial importance for
both model developers and radiological environmental remediation
domain experts (Molnar et al., 2020).
In this publication, our ﬁrst hypothesis is that the ability to character-
ize Kex in soil at a sufﬁcient level of performance for remediation is
conditioned by the availability of a large amount of data and the use of
high capacity model classes such as CNN. Our second hypothesis is that
CNN-based soil property prediction beneﬁts from merging MIRS informa-
tion from a wide range of soil types (Soil Taxonomy Orders), even when
data are not equally distributed across all orders. By merging, soil orders
with a low amount of data in the KSSL dataset also beneﬁt from the
CNN leaning process, reusing, when possible, spectral features learned
on well represented soil orders. Such a feature would provide a major op-
portunity to address the lack of data on the fate of radionuclides in poorly
explored environments such as arid, tropical and monsoonal climates.
Therefore, in this study, our ﬁrst aim is to assess the ability of CNN
models to predict Kex in soil when trained on a large MIRS spectral li-
brary with a sufﬁcient level of accuracy for the remediation of radioac-
tive contamination of agricultural land. To articulate the role of the
data regime and model capacity in this analysis, PLSR is used as a base-
line. Our second aim is to investigate, through the analysis of model's
performance across Soil Taxonomy Orders, how domain experts can ex-
ploit CNN interpretability algorithms to gain new insights into the soil
processes being modeled and build conﬁdence in the decision-making
process during nuclear remediation.

resources is also a key ingredient of reproducibility research.
2.2. Data selection, preprocessing
The ability to predict and characterize Kex is key to optimize the
remediation of radioactive contamination in agriculture. For this

study, we focused on a selection of the Mid-Infrared Spectral database
made available to the Joint FAO/IAEA Centre of Nuclear Techniques in
Food and Agriculture by the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL)
from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA-NRCS). The
Mid-Infrared spectra were acquired on air-dried and ground soil sam-
ples using a Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer with an HTS-XT high-
throughput accessory (Dangal et al., 2019). In total 50,494 samples
were identiﬁed and selected from the dataset, on which Kex was
measured (as of January 2022). The mid-infrared spectra (from
wavenumbers 4000 to 600 cm−1 at resolution of 2–1764 wavenumbers
in total) were systematically centered and normalized, for both the
baseline (PLSR) and CNN models, using the Standard Normal Variate
transform (SNV) (Barnes et al., 1989). When used to train the baseline
model, a Savitsky-Golay transformation (window length of 11, polyno-
mial order of 1 and ﬁrst derivative) was further applied and the CO2
spectral region was removed to avoid inﬂuence from this artifact
independent from the soil analysis (from wavenumbers 2269 to 2389
cm−1). The CNN will safely ignore the CO2 spectral region and learn
the ﬁrst derivative (ﬁnite difference) operator if it is deemed
necessary to Kex prediction, hence, both pre-treatments were not
applied in that case.
In the dataset involved in this study, Kex content in the soil has been
measured using the NH4OAc pH 7 extraction method (in cmol(+).
kg−1). Table 2 provides the summary statistics of the empirical
distribution of these measurements and their log10-transformation
before any data selection (50,494 measurements in total).
Figure 1 shows both the number of samples and the distribution of
Kex concentration by Soil Taxonomy Orders (Baillie, 2001) before any
selection. We observe that certain soil orders are largely under-
represented although their inclusion in the majority “Undeﬁned” class
remains theoretically possible. However, the relative distribution of
the deﬁned soil orders, from Mollisols to Oxisols, is representative of
soil types present in the geographical area covered by the KSSL dataset
(United States mainly) (Dangal et al., 2019).
The method detection limit (MDL) for Kex content (target variable),
through the NH4OAc pH 7 extraction method, used for the KSSL data-
base, is 0.06 cmol(+).kg−1 while its Practical Detection Limit (PDL) is
0.30 cmol(+).kg−1 (5 times of MDL), set higher than the PDL in pure
chemistry (approximately 3.3 times of MDL) because of more complex
matrices in soil extracts (Klesta and Bartz, 1996). However, the appro-
priate Kex content to ensure radiocaesium concentration of 99% of
brown rice below the target level was 0.14 cmol(+).kg−1 in
Fukushima area. To include this appropriate Kex content (0.14 cmol
(+).kg−1), the detection limit used in this study is closer to the MDL
and a threshold of 0.12 cmol(+).kg −1 was applied, i.e. two times the
MDL. About 20% of data had values below that threshold and the re-
maining 80% of the data, i.e. 40,132 samples, was log10-transformed to
avoid weighting the loss functions accounting for the heteroscedasticity
of the prediction residuals otherwise.
2.3. Modeling
2.3.1. Evaluation scheme
For all experiments conducted in this study, the data were randomly
split in the following proportions: 80% for training, 10% for validation
and 10% for testing. To optimize model hyperparameters, an “early stop-
ping“ technique was used. The number of components or epochs for the
PLSR and CNN model respectively was increased so long as the loss on
validation continued to decrease. When the loss either leveled off or in-
creased during three consecutives increases of the hyperparameters,
the training was stopped. Models were then trained, validated and
tested on 20 different versions (random seeds) of this splitting scheme
(i) to assess their robustness and (ii) to mitigate the effect of relatively
small sample sizes for certain Soil Taxonomy Orders such as Oxisols,
Vertisols, Gelisols and Histosols. For each of these different 20 random
splits, both models were exposed to the same train, validation and test
(unseen) data. The mean performance as well as their standard devia-
tion were reported.

To assess the ability of the PLSR and CNN models to leverage an in-
creasing data regime, PLSR and CNN models were also trained on ran-
dom subsamples of increasing sizes of the data and their performance
on the test sets portrayed through the so-called “Learning curve”
graph (Viering and Loog, 2021).
The assessment of the models was further performed in two differ-
ent contexts that we call in this study “global” and “local”. In the global
setting, the models were trained on all data and performance was
assessed on the entire test set and by Soil Taxonomy Orders. To provide
further insights into the CNN training process, the validation loss by Soil
Taxonomy Orders was also monitored as the number of epochs in-
creased during training. In the local setting, the models were trained
by Soil Taxonomy Orders separately, and tested on the Soil Taxonomy
Orders they were trained on. Only performance on Mollisols, Vertisols
and Gelisols are reported (i) to highlight the role of distinctive data re-
gimes (from high to low), and (ii) to assess the ability of the CNN model
to “re-use” or transfer spectral features learned across different Soil Tax-
onomy Orders, in particularly between well and non-represented ones
in the MIRS KSSL dataset.
2.3.2. Metrics
To evaluate both the PSLR and the CNN models on training, valida-
tion and test datasets, the following metrics were used: (i) coefﬁcient
of determination (R2) and (ii) Lin's concordance correlation coefﬁcient
(LCCC). LCCC measures the linear correlation between the predicted
and true values but penalized by a bias term allowing to assess the
agreement between the observed and predicted values with respect to
the 1:1 line (Lawrence and Lin, 1989). These two metrics were calcu-
lated on the log10-transformed version of the true and predicted values
of Kex. In addition, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (MAPE) were calculated on the original scale of the
target
variable
to
facilitate
interpretation
and
provide
two
complementary perspectives on the performance of the models.
Indeed, given the skewed empirical distribution of the target variable,
RMSE and MAPE tend to overweight errors made respectively for
large and small Kex values. Bias was also calculated on the original
scale and reported.

2.3.3. Architecture of convolutional neural network models
PLSR was used as a baseline in this study, to highlight its behavior in
increasing data regimes.
The design of our CNN was inspired by the VGG16 architecture
(Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014) stacking uniform convolution-
pooling layers with small kernel sizes (i) to promote automatic extrac-
tion of hierarchical features, (ii) to control the growth in the number of
learned parameters and (iii) to dispose of sufﬁcient model capacity to
predict Kex in large data regime.
Fig. 2 provides an overview of the architecture of our Convolutional
Neural Network consisting of two main components:
• A features learner composed of stacked blocks, each consisting of a
convolutional, batch normalization, non-linear activation and average
pooling layers, with each consecutive block seeing its depth (number
of ﬁlters) doubled (up to 512 in the last block).
• A task learner that (i) ﬂattens the learnt features maps, (ii) performs
dimensionality reduction of ﬁnal features into a 20-dimensional latent
space using a fully connected layer and ﬁnally (iii) applies a non-linear
activation and a single neuron linear layers (with no further activation
function) predicting the soil property of interest. A Dropout and Batch
Normalization layers were also added.

The model used in our study has 162,401 trainable parameters in
total and was regularized using early stopping (after 3 epochs without
validation loss decrease) to guarantee its generalization property and
prevent overﬁtting.
While we relied on sensible defaults with regards to the network archi-
tecture and did not perform extensive hyperparameters tuning, we used
cyclic learning rates (Smith, 2017). The motivation behind cyclic learning
rates is that, by alternatively decreasing and increasing the learning rate,
we give to the optimizer the opportunity to explore, visit multiple local
minima of the loss function and hopefully prevent the optimizer from get-
ting trapped in a local minimum. In this study, we use an Adam optimizer
(Kingma and Ba, 2014) with cyclic learning rates between 3 × 10−5 and
1 × 10−3. A Mean Squared Error loss was used to optimize the CNN and
the determination of the min and max learning rates was decided based
on the structure of the loss over 8 learning epochs (Smith, 2017).
2.4. Interpretability
In this study, we implemented the GradientShap (Lundberg and Lee,
2017; Sundararajan et al., 2017; Smilkov et al., 2017; Kokhlikyan et al.,
2020) model interpretability algorithms to identify the spectral features
regarded as important by the learning algorithm for the prediction task
being performed. The importance of spectral features can be computed
model-wide or for an individual or group of instances with marginal ad-
ditional computational burden. In our effort to relate this information to
domain knowledge, feature importance was calculated for the overall
CNN models based on (i) the full dataset, used in this study, and (ii)
the Soil Taxonomy Orders separately. The correlation of the
GradientShap values of the spectral features for predicting Kex content
by Soil Taxonomy Orders was also assessed, allowing understanding
their similarities. This information on correlation does allow not only
increasing interpretability but also helps to understand how the
learned spectral features are reused across soil orders.
The GradientShap algorithm takes the gradients of model output
with respect to the input features as it could be done in a linear regres-
sion setting. However, the non-linear behavior of CNN models intro-
duces masking effects (Shrikumar et al., 2019) making such an
approach less suitable. Instead, to remedy this possible lack of sensitiv-
ity, the GradientShap algorithm was integrated in our study with the
gradient along the path between several baselines (in our study, 100
spectra randomly sampled from the training set), so allowing to better
approximate the calculation of the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlana-
tions) (Lundberg and Lee, 2017) value.
3. Results
3.1. Exchangeable potassium prediction models in a growing data regime
The learning curves and model performance of both PLSR and CNN
models for the prediction of exchangeable potassium (log10(Kex)),
with increasing number of training examples and using all Soil
Taxonomy Orders, are shown in Fig. 3.
Up to a dataset of 5000 samples, both PLSR and CNN models perform
poorly with an R2 below 0.65 and a high level of variance across differ-
ent random splits. However, a data regime of 10,000 samples appears to
be an inﬂection point. While the PLSR model levels off at approximately
an R2 of 0.64, the performance of the CNN keeps increasing up to an R2 of
about 0.79 as the size of the dataset increases.

Orders. Table 3. reports their mean and standard deviation perfor-
mances on the test set. We recall that the models were trained, vali-
dated and tested on 20 different random train, validation and test splits.
Results conﬁrm that the CNN model outperforms PLSR in the context
of a large data regime, reaching in average an R2 of 0.79 and a MAPE of
30.9% whereas PLSR levels off at an R2 of 0.64 and a MAPE of 135% on the
overall test set. Furthermore, the predictions calculated by the CNN over
20 different random splits show little variance with a standard deviation
of 0.08 and 0.9% for R2 and MAPE respectively. With such prediction per-
formance, the CNN model is more suitable for the remediation of radio-
active contamination.
Moreover, when evaluated by Soil Taxonomy Orders, the average
MAPE ranges from 26.9% for Vertisols to 47.3% for Vertisols. On
Mollisols, the most represented order in the KSSL dataset, the average
MAPE is 27.4%. The variability of the metrics increases as sample size
of the test set decreases as it is the case for Gelisols with a standard de-
viation of 9.9% for its MAPE.
The average bias values for CNN predictions evaluated on all data is
0.0047 cmol(+).kg−1. When evaluated on individual Soil Taxonomy
Orders, bias values range from −0.04 to 0.02 cmol(+).kg−1 for less rep-
resented soil orders such as Gelisols or Histosols. As for the PLSR, the av-
erage bias values predictions evaluated on all data is −0.0002 cmol(+).
kg−1. When evaluated on individual Soil Taxonomy Orders, bias values
range from −0.09 to 0.04 cmol(+).kg-1 respectively for Gelisols and
Ultisols.
The scatterplots of observed vs predicted Kex on a single train/test
split shown in Fig. 4 conﬁrm the higher overall agreement of the CNN
model between the observed and predicted values with respect to the
1:1 line.
As conﬁrmed by Fig. 4, the reported RMSE and MAPE metrics also
provide complementary perspectives on the errors performed, as
overweighting respectively errors made on higher and lower ranges of
predicted Kex. Indeed, these scatterplots clearly highlight a higher
dispersion when predicting with PLSR, in particular for levels of Kex
lower than 1 cmol(+).kg−1 (once back-transformed in their original
scale). For higher levels (higher than 1 cmol(+).kg−1), the PLSR
model shows a bias, almost systematically underestimating Kex.
To see the learning process of the CNN in action, the validation loss
by Soil Taxonomy Orders is reported in Fig. 5.
As indicated by the dynamic of the loss evaluated on the entire val-
idation set (All), 200 training epochs were required to meet the “early
stopping” criteria (stop after 3 epochs without validation loss decrease).
Below this curve, the ﬁrst group of validation curves including Andisols,
Alﬁsols, Mollisols and Vertisols shows a continuous decrease. As op-
posed, above this curve, the second group of validation curves including
Inceptisols, Aridisols, Ultisols, Spodosols and Gelisols has leveled off
long before the end of the training, indicating a risk of overﬁtting. The
validation curve for Histosols still shows a steady decrease up to
approximately 180 training epochs but with higher MSE values.
3.2.2. Local setting
Figure 6 shows the comparison of the test performances (R2 and
MAPE) for both PLSR and CNN models on Mollisols, Gelisols and
Vertisols Soil Taxonomy Orders when trained (i) on all orders included
(global) and (ii) on Mollisols, Gelisols or Vertisols separately (local).
This experiment highlights clearly that, at least when predicting Kex,
stratifying the modeling approach by Soil Taxonomy Orders was of little
or no interest for the PLSR model and substantially detrimental for the
CNN model. Additionally, high standard deviations were reported
when training and testing on Gelisols due to the small sample size,
which consequently conﬁrms the relevance to systematically report
result on multiple random splits.
3.3. Assignment of spectral bands
The GradientShap values averaged over the whole test set or by Soil
Taxonomy Orders is shown in Fig. 7 along with the mean spectrum for
each class.

It is important to recall that when the SNV (Standard Normal Vari-
ate) preprocessing step is applied upstream of the modeling pipeline,
MIR spectra are made translation and scale invariant. Hence, machine
learning algorithms exploit only deformation/distortion patterns to
provide estimates. GradientShap values indicate the effect of local de-
formations of the spectra on predicted values.
A ﬁrst analysis of the GradientShap values shows that the spectral
region around wavenumbers 3700–3400 cm−1 is considered by the
CNN as important to predict Kex for most soil orders. Several studies
(Viscarra Rossel et al., 2006; Le Guillou et al., 2015) have highlighted
the role played by soil mineralogical characteristics in this spectral
region with the presence of absorption peaks of soil constituents such
as calcite, kaolinite, 2:1 type clay minerals, and the features of free
water. Importance of mineralogy was also implied by regions
1200–970 cm−1, assigned to Si–O stretching (Farmer, 1974). Soil or-
ganic matter may also contribute potassium retention in soil orders
with high organic matter content such as Histosols, Gelisols and
Andisols as implied by the importance of the 3000–2800 cm−1 spectral
region (Le Guillou et al., 2015).
To further compare GradientShap values computed for each Soil
Taxonomy Orders, a correlation matrix is shown in Fig. 8. The assess-
ment of GradientShap values similarity allows to postulate the presence
of spectral features reused across Soil Taxonomy Orders and will
support our analysis of the behavior of the CNN model at different
data regimes.
A detailed analysis of the correlation levels is conducted below. To
only consider the general trends at this stage, a high level of correlation
is observed between the GradientShap values calculated for Spodosols,
Entisols and the Undeﬁned category. The GradientShap values calcu-
lated on Mollisols, the most represented Soil Taxonomy Orders in the
KSSL database, are highly correlated positively with Vertisols and nega-
tively with Spodosols and Entisols.

On the other hand, the GradientShap values computed for Andisols,
Aridisols and Ultisols show little correlation with other orders and ap-
pear to be distinctive. Finally, the GradientShap values of Gelisols and
Histosols correlate strongly with each other but show a low correlation
with the other orders, suggesting a distinctive cluster.
4. Discussion
4.1. Performance analysis
Soils with high radiocaesium transfer risk to crops require Kex of
around 1 cmol(+).kg−1 to bottom out radiocaesium transfer to crops
(Hirayama et al., 2018). Hence, in the context of the remediation of
radioactive contamination, the ability to accurately characterize levels
of Kex lower than 1 cmol(+).kg−1 is of critical importance. At such
lower potassium concentrations, the available potassium is not
enough to avoid uptake of radioactive elements, such as radiocaesium,
typically present in case of a fallout linked to a nuclear emergency.
Hence, the much lower MAPE errors of the CNN (31%) over the PLSR
(135%) models constitutes a major opportunity for this application
domain.
For higher Kex concentration (higher than 1 cmol(+).kg−1), as
indicated in Fig. 4, a clear bias can be observed for the PLSR model. In ad-
dition, the PLSR model appears to be dominated by majority of mea-
surements available in the dataset within the 0.3 to 1 cmol(+).kg−1
range (−0.5 to 0 when log10-transformed). In contrast, the CNN
model has clearly superior predictive power in this range, despite the
lack of representativeness of this type of data in the training set.
As mentioned, the early stopping technique was used to train our
models. In the case of the CNN, the training was stopped after 3 epochs
without validation loss decrease to avoid overﬁtting. However, Fig. 5
showing the validation curves by Soil Taxonomy Orders allows for a
more in-depth and differentiated analysis. Two groups of validation
curves were identiﬁed, one group of curves showing a steady decrease
throughout the training period and another group whose curves often
level off or start increasing again by the end of the training period. Our
interpretation is that the overall validation loss decrease was mainly
driven by Mollisols and Alﬁsols orders, the two most represented orders
in the KSSL dataset. More training epochs would have conducted most
likely to even better performance on those orders. However, the group
including Gelisols, Spodosols and Ultisols validation losses stopped de-
creasing after 100 epochs (halfway through the training period). We
are overﬁtting those soil orders. Hence, a more conservative approach
would have been to stop training at 100 epochs.
4.2. The capacity to leverage growing data regimes
A question that often arises is how many samples are needed to use
Deep Learning models. The analysis of the Learning curves shown in
Fig. 3 allows to answer this question for our speciﬁc application domain.
The learning curves of both the PLSR and CNN models for Kex prediction
highlight the importance of the data regime with respect to model
capacity. In this study, the CNN model is found to be superior to the
PLSR for the prediction of Kex when the data regime exceeds about
10,000 samples, where the performance of the PLSR model reaches a
plateau at an R2 of about 0.65 while the performance of the CNN con-
tinues to increase until it reaches an R2 close to 0.8. The learning curves
show also high standard deviation in low data regimes. This is an artifact
of the evaluation scheme used. While train, validation, test random
splits in the respective proportions: 80%, 10% and 10% are relevant in
high data regimes and commonly used, in lower data regime a k-fold
evaluation scheme or at least train, validation, test random splits in
the respective proportions: 60%, 20% and 20% would have been more
suitable. However, this limitation does not affect our rationale as
(i) the size of the splits, sometimes insufﬁcient, is reﬂected in the stan-
dard deviation of the metrics reported and (ii) our experiment focuses
on the trend in the highest and growing data regimes.
4.3. CNN interpretability and domain knowledge
Fig. 6 shows a superior performance of the CNN model in
predicting Kex for Vertisols when trained on all orders than when

A

computed
GradientShap values on different Soil Taxonomy Orders and in par-
ticular their levels of correlation as shown in Fig. 8 provides us with
additional interpretation keys.
Table 4 is a synthesis of our analysis whose objectives are (i) to iden-
tify situations where spectral features are reused/transferred between
different soil orders, (ii) to hypothesize the predominance of certain
soil orders in the “Undeﬁned” class and last (iii) to further analyze
Fig. 7. GradientShap values for CNN based Kex (log10-transformed) prediction by Soil Taxonomy Orders (Oxi.: Oxisols, Geli.: Gelisols, Spodo.: Spodosols, Histo.: Histosols, Verti: Vertisols,
Andi.: Andisols, Aridi.: Aridisols, Enti.: Entisols, Ulti.: Ultisols, Incepti.: Inceptisols, Alﬁ.: Alﬁsols, Molli.: Mollisols). A positive (blue) value indicates that distorting the spectrum upwards
would lead to an increase of predicted Kex; a negative (red) value indicates that distorting the spectrum upwards would lead to a decrease of predicted value, or equivalently
distorting the spectrum downwards would lead to an increase of predicted value.

spectral features considered as important by the CNN model when
predicting Kex.
As summarized in Table 4, CNN model performance seems to be
driven by two competing forces, namely the data regime and the dis-
tinctive nature of the GradientShap values computed for each Soil Tax-
onomy Orders, as characterized by their level of correlation over all
wavenumbers or speciﬁc spectral regions. This analysis scheme is em-
ployed below to highlight the potential role played by the transfer and
reuse of spectral features learned by the CNN for each type of soil. The
different scenarios will then be interpreted in light of domain expertise.
In general, the pattern of higher level of performance as the data re-
gime increases is consistent with the summary of Table 4. However
there are exceptions.
For instance, the case of Vertisols is instructive, where, despite the
low data regime, very good level of performance is reported. The analy-
sis of the correlation of its GradientShap values shows that it is (nega-
tively) highly correlated with Mollisols and Entisols, both soil orders
very well represented in the KSSL database and with Spodosols. The
2:1 type clay minerals (e.g., micas, vermiculites, and smectites) deter-
mine soil's ability to retain potassium in most cases (Sawhney, 1970;
Sharpley, 1989; Parﬁtt, 1992; Coulombe et al., 1996). In general,
Vertisols have high clay content with relatively simple clay mineralogy
dominated by smectite (Coulombe et al., 1996). Spodosols has sand to
loam texture (McKeague et al., 1983), whereas the texture of Vertisols
is, in deﬁnition, heavier than clay loam (Coulombe et al., 1996; Baillie,
2001; Soil Survey Staff, 2014). In addition, the major 2:1 type clay min-
erals, if any, in surface soil of Spodosols are irregular interstratiﬁed
mica-vermiculite-smectites, not pure smectites (McKeague et al.,
1983). In Entisols, due to the low degree of mineral weathering, soil tex-
ture and clay mineralogy are diverse reﬂecting the nature of parent ma-
terials (Allen and Fanning, 1983; Grossman, 1983). Fig. 7 highlights this
contrasted clay mineralogy with symmetric GradientShap values of
Vertisols and Entisols and Spodosols in the spectral region 3700–3400
cm−1. Furthermore, a high level of correlation is observed between
Vertisols and Mollisols (0.93). In the United States, smectites are also
common in Mollisols (Fenton, 1983; Nettleton and Peterson, 1983).
The similar smectitic nature of Vertisols and Mollisols may have also
driven the unexpected high level of performance for Vertisols, suggest-
ing a reuse of spectral features learned on Mollisols, very well repre-
sented in the KSSL database.
In contrast, the level of performance for Histosols and Gelisols is the
lowest. Their GradientShap values are highly correlated with each other
(0.95) but not with the other orders. Indeed, they show unique spectral
features importance in the 3000–2800 cm−1 region, related to high or-
ganic matter content that control the cation exchange capacity of the
soil and, hence Kex (Le Guillou et al., 2015). Both their low data regime
and unique GradientShap values might explain the poor performance.
The level of performance on Spodosols is medium despite the low
data regime. Most of the Spodosols samples were discarded during the
data selection step as below the detection level. Again, a high level of
correlation of its GradientShap values is observed with the Undeﬁned
class, Mollisols and Entisols. Given these high levels of correlation, how-
ever, we would have expected a level of performance comparable to
that achieved for Vertisols. This situation requires further investigation.

The level of performance on Aridisols is also medium despite its me-
dium data regime and distinctive GradientShap values. Its GradientShap
values proﬁle shows high values in the 1400–1200 cm−1 spectral re-
gion. According to Johnston and Aochi, 1996, absorbance peaks in that
spectral region relates to organic matter content. The calculated
GradientShap values of orders with high organic matter content such
as Histosols and Gelisols do not highlight such spectral region as impor-
tant. The interpretation of this paradox requires further investigations.
The predominance of the “Undeﬁned” Soil Taxonomy class requires
us to take precautions in the case-by-case analysis of model perfor-
mance by Soil Taxonomy Orders. A closer look at the GradientShap
values shows a high positive correlation with Entisols (0.88), Spodosols
(0.95), Gelisols (0.76), Inceptisols (0.76) might suggest the presence of
these classes in the “Undeﬁned” class. However, the interpretation of
the GradientShap correlation values remains difﬁcult given the poten-
tially complex mixture of very different soil types included in this class.
Finally, in line with our interpretative framework, the level of perfor-
mance on Andisols is medium (33%) and high (27%) for Alﬁsols with re-
spectively medium and high data regimes. Andisols are of volcanic
origin and have a distinct mineralogy with more sesquioxides. Their
GradientShap values are also distinctive with all wavenumbers between
3700 and 2900 cm−1 and 1400–900 cm−1 considered important by the
CNN to predict Kex.
Whether it is preferable to stratify MIRS modeling by Soil Taxonomy
Orders rather than including them all together has been a long-standing
debate in the Mid-infrared soil spectroscopy research community
(Torres Astorga et al., 2018). Our study proposes a methodology to in-
form this decision in the light of the spectral features learned and re-
used by the prediction algorithm. As a ﬁrst analysis, we have shown
that the quality of the prediction of Kex is on the one hand indexed on
the availability of a large data volume and on the other hand on model
classes capable to leverage it. A more detailed analysis of these regimes
by Soil Taxonomy Orders, however, revealed that the predictions of Kex
for some underrepresented classes such as Vertisols is possible. Hence,
we have shown that the pooling of all Soil Taxonomy Orders is
beneﬁcial in this circumstance but for instance not, in the case for
Histosols and Gelisols. Such an analysis is instructive and would be
interesting to conduct also in the context of prediction of other soil
analytes.
5. Conclusion
The approach and methodology developed in this paper and its fu-
ture developments constitute a major opportunity for the remediation
of radioactive contamination in agriculture. They open the possibility
of high throughput characterization of Kex under different soil
conditions. The level of predictive performance achieved now allows
precise monitoring of the effects of the remediation action, especially
in the range of Kex values inﬂuencing the dynamics of root uptake.
Moreover, the proposed approach allows to equip the experts of the
domain, in our case soil scientists, with tools for introspection and
interpretation of the model to better understand the modeled
phenomenon.
Beyond the progress made in this work, there are several avenues for
future research. First, the potential of Transfer Learning as a major op-
portunity to cut down on the important cost of spectral data acquisition
and leverage pre-trained state of the art Deep Learning architectures
should be further considered. Second, in this study we have focused
on Mid-Infrared (MIR) data. However, Near-Infrared (NIR) data might
also offer the opportunity to characterize Kex at an even higher
throughput given the availability of low-cost portable spectrometers.
The question of its level of performance remains open and justiﬁes fur-
ther investigations. Third and last, MIR and NIR spectroscopy allows
local or “point” estimation of Kex. However in the context of the
remediation of farmland affected by nuclear accidents, the possibility
of a swift characterization of Kex in soil at landscape scale represents a
major challenge. The question of determining the way that remote
sensing and soil spectroscopy data can be used together in this
context remains open and needs further exploration.
