Abstract
A Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) usually consists of numerous
wireless devices deployed in a region of interest, each able to collect and process
environmental information and communicate with neighboring devices. It can
thus be regarded as a Multi-Agent System for territorial security, where individ-
ual agents cooperate with each other to avoid duplication of effort and to exploit
other agent’s capacities. The problem of sensor deployment becomes non-trivial
when we consider environmental factors, such as terrain elevations. Due to the
fact that all sensors are homogeneous, the chromosomes that encode sensor posi-
tions are actually interchangeable, and conventional crossover schemes such as
uniform crossover would cause some redundancy as well as over-concentration
in certain speciﬁc geographical area. We propose a Parsing Crossover
Scheme that intends to reduce redundancy and ease geographical concentration
pattern in an effort to facilitate the search. The proposed parsing crossover

1. Introduction
In recent years, territorial security have been studied intensively for various
applications such as environmental monitoring and surveillance, such as airports,
public transit, emergency services or nuclear facilities. When trying to monitor
large geographically distributed area, in general Wireless Sensor Networks
(WSN) are deployed. A WSN usually consists of numerous wireless devices
deployed in a region of interest, each able to collect and process environmental
information and communicate with neighboring devices (Wang and Tseng,
2008; Bai et al., 2006; Hefeeda and Ahmadi, 2009). Hence, A WSN can be
regarded as a Multi-Agent System (Wooldridge, 2002; Hewitt and Inman, 1991;
Ferber, 1999; Cai et al., 2011) for territorial security, where individual agents
cooperate with each other to avoid duplication of effort and to exploit other
agent’s capacities (Wooldridge, 2002; Athanasiadis and Mitkas, 2004; Cai et al.,
2011). Sensor deployment is an essential issue in WSN, as it affects how well a
region is monitored by sensors. This is a critical issue as there are a number of high
potential applications for sensor deployment, such as national defense (Nickerson
and Olariu, 2007), home security (Zhang, 2008), industrial surveillance (Chen,
2008) and environmental monitoring, etc. the primary objective for sensor deploy-
ment is two-fold: WSN should cover a region of interest as complete as possible,
while minimizing the number of sensors deployed, and thus minimizing costs asso-
ciated with sensor deployment.
Considering a region of interest monitored by sensors, one of the most critical
concerns is the region coverage (Wang and Tseng, 2008; Kar and Banerjee, 2003;
Zhou et al., 2007; Kumar et al., 2006; Liu and Towsley, 2004; Hefeeda and
Ahmadi, 2009; Romoozi and Ebrahimpour-Komleh, 2012). In general, one of
basic requirements for a WSN is that each location in a region of interest should
be within the sensing range of at least one of the sensors. An alternative approach
is to have a region of interest covered simultaneously by at least K sensors (Wang
and Tseng, 2008; Zhou et al., 2007). Some deterministic methods have been pro-
posed to address the problem of coverage. It has been shown that covering an area
with disks of equal radius can be done in an optimal manner (Bai et al., 2006;
Hefeeda and Ahmadi, 2009; Kar and Banerjee, 2003). Similar results have been
reported when multiple coverage of the target area is required (Bai et al., 2006;
Zhou et al., 2007; Kumar et al., 2006; Wang and Tseng, 2008). Besides, the
majority of optimization methods proposed are deterministic, and are generally
functions of a ﬁxed sensing range, as shown in Fig. 1.

The direct consequence of oversimpliﬁcation in sensor deployment is that the-
oretically perfect coverage shown in these deterministic methods may not hold
true in practice. Most sensor deployment optimization methods assume that sen-
sors are placed on a 2D plane, without taking into account the topographic ter-
rain information (Kar and Banerjee, 2003; Bai et al., 2006; Hefeeda and
Ahmadi, 2009; Zhu et al., 2012). However, the area of interest that requires sen-
sor deployment is rarely completely plane, usually it contains buildings and
some facilities. As a result, obstacles presented in environment, such vegetation,
buildings, hills or valleys are all ignored in traditional sensor deployment setting.
The conventional deterministic approaches do not consider environmental
factors such as terrain topology, and cannot deal with it. While WSN seems
to satisfy the requirements to achieve full coverage on a target area using a
deterministic method, there are no means to ensure that this coverage is truly
effective in the real environment. This uncertainty of coverage thus presents a
challenge in sensor deployment. To summarize, oversimpliﬁed assumptions lead

performance.
Nevertheless, the problem becomes non-trivial when we consider environmental
factors. Given N sensors to be deployed in an area with M possible positions, the
possible combination of deployment will be M�ðM�1Þ�ðM�2Þ���1
ðM�NÞ�ðM�N�1Þ���1. In general, M is rather
large, and this makes exhaustive search unfeasible. For example, given an area of
100 m � 100 m, even if we place a grid of 1 m and restrict sensors to be deployed
only on the corner of a grid, there will be 10; 000 possible sensor positions.
Considering to deploy only 10 sensors, there will be 10; 000 � 9999 � 9998
�9997 � 9996 � 9995 � 9994 � 9993 � 9992 � 9991
combinations,
which
is
almost 1040. Such amount is simply not easy to proceed with current computation
power. The problems with such a high dimensionality cannot be solved directly,
especially if the terrain exhibits some irregularities. In general, heuristic search
methods such as random search can be applied, in the hope that a local optimum
will emerge during the search. However, random search offers little help if high

quality local optima are of a small number, because a random search of 1000 gen-
erations only explores

(Bhondekar et al., 2009; Seo et al., 2008; Akbarzadeh et al., 2010; Brar and
Virk, 2014; Karaboga et al., 2014; Tripathi et al., 2011). We have, however, little
evidence that such regularities or similarities exist in a highly complex problem,
and that they can be extracted in such a straightforward way. Others such as sim-
ulated annealing try to explore local information of sensors deployed, and only
make short range displacement for sensors in a less frequent pace when time passes
by.
In order to solve the problem, some non-deterministic search methods such as
random search or simulated annealing can be applied. By taking into account ter-
rain elevations, these non-deterministic search methods could perform better than
traditional deterministic approach. In an effort to tackle the problem, some prior
work based on evolutionary algorithm has been conducted (Akbarzadeh et al.,
2010; Kosar and Ersoy, 2012; Akbarzadeh et al., 2013; Song et al., 2012;
Gueney et al., 2012).
However, there are still some disadvantages in using conventional evolutionary
approaches. Due to the fact that all sensors are homogeneous, the chromosomes
that encode sensor positions are actually interchangeable, and conventional cross-
over schemes such as uniform crossover (Yoon and Kim, 2013; Karaboga et al.,
2014; Brar and Virk, 2014; Tripathi et al., 2011; Romoozi and Ebrahimpour-
Komleh, 2012) would cause some redundancy as well as over-concentration in
certain speciﬁc geographical area. We notice that after a few iterations the same
sensor positions or geometrically close sensor positions would be encoded in
different parts in chromosome by different individuals, and the conventional
crossover scheme such as uniform crossover may produce offspring with redun-
dant or geometrically close sensors. Such a crossover is thus less effective and
may delay the optimization process in sensor deployment optimization.
There are little work in sensor deployment optimization with evolutionary
approaches, and most prior work conducted with such paradigms (Romoozi
and Ebrahimpour-Komleh, 2012; Akbarzadeh et al., 2010; Brar and Virk, 2014;
Karaboga et al., 2014; Tripathi et al., 2011) simply used evolutionary algorithms
as a black box approach without taking into account the problem of homogeneous
gene representation. Hence, we propose a Parsing Crossover Scheme that reduces
redundancy and eases geographical concentration pattern to facilitate the search.
The proposed parsing crossover method demonstrates better performances than
those of uniform crossover under different terrain irregularities.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The problem statement is
presented in the next section, followed by a presentation of the proposed method.
The experimental protocol and results are then summarized, concluding the paper
with discussions and perspectives.

2. Problem statement
Although there are some common notions on critical issues such as coverage
(Ahmed et al., 2005; Boukerche and Fei, 2007; Kumar et al., 2006; Zhou et al.,
2007), there are few comprehensive frameworks that have been done for sensor
deployment optimization. In most cases, sensor deployment optimization is
regarded as an overly complex problem, thus generic heuristic algorithms are often
used for the optimization task (Bhondekar et al., 2009; Seo et al., 2008). A more
comprehensive framework was proposed in Akbarzadeh et al. (2010). Still, we
believe that are some important concepts that are yet to be clearly deﬁned or
outlined.
Given a sensor si with a sensing range dr and a point of interest pj with a
distance dps away from sensor si, we ﬁrst deﬁne the visibility vðsi; pjÞ as 1 if the
point pj is visible to sensor si, and as 0 otherwise. Once the visibility is deﬁned,
the coverage of the sensor si to the point pj can be calculated (Ko et al., 2011):
Deﬁnition 1 (Single Sensor Binary Coverage on a Point). The sensor binary
coverage cðsi; pjÞ of a sensor si with detection range dr on the point pj can be
deﬁned as:
cðsi; pjÞ ¼ 1; if max ð0; dr � dpsÞ � vðsi; pjÞ > 0
ð1Þ
cðsi; pjÞ ¼ 0; otherwise
ð2Þ
Alternatively, we can extend the deﬁnition of cðsi; pjÞ into a probability setting:
Deﬁnition 2 (Single Sensor Probability Coverage on a Point).
cðsi; pjÞ ¼ fðdpsÞ � vðsi; pjÞ
ð3Þ
where fðdpsÞ is a probabilistic sensor detection function, the exact function depends
on sensor behavior model. For example, a sigmoid detection function can be used
if justiﬁed:
fðdpsÞ ¼
1
1 þ exp �
a
dps � b
�
�
h
i
ð4Þ
where a and b are parameters that deﬁne exact sensor detection behaviors. A point
of interest is regarded as covered if it is covered by at least of sensors deployed. If
there are N sensors deployed, instead of just one single sensor, then the coverage of
a point pj can be deﬁned as (Ko et al., 2011):
Deﬁnition 3 (Binary Coverage on a Point). The binary coverage cðpjÞ on a point pj
can be deﬁned as:

93
cðpjÞ ¼ 1; if
X
N
i¼1
cðsi; pjÞ > 0
ð5Þ
cðpjÞ ¼ 0; otherwise
ð6Þ
where si denote a sensor among total N sensors, 1 6 i 6 N. Again, a probabilistic
coverage on a point can be implemented if sensor behavior is known:
Deﬁnition 4 (Probabilistic Coverage on a Point). The probabilistic coverage cðpjÞ
on a point pj can be deﬁned as (Ko et al., 2011):
cðpjÞ ¼ 1 �
Y
i¼1;...;N
1 � cðsi; pjÞ
�
�
ð7Þ
Note that cðsi; pjÞ is the single sensor si probability coverage on a point pj.
With the knowledge of the coverage between sensor si and all points of interest,
the overall coverage by sensor si can be deﬁne by aggregation. If there are m points
of interest, then the coverage by a sensor si can be deﬁned as:
Deﬁnition 5 (Coverage by a Sensor). The coverage cðsiÞ by a sensor si can be
deﬁned as (Ko et al., 2011):
cðsiÞ ¼
X
m
j¼1
cðsi; pjÞ; 1 6 j 6 m
ð8Þ
where pj is a point, 1 6 j 6 m, in a region of interest R. This deﬁnition applies for
both binary and probabilistic coverages. Given N sensors to be deployed in a
terrain, and m points in a region of interest, the global coverage cðSÞ can be
deﬁned as the sum of coverage of all points of interest, which in turns is a function
of all sensors deployed, fs1; s2; . . . ; sNg:
Deﬁnition 6 (Global Coverage).
cðSÞ ¼
X
m
j¼1
cðpjÞ; 8j; pj 2 R
ð9Þ
where pj is a point, 1 6 j 6 m, in a region of interest R. Again, the same deﬁnition
works for under both binary and probabilistic coverage settings. Apparently, the
global coverage cðSÞ is a function of terrain elevations pj;z; 1 6 j 6 m of all points
of interest in region R and sensor positions si;x; si;y and sensor elevations
si;z; 1 6 i 6 N. For simplicity, we denote the series of pj;z as pj;z and the sensor
positions and elevations as si;x; si;y; si;z, respectively:
cðSÞ ¼ Uðpj;z; si;x; si;y; si;zÞ
ð10Þ
94
A.H.R. Ko, F. Gagnon
Thus, the goal for sensor deployment is to position sensors in a way that global
coverage is maximized:
fsi;x; si;yg ¼ arg max Uðpj;z; si;x; si;y; si;zÞ ¼ arg max cðSÞ
ð11Þ
Note that pj;z and si;z are terrain effects and the system has no controls on these
factors.
Here we notice that we derive global coverage cðSÞ not by sensors, but by points
in a region interest. The reason is that it is far less costly to take into account
multiple coverage effects by points of interest rather than by sensors. We simply
cannot know the extent to which a sensor has duplicated coverage with other sen-
sors unless we examine all points of interest that may potentially be covered. This
causes some problems in optimization, because we cannot simply add up coverage
from all sensors to obtain global coverage. Thus, we cannot regard the problem as
individual optimization problems, because optimization of individual sensor
coverage would not be equal to the overall global coverage. Moreover, because
the sum of coverage of all sensors does not equal to global coverage, we cannot
evaluate the ﬁtness of an individual sensor only based on its coverage achieved.
Given the high dynamic nature of the problem, it is quite costly to predict the
behaviors of other agents and the consequences of these behaviors in such a com-
plex and dynamic setting. Due to the intrinsic complexity of the problem,
advanced evolutionary approaches would perform better than traditional heuristic
search. However, since all sensors are homogeneous, the chromosomes that code
sensor positions are actually interchangeable, and conventional crossover schemes
such as uniform crossover would cause some redundancy as well as over-concen-
tration in certain speciﬁc geographical area. We thus propose in the next section
our parsing crossover method.
3. Proposed method
Given N sensors, each sensor position can be encoded by its x coordinate and y
coordinate, hence the sensor deployment needs 2 � N sensors to depict sensor posi-
tions. Each sensor position is thus represented by a gene-pair in chromosome.
The conventional crossover scheme may encode identical sensors into different
genes, and this may cause two problems: (a) offspring may have redundant sensor
positions in its chromosome; (b) offspring may not inherit the gene-pairs that both
parents have.
We are mainly motivated by three purposes to propose this parsing crossover
method for sensor deployment : (a) make sure that offspring would not have
redundant gene-pairs; (b) if both parents have a certain gene-pair, then make sure
that their offspring would inherit it; (c) under the condition that both (a) and (b)
are satisﬁed, make sure that more distant sensor positions, i.e., sensor positions
that are less similar to existent sensor positions, have higher chance to be
inherited.

95
In order to satisfy these purposes, the parsing crossover method can be carried
out by the following algorithm:
Algorithm 1. Pseudo-code of parsing crossover scheme.
Given two parents, each parent encodes N sensor positions, and contains 2 � N genes:
1. Merge chromosomes from both parents into a new chromosome, as group A with 2 � N gene-pairs, or
4 � N genes,
2. Separate all 2 � N gene-pairs from group A into two groups: group B with Nb redundant gene-pairs and
group C with Nc unique gene-pairs,
3. Prase redundant gene-pairs in group A such that all duplicated gene-pairs would be eliminated, and all left-
over gene-pairs are unique
4. Calculate distances di of all gene-pairs ðgi;x; gi;yÞ in group B with all gene-pairs in group A,

7. Select N � Nb gene-pairs from group C into group D; the probability of a gene-pair ðgi;x; gi;yÞ in group c to
be selected is exactly its normalized distance pi
8. Return group D as ﬁnal result of crossover.
4. Simulations
In order to verify the validity of the proposed method, we carried out a number of
experiments on terrains with different irregularities. Note that we are simply
unable to test all terrain types for two reasons: (a) Millions of types of terrain
exist, and even categorization may not be feasible; (b) currently there is simply
no measure on terrain irregularities and we cannot quantify it given any terrain.
Hence, we work another way around, ﬁrst we deﬁne a standard deviation of
terrain elevation as irregularity, and then we generate artiﬁcial terrains using
different standard deviation and test different search algorithms.
4.1. Experimental protocol
We deploy 8 sensors in an area with size 100 m � 100 m, thus the problem has the
complexity of 10; 000 � 9999 � 9998 � 9997 � 9996 � 9995 � 9994 � 9993 combi-
nations, which is almost 1032. The coverage is based on binary setting, and each
sensor is supposed to have a radius of 30 m of detection range. Sensors are
deployed one meter high above the ground, so there is an asymmetry between
detecting positions and detected positions. Consequently, we assume that any
point of interest is detectable under the condition that it is inside the detection
96
A.H.R. Ko, F. Gagnon
range of a sensor and that there is no obstruction on the line of sight between the
sensor and the point.
Note that a real world WSN sensor has more complex behaviors and many more
factors to take into account, such as a ‘‘dipole’’ pattern, battery issues, communi-
cation routes, etc. Nevertheless, we regard the 3D obstruction as one of the most
relevant ones. In this paper, we simply try to stress the importance of terrain issues
in considering WSN coverage, and do not deal with all of them at the same time.
Terrain has various elevation variations, the elevation variations are in Gauss-
ian distribution with standard deviation from 0.1 m to 1200 m and a mean of 0.
Terrain is almost ﬂat with only 0.1 m of standard deviation, but can be quite
complex with 1200 m of standard deviation.
To introduce asymmetry in the experiment, sensors would be placed one meter
above the ground instead of on the ground. We tested several methods, including
traditional deterministic pattern (Bai et al., 2006; Hefeeda and Ahmadi, 2009),
Random Search, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm with uniform crossover,
one point crossover, two point crossover, and the proposed parsing crossover.
Each method makes 500 displacement iterations in a test, with 30 tests in total,
except for traditional deterministic pattern, and genetic algorithm. For genetic
algorithm, we set up a population of 10 individuals, hence there would be 10 dis-
placement evaluations in each generation. Thus, genetic algorithm only contains
500
10 ¼ 50 generations to be comparable with other methods. Crossover rate is 0.9
for uniform crossover. Mutation rate is 0.05, and the disturbance in case of a
mutation is a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation rr ¼ 10 m. For sim-
ulated annealing, we set a ¼ 1
3 and b ¼ 1
2 for temperature function, and
rr ¼ 10 m for displacement distance, the same as in genetic algorithm.
4.2. Experimental results
Table 1 shows experimental results. Traditional deterministic deployment pattern
has the lowest coverage among all methods tested. This is not surprising given that
traditional deterministic deployment does not consider terrain elevations.
Among purely heuristic methods, we notice that simulated annealing with dis-
placement of only one sensor at a time generally performs better than random
search. On contrary, simulated annealing with displacement of all sensors at the
same time in general does not perform as well as random search. It may suggest
that simulated annealing can perform better than random search, but only if we
displace one sensor at a time rather than displace all sensors at the same time.
A plausible explanation is that if we displace only one sensor at a time, the rest
of sensors preserve more or less the structure of the network. Thus, during the
search simulated annealing would explore a better solution for a given network,
of which properties are somehow stable. However, if we displace all sensors at
the same time, simulated annealing may actually generate a completely different
network. A complete new network may prevent simulated annealing from making

use of properties of a stable network. As there are some constraints on displace-
ment distance, simulated annealing with displacement of all sensors at the same
time may not be as good as random search.
Genetic algorithm apparently performs better than both simulated annealing
approaches. Also, genetic algorithm has the best performance when the terrain
irregularity is low. Among different crossover schemes, we observe that uniform
crossover is consistently outperformed by all other crossover schemes, as shown
in Fig. 2. For terrain with low variations, one point crossover tends to outperform
other crossover schemes. However, as terrain starts to show medium irregularity,
two point crossover seems to have the best performance. Furthermore, the pro-
posed parsing crossover scheme has the best performance when the terrain
becomes even more irregular.
5. Discussion and conclusion
Sensor deployment in a 3D environment is a non-trivial task, as it is basically a
NP-hard non-convex optimization problem. In order to solve the problem, non-
deterministic optimization methods such as random search, simulated annealing
or evolutionary algorithm (Akbarzadeh et al., 2010) can be applied. By taking into
account terrain elevations, these non-deterministic optimization methods could
perform better than traditional deterministic approach.
Figure 2
Genetic Algorithm crossover scheme performance comparison using uniform crossover as the
benchmark: the evaluation was carried out on different terrain complexities with elevation standard deviation
from 0.1 m to 1200 m. Genetic Algorithm with uniform crossover is set as the benchmark as thus has always the
value 0; we compare its performance with those of one-point crossover, two-point crossover and the proposed
parsing crossover.

However, due to the fact that all sensors are homogeneous, the evolutionary
algorithm will encounter some problems. The chromosomes that encode sensor
positions are actually interchangeable, and conventional crossover schemes such
as uniform crossover would cause some redundancy as well as over-concentration
in certain speciﬁc geographical area. We notice that after a few iterations the same
sensor positions or geometrically close sensor positions would be encoded in
different parts in chromosome by different individuals, and the conventional
crossover scheme such as uniform crossover may produce offspring with redun-
dant or geometrically close sensors. Such a crossover is thus less effective and
may delay the optimization process in sensor deployment optimization.
Hence, we proposed a parsing crossover scheme for genetic algorithm. The
experimental simulation conﬁrms that the proposed crossover scheme performs
better than traditional uniform crossover, one-point crossover and two-point
crossover schemes. However, although the proposed scheme outperforms all other
compared methodologies in highly irregular terrain, we acknowledge that there
may still be some room to further improve the crossover scheme and to make it
more robust regardless of irregularity in optimization space.
Despite the fact that the proposed method does perform better than most
conventional schemes, our parsing crossover relies on the mechanism of genetic
algorithm - a population-based optimization. Hence, in circumstances where
genetic algorithm fails, we are uncertain whether our parsing crossover scheme
can be a full remedy. In our simulation, we do not observe any instances of general
genetic algorithm failure. However, this is an issue that we may need to pay more
attention in the future.
