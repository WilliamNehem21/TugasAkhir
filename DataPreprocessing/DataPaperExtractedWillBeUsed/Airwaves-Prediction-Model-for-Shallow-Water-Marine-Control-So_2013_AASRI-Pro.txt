Abstract 
One of the main challenges of using Marine Control Source Electro-Magnetic (MCSEM) sounding for Hydrocarbon de-
tection has been the airwaves phenomena.  In shallow water the response from the air half-space often masks the response 
from the subsurface.  In this paper we present a curve fitting approach to identify a mathematical function or model that 
best describes the pattern of the airwaves data.  The identified model can serve as a prediction model for the airwaves.  
Synthetic data are simulated in a geologic model that is fairly representative of the area where real MCSEM data were 
collected.  Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Sum of Square Error (SSE) and Coefficient of determination (R2) were used 
to evaluate the performance of the prediction model.  The result indicates that exponential decay function can describe the 
airwaves data with RMSE of 3.1e-7, SSE of 1.3e-11 and R2 of 0.990.

1. Introduction 
Marine Control Source Electro-Magnetic (MCSEM) is a technique of measuring the response of earth's 
subsurface structures due to the imparted alternating electric current when external electromagnetic field is 
applied into subsea floor formations.  The CSEM technique has provide a means of remotely detecting the 
presence of high resistive subsea floor structures of the earth's interior such as the hydrocarbon reservoir.

The following describes a typical MCSEM survey.  Commonly in practice, an electrode refers to a Hori-
zontal Electric Dipole (HED) which serves as electromagnetic source is disposed approximately 30 – 50m 
above the seabed and connected to the survey recording vessel.  The electrode is being charged by the power 
source on the survey vessel at selected magnitude of alternating current and transmission frequency or fre-
quencies.  At a selected source receiver distance (offset), an Ultra-low (~ 0.1 – 5Hz) transmission frequency is 
commonly passed through the seabed into the subsurface of the earth formation. Electric and magnetic sen-
sors/receiver designed with a voltage measuring circuit are placed strategically either on the seabed or on a 
different survey vessel (see Figure 1).  The imparted voltages recorded by the receivers on the seabed are then 
analysed to presume the structural formations beneath the earth surface through their electrical properties [1 – 
3].

Theoretically, one of the main physics behind MCSEM is based on the knowledge that when an electro-
magnetic (EM) field is propagated through a conductive subsurface, the induced signal is mainly affected by 
spatial distribution of resistivity.  Sediments filled with saltwater in a marine environments typically represent 
good conductors, whereas carbonates, hydrocarbon filled sediments, salt and volcanic rocks represent exam-
ples of resistive bodies that scatter the EM field.  Part of the electromagnetic field scattered by subsurface in-
homogeneities propagates back to the seafloor where the signal is recorded by receivers equipped with electric 
and magnetic sensors.  The data recorded in shallow water CSEM survey are known to be affected by a noise 
called “airwaves".  The noise component (airwaves) are generated predominantly by the vertically up going 
diffuse electromagnetic signal component that propagates in form of wave at the air/sea interface with speed

of light and without attenuation before it diffuse back through the water layer vertically down where it is rec-
orded by the electromagnetic receivers [4] as illustrated in Figure 1. 
There are numerous modeling concepts developed to provide better understanding of systems having fac-
tors with nonlinear relationships like the airwaves.  The numerical modeling conducted by [5] that used HED 
as the electromagnetic source, investigated the airwave contribution to the MCSEM data.  Their study identi-
fied far offset, transmission frequency and relatively shallow seawater depths to have important effect on the 
airwaves component.  Even though, apart from the numerical modeling, no method of computing the airwaves 
was given in that study.  Hankel transform was used by [6] to develop another 1D model through numerical 
airwaves calculations that resulted into a fast algorithm.   The behaviour and physical insight of how airwaves 
build up in the water layer was not explained by the algorithm. 
Study by [4] has also shown the effect of seawater depth would be important at large source-receiver sepa-
rations, low frequencies, or in relatively shallow water.  It was also pointed out that in principle, the method 
of modeling-and-subtraction can be used to suppress the airwave component.  The effect can be incorporated 
into the theory if both water depth and source location are accurately determined [6].  Features of the effect of 
the air wave on the amplitude and phase was described by [2] and reported that the range at which the air 
wave dominates the response, and information on seabed resistivity is lost, increases with decreasing frequen-
cy and water depth. 
Furthermore, in the work of [7] and reported by [8] where the angular frequency, conductivity, and mag-
netic permeability were respectively represented by , , and , the expression defining attenuation ( ) and 
propagation ( ) constants for frequencies below 105Hz within the conductive medium is given by:

Here μ = μo (magnetic permeability in free-space) because of nonmagnetic rocks in sedimentary basins.  
The research done by [4] has shown that the attenuation of electromagnetic energy depends on conductivity, 
transmission frequency and offset in a situation where the geometry is fixed.  The low frequency electromag-
netic signal in a distance x (m) experience exponential decay expressed as e-x/  where;

Where,  and f denote resistivity ( m) and signal frequency (Hz) respectively.  The distance required to at-
tenuate an EM signal by factor of e 1 is defined as skin depth and is about 551m in sea water (0.3 m), 1424 
m in 2 m sediment and 108 in air (1011 m) for a frequency of 0.25Hz.

Fig. 2. Magnitude Versus Offset (MVO) plots for airwaves data in 100m – 500m seawater depth  
Considering the above studies and the trend pattern of the MVO plot shown in Figure 2 which fairly sug-
gests an exponential form of relationship motivates the authors to study the feasibility of applying exponential 
curve fitting method to model the airwaves data. 
2. The Exponential Function 
An exponential function is a widely used function in fundamental and applied sciences to model a relation-
ship in which a constant change in the independent variable gives the same proportional change (i.e. percent-
age increase or decrease) in the dependent variable [9].  All forms of exponential function originate from the 
primitive two (2) parameter family.  The variations that exist within this extended family resulted from mere 
transformations, shifts and stretches of the common stock defined as: 
x
f x
Y
( )
 
 
(3) 
Where,  and  are the function parameters that represent the Y-intercept and the base for the function re-
spectively.  The random variable is denoted by x where they all determine the exponential function's input-
output behaviour [10].  It is worth to note that  is always positive in order to make real and algebraic sense.  
This implies that 
x is also positive always.  Therefore, the output values of the function f(x) are either com-
pletely positive or completely negative depending respectively on whether the sign of  is positive or negative.  
In many different applications and indeed calculus, the common choice of base for exponential functions is  
= e.  This is because transformation can easily be made such that for all  > 0 there exist a constant  so that e  
=  and hence equation 3 becomes:

However, the term exponential function is sometimes used more generally for functions of the form 
x, 
where the base  is any real positive number, not necessarily e. 
2.1. Algorithm of Exponential Curve Fitting 
Basically, curve fitting technique is a process of determining mathematical function that has the best fit to 
a series of data points, possibly subject to constraints [11].  To accomplish the exponential curve fitting 
process, suppose that we are given the points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), … (xn , yn) and want to �t an exponential curve. 
We express Xi's (i = 1, 2, ..., n) to represent the offset values and Yi's as the corresponding magnitude of the 
airwaves  Looking at Equation (3), the nonlinear least-squares procedure requires �nding a minimum of:

Equations (8) and (9) are nonlinear in the unknowns  and .  To avoid a time-consuming computation and 
the iteration involved that requires good starting values for  and  for equations of this nature.  We therefore 
utilize MATLAB software package which has a built-in minimization subroutine for functions of several vari-
ables to minimize E( , ) directly.

3. Methodology 
The simulation protocols related to the study data acquisition are explained in this section.  Computer 
Simulation Technology (CST) software was used in designing and solving the different models of MCSEM 
environment.  The area simulated is 25Km.  The transmitter is modelled as a short 1250A AC line current 
segment of length 270m located 30m above the sea bed.  The Maxwell’s electromagnetic field wave equation 
in vacuum in the absence of electric or magnetic sources is solved for the electric field vector E inside the 
computational domains. 
Figure 2 (a) is a 1D MCSEM geologic model depicting "No Air Layer Model" and Figure 2 (b) – (f) are 
"With Air Layer Models" configurations that were simulated to obtain the airwaves data.  Note that the fig-
ures are not drawn to scale in this text; but in practice all have the same area.  The only difference between 
"No Air Layer Model" and "With Air Layer Models" is the changing of the sea water depth and replacing the 
space with air layer.  We changed the sea water depth at interval of 100m from 2000m down to 100m in order 
to obtain the airwaves data.  In this study, only airwaves data from sea water depth of 500m down to 100m 
was used.  This is because a study by [12] has shown that airwaves have significant effect on the MCSEM 
survey data within the depth of 100m to 500m.

 Constructing a MCSEM geometric model of the region having a top air layer, a middle sea water layer, and 
a bottom earth layer, with the model reflecting known bathymetry of the region and known conductivities 
of the air, seawater and earth; 
 Using the model to compute the electromagnetic field at all receiver locations for each source location; 
 Replacing the air layer in the model with sea water to create No-Air Layer model; 
 Computing the fields for the same source-receiver geometries for the No-Air Layer model; and 
 Computing the airwave effect at each seawater depth by subtracting the No-Air Layer Model fields from 
the corresponding fields of the With-Air Layer Models. 
4. Results 
Table 2 present the performance measure of the exponential curve fitting analysis with parameter values of 
 and .  It can be seen from the results that even in the most shallow water depth of 100m where the airwaves 
is considered more than in the other deeper seawater depths.  The exponential curve fitting technique has 
achieved the value of R2 of 0.99.  While the RMSE and SSE of as low as 3.1e-7 and 1.3e-11 respectively.  
Furthermore, it can be observed the value of the intercept ( ) is decreasing as the seawater depth is increasing.  
This is because the onset of the airwaves is being affected by the depth of the seawater.  The values for  seem 
to be fairly the same; this might suggest the stability of the model.

5. Conclusion 
Curve fitting technique was used in this study to identify a model that can serve as a shallow water air-
waves prediction model.  We have identified an exponential decay function of the form f(x) = e x to best 
describe the airwaves data. The study results shows that the exponential decay function can achieve R2 of 
0.995, RMSE of 1.6e-7 and SSE of 3.4e-12.  The near 1.0 for the coefficient of determination the small RMSE 
and SSE observed indicates that this prediction model indeed fits the data well.  As this study is done with 
simulated data, the next step is to carry out the experimental work to verify the results.
