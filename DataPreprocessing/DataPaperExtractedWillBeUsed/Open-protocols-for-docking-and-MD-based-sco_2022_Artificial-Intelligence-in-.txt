The study of protein-peptide interactions is an active research ﬁeld from an experimental and computational per- 
spective, with the latest presenting challenges to model and simulate the peptides’ intrinsic ﬂexibility. Predicting 
aﬃnities towards protein systems of interest, such as proteases, is crucial to understand the speciﬁcity of the 
interactions and support the discovery of novel substrates. Here we provide a set of computational protocols to 
run structural and dynamical analysis of protein-peptide complexes from a binding perspective. The protocols 
are based on state-of-the-art methods, but the code is open and can be customized depending on the user needs. 
These include a fragment-growing peptide docking protocol to predict bound conformations of ﬂexible peptides, 
a protocol to extract descriptors from protein-peptide molecular dynamics trajectories, and a workﬂow to build 
and test machine learning regression models. As a toy example, we applied the protocols to a serine protease 
structure with a set of known peptide substrates and random sequences to illustrate the use of the code, which is 
publicly available at: https://github.com/rochoa85/Protocols- Peptide- Binding 
1. Introduction 
The spatial arrangement of peptide substrates is important to pre- 
dict potential interactions with their molecular targets [1] . The research 
on molecular docking of peptides has contributed to overcome, in part, 
the challenge of predicting bound conformations of these highly ﬂex- 
ible molecular entities [ 2 , 3 ]. In this sense, multiple approaches have 
been published to tackle this computational problem [4] . Among them, 
methods using docking strategies where the peptide is grown step-by- 
step can help to solve the ﬂexibility issues, while maintaining the ca- 
pability of predicting energy-favorable conformations associated with 
potential biological activities [ 5 , 6 ]. These complexes can be sampled 
using techniques such as molecular dynamics (MD), where amino acid 
force ﬁeld parameters can be implemented to study peptides and their 
interactions [ 7 , 8 ]. Other tools can be useful to predict beforehand the 
probable structural conformation of the peptides in comparison to ex- 
perimental techniques [ 9 , 10 ]. 
To assess the binding aﬃnity of peptides, multiple strategies have 
been proposed to capture their molecular ﬂexibility. These include en- 
hanced sampling approaches [11] , alchemical free energy perturbations 
[12] , or techniques able to explore the potential surface energy of the 
system. Other methods are based on implicit solvent calculation using 
Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) ap- 
proaches [13] , with the possibility of adding quantum calculation us-

ing semi-empirical theories for catalytic residues [14] . In any of these 
scenarios, large computational resources are required to reproduce the 
binding landscape of peptides as ligands. One option is to use scoring 
functions used in molecular docking to score representative frames of 
MD trajectories, and calculate thermal averages that can be correlated 
with binding aﬃnities [15] . Another approximation is to use machine 
learning methods to predict, from MD trajectories and molecular de- 
scriptors, any response variable such as aﬃnity proxies [ 16 , 17 ]. 
Nowadays, the combination of physics-based approaches with ma- 
chine learning models is useful to reduce the computational cost of run- 
ning exhaustive simulations and improve the prediction performance of 
classical methods with available curated data [18] . This is the case of 
novel methods to accelerate quantum chemical calculations using mod- 
els trained with pre-calculated parameters [19] . In the context of MD, 
initiatives are reported to extract descriptors from the trajectories and 
combine them with additional chemical data from the molecular enti- 
ties. This is the case of the Molecular Dynamics Fingerprints package 
(MDFP) [20] , where a set of molecular ﬁngerprints can be computed 
by obtaining average energy terms and observables from the MD sim- 
ulations such as the solvent accessible surface area, dipole moments, 
radius of gyration and evolution of the hydrogen bonds. The latest have 
been applied to predict free energies of solvation for small molecules 
[21] , and for binding studies involving proteins [22] . The protocol can 
be adapted to include peptides as ligands for virtual screening studies

given that a predictive model can be convenient to avoid running ex- 
haustive simulations. 
In this article, we present a set of open Python scripts to run lo- 
cally diﬀerent computational workﬂows inspired by published methods 
for peptide modeling, such as peptide docking using a fragment-growing 
docking protocol for the prediction of bound peptide conformations, and 
a routine to capture descriptors from protein-peptide MD trajectories in 
order to predict observables such as average scoring values. We pro- 
vide the open source code to reproduce the main protocols with small 
diﬀerences and without requiring access to web servers. As a toy exam- 
ple, a library of known substrates and random peptide sequences were 
docked to a granzyme B protease, where each complex was subjected 
to short MD simulations. Then, a set of descriptors was calculated per 
complex to generate a regression model able to predict with enough ac- 
curacy binding observables. For this example, we show the performance 
of some models under certain conditions explained in the Methods, but 
such variables can be changed by the user if a protein target is selected 
with previous knowledge of its binding site, as well as a list of peptide 
substrates that can be used to extrapolate the results into a novel chemi- 
cal space using machine learning approaches. Instructions to run exam- 
ples and install third-party modules required to perform the analysis are 
provided in the repository. 
2. Methods 
2.1. Customization and system requirements 
The Python 3 scripts are available in the public repository: https: 
//github.com/rochoa85/Protocols- Peptide- Binding . The code is pro- 
vided under a MIT license for academic and development purposes. 
The project is split into three folders. The ﬁrst one allows running the 
fragment-growing docking protocol with a protease receptor as an ex- 
ample. The second provides scripts to extract features of protein-peptide 
MD trajectories with the MDFP package. In addition, the PepFun pro- 
tocol is used to calculate descriptors from the peptide sequence and 
structure as explained later in Section 2.5 and Supplementary Table 1. 
Finally, the third protocol provides a script to conﬁgure and run a re- 
gression model to predict score/aﬃnity values based on the obtained 
descriptors. An example with a protease and a set of peptides evaluated 
in this work is included in the code. 
All the classes and functions were written under the Ubuntu 20.04 
operating system. Additional third-party tools (see Supplementary Table 
2) can be installed through the available source code using the latest 
versions, or through Conda virtual environments. 
2.2. Fragment-growing docking approach 
As an open source alternative to dock ﬂexible peptides in protein 
binding sites, we provide a protocol based on the incremental growth 
of a core peptide fragment into the protein binding site, maintaining 
a degree of ﬂexibility after new amino acids are added in the peptide 
ﬂanking regions. The method is inspired in the DINC2 strategy [23] . 
The methodology involves the following steps: (i) Modeling of a 3- 
mer peptide fragment corresponding to the central section of the peptide 
of interest given as input. The loop reconstruction module of Modeller 
is used to generate this starter 3-mer fragment from the amino acid se- 
quence using the Python modules, which can be easily incorporated into 
the docking protocol [24] . The protonation states of the protein and pep- 
tide 3D structures are generated using PDB2PQR [25] . (ii) The fragment 
is docked in the protein active site using Autodock Vina with standard 
parameters [26] . The site is deﬁned based on previous knowledge of 
the protein, and it is delimited by a grid search box at the center of the 
binding site that increases its size after growing the peptide sequence. 
The initial fragment has all their rotational bonds active. (iii) From the 
initial docking, the three best poses (i.e. best Autodock Vina scores) are 
used as starting points to add amino acids at each ﬂanking region of the 
peptide. In that way, three solutions are generated from three diﬀerent 
initial docked conformers. To add the ﬂanking amino acids, the rotamers 
are predicted with Modeller using the rest of the structure bound to the 
protein as a template. The bonds of each new amino acid and the amino 
acids next to them are kept ﬂexible, while the central part is conﬁgured 
as rigid based on the docked pose of the previous step. (iv) Finally, the 
new fragments are docked and the best pose per each of the three par- 
allel runs is selected to repeat the growing process, until the peptide 
reaches its ﬁnal size. The methodology is intrinsically parallelized by 
Autodock Vina itself and the multiprocessing module of Python. 
2.3. Use case with a protease-peptide system 
A benchmark/validation docking run using our fragment-growing 
approach was performed on the granzyme B protease (PDB id 1iau) 
[ 27 , 28 ]. This is a serine protease from the subfamily S01.010, accord- 
ing to the MEROPS database [29] . Multiple peptide substrates have 
been reported against this enzyme. A total of 513 8-mer sequences were 
selected from the MEROPS database based on ﬁltering experimentally 
non-redundant cleaved substrates. To include a set of external peptides 
for prediction purposes, 365 random sequences were generated with the 
PepFun package [30] and docked to the same protease structure. The 
sequences were generated using the same 8-mer length, with uniformly 
distributed amino acids per position, and without conserving dominant 
residues on the peptide cleavage sites. 
To assess the performance of our fragment-growing docking proto- 
col, a set of reported proteases structures bound to peptides with ex- 
tended conformations were subjected to re-docking calculations of the 
peptides using the following servers: ClusPro [31] , Haddock [32] , HPEP- 
Dock [33] , MDockPep [34] , CABSDock [35] and DINC2 [23] . To eval- 
uate the performance, we compared the predicted peptides with re- 
spect to crystal conformations through RMSD calculations over back- 
bone atoms. The studied complexes have the PDB IDs 1ou8, 2xxn, 3qdz, 
3tjv and 6di8, and all of them are co-crystallized with peptides from 8 
to 15 amino acids in range. The full peptide input conformations for re- 
docking at each server were generated with PEP-FOLD [36] , except for 
CABSDock and MDockPep which both generate the peptide structure in- 
put. To complement the assessment, we included a set of 10 additional 
protein-peptide complexes available in the PDB and curated based on 
the LEADS-PEP dataset [37] . The peptides selected are also bound in 
extended conformations. The same docking servers were used, and the 
RMSD evaluation metrics used for the proteases were also calculated. In 
all cases, the binding site residues or binding site grid were speciﬁed, 
depending on web server requirements. 
2.4. MD simulations 
Each granzyme B-peptide complex docked with our protocol was 
subjected to MD simulations using Gromacs version 5.1.4 [38] . The 
Amber99SB-ILDN protein force-ﬁeld [39] , a TIP3P water model [40] , 
a modiﬁed Berendsen thermostat [41] , and a Parrinello-Rahman baro- 
stat [42] were used during the equilibration and production phases. The 
complex was solvated in a cubic box of water with periodic boundaries 
at a distance of at least 8 ˚A from any atom of the protein. Counterions of 
Na + and Cl − were included in the solvent to make the box neutral. The 
electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Particle Mesh Ewald 
(PME) method, with 1.0 nm short-range electrostatic and van der Waals 
cutoﬀs [43] . The equations of motion were solved with the leap-frog 
integrator [44] , using a timestep of 2 femtoseconds (fs). 
The equilibration consisted of 100 picoseconds (ps) of NVT ensem- 
ble, followed by 100 ps of NPT. Then a production NPT simulation was 
run during 10 ns. With the trajectories, a MD/scoring approach was 
implemented to calculate average scores using all the frames from the 
trajectories. Speciﬁcally, for each MD simulation, an interaction score 
was attributed: each frame was scored using the Autodock Vina scor- 
ing function (the same used in the fragment-growing docking protocol) 
2

and the average value across all frames from the trajectory was stored, 
and used at later stages, for the generation of a regression model able 
to predict the same variable for novel peptide sequences. 
2.5. Descriptors extraction 
Based on the granzyme B-peptide MD trajectories performed with 
Gromacs, the MDFP tools libraries [20] were adapted and used to ex- 
tract a set of protein-peptide MD-derived descriptors ( https://github. 
com/rinikerlab/mdfptools/ ). Each descriptor is split into three positions 
(vector), which include the average, median and standard deviation 
value of the calculated property among the MD frames. To achieve this, 
the calculated MD trajectory is re-run with Gromacs to add new energy 
terms in the outputs per frame. These include the Coulomb and Lennard- 
Jones energy contributions between the peptide, the receptor and the 
water molecules. Other included descriptors are the SASA and radius 
of gyration, the charges calculated with the ParmEd module [45] , the 
dipole moments and evolution of hydrogen bonds with the MDtraj mod- 
ule [46] , and bioinformatics properties of the peptide using the PepFun 
package. A total of 70 descriptors per complex were calculated. The full 
list is available in the Supplementary Table S1. 
Two scripts, one using bash command lines, and a second written 
in Python are included in the main code to extract these descriptors. 
The vectors per complex are stored as pickled objects in a folder, which 
can be read later by machine learning models. An example of a protein- 
peptide MD trajectory is provided in the code repository to reproduce 
the results. 
2.6. Machine learning model setup and test 
Finally, to test the prediction performance of the average score ob- 
tained from the MD frames, two regression models were conﬁgured us- 
ing the granzyme B system. The models are a basic linear regression 
model, and a gradient boosting regressor with 500 estimators and a 
learning rate of 0.01. Both models are prepared using the scikit-learn 
module in Python [47] . For the initial training validation, the set of 513 
peptide substrates were split in a 75/25 schema (i.e. 75% of the pep- 
tides to train, and 25% to test). This was performed using a maximum 
chemical diversity function, where both the training and test set con- 
tains the maximum number of diverse compounds to avoid biasing both 
chemical spaces. The chemical similarity is quantiﬁed using the ECFP4 
Tanimoto coeﬃcient [48] , and the diverse subset are selected using the 
MaxMin algorithm in the RDKit. The R2 coeﬃcient of determination and 
the Mean Squared Error (MSE) were calculated to assess the models. In 
the case of the gradient boosting regression model, the deviance of both 
training and test sets, as well as the feature and permutation importance 
were analyzed. 
After the initial assessment, a ﬁnal model was trained with the 513 
peptide substrates, and applied using the 365 random sequences. The 
same R2 and MSE metrics were calculated to validate the model. A 
script to conﬁgure and run the predictions with the protease-peptide 
trajectories is also provided within the code. For this example, we add 
the average scores as a pre-calculated variable per peptide to be used 
as the model output. However, the users have the option to select as 
response any proxy aﬃnity value, mostly motivated in the cases where 
running such calculations require demanding computational times and 
resources. 
3. Results and discussion 
The three protocols covering peptide docking and scoring analysis 
were applied using a protease (granzyme B) system as an example. In 
the next section, we discuss their implementation and provide insights 
about their use for other applications.

3.1. Peptide docking protocol 
The docking of highly ﬂexible molecules is an active research area 
with diﬀerent software available for that purpose. This includes pack- 
ages such as FlexPepDock [49] , GalaxyPepDock [50] , and DynaDock 
[2] , which use diﬀerent computational strategies and scoring functions 
to predict reﬁned protein-peptide complexes. However, most of these 
methods are available as public web servers where the code is not avail- 
able, or as part of open pipelines demanding previous exhaustive analy- 
sis of the initial template, limiting their usability. In our case, the dock- 
ing protocol implements open source software to dock peptides in a pro- 
tein binding site, dealing with the intrinsic ﬂexibility of the peptide, 
and allowing the customization of the protocol in case the user wants 
to modify not only parameters but substantial parts of the protocol. The 
workﬂow we propose is summarized in Fig. 1 . 
One goal of the protocol is to include the ﬂexibility of the molecule, 
in this case the peptide, but gradually after each iteration. The internal 
rotational bonds of the peptide are conﬁgured ﬁrst as ﬂexible, but af- 
ter growing the ﬂanking regions the best conformations of the previous 
steps are kept rigid to diminish the computational time, allowing the 
new fragments to explore the best pose based on the rigid selected tem- 
plate, and the ﬂexible new ﬂanking amino acids. The protocol has ben- 
eﬁted from the multithreading architecture available in Autodock Vina 
and auxiliary programs to model additional amino acids in the peptide, 
protonate according to the system requirements, and tailor the peptide 
based on the known binding site and biological background available. 
To validate the protocol performance for proteases, we selected ﬁrst 
a dataset of ﬁve protease-peptide complexes available in the PDB. The 
peptides were selected by taking into account full peptide substrates 
longer than 8 amino acids belonging to diﬀerent families and with loop 
structures. One advantage is the availability of crystallized bound con- 
formations to compare the docking results through RMSD values. We 
also performed the docking using alternative protocols for peptide dock- 
ing (see Methods). In addition, we followed a similar docking analysis 
and RMSD calculation using a set of 10 protein-peptide complexes avail- 
able in the LEADS-PEP dataset. A summary of the peptide RMSD for our 
fragment-growing protocol is provided in Table 1 . 
We found that our protocol predicts peptide conformations with 
RMSD values below 5 ˚A for the proteases included in the benchmark- 
ing, and a similar performance was found with the additional protein- 
peptide complexes reported in the LEADS-PEP dataset. In general, re- 
producing ﬂexible backbone conformations is a subject of research that 
can be complemented with sampling of the conformational space using 
MD and other techniques, which is the case of our pipeline. Other alter- 
natives to perform peptide docking presented similar, and in some cases

iterative expansion of the structure through the addition of amino acids in the ﬂanking regions. The pipeline uses three starting docked fragments to grow the 
sequence in parallel. The best scored ﬁnal complex can be used for further sampling steps. The blue section describes the expansion steps, the green section the 
docking and ranking, and the orange section the protocol output. (B) Example of a peptide fragment and how it is expanded through the ﬂanking regions. (C)

better results, but with the disadvantage of being accessed only through 
web servers, and limiting batch jobs for large peptide binders datasets. 
Among the external programs, it is important to mention that ClusPro 
and Haddock are rigid body docking approaches where the results de- 
pend on the peptide initial conformation. It means that the output will 
be aﬀected if the structure of the input is very diﬀerent from that of 
the crystallographic structure. Unlike the two previous cases, HPEPDock 
and DINC2 allow implicit ﬂexibility in the peptide structure through en- 
semble docking or by fragment-based docking respectively, increasing 
the chances to ﬁnd optimal conformations. MDockPep and CABSDock 
can model and dock the structure of the peptide from its sequence. 
The docking protocol provided in our scripts is inspired by the DINC2 
methodology [23] , with diﬀerences around the parallelization of the 
code, the selection of candidates, and the requirement of peptide frag- 
ments as input ﬁles, which are modelled within our protocol. In the case 
of DINC2, more parallel runs are generated to select the candidates from 
a group of solutions. In our case, we provide three ﬁnal protein-peptide 
complexes that can be ﬁltered based on the predicted score or confor- 
mational pose. The number of runs can be changed by the user in the 
code. In terms of the assessment performance, one of the limitations is 
associated with the size of the peptide, as in our case. Speciﬁcally, the 
larger the size the greater the conformational freedom, as can be ap- 
preciated for larger peptides with higher RMSD values in Table 1 . The 
RMSD for the external peptide docking servers are reported in Supple- 
mentary Table S3. 
Diﬀerences in predictions can be related with the peptide initial con- 
formation. In our docking protocol, the peptide input conformer is pre- 
dicted, or a crystallized fragment from a structural complex can be used 
directly to grow the full peptide sequence. On the other hand, the in- 
puts used for the servers were generated with PEP-FOLD. In spite of not 
accurately reproducing the crystal structures, our method can be used 
to screen massive amounts of ligands that can be reﬁned as proposed. 
In addition, we compared the computational eﬃciency of our protocol 
against Autodock Vina itself, using one protein-peptide system as ref- 
erence (PDB id 1bx2). We found that our method can run the docking 
in half of the time required by Vina with 24 CPU cores, and the ﬁnal 
docking pose was less accurate with regard to the crystal structure when 
Vina was used alone (see Supplementary Fig. S1). 
For the granzyme B system, we docked the 878 peptides at the crys- 
tal binding site, where 513 are known substrates and the remaining 365 
are the random sequences generated with PepFun. After docking all the 
substrates and random peptide sequences to the granzyme B system, 
we followed a pipeline where each complex is subjected to MD simula- 
tions and a set of descriptors are extracted to build a predictive machine 
learning model ( Fig. 2 A). The latest is important because it is diﬃcult to 
explore the conformational space using classic docking protocols. This 
can be overcomed by reﬁning or sampling the complexes using MD, 
Metropolis Monte Carlo, among other sampling techniques. Our pro- 
tocol generates short trajectories of the systems with MD equilibrium 
simulations of 10 ns, which is a suitable time for massive virtual screen-

ing campaigns in order to increase conformational variability within the 
same minima found during the ﬁtting process ( Fig. 2 B), and therefore 
statistically improve the predicted score by scoring each frame and av- 
eraging it as a proxy aﬃnity response ( Fig. 2 C). 
3.2. Model descriptors 
From the MD simulations for all the 878 peptides (513 substrates and 
365 random sequences), 70 previously described descriptors (see Meth- 
ods) were calculated for the machine learning (ML) setup and selected as 
independent variables. The average Autodock Vina score obtained from 
the MD simulations for each protein-peptide complex was selected as the 
dependent variable to be predicted in the regression model. This com- 
bined MD/scoring approach has been implemented in the past to ﬁlter 
candidates that agree with experimental data [ 51 , 52 ]. However, users 
can run more exhaustive free energy calculations to predict the aﬃni- 
ties or to include experimental values if these are available, in order 
to justify the setup of a regression model able to predict energies using 
solely basic MD simulations. This reduces the required computational 
resources and provides a hybrid MD/ML approach that can be more ef- 
ﬁcient for massive analysis such as protease novel substrate recognition 
[53] . 
The example provided is an illustrative case where capturing infor- 
mation from MD simulations can allow the reduction of prospective 
simulation time by preparing a model able to predict a particular MD- 
related observable. It means that information from MD trajectories can 
be captured in an ML model trained with MD-based descriptors, or if an 
experimental value is available, a descriptive model can be generated 
and complemented using the same MD-based descriptors. To visualize 
how these 70 descriptors are distributed among the included sequences, 
histograms of some properties are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. We 
also plotted the distribution of the average scores to assess the variabil- 
ity of the metric to be predicted in the example, which is suitable for 
the machine learning application (Supplementary Fig. S3). A summary 
of the suggested model is shown in Fig. 3 . 
3.3. Machine learning model performance 
As a toy example, we provide a simple analysis of training and testing 
a regression model using the descriptors calculated in the previous step. 
The goal is to illustrate one way to run the analysis, but the user has the 
option to customize the protocols based on the system and data available 
to build their own models. 
For this application and based on the deﬁned set of descriptors, we 
trained two regression models using the 513 peptide substrates as the

training set, and the 365 random peptides as the test set. However, with 
the 513 peptides we did a 75/25 training/test schema using a maximal 
chemically diversity analysis with the included peptides (see Methods). 
The main regression metrics for this analysis is provided in the Supple- 
mentary Table S4. The results for the ﬁnal training and test using the 
average score as the output variable is shown in Table 2 . 
In general, we observed a better performance of the linear regression 
model. However, in both cases the performances were acceptable with 
R2 values over 0.7. In particular, the gradient boosting technique al- 
lowed us to visualize per iteration the deviance of the results, and check 
which features are contributing the most to the predictions ( Fig. 4 ). 
Regarding the features, the most relevant are those derived from 
the protease-peptide energy terms, including the Coulomb and Lennard- 
Jonnes average and median descriptors. Some ligand-based features are 
also highlighted such as the number of rotatable bonds, which is an in-

3.4. Technical considerations 
The protocols were designed under the Ubuntu 20.04 operating sys- 
tem. However, the project can be installed in any Conda virtual envi- 
ronment with the required dependencies. In the case of the docking pro- 
tocol, it depends on calls to bash commands that were originally tested 
in a Linux environment. All the workﬂows depend on the addition of 
third-party tools, which are also open source, but will require building 
the source code in the local machine where the project will be imple- 
mented. 
The docking method we provide is a supervised approach, initially 
motivated by a local project to dock epitopes into the MHC class II 
binding site [54] . This means that instead of providing a blind docking 
strategy where the binding site is undetermined, the user is required to 
customize the process based on previous knowledge of the protein and 
binding site, in order to focus the analysis on managing the peptide in- 
trinsic ﬂexibility and reproducing plausible bound conformations. To al- 
low this, a grid search space should be assigned based on a required size. 
A set of known binding site coordinates must be provided to dock the 
initial peptide fragment, which can aﬀect the starting point to grow the 
bound peptide structure. We recommend that if a crystallized protein- 
peptide complex exists, a tripeptide obtained directly from the refer- 
ence complex should be considered for the fragment-growing docking 
approach, to improve the results. 
Finally, we suggest the parameters for running the MD simulations, 
but the user can conﬁgure them based on their own necessities. The only 
requirement is to use Gromacs for the calculations. 
4. Conclusion 
The computational study of how peptides interact with other molec- 
ular entities is crucial to accelerate the design of novel sequences with 
better properties, including their aﬃnities. In this work, we provide 
three open protocols that can be implemented to any protein-peptide 
of interest but exempliﬁed in the context of a granzyme B system with 
available biological and structural knowledge. The protocols allow the 
analysis of massive peptide substrates through fragment-based docking 
and MD sampling and scoring of the molecules. The code is open and can 
be modiﬁed to ﬁt the user necessities, add new types of predictions and 
simulations, and automatize the pipeline for virtual screening purposes.
