Abstract
This article presents a new speed observer based on fuzzy logic for speed sensorless
control applications of permanent magnet synchronous motor ‘‘PMSM”. The switch function in
traditional Sliding Mode Observer ‘‘SMO” is replaced by a rule based fuzzy logic system. The pro-
posed observer not only improves the system dynamic performance during disturbances or param-
eter variations, but also has a high accuracy tracking performance with sufﬁcient chattering
reduction. The validity of the new observer corroborated through experimental results using
TMS320F28069M Digital Signal Processor ‘‘DSP”.

1. Introduction
Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine ‘‘PMSM” become a
good choice in servo drives, and is on the way to step beside
induction
machines
in
traction
applications.
Traditional
PMSM drives employ position sensors to measure the speed,
and rotor angular position. These sensors present several
disadvantages, such as reduced reliability, susceptibility to
noise, additional cost and weight and increased complexity
of the drive system. Recently, there has been much interest
in developing a sensorless algorithms in which the motor was
controlled using the estimated values of the angular speed of
the rotor [1,2].
Several methods have been developed to estimate the rotor
speed or position, and among them are Flux Linkage Observer
‘‘FLO”, Extended Kalman Filter ‘‘EKF” based observer, and
Sliding Mode Observer ‘‘SMO”. The latter has a fast response,
good robustness for external disturbances, and machine
parameter variations [3,4]. The SMO uses a sliding mode vari-
able structure in the control loop to compensate the parametric
uncertainties
keeping
the
observer
independent
of
the
unknown signals during the sliding motion with a stable
dynamic error [5,6]. The estimated values in an ordinary
SMO contain high frequency oscillation components because
of the discrete switch control. The switch function is critical
to the observer performance and it allows appearing the chat-
tering phenomenon that can excite high frequencies which isn’t
desirable in high performance speed drives [7,8]. Several
solutions are proposed to make a trade-off between chattering
phenomenon reduction, and observer robustness. In [9–11] a
ﬁrst order and second order SMO proposed, the chattering
phenomenon reduced but low pass ﬁlter causes unavoidable

and unpredictable time delays in the estimated values which
need a compensation technique. In [12], the ordinary switch
function replaced with the sigmoid function, low-pass ﬁlter
avoided but there is a tracking error. In [13] a higher-order
sliding mode ‘‘HOSM” observer presented, the estimation
accuracy improved, but selecting sliding mode gains and
boundary layer are difﬁcult as they are dependent on the rotor
speed. Other algorithms such as artiﬁcial neural network [14]
and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) methods [15], can achieve high
performance, but they are relatively complicated and require
large computational time.
This paper introduces a new Fuzzy Sliding Mode Observer
(FSMO) in which the switch function in traditional Sliding
Mode Observer ‘‘SMO” was replaced by a rule based Fuzzy
Logic System ‘‘FLS”. The proposed observer not only ensures
the robustness for various disturbances, but also improves the
dynamic performance. The observer was experimentally tested
out on a TMS320F28069M DSP Controller, and experimental
results were introduced to validate the proposed observer
covering digital implementation cost, position estimation accu-
racy, and speed response.
2. Motor model and sliding mode observer
Based on these assumptions the motor appears to be or
becomes unsaturated; all the stator resistance, self- and mutual
inductances for each phase are the same, neglecting the iron
losses. The PMSM model in the stationary reference frame is
described by the following equations [16]:
LsðpiaÞ ¼ �Rsia � ea þ Va
LsðpibÞ ¼ �Rsib � eb þ Vb
(
ð1Þ
where
ea ¼ �wfxr
sin h
eb ¼ �wfxr
cos h
(
ð2Þ
To observe the EMF components, the sliding mode observer is
designed as follows [17,18]:
Lsðp^iaÞ ¼ �Rs^ia þ Va � ksgnð^ia � iaÞ
Lsðp^ibÞ ¼ �Rs^ib þ Vb � ksgnð^ib � ibÞ
�
ð3Þ
where sgn ðxÞ ¼
1
if x > 0
�1
if x < 0
�
ð4Þ
Subtracting Eq. (1) from Eq. (3), Va cancel Vb, and the
error equations will be the following:
Lsðp~iaÞ ¼ �Rs~ia þ ea � ksgnð�iaÞ
Lsðp~ibÞ ¼ �Rs~ib þ eb � ksgnð�ibÞ
�
ð5Þ
To guarantee the observer convergence based on lyapunov’
direct theory, the observer gain ‘‘k” should be [11]:
k > maxðjeajjebjÞ
ð6Þ
Once the system reaches the sliding surface, then:
�i ¼ ~ia
~ib
½
�T ¼ 0
p�i ¼ p~ia
p~ib
½
�T ¼ 0
(
ð7Þ
Substituting Eq. (7) in Eq. (5), the back EMF can be obtained
as follows:
0 ¼ 0 þ ea � ksgnð�iaÞ
0 ¼ 0 þ eb � ksgnð�ibÞ
�
;
ea ¼ ksgnð�iaÞ
eb ¼ ksgnð�ibÞ
�
ð8Þ
The back EMF in Eq. (8) usually contain high frequency com-
ponents [19]. To relieve this noise a low pass ﬁlter applied:
pð^eaÞ ¼ �x0^ea þ x0ea
pð^ebÞ ¼ �x0^eb þ x0eb
�
ð9Þ
where x0 ¼ 2pf0, and f0 is the cut-off frequency of the ﬁlter.
Finally the rotor position, and rotor speed can be calcu-
lated as follows:
^h ¼ arctan � ^ea
^eb
�
�
^xr ¼ p^h

3. Design of fuzzy sliding mode observer (FSMO)
The idea behind SMO is to select the switching gain so the slid-
ing function ’’ksgnð�iÞ’’ compensate the parametric uncertain-
ties keeping the observer independent of the unknown
signals during the sliding motion insuring a stable dynamic
error [5,6]. The discontinuous sign function in Eq. (4) is critical
to the observer performance and needs fast switching of
motion states, which will cause chattering [20,21]. To eliminate
the chattering phenomenon in classical SMO, the ﬁxed numer-
ical values of the switching function are replaced by linguistic
variables, and the switching function is calculated through
fuzzy logic system. The new Fuzzy SMO ‘‘FSMO” will have
the robustness property of SMO with sufﬁcient chattering
reduction via Fuzzy Logic System ‘‘FLS”. The FSMO block
diagram is depicted in Fig. 1, and built as follows:
Lsðp^iaÞ ¼ �Rs^ia þ Va � kFs
Lsðp^ibÞ ¼ �Rs^ib þ Vb � kFs
�
ð11Þ
where Fs ¼ FSMOð�i; p�iÞ
ð12Þ
The proposed FSMO will have 49 if-then rule base, two input
variables ½�i; and p�i� which deﬁne the current error and its rate

of change, respectively, and one crisp output ðFsÞ. All fuzzy
variables have the same universe of discourse [�1 to 1], and
been divided into seven fuzzy sets (A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5,
and A6) and (B0, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, and B6) for the input
variables, and (NB = negative big, NM = negative medium,
NS = negative
small,
ZE = zero,
PS = positive
small,
PM = positive medium, and PB = positive big) for the output
variable. Membership functions are chosen in the form of sym-
metrical triangular as in Fig. 2.
The output fuzzy ‘Fs’ set is normalized in the interval
[�1,1] therefore, Fs ¼ jFSMOð�i; p�iÞj 6 1. A simple fuzzy rule
table is constructed considering the following reaching and
stability requirements;
1. When ð�i � p�iÞ becomes a positive value, the membership
function of Fs is set in such a way that its sign becomes sim-
ilar to that of ð�iÞ and therefore, �i � Fs 6 0.
2. When ð�i � p�iÞ is a negative value, the reaching condition
would be satisﬁed automatically. In this case, the member-
ship function of Fs could be changed with negative or even
positive sign to enhance the tracking performance.
Regarding seven membership functions for each input vari-
able of the fuzzy rule base, 49 if-then rules of Fig. 2 are
obtained using expert engineering knowledge in the navigation
ﬁeld and satisfying the above-mentioned stability and reaching
conditions. The FLS output is calculated based on singleton
fuzziﬁcation strategy, center-average defuzziﬁcation and pro-
duct inference. At each input values the FLC gives an output
signal corresponds to the increase or decrease in sliding func-
tion (Fs) to satisfy the dynamic stability of the observer.
4. Experimental setup
To assess the performance and the robustness of the proposed
observer, ﬁeld oriented control strategy was applied to an
experimental DSP-based PMSM drive apparatus. The block
diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 3. It consists
of power inverter, PMSM with parameters shown in Table 1
and loading arrangement, voltage and current sensing circuits,
and ﬂoating point TMS320F28069M digital controller.
The controller running clock and Pulse Width Modulation
‘‘PWM” switching frequency are 50 MHz and 10 kHz, respec-
tively. To avoid the switching harmonics in the samples phase
currents, the sampling frequency is selected as 10 kHz for the
current control loops and 1 kHz for the speed control loop.
Two PI controllers are used for current, and speed control

loop, and the tuning process of controller constants is designed
to get a bandwidth of 400 HZ, and 40 HZ respectively. The
resultant PI controller constants are KP = 10�4, Ki = 0.97
for current controllers, and KP = 167.32, Ki = 28.58 for the
speed controller.
5. Experimental results
Several tests have been carried out to verify the correctness and
robustness of the proposed observer.
Test 1: Speed step increasesreference from 10% to 100% of
rated speed with constant load; this test examine the steady-
state performance of the proposed observer at low and high-
speed, comparing its performance with the traditional SMO.
Figs. 4, and 5 shows the experimental results for traditional
SMO, and the proposed observer respectively.
The actual and estimated rotor speed for traditional SMO
is shown in Fig. 4a, while Fig. 4b, and c shows the waveforms
of the actual and estimated rotor positions obtained for tradi-
tional SMO respectively. The rotor position error is shown in
Fig. 4d. The average steady-state speed error is (300/4000 =
7.5%) at 4000 rpm, and (55/400 = 13.7%) at 400 rpm.
The actual and estimated rotor speed for FSMO is shown in
Fig. 5a, while Fig. 5b and c shows the waveforms of the actual
and estimated rotor positions obtained for FSMO respectively.
The rotor position error is shown in Fig. 5d. The average
steady-state speed error is (50/4000 = �1.25%) at 4000 rpm,
and (10/400 = 2.5%) at 400 rpm. It can be observed that the
FSMO is accurate with sufﬁcient chattering reduction com-
pared with traditional SMO.
Test 2: The speed response to bipolar command from 400 rpm
to �400 rpm with constant load; this test examines the
performance of the proposed observer at low speed bipolar
command. The bipolar speed command is a square waveform
with a half cycle of 2.5 s and bipolar references ±400 rpm.
Fig. 5 shows the waveforms of the actual and estimated rotor

speed, actual and estimated rotor positions, and the rotor posi-
tion error respectively. It can be observed that the estimated
speed approaches the real value and responds correctly to the
bipolar command. The dynamic response seems satisfactory.
Test 3: Observer robustness to motor parametervariation; the
body temperature of a running motor increases because of
the core loss, copper loss and mechanical frictions. As a result,
the stator winding resistances increase. The main purpose of
this test was to examine the robustness of the proposed obser-
ver in case of doubling the motor resistance. This test was done
by connecting 1 X resistor in series with the stator winding,
and a speed step reference from 400 rpm to 4000 rpm.
Fig. 6 shows the waveforms of the actual and estimated
rotor speed, actual and estimated rotor positions, and the
rotor position error respectively. Although position estimation
error exists, it is very small because of high rotating speed. In
this case, about 55 rpm speed estimation errors appear at tran-
sient time. But they converge to zero very quickly. Test results
prove the good performance of the proposed observer, despite
of the variations of stator resistance, in the speed range from
10% of rated speed to full one (see Fig. 7).
6. Conclusion
A new efﬁcient fuzzy based SMO algorithm for sensorless vec-
tor control of PMSM was introduced. The chattering reduc-
tion
is
achieved
by
using
linguistic
variables,
and
the
switching function is calculated through fuzzy logic system.
The proposed algorithm is successfully implemented on a
DSP controller, and the performance is compared to the tradi-
tional SMO. Experimental results prove that the proposed
FSMO has sufﬁcient chattering reduction along with a good
estimation
accuracy,
and
high
immunity
to
the
motor
parameter’s variations. In future work, a research is suggested
to
develop
a
Genetic
based
sliding
mode
controller
‘‘GAs-SMC”, which will be used to choose the appropriate
SMC discontinuous part’s gain to reduce the problem of chat-
tering in SMC.
