Hand transplanting of vegetable seedlings is always been a time consuming and labourious activity which often
leads to muscular fatigue. Use of hitech instrumentation increased to achieve precision and automation in agri-
cultural operations. At present the transplanting is done manually which accounts for large amount of hand la-
bour and time. To ensure precision and timeliness in operation, an automatic transplanting based on
embedded system for use in seedling transplanters was developed. The developed system consists of feed roller,
pro-tray belt, a pair of L-shaped rotating ﬁngers, embedded system, DC and stepper motor. The plug seedlings
were released into the furrow with use of developed embedded system by actuating DC as well as stepper
motor. The performances of the developed system was tested rigorously at four different operating speeds
(1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 km/h) and three angles of pro-tray feed roller (00, 300, 450) for attaining optimum plant
to plant spacing in soil bin. The result indicated that percent transplanting and plant to plant spacing was
found optimum at 2.0 km/h forward speed and 300 angle of pro-tray feed roller. The average plant spacing,
transplanting efﬁciency, furrow closer, angle of inclination and miss planting were 600 mm, 91.7%, 90.3%, 18.30
and 2.1%, respectively. The developed system ensures the precision by sigulating the placement of seedlings at
optimum spacing for sustainable agriculture production. It also enabled the optimum transplanting rate, the abil-
ity to transplant at higher speeds and maintaining proper plant to plant spacing.

1. Introduction
Precision is very important criteria for transplanting of vegetable
seedlings at right time, at right moisture content and at equal interval
to facilitate other intercultural operations. Also, the crop yield increases
when optimum plant to plant spacing was maintained (Liang et al.,
2015; Miller et al., 2012; Zhan et al., 2010). In other words, using
automatic vegetable transplanters (AVTs) cut down the production
cost, timeliness in operation, labour shortage during peak season causes
delay in transplanting, leading to drastic reduction in yields (Chaudhari
et al., 2002). The low mechanization level for seeding and planting i.e.
below 40% as well as unhealthy seedlings is the key factor for lower
vegetable productivity. Hence, to increase crop yield and quality, im-
proved crop production practices with mechanized cultivation should
be followed. Commercial transplanting with hand by manually is a
drudgerious, time consuming and expensive operation that often re-
sulted in non-uniform distribution of plants compared with mechanical
transplanters (Orzolek, 1996). Also, feeding of seedlings to the delivery
unit in semi-automatic transplanters were difﬁcult due to singulation,
selection, alignment and manual transfer of seedlings that depends on
the skill of the operator. The vegetable transplanter developed for
plug-type seedlings are generally of semi-automatic type which consists
of either pocket-type, cup or bucket-type or conveyor-type metering
mechanism that uses bare root, plug or pot type seedlings for
transplanting. Also, it was observed that the existing system is costly, la-
bour intensive and has low ﬁeld efﬁciency.
For attaining uniform plant spacing, the performance of trans-
planters during planting plays a crucial role. The type of metering mech-
anism used in the transplanter is the most important component that
directly affects its performance (Miller et al., 2012; Karayel et al.,
2006; Navid et al., 2011; Yazgi and Degirmencioglu, 2014). Several stud-
ies have been reported on the development of metering mechanism
used in the transplanters for seedling pick-up from pro-tray and deliv-
ery into the furrow. The most advance type of vegetable transplanter
uses application of robotics where the pick-up mechanism is mostly
controlled with electronics in AVTs. This type of mechanism is gaining
attention for efﬁcient planting of seedlings, maintaining the accuracy,
precision and effectiveness in planting seedlings with minimum
human intervention. Here, the seedling pick-up is an important concept,
where a single seedling is extracted automatically from the tray with
the help of a pair of pin or fork, then discharged into the furrow and

again retracting back to its starting position. Developing a robotic trans-
planter requires specialized mechanism. This type of mechanism uses
computer graphics or machine vision system and end-effector mecha-
nism for extracting the seedling (Ting et al., 1992; Tai et al., 1994); grip-
per and a manipulator (Brewer, 1994; Hwang and Sistler, 1986; Ishak
et al., 2008); indexing drum type seedling removal device with ejector
(Williames, 1997; Shaw, 1997); or a pick-up system, a planting system
and a feeding system (Kim et al., 2001; Ryu et al., 2001; Choi et al., 2002;
Park et al., 2005; Hua et al., 2015).
Simonton (1991) developed an end-effector for controlling the posi-
tion, velocity and force to minimize damage to the petioles and main
stem of geranium cuttings. An end-effector that uses rack and pinion
type mechanism to convert rotational motion of the stepping motor to
the clipping motion of the ﬁnger was reported by Kim et al. (1995). A
machine vision system was reported to detect the unsuccessful
transplanting (Beam et al., 1991). Whereas Tai et al. (1994) used ma-
chine vision system to locate empty cells on the tray and guiding
healthy plugs into empty cells to re-transplant. In another study, Ryu
et al. (2001) developed an end-effector which can grip, hold and release
a seedling plug using a pneumatic system. The performance was evalu-
ated by identifying empty cells in 72- and 128-cell trays with 16 days
old cucumber seedlings using vision based system.
Working with robotic transplanters that uses electronic system has
speciﬁc requirements viz. micro-controller based system, stepper and
DC motors, data interface system, complex calibration processes, plant
to plant spacing, etc. Furthermore, these developed AVTs with different
metering mechanism either are of very expensive or not meeting the
farmer's expectations (Khadatkar et al., 2018). Some experimental stud-
ies to overcome the limitations mentioned in the existing transplanters
and to provide a solution that can singulate and precisely deliver the
seedling into the furrow at speciﬁed interval are still under progress.
This study describes the design, development and performance of an in-
novative Embedded System based Automatic Transplanting of plug-
type vegetable seedlings used in seedling transplanter.
2. Structure and working principle of machine
2.1. Transplanting object
The vegetable seedlings of chilli (Variety-Pusa Jwala) are used as
transplanting object. The seedling tray is a conical tray having 104
pots. The depth of the pot is 30 mm. The spacing between the consecu-
tive pots is about 4 mm. Each pot section has a top and bottom diameter
of 32 mm and 20 mm, respectively. Generally, the seedling substrate i.e.
coco peat, vermiculite and perilite were used in desired proportion of
3:1:1, respectively for raising vegetable nursery in pro-trays. The
30 days old seedlings having 4–5 leaf are suitable for transplanting in
ﬁeld (Fig. 1a). Since, the testing of the developed transplanter requires
lots of seedlings, so dummy seedling of similar dimension i.e. height
and weight was prepared (Fig. 1b). Seedling properties need to be con-
sidered while designing the transplanter (Khadatkar et al., 2020). The
average stem diameter, height and weight of the seedling were
0.1 mm, 96 mm and 14.7 g. The mixture used for growing nursery in-
cludes coco-peat, vermiculite, perilite and soil in proportion of 2:1:1:1,
respectively. The soil of the farm was black cotton soil (plasticity
index 20–65%) with 95% of clay and silt, and 5% sand. The average
bulk density and moisture content (db) of testing plot was 1.6 g/cm3
and 14%, respectively. The soil used had an average pH = 6.2, EC =
0.045 mhos/cm2 with nutrient contents of N = 0.012%, P = 4 ppm,
K = 85 ppm and organic C = 0.38%. The sand was the other component
mixed with soil in equal proportion to add air space and weight to the
potting mixture. Cleaned and washed medium sand with particles in
the range of 0.425–2 mm was used.
2.2. Design requirement of the seedling transplanter
2.2.1. Structure of seedling transplanter
To avoid damage to the seedling, the seedling should be released as
close as possible to the ground from the pro-tray in the direction of for-
ward travel of the transplanter. The transplanting system mainly con-
sists of a feed roller, pro-tray belt, a pair of L-shaped rotating ﬁngers,
embedded system, DC and stepper motor (Khadatkar and Mathur,
2020). The “L-shaped” rotating ﬁngers are mounted on the metering
shaft which is connected with the ground wheel as well as with the
stepper motor (Fig. 2). The ground wheel is used to rotate the shaft at
a speciﬁed forward speed whereas the stepper motor is used to move
the metering shaft to and fro using micro-controller. The electronic
switches are connected to change the direction of the metering shaft.
The DC motor was used to move the protray forward direction so that
the next row comes to the striking position when the leaf switch was
pressed. The ground wheel used to rotate the metering shaft which
ejects the seedling from the pro-tray into the delivery box.
2.2.2. Working principle of seedling transplanter
For automatic control and functioning of seedling transplanter, em-
bedded system was developed. The working principle of the seedling
transplanter is briefed in Fig. 3. The developed system was driven by
ground wheel, stepper motor and DC motor. The ground wheel was pro-
vided on one side of seedling transplanter, which is used to rotate the
metering shaft in the forward direction whereas the stepper motor was

used to move the metering shaft to and fro. The DC motor was used to
move the protray forward as per the programme. The metering mecha-
nism was also controlled by programming using micro-controller, step-
per motor and DC motor. The feed roller has to feed one pro-tray of
seedlings at a time to the metering system. The sprocket of the ground
wheel has 28 teeth and 14 teeth sprocket on the idler shaft. The increase
in speed is in a ratio of 2:1.
The idler shaft has sprocket with 20 teeth and sprocket on metering
shaft with 12 teeth. The increase in speed is about 1.7 times. This rota-
tional speed is used to eject out the plug seedling from the pro-tray
into the delivery box. To maintain the optimum plant to plant spacing,
the velocity ratio between ground wheel shaft of the feeding mecha-
nism and metering shaft is kept as 3.4:1.
2.2.3. Design of embedded system for automatic transplanting
To release seedling at optimum spacing, a novel transplanting mech-
anism was developed which is controlled by electro-mechanic system to
automate the operation. In this system ArduinoUno microcontroller is
used for operating the driver of DC motor and stepper motor (Fig. 4). Mi-
crocontroller generates Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals of differ-
ent pulse width for both DC and stepper motor. Here, two leaf switches
are used for changing the direction of stepper motor attached at
Fig. 1 (continued).

120 mm apart from one end. Both the switches were pressed with the
help of special bush attached on the metering shaft. When stepper
motor moves and its presses the right switch, then controller receive sig-
nal from switch digital pin and it gives digital output at direction pin of
stepper motor driver. Thus, motor rotates in clockwise direction and
when left switch is pressed stepper motor moves in anti-clockwise direc-
tion. As the direction of stepper motor changes, DC motor turn ON with
delay of 1 s and after 75 milliseconds DC motor becomes off. The DC
motor makes to moves only in anticlockwise direction so that the feed
roller rotates in forward direction. The microcontroller provides 5 V DC
voltage as power supply for both drivers. A 12 V DC battery is used as
power supply for both motors and microcontroller.
2.3. Design and development of experimental transplanting system for
plug-type seedling
The experimental setup was designed and run in soil bin. The differ-
ent components of the setup were as follows:
i) Experimental transplanting system
ii) Embedded system
2.3.1. Experimental transplanting system for seedling transplanter
A seedling transplanter was designed and developed which con-
sists of a pair of “L-shaped” rotating ﬁngers, pro-tray feed rollers, belt,
metering shaft, pro-tray guides, delivery unit and embedded system.
The developed experimental setup was test in soil bin (Fig. 5). To ad-
dress the two rows, pair of “L-shaped” rotating ﬁngers was mounted
on the metering shaft at distance of 120 mm from one end. The
metering shaft is connected with the ground wheel as well as stepper
motor. The ground wheel rotates the metering shaft at a speciﬁed for-
ward speed and rotating ﬁngers ejects the seedling from the pro-tray.
The forward and backward motion to the metering shaft was given by
the stepper motor.
A single seedling was pushed out from the pro-tray into the delivery
tube by striking it from below and placed in the furrow. For more effec-
tive delivery of single seedling, pro-tray guide and pro-tray press as-
sembly were provided. The pro-tray guide was used to guide the pro-
tray in the speciﬁed path whereas, pro-tray press assembly “1” was
used to press the pro-tray horizontally and pro-tray press assembly
“2” was used to press the pro-tray vertically. The seedlings spacing be-
tween them can be adjusted by increasing/decreasing the forward
speed of the machine. The spacing can also be changed by changing
the ratio between forward speed and rpm of the metering shaft
(Table 1).
2.3.2. Embedded system
An embedded system for seedling transplanter comprised of micro-
controller board (Arduino Uno), DC motor, stepper motor and button
switch. Arduino board has 2 kB SRAM and 1 kB EEPROM, it have 14 dig-
ital input/output (I/O) pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6
analog inputs, a USB port, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a power jack, an
in-circuit serial programming (ICSP) header, and a reset switch. The
micro-controller was conﬁgured by using open source Arduino software
to upload new code without use of an external hardware programmer.
The micro-controller board can be powered via USB cable from laptop as
well as external power supply adapter. The programming of microcon-
troller based system was done in C language.
2.3.3. DC motor actuating unit
Microcontroller provides a maximum 5 V DC output voltage and to
actuate DC motor requires 12 V, hence an intermediator is required be-
tween controller and motor. This mediator is DC motor H- bridge driver,
it transfers PWM control signal from microcontroller and 12 V power
from battery to motor. Driver is able to change the speed of motor on
the basis of duty cycle of PWM signal and also vary the direction of

motor according to controller command. The controller provides three
types of signal to driver they are: PWM, enable and direction. Enable
signal used to actuate the motor or halt the operation of motor, if it is
high it turns ON motor, otherwise vice versa. DC motor was operated
at 12 V and 5 V was providing to DC motor driver by Arduino for oper-
ating the motor at constant speed. Controller generates PWM for con-
trolling the speed of motor and it also set the direction of motor
clockwise or anticlockwise. DC motor was used for controlling the lon-
gitudinal movement of feed roller.
2.3.4. Stepper motor actuating unit
Stepper motor also requires H-bridge driver for actuating it on the
basis of control signals provided by microcontroller. TB6560 driver
was used here for stepper motor operation. It also works on the princi-
ple of PWM signal and requires both direction and enable signal from
controller for performing the operation. Stepper motor move the shaft
in which L type rotating ﬁngers are attach used for striking the pro-
tray so that seedling comes out from the tray.
2.4. Design of seedling transplanter
2.4.1. System working principle
The system mainly consists of pro-tray feed roller unit, metering
unit, delivery unit and corresponding embedded system. The embed-
ded system developed is used to drive the metering mechanism and
the mechanical system used to drive the system at optimum rota-
tional speed at 3.4:1 transmission ratio to obtain recommended
plant to plant spacing. At the same time, the seedling pro-tray feed
rollers and metering shaft is driven by DC motor and stepper motor
to supply the seedlings transversely and longitudinally, respectively,
so as to eject the seedling from the pro-tray and releasing into the fur-
row. The entire operation was controlled by embedded system. The
pro-trays are fed longitudinally and metering shaft moves trans-
versely. The seedlings are ejected by rotating ﬁngers mounted on
the metering shaft.
2.5. Design of control system
2.5.1. Component for control system
ArduinoUno microcontroller is used for operating the driver of DC
motor and stepper motor. Microcontroller generates PWM signals of
different pulse width for both DC and stepper motor. Here, two leaf
switches are used for changing the direction of stepper motor attached
at 120 mm apart. When the switch was pressed, the controller receive
signal from switch digital pin and it gives digital output at direction
pin of stepper motor driver. Thus, motor rotates in clockwise direction
and vice-versa. The embedded system works as per the ﬂow chart for
developed seedling transplanter (Fig. 6). The micro-controller provides
5 V DC voltage as power supply for both drivers. A 12 V DC battery is
used as power supply for both motors and microcontroller.
2.5.2. Complete circuit and software interface of the system
CNC Router Single Axis 3A Stepper Motor driver board was used for
axis control with Input signal high-speed opto-coupler isolation, large
heat sink to ensure good heat dissipation. Coding of embedded system
had been done in Arduino software in C language as per the circuit dia-
gram (Fig. 7). Stepper motor driver is semi-ﬂow mode adjustable, semi-
ﬂow current adjustable, with a variety of semi-ﬂow model and semi-
ﬂow current setting functions.
2.6. Performance Evaluation of developed seedling transplanter
2.6.1. Experimental protocol
The developed seedling transplanter unit was ﬁxed to the carriage
mounted on soil bin rails. This unit consisted of developed transplanter
with metering mechanism, ground wheel and the power transmission.
The soil bin experiments were conducted to check the working of the
developed system. They were operated simultaneously at factorial com-
binations of four levels of forward speed of transplanter (S1 = 1.0, S2 =
1.5, S3 = 2.0 and S4 = 2.5 km/h) and three levels of angle of protray
feed roller (A1 = 00, A2 = 300 and A3 = 450), respectively with three
replications. Soil bin experiments were conducted on transplanting
mechanism to study the effect of machine parameters viz. speed of op-
eration on furrow closure, uniformity in spacing and success of
transplanting plug seedlings (Table 2). Observations for angle of inclina-
tion of stem with vertical, proper furrow closure and plant spacing were
recorded at different forward speed. The performance of the system was
indicated by measure of plant to plant spacing (PS), planting depth
(PD), transplanting efﬁciency (T), percent furrow closer (FC), angle of
inclination of seedling (AI) and miss planting (MP).
2.6.2. Test parameters
The important performance parameters required to evaluate the
transplanting system are plant to plant spacing, planting depth,
transplanting efﬁciency, furrow closer, angle of inclination and miss
planting. The equations for calculation of above parameters are given
below:
Plant to plant spacing (PS): The distance between plant to plant was
measured with the help of measuring tape.
Planting depth (PD): The standard method for measuring depth of
planting is by uprooting seedlings and then measuring the depth by
steel tape.
Transplanting efﬁciency (T): The transplanting efﬁciency was calcu-
lated by the ratio of seedlings inclined less than 30° from the vertical
and proper soil compaction around roots to the total number of seed-
lings transplanted and expressed by equation given below.

Where, Nt = Number of seedlings successfully transplanted with
angle of inclination less than 30° from the vertical and proper soil com-
paction around roots.
N = Total number of seedlings transplanted.
Furrow closer (FC): For a seedling to be counted as successfully
transplanted, the plug of the seedling must be covered and compacted
properly with soil. The furrow was said to be properly closed if the
root plug of the seedling was not visible and covered completely with
soil. Visual observations for furrow closure were recorded as “1” for
proper furrow closure and “0” for the rest.
Angle of Inclination (AI): For a seedling to be counted as successfully
transplanted, in addition to furrow closer of stem from vertical, the
transplanted seedling must be having angle of inclination <300 from
the vertical.

3. Results and discussion
The experiment were carried on soil bin at four forward speed of op-
eration and at three different inclination of feed roller to get the best
combination of result on the basis of performance (Fig. 5). The effect
of speed of operation and angle of pro-tray feed roller on different per-
formance parameters were studied (Table 3).
The correlations among the application variables S, A, indicators for
seedling uniformity that is measured variables (PS, PD, T, FC, AI and
MP), the physical rule regarding the operation of the metering mecha-
nism and statistical values viz. Standard Error (SE), Standard Deviation
(SD) and Coefﬁcient of Variance (CV), related with plant spacing distri-
bution according to developed system (Table 4). There is very strong
correlation between many of the physical rules regarding the operation
of the metering mechanism and indicator values for seedling uniformity
that is the measured variables (PS, PD, T, FC, AI and MP).

the developed transplanter transplants seedling at optimum spacing
when the speed of operation is 2.0 km/h (Table 3). The developed
mechanism was driven by wheels which rolled over soil bin rails with-
out skid. Therefore, there was less chance of variations to be observed in
uniformity of spacing in soil bin. However, higher variation in spacing
may be expected in actual ﬁeld conditions due to high skid values of
ground wheel.
3.2. Planting depth
The observed depth of planting for different forward speed and
angle of pro-tray feed roller are shown in Fig. 9. The result indicated
that depth of planting decreases with speed of operation irrespective
of angle of the pro-tray feed roller. The best results were obtained for
S3 and A2 combination.
3.3. Transplanting efﬁciency
The average percentage of seedlings transplanted irrespective of
proper furrow closure for selected forward speed and angle of pro-
tray feed roller are shown in Fig. 10. In order to achieve higher ﬁeld ca-
pacity, it is desirable to transplant the seedling at higher speeds i.e.
2.0 km/h beyond which the transplanting efﬁciency reduces. At this
speed, the transplanting efﬁciency was 90.3% which is considered very
good (Khadatkar et al., 2018). It was observed from the result that
transplanting percentage increases with increase in speed of operation
and then reduces afterwards, which may be due to the reason that at
higher speed the soil covering was not proper.
3.4. Furrow closure
Proper furrow closure with sufﬁcient compaction around the vege-
table seedlings is critical criteria for establishment of seedlings after
transplanting and also to uphold the seedlings at a transplanted position
during early growth stage. The average values of furrow closure out of
total seedling transplanted for different forward speed and angle of
feed roller are shown in Fig. 11. The result indicated that the percentage
furrow closer decreases with increase in speed of operation and angle of
pro-tray feed roller upto S3 and then decreases which may be due to
bending of seedling at higher speed.

3.5. Angle of inclination
For proper transplanting, it was necessary that the angle on inclina-
tion of seedling should be less than 300 from the vertical. The average
values of angle on inclination out of total seedling transplanted for dif-
ferent forward speed and angle of feed roller are shown in Fig. 12. The
result indicated that angle of inclination of seedling increases with in-
crease in speed of operation as well as increase in angle of feed roller.
3.6. Miss planting
The percent missing of seedlings transplanted at selected forward
speed of operation and angle of pro-tray feed roller are shown in
Fig. 13. The result indicated that missing per cent increases with in-
crease in speed of operation as well as increase in angle of feed roller.
At S3 = 2.0 km/h speed and A2 = 300, the miss planting was 2.1%
which is considered very good (Khadatkar et al., 2018).
The results above indicated that the developed embedded system
work satisfactory with developed programme. It also indicated the
test values obtained during the study may be used to carry out the
ﬁeld trial for its efﬁcient working and further development. The results
also show that optimum speed of operation as well as angle of pro-tray
feed roller can improve the efﬁciency of the transplanter. Therefore,
speed of operation and angle of pro-tray should be optimized to use in
the new prototype for further application.
4. Conclusion
The seedling transplanter with embedded automatic transplanting
system that would enable the singulation and optimum plant to plant
spacing was developed and tested. An embedded system based soft-
ware programme was developed, the hardware design was fabricated
and it was integrated successfully with the seedling transplanter. The
average values of performance parameters obtained with the developed
system was found to be closer to the recommended values. The result
indicated that average values of plant to plant spacing, planting depth,
transplanting efﬁciency, percent furrow closer, angle of inclination and
miss planting were 600 mm, 46 mm, 90.0%, 84.2%, 180 and 3%, respec-
tively. The developed system ensures the optimum transplanting rate,
the ability to transplant at higher speeds, singulation of seedlings and
maintaining proper plant to plant spacing. The study indicated that
speed of operation and angle of pro-tray feed roller are important fac-
tors in improving the efﬁciency of the transplanter.
