Seismic random noise reduction is an important task in seismic data processing at the Chinese loess plateau area, which beneﬁts the geologic structure interpretation
and further reservoir prediction. The sparse inversion is one of the widely used tools for seismic random noise reduction, which is often solved via the sparse
approximation with a regularization term. The ℓ1 norm and total variation (TV) regularization term are two commonly used regularization terms. However, the ℓ1
norm is only a relaxation of the ℓ0 norm, which cannot always provide a sparse result. The TV regularization term may provide unexpected staircase artifacts. To avoid
these disadvantages, we proposed a workﬂow for seismic random noise reduction by using the self-paced learning (SPL) scheme and a sparse representation (i.e. the
continuous wavelet transform, CWT) with a mixed norm regularization, which includes the ℓp norm and the TV regularization. In the implementation, the SPL, which
is inspired by human cognitive learning, is introduced to avoid the bad minima of the non-convex cost function. The SPL can ﬁrst select the high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) seismic data and then gradually select the low SNR seismic data into the proposed workﬂow. Moreover, the generalized Beta wavelet (GBW) is adopted as the
basic wavelet of the CWT to better match for seismic wavelets and then obtain a more localized time-frequency (TF) representation. It should be noted that the GBW
can easily constitute a tight frame, which saves the calculation time. Synthetic and ﬁeld data examples are adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
workﬂow for effectively suppressing seismic random noises and accurately preserving valid seismic reﬂections.
1. Introduction
The loess plateau of the Ordos Basin in northwest China is one of the
main target regions for oil and gas exploration, especially the shale oil in
China. The topography and landform of the loess plateau are complex
and its surface layer contains too thick Quaternary loess, which results in
serious noises in the collected 3D ﬁeld data. Several types of incoherence
(random) noises have a bad inﬂuence on the successive seismic signal
processing and interpretation (Gu et al., 2021; Qu et al., 2021; Li et al.,
2021). Therefore, how to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the
collected ﬁeld data is one of the main research contents for the loess
plateau area in China.
During past decades, many denoising methods have been proposed
for ﬁltering seismic data, such as the predictive ﬁltering-based methods
(Chen and Sacchi, 2017), the mode decomposition-based methods (Yu
and Ma, 2018), the rank reduction-based methods (Zhang et al., 2020),
the sparse transform-based methods (Wang et al., 2019) and machine
learning-based methods (Zhong et al., 2021). Among these, the sparse
transform-based methods are proposed to reduce seismic random noise
based on various time-frequency (TF) transforms (Liu et al., 2016, 2019;
Xue et al., 2021). For the noisy seismic data, the TF energy of the random
noises distributes among the whole transform space, while the TF energy
of the valid seismic data is often restricted in a small TF space (Wang and
Gao, 2013). In a word, the TF spectrum of the valid seismic data is sparse.
Therefore, the sparse inversion with a sparse regularization is widely
used in the sparse transform-based random noise methods (Yuan et al.,
2012). The ℓ1 norm, as one of the commonly utilized sparse regulariza-
tion, has been applied in many sparse transforms to reduce seismic
random noises, containing the wavelet transform (Wang and Gao, 2013),
the curvelet transform (Wang et al., 2010), the synchrosqueezing trans-
form (Anvari et al., 2017). However, the ℓ1 norm, which is only a relaxed
version of the ℓ0 norm, may underestimate the high-amplitude compo-
nents of the sparse results. Meanwhile, it may lead to abnormal results
due to the soft-thresholding strategy (Ding and Selesnick, 2015).
To alleviate the above disadvantages, TV regularization is introduced
in sparse inversion, which can accurately maintain the structure edges.
Ma and Plonka (2007) proposed a curvelet-based denoising method with
a projected TV diffusion. Lari and Gholami (2014) proposed a
curvelet-TV regularized seismic random noise reduction method, in
which the Bregman iteration method is introduced to address this

optimization model. However, the TV regularization, as a piece-wise
regularization, may produce undesirable staircase artifacts (Ma and
Plonka, 2007; Selesnick et al., 2020).
Recently, the ℓp norm regularization Gonin and Money (2017), which
can provide the sparser solution, is widely used in the sparse
inversion-based random noise reduction method. However, the ℓp
norm-based cost function is non-convex and the solution will suffer from
a bad minima. To alleviate this problem, curriculum learning (CL), which
is inspired by the humans and animals learning way, is proposed (Bengio
et al., 2009; Kumar et al., 2010). The CL will ﬁrst train the easy samples
and then select the complex samples into learning. Although the CL can
obtain an accurate solution for the non-convex optimization problem, it
has a well-known limitation, which needs prior knowledge to deﬁne the
easy and complex samples. In practice, the deﬁnitions of easy and com-
plex samples are difﬁcult. Self-paced learning (SPL) is present to identify
the easy and complex samples adaptively (Meng et al., 2017). Self-paced
learning can ﬁrst select the simple samples into the training scheme and
then automatically learn the complex samples. In every training scheme,
the simple and complex samples are determined by the SPL model itself.
Thus, the SPL can avoid the bad minima for the above problem and
obtain an accurate result.
According to the above analysis, we proposed a seismic random noise
attenuation workﬂow based on the SPL and a mixed norm (named SRNA-
SPL-MN). The mixed norm, including the TV regularization and the ℓp
norm, can not only address the main drawbacks of the traditional regu-
larization but also generate accurate ﬁltered results. The SPL scheme is
introduced in this workﬂow to overcome the bad minima for the non-
convex optimization problem. In the implementation, The CWT with
the generalized Beta wavelet (GBW), which matches better for different
seismic wavelets, is introduced in this study to generate a localized TF
representation (Gao et al., 2006). Moreover, the GBW can constitute a
tight frame, which beneﬁts from saving the expensive calculation.
This paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst give a brief introduction of
sparse theory. Then, we propose a random noise reduction model called
SRNA-SPL-MN and then an effective split Bregman-based optimization
algorithm is applied to obtain accurate ﬁltered results. Next, synthetic
and post-stacked ﬁeld data examples are used on our proposed workﬂow,
respectively. Finally, the conclusion is given.
2. Theory of sparse representation
In this section, we ﬁrst review the sparse representation based on the
GBW. Then, we describe the theory of the sparsity-based seismic random
noise reduction method.
2.1. The generalized beta wavelet
In the past years, although several sparse transforms have been
developed, the CWT still has an important impact on seismic data pro-
cessing and interpretation (Wang and Gao, 2013). For a given signal s(t),
the CWT WT(a, b) is deﬁned as:
WTða; bÞ ¼ 1ﬃﬃﬃa

�∞
sðtÞψ*
�t � b

where ψ(t) is the mother wavelet, ψ*(t) is the conjugate of ψ(t). a and b
are frequency and time parameters, respectively.

For the CWT, selecting an appropriate basic wavelet is a key point,
which should match for different seismic wavelets. The CWT with the
best basic wavelet will provide a high localized TF representation. The
Morlet wavelet is commonly used in seismic data processing and inter-
pretation, which is given in the frequency domain as
ΨσðωÞ ¼ aσe�1
2ðω�σÞ2½1 � e�ωσ�
(2)
where Ψ(ω) is the Fourier transform of ψ(t). σ is the radian frequency. aσ
is a constant to maintain the normalization of the energy. Clearly, the
Morlet wavelet is a wavelet with a Gaussian envelope. For a larger σ(σ >
5.33), the second term of equation (2) can be ignored and the Morlet
wavelet can be regarded as an analytic wavelet. However, the Morlet
wavelet is not entirely analytic and does not match for the real seismic
wavelets, which may lead to unsatisfactory TF localization (Wang and
Gao, 2013).
To achieve a high TF localization, we utilize the recently proposed
GBW as the new mother wavelet in this work. The GBW can achieve an
adaptive trade-off between time and frequency localization, which is
given in the frequency domain (Wang et al., 2017).

where α and β are parameters to control the shape of the GBW. aα,β is a
normalization constant and U(ω) is the unit step function. To achieve an
adaptive trade-off between time and frequency localization, the param-
eters α and β are selected to match the real seismic wavelet according to

the estimation of the seismic amplitude spectrum (Gao et al., 2006,
2017). Fig. 1 displays the Fourier spectrum of the GBW with different aα,
β. Clearly, selecting proper aα,β can match different seismic wavelets.
Then, a high localized TF representation can be obtained by the GBW.
Furthermore, the CWT can construct a tight frame in the certain
condition based on the frame theory in Mallat (1999), which may beneﬁt
for the proposed seismic random noise reduction workﬂow in this paper
(Wang and Gao, 2013). Thus, the CWT coefﬁcients x ¼ ðxm;nÞm;n2N of a
signal s and the reconstruction CWT are deﬁned as
x ¼ 〈s; ψm;n〉 ¼ F*s
s ¼ Fx ¼ FF*s
;
(4)
where ψm;n ¼ ½ψm;nðtÞ�m;n2N denotes the wavelet family. 〈 �; � 〉 is the inner
product. The adjoint operator F* is deﬁned from L2ðRÞ to ℓ2ðN2Þ, while
the frame operator F represents from ℓ2ðN2Þ to L2ðRÞ.
2.2. The sparsity-based seismic random noise reduction
In seismic data processing, the observed noisy seismic signal includes
the noise-free seismic data and the random noise. Thus, the noisy seismic
signal y 2 RN�1 can be modeled as
y ¼ s þ n;
(5)
where s 2 RN�1 is the noise-free seismic signal and n 2 RN�1 is the white
Gaussian noise. A great challenge of random noise reduction method is
how to accurate estimate the noise-free seismic signal from the noisy
seismic signal.
From above analysis, the noise-free seismic signal can been recovered
from its inner products based on the tight frame analysis operator
(Mallat, 1999). Thus, based on equation (4) and sparse representation
theory, the approximation ~x can be obtained by a minimized optimiza-
tion problem
xopt ¼ arg min 1
2ky � Fxk2
2 þ λφðxÞ;
(6)
where φ(x) is the regularization term, which maintains some characters,
such as sparsity and smoothness. λ is a regularization parameter. Obvi-
ously, due to the sparsity of the noise-free seismic signal in transform
domain, the ℓ1 norm regularization term is commonly used in this
problem. Then, the minimization problem can be a lasso problem,
xopt ¼ arg min 1
2ky � Fxk2
2 þ λkxk1;
(7)
where kxk1 ¼ P
i
jxij is the ℓ1 norm and xi denotes the ith element of x.
Many optimization methods have been utilized to solve such problem
(Daubechies et al., 2004; Beck and Teboulle, 2009) and these algorithms
are implemented by an iterative updating scheme and a soft-thresholding
strategy, which is given by
softðx; λÞ ¼
8
<
:
x � λ x
jxj;
if jxj > λ
0;
if jxj < λ
:
(8)
However, the ℓ1 norm has some drawbacks. One is that the ℓ1 norm is
the approximate representation of the ℓ0 norm and cannot generate the
sparsest solution. Therefore, the ℓ1-minimization problem will lead to
underestimated results for the high-amplitude component (Selesnick,
2017). On the other hand, the thresholding strategy is always introduced
to solve the ℓ1-minimization problem and an inappropriate thresholding
parameter will lead to undesirable results.
To alleviate the disadvantage of ℓ1 norm, the TV regularization,
which can preserve edges, is addressed in seismic random noise attenu-
ation. The TV regularization optimization problem is given
min

ularization term, which is deﬁned as

Although the TV regularization has good performance to reduce
seismic random noise, it may provide unexpected staircase artifacts.
Meanwhile, according to equation (9), the TV regularization is generated
by the ℓ1 norm, which suffers from the similar limitation of the ℓ1 norm.

3. The proposed seismic random noise reduction method based
on self-paced learning
3.1. The ℓp norm regularization
According to above analysis, the ℓ0 norm is used to provide the
sparsest solution of equation (6). However, the ℓ0 norm-based optimi-
zation problem is a non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness (NP-
Hard) problem, which is difﬁcult to solve. Recently, the ℓp, 0 < p < 1-
based problem is proposed, which is deﬁned as
ℓp ¼ kxkp ¼
 Xn
i¼1 xi
p
!1
p
;
(12)
where xi is the ith element of x. Fig. 2 describes geometric sketch maps of
the ℓp,p¼0.8, the ℓ1 norm and the ℓ2 norm, respectively. Clearly, the ℓ2
norm only provides smoothness and the ℓp,p¼0.8 norm maintain much
sparser than the ℓ1 norm. Fig. 3 also gives the comparison for different
norms. Obviously, the ℓp,0<p<1 norm can preserve the sparsest result,
which can be introduced in the sparsity-based model.
3.2. The self-paced learning
Recently, a machine learning algorithm, called curriculum learning
(CL), is proposed. The CL, inspired by the humans and animals learning
scheme, can learn the easy samples and then select the complex samples.
Many empirical evaluations have demonstrated that the CL can avoid the
bad minima for a non-convex problem. However, the CL needed a prior to
determine the simple and complex samples, which was difﬁcult in the
real application.
To overcome above disadvantage, the SPL was addressed by Kumar
et al. (2010), which formulated the key principle of CL as an optimal
problem. The SPL can select the simple and complex samples automati-
cally, which is deﬁned as
min
x;w
Xn
i¼1 ωieðyi; f ðxiÞÞ þ hðw; ηÞ
(13)
where e is the loss function. w ¼ [ωi] and ωi is the ith weighted value on
samples. h(w, η) is the SPL regularization to calculate the weighted
values. η is the age parameter to control the learning pace. With the
parameter η increasing in every iteration, more complex samples will be
introduced in the learning scheme. The SPL regularization h(w, η) has a
general deﬁnition, which is given as follows:
Deﬁnition (SPL regularization term (Zhao et al., 2015)) Suppose w is
the weighted values, e is the loss function, η is the age parameter, h(w, η)
is the SPL regularization term, if.
1. h(w, η) is convex with respect to w 2 [0, 1].
2. w(η, e) is monotonically decreasing with respect to e, and it holds that
lime→0w(η, e) ¼ 1, lime→∞w(η, e) ¼ 0.
3. w(η, e) is monotonically increasing with respect to η, and it holds that
limη→0w(η, e) ¼ 0, limη→∞w(η, e) � 1.
where w(η, e) ¼ arg minw2[0,1]we þ h(w, η).
The above deﬁnition gives an easy understanding for the SPL. The
condition 2 demonstrates that the SPL can ﬁrst select easy samples. The
condition 3 indicates that when the age parameter becomes larger, the
SPL may include more complex samples into training. Compared with the
CL, the SPL can automatically select the easy or complex samples by
learner itself.
3.3. The proposed SRNA-SPL-MN model
According to the advantage of the ℓp,0<p<1 norm and the SPL, we
proposed a mixed ℓp norm-based seismic random noise reduction method
to avoid drawbacks of the single regularization. In our proposed method,
the mixed norm, including the ℓp,0<p<1 norm and the TV regularization,
can boost the advantages of the sparse regularization and the TV regu-
larization, while provide more accurate denoised results. The SPL is also
applied in this model to avoid the bad minima, which is introduced by
the ℓp norm regularization term. Thereby, the proposed optimization
model is given by

(14)
where λ1 and λ2 are regularization parameters. � represents the Hada-
mard product of matrices.
pﬃﬃﬃﬃw
is the element-wise square root of w. The
second term kxkp
p represents the ℓp,0<p<1 norm. kFxkTV is the TV regu-
larization. h(w, η) demotes the SPL regularization term to select the
training samples. The detailed properties of the SPL regularization term is
given in (Yang et al., 2019).
To further understand the SPL training processing, a simple SPL
regularization, called hard regularization, is used, which is deﬁned as
hðω; ηÞ ¼ �ηω
(15)
Then, we introduce this SPL regularization into equation (14). When
x is ﬁxed, the equation (14) can be rewritten as
min

ω*
i ðei; ηÞ is given as
ω*
i ðei; ηÞ ¼

1; ei � η
0; else :
(17)
According to equation (16), the binary values are given for every
sample. When the loss function ei is less than η, the samples are regarded
as simple samples. With the η increasing, more complex samples will be
included in the training scheme.
3.4. The algorithm of the proposed model
Obviously, the proposed SRNA-SPL-MN model in equation (14) is
non-convex and non-smooth, which is challenging to solve. However,
when the parameter x is ﬁxed, the equation (14) is a convex problem,
which is easy to solve. While the parameter w is ﬁxed, the equation (14)
become a mixed norm-based optimal problem, which can be solved by
the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm (Shen
and Cheng, 2016) and the split Bregman algorithm (Yin et al., 2008).
Thus, we ﬁrst divide the proposed SRNA-SPL-MN model into two
sub-problem and then optimize each of them with other ﬁxed.
At ﬁrst, when the x is ﬁxed, the equation (14) can be a regarded as

where ei ¼ 0.5(yi � (Fx)i).
Recently, many SPL regularizations have been proposed (Yang et al.,
2019). In this paper, we only consider the soft SPL regularization, which
is deﬁned by
hðω; ηÞ ¼

γ þ ωη;
(19)
where γ is a constant. Therefore, the solution of equation (18) is given as

Many method have been proposed to solve this non-convex problem,
such as the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algo-
rithm (Shen and Cheng, 2016) and the split Bregman algorithm (Yin
et al., 2008). In this paper, we use the split Bregman algorithm to solve
the equation (21). Based on the theory of the split Bregman algorithm
(Yin et al., 2008), two variables u and v are introduced and then the

In this section, a synthetic seismic signal is introduced to demonstrate
the performance of our proposed seismic random noise reduction
method. We utilized the SNR to measure the effectiveness of our pro-
posed method, which is given by

where y represents the noisy seismic signal and x is the denoised result.

the reﬂection, which is from the Marmousi model. Fig. 4(b) represents
the noise-free seismic signal, which is given by convolving a 35 Hz Ricker
wavelet on Fig. 4(a). The time sampling number is 601 and the time
sampling interval is 1 ms. The noisy synthetic seismic signal, which is
generated by adding White Gaussian noise, is given in 4(c) and the SNR
value is 5 dB. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed seismic
random noise reduction method, three comparison methods are applied
in this example, including the ℓ1 norm regularized sparse random noise
reduction method (named GBW-L1), the TV denoising method, the mixed
norm-based denoising method (called GBW-M). The regularization
parameter of the GBW-L1 is selected based on the noise level (Yang et al.,
2019). The TV regularization parameter selection strategy is given in
Ding and Selesnick (2015). For the GBW-M method, we also use the
Bregman algorithm to solve the optimal solution. The parameter p of the
GBW-M is set as p ¼ 1 and p ¼ 0.5, respectively. Unfortunately, the
regularization parameters selection in the GBW-M and our proposed
SRNA-SPL-MN method are still an open problem and thus these param-
eters are obtained by empirical validation.
Fig. 5 describes the denoised results by above-mentioned methods
and the SNR values of these methods are listed in table Table 1. Clearly,
the GBW-M method and our proposed method performer better than the
TV denoised method and GBW-L1 method. In order to describe the
comparison among these denoised methods in detail, Fig. 6 gives the
enlarged denoised results of Fig. 5 from 0.1s to 0.23s and the denoised
results in the black box is enlarged. The TV denoised method, which has
the lowest SNR value (SNR ¼ 11.92 dB), produces the unexpected
staircase artifacts denoted by the red arrows, while some effective signals
are leakage. The black box indicates that the GBW-L1 has some ineffec-
tive denoised results. For the GBW-M, when the parameter p is set as 0.5,
this method may lead to less effective signal leaking than the GBW-M
with p ¼ 1, which can be also demonstrated by the SNR value of the
denoised results in table ?? Thus, the parameter p of the proposed SRNA-
SPL-MN is set 0.5 and the denoised result is represented by the red line in
Fig. 5. Obviously, the proposed SRNA-SPL-MN with the highest SNR
(SNR ¼ 13.48 dB) can reduce the random noise more effectively and also
ensure a more signiﬁcant signal.
5. Field data applications
To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SRNA-SPL-
MN method, an example of 3D real seismic data is given in this section.
The 3D real seismic is shown in Fig. 7, which comes from the loess
plateau area in China. The real 3D seismic data includes 500 Inline traces
and 500 Xline traces, respectively. The time sample interval is 2 ms and
the time sample number is 500. We also select GBW-L1 and GBW-M with
p ¼ 0.5 methods as the comparison methods. Following the analysis of
the synthetic example, we set p ¼ 0.5 in this application.
The denoised results and the corresponding difference sections of
these three methods are shown in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. From the
difference sections in Fig. 9, these three mentioned methods make little
effective seismic signal leaking. Unfortunately, the GBW-ℓ1 attenuates a
little random noise especially within the black arrows in Fig. 8(c). From
Fig. 8(a) and (b), our proposed method has the best performance to
reduce random noises and maintain the effective signals. Furthermore,
the seismic traces of Xline 300 and Inline 300 are given in Fig. 10.
Clearly, the proposed method can ensure more effective seismic signal
than the other two denoised methods. Then, the normalized Fourier
spectrum of these four seismic traces is illustrated in Fig. 11 and the
results reveal that the proposed method attenuate more random noise,
especially in the high frequency part (shown in the black box).
The denoised results.
6. Conclusion and discussion
We propose a sparse transform-based seismic random noise reduction
method via mixed norm regularization and self-paced learning in this
study. The regularized term is consisted of a mixed norm, including the ℓp
norm and the TV regularization. This mixed norm can not only boost the
advantages of the ℓ1 norm and the TV regularization but also provide
sparser results than the above two traditional regularizations. Mean-
while, SPL, which can avoid the bad minima for the mixed norm regu-
larized optimization problem, is introduced in the proposed method. In
the implementation, the SPL selects the high SNR seismic data ﬁrst into
the mixed norm regularized problem and then learns low SNR seismic
data. Moreover, an enhanced Bregman iteration algorithm is addressed
to solve the above optimization model. In a word, the proposed random
noise reduction method has the best performance for improving the SNR
values for the seismic data, especially for the complex environment. To
show the performance of our proposed workﬂow, a synthetic seismic
signal and a 3D real loess plateau data examples are successfully applied.
Compared with the two traditional denoising methods, our proposed
workﬂow can reduce more random noises, while maintaining the valid
seismic signals.
Due to the introduction of three regularization terms in the proposed
model, the proposed method should take more experimental to set the
regularization parameters. Although the proposed method boosts the
performance of seismic data denoising, it is a signiﬁcant task to improve
the parameters selection scheme. Furthermore, the proposed model is
only focus on the seismic random noise reduction in this paper, which
can be extended to solve seismic data reconstruction and seismic random
noise reduction simultaneously. Another topic of the future work could
be to remove the seismic coherent noise.
