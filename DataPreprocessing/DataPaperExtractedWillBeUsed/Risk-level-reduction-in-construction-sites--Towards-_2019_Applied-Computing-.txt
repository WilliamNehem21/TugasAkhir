There has been increased concern in the evaluation of risk in the construction ﬁeld and it is common to
have it performed for every task, function and machine. Nonetheless this commonly used approach does
not take into account most of the intrinsic variables inherent to a site construction and hence several fac-
tors reported in literature, as well as experience based analysis, suggest that spatial and temporal vari-
ables have a strong inﬂuence on risk level distribution. To evaluate the impact of these factors a study
was conducted concerning the simultaneity of risks in the construction of an Aged People Hostel, in
the district of Braga, Portugal. A method was developed in order to reduce peaks of previously estimated
risk levels through the reorganization of tasks in time and space attaining a substantial reduction in peak
risk tasks. This study, along with the increasing availability of computing tools pertaining to the construc-
tion area, demonstrates the necessity for the development of new strategies regarding integrated risk
management and planning during the project phase that substantially mitigate risk peaks during
construction.

1. Introduction
Risk evaluation has begun half a century following the indus-
trial revolution in England [1] due to a growing concern regarding
working conditions, accidents and other risk factors, which were
common in the domain of ﬁrst industries. Nevertheless it was in
the United States of America that the ﬁrst initiatives regarding risk
prevention took place, given the government, entrepreneurs and
specialists intervention. In 1928 The American Engineering Council
had already demonstrated the existing connections between the
direct and indirect costs linked to accidents such as payment of
non-productive manpower, ﬁnancial losses and production disrup-
tion. In 1931 H.W. Heinrich [2] made public a study revealing the
direct and indirect costs of work accidents outlining a method that
was later known as the domino theory. The study underlined the
causality effect as determinant for a cascade effect ruled by ﬁve
factors: social ambience, human error, dangerous conditions, acci-
dent and personal damage [3]. Risk assessment is an important
tool for risk prevention at work and regardless of the method its
assessment is fundamental [4,5,11].
A greater concern towards both cause and effect of risk has been
growing and reported approaches are abundant in literature.
Simonds [4] presented a method for the calculation of costs associ-
ated with some types of accidents which might result in lesions,
medical assistance, ﬁrst aid help and accidents without injuries
[5]. In 1953 Recommendation n� 97 of The International Conference
of Work sets some basic guidelines for the protection of health con-
cerning the workers: practical actions to prevent, reduce and elim-
inate risks, medical care for workers, notiﬁcation of occupational
diseases and facilities for ﬁrst aid and emergency treatment in case
of accident. Bird & Germain [6] published another study where
90,000 accidents in a siderurgical enterprise were analysed giving
place to measures that were motivated by the costs resulting from
accidents. Towards the end of the 20th century a growing concern
emerged on the prevention of risk factor exposure or professional
disease [7,8,9,39]. Further, research and practice demonstrated
that decisions made prior to work at construction sites can

inﬂuence the safety of construction workers [10]. In fact, according
to Kuo and Lu [11] an effective risk management of construction
projects requires a reliable risk assessment and risk treatment
plan. Risk analysis is a core process of safety management [12]
and also, safety is a prominent feature in complex systems and
there is an abundance of different approaches on how to handle
it [13]. By deﬁnition, risk analysis deals with uncertain situations,
that is, with situations in which there is no complete and accurate
knowledge about the state of the system [14]. With the industrial
and social development already attained the perspective of risk
assessment has gained another dimension.
2. Integrated risk management
Falls represent a major care and cost problem to health and
social services world-widely given that 50% of falls result in an
injury [15] and it is known that injuries at work have a substantial
economic and societal burden [16,17]. Doulamis et al. [40]; Bourke
et al. [41] and Li et al. [42] proposed new methodologies based on
accelerometers and gyroscopes for the detection of falls neverthe-
less the main drawbacks of these studies concern the distinction
between involuntary human falls from normal movements similar
to falls. The difﬁculties encountered in these studies demonstrate
the importance of detecting and preventing the risk of falls. In gen-
eral organizations adopt safety management systems or behavior-
based systems approaches to safety functions in an attempt to
achieve performance excellence [18,19].
Some authors defend that safety and health management at
work should be initiated and integrated during the project period
[20] and safety management must be organized in function of
the building processes, the architectonic and structural solution
adopted. Santos et al. [21] characterize the Portuguese view on
how enterprises deal with the Occupational Health and Safety
Management Systems certiﬁcation process, after receiving the
Quality Management System certiﬁcation. The authors found that
in most cases the Occupational Health and Safety Management
Systems certiﬁcation process are the last to be implemented which
is corroborated by other authors [22,23,24]. An Occupational
Health and Safety Management System is deﬁned as ‘‘a set of tools
that enhance safety risk management efﬁciency related to all the
organization‘s work activities” [25,26] however enterprises that
have implemented the Quality Management System certiﬁcation
reported improvements in working conditions and in ensuring
compliance with applicable health and safety legislation [21]. In
high-risk organizations much effort has been made to standardize
procedures in order to streamline human action to decrease risk
and increase productivity [26].
Badri et al. [27], upon his literature review on the integration
and management of safety with the project management, state
the existence of many published books (60% of the selected pub-
lished books) that envisage the integration of risks management
with process control in the civil construction ﬁeld as a fatality.
Lately different approaches to the problem have been suggested,
several authors [28,29,30] have tried to combine scheduled tasks
to the programming and safety measures. Also, and due to critical
nature and high number of working accidents, several researchers
have proposed tools to integrate safety management in the process
of production programming. The following authors are just a few
that made attempts to integrate different aspects regarding risk
assessment and control: Hare et al. [29] tried to integrate safety
management within the project phase. He used an approach based
on discussions with experts on civil construction in order to
determine the critical and detriment factors for the development
of an integrative model for safety management; Zhang et al. [31]
proposed an automatic application integrated in recent systems
Building Information Modelling (BIM) - This application allows
for an automatic analysis of the virtual construction model in order
to detect and suggest preventive measures. It allows for the iden-
tiﬁcation of locations and periods during which safety measures
should be implemented in earlier stages of construction; Yi & Lang-
ford [30] introduced the concept of combining the timetable of dif-
ferent tasks with the programming of safety measures. They aim at
improving the perception of places and periods during which the
workers are potentially more prone and vulnerable to serious acci-
dents. They defend that if the mentioned places and periods are
previously identiﬁed necessary and adequate safety measures
can be taken to avoid situations of high risk. They also state that
safety planning requires coordination with the programming/
chronological register of works to identify situations when the risk
exceeds the admissible limits for the project. Besides reducing the
accident indexes this coordination concurs for the reduction in the
project costs; Doulamis et al. [43] use a different approach and
apply a resource allocation algorithm to minimize, but not elimi-
nate, overlapping tasks assigned to the same processor.
Other approaches to risk management increasingly take advan-
tage of digital technology [8] and its inherent capability to handle
massive quantities of information. Zhou et al. [32] established a
relationship between the risks in civil construction industry and
the digital and technological development veriﬁed in the concep-
tion of buildings and show the existence of several digital tools
which broach the safety questions during the construction period.
Nevertheless very few digital tools promote safety during the pro-
ject phase integrated into the work planning. They go on saying
that the digital tools broaching the safety measures in the project
phase are technically precocious. Hadikusumo & Rowlinson [33]
developed a tool to visualize the building process taking advantage
of recent virtual reality technologies - they developed a model able
to see all the constructive process still in the project phase. The use
of this tool during construction planning allows managers to access
safety management and identify, evaluate and control the existing
risks in the construction site. Kartam [28] through the Critical Path
Method (CPM) joined safety management with work management
programming based on planning, organization, control and leader-
ship principles. The proposed methodology has processes of con-
trol through engineering procedures, training and the right
fulﬁlment of normative requests and it allows for the program-
ming, management and safety control in every phase of the con-
struction project. Fung et al. [34] developed a Risk Assessment
Model (RAM) for the different periods of a project in the civil con-
struction to help safety managers and workers in understanding
the real risks in their working functions. This method gives a quan-
titative evaluation based on historical data and was tested in a real
working atmosphere to validate its credibility. Thus, proactive haz-
ard identiﬁcation and elimination is always safer and more cost
effective than reactive hazard management [35]. Liu et al. [36] pre-
sents an improved risk priority number approach based on a fuzzy
measure and fuzzy integral. A fuzzy measure is used to reﬂect the
importance of the individual indicators and the indicator set and a
fuzzy integral is a nonlinear function deﬁned on the basis of fuzzy
measure. Molen et al. [37] evaluates the effectiveness of a face-to-
face strategy and a direct mailing strategy on safety violations
while working from heights among construction companies com-
pared to a control condition.
3. Material and methods
The work presented in this paper addresses some of the
limitations presented by other approaches regarding the evalua-
tion and use of different risk probability variability within a con-
struction site location and proposes enhancements concerning

137
the optimized distribution of risk within the project plan. Taking
into consideration the presented approaches for risk assessment
and their limitations, this study adds a physical and temporal
dimension to the problem and is later assessed through a case
study. This paper presents a new methodology for risk assessment
in construction sites and it is designed to explore some of the lim-
itations of the previously presented studies. It takes into consider-
ation previous frameworks and addresses the limited results on the
relationship between physical and temporal risk hazard locations
providing a map that can be easily assessed to depict critical risk
in time and space. There are several theoretical assessment
methodologies, however, evaluations that address time and space
and are corroborated by a case study have not been yet been pre-
sented and validated.
This method was explored and evaluated during the construc-
tion of an Aged People Hostel - The building budgeted in 2.5 mil-
lion
Euro
has
three
ﬂoors
and
approximately
4000 m2
of
construction area and a construction period of one year. The infor-
mation registered for this construction site was the following: the
required working days to accomplish each task, their start and con-
clusion date and if applicable the total number of periods of work.
Fig. 1 details the information previously described in the form of a
chronogram.
Together with task records it was conducted an evaluation of
risk for each of the tasks (162 tasks) using the Composed Matrix
Method [38]. This method (by the Instituto Nacional de Seguridad
e Higiene en el Trabalho, 1995) enables the estimation of risk mag-
nitude through the identiﬁcation of existing deﬁciencies, their
probability of occurrence and associated risk consequence. The
Risk Level (RL) is a function of the Probability Level (PL) of some
accident and Consequence Level (CL) regarding associated dam-
ages, and can be represented as follows:
RL ¼ PL � CL
The Probability Level (PL) can be determined as a function of
Deﬁciency (insufﬁcient) Level (DL) of the preventive measures
and Exposure Level (EL) to risk, and can be expressed by:
PL ¼ DL � EL
where the Deﬁciency Level (DL) is the expectable amplitude
between the set of risk factors considered and its direct relation
to possible accidents. The Exposure Level (EL) is a measure of fre-
quency of occurrence of risk exposure and is estimated on the basis
of start times in work areas [38].
The quantiﬁcation of Deﬁciency Level, exposure and conse-
quence, was performed by direct observation of each task in the
real working environment. To get the most rigorous risk assess-
ment and therefore reﬂect the reality of this type of work there
was no interference in the form of the work involved or the time
required to perform tasks. Only preventive measures were consid-
ered, veriﬁed and implemented by workers during working hours.
The quantiﬁcation of risk associated with each task was through
the matrix represented schematically in Fig. 2. Risk characteristics
of each task are represented by the sum of the risks associated with
the different activities required to complete the respective task.
The tasks presented in Fig. 2, including ﬁling reinforced con-
crete pillars, ﬁling reinforced concrete stairs, walls rooﬁng ﬁlling
layer implementation, ﬁlling pavements, application of protection
guards on balconies and stairs, respectively obtained the following
individual levels of risk: 116,330, 92,820, 41,600, 37,980, 17,930
and 17,930. The most observed risks in the majority of task were
the following: the risks of falls from higher levels; falls at the same
level; incorrect ergonomic postures; and, electrical hazard. The cal-
culated risk was distributed along the chronogram of work to get a
real chronogram with the quantiﬁcation of associated risks for
each task, that is to say, a risk map. Fig. 3 presents a schematic
representation of the risk chronogram and associated task risk
magnitude.
The obtained risk map combined with the working chronogram
and associated risk evaluation makes it possible to quantify the
daily level of accumulated risk as function of the work taking place
at each spot. Several types of graphics may now be developed con-
sidering the temporal factor and the evaluated risk distribution.
This new approach can be analysed from different perspectives,
according to the relevance of the combined factors, these are:
– For tasks with the same level of risk evaluation, linked but not
juxtaposed, a graph of accumulated risk is developed, linear
and constant according to Fig. 4. This type of graph is ideal to
monitor and treat associated risk. Although in some phases of

construction there are some duly linked tasks which cannot
begin without the conclusion of previous ones quantiﬁcation
of individual risk level is not always equal.
– For tasks linked sequentially with different levels of risk, but not
juxtaposed, a graph of accumulated variable risk is developed
with deﬁned levels according to Fig. 5. This is the type of graph
which better mirrors a sequence of tasks of different nature but
duly linked. That is to say that this graph characterizes the set of
several tasks with different risk level, developed in sequence,
one after the other.
– For tasks simultaneously executed with different levels of risk
(in the same period of time) a graph of accumulated risk is
developed, variable with well-deﬁned levels but with very dif-
ferent valuations, according to Fig.6. With the simultaneity of
tasks the level of accumulated risk represents the total amount
of risk levels juxtaposed. This is the most usual and common
graph observed during construction.
Following the identiﬁcation of the phases of the work with
higher risk probability a number of organizational measures were
adopted that aimed at reducing peak risks values. The introduced
alterations aimed at reducing the number of simultaneous tasks
without interfering with critical activities and in the majority of
the cases resulted in the adjustment on the days pertaining to
the beginning and end of tasks, preserving the working days neces-
sary for the site construction. Critical activities are those that can-
not have any delay on completion and must be completed at a
deﬁned / scheduled time. Taking into account the initial chrono-
gram and the introduced alterations a new histogram of accumu-
lated risk was obtained.

The
following

present
the
different
approaches to risk distribution assessment and prediction as well
as a ﬁnal comparison subsection. In the ﬁrst part it is presented
the traditional analyses carried to determine probable problematic
periods concerning risk levels. The second part introduces into the
risk assessment analyses the proposed method taking into account
time and space redistribution of risk. The ﬁnal part gives a compar-
ison concerning the implementation of this method as well as
providing evidences pertaining to its beneﬁts on assessing risk
and complementary planning of tasks during construction.
4.1. Initial histogram
The obtained risk distribution histogram (Fig.7) is characteristic
of this type of construction for the category of building. This type is
characterized by two distinct phases of higher risk normally
separated by a lower risk period of time. The ﬁrst period includes

formwork and stripping of every element of concrete which com-
pose the building. The second includes the execution of all neces-
sary ﬁnishing works. Generally, between these phases there is a
small appeasement or even a total stop of every kind of work. This
appeasement or pause is due to the time required for hardening of
the concrete elements, which attain their project resistance after
28 days.
According to Fig. 7 it is shown that the ﬁrst month of work
reveals a small and residual level of risk given the tasks associated,
namely the settlement of the dock and cleaning of the ground. Dur-
ing the following months tasks such as installation and preparation
of every type of support equipment takes place as well as the
installation of sanitary facilities and social ﬁttings giving rise to
higher levels of risk. Additionally there are a number of different
tasks developed simultaneously concerning mainly to the execu-
tion of elements in concrete. Generally the execution of tasks in
this period have the highest risk index since it involves works in
height, digging works and movement of hanging cargoes.
Following this higher level of risk there is a reduction in the
number of tasks executed simultaneously that lasts approximately
28 days, the required period for the concrete elements to attain the
necessary resistance. It is also shown that works will not cease and
hence the correspondent risk associated persists, although smaller.
The following four months are characterized by irregular and broad
peaks due mainly to the high simultaneity of developed tasks.
Although the risks associated with on-going tasks have lower
levels there is high simultaneity of tasks and people working in
the building causing a rather high accumulated risk. Although
the last two months are also characterized by a high simultaneity
of tasks the risk level associated with each task is smaller giving
rise to a lower accumulated risk, due mainly to ﬁnishing tasks,
tests and cleaning. Hence, the accumulated risk pattern generated
for this construction site reveal two distinct phases of higher risk
incidence mainly due to the accumulated risk inherent to simulta-
neous execution of tasks. Generally, these histograms are obtained
using data collected on site and represent the risk accumulated
daily during the period of execution of the work. This method
can be applied to other types of construction works.
4.2. Redistribution of risk and task simultaneity analysis
Following the identiﬁcation of risk distribution along the execu-
tion plan measures were studied in order to diminishing the risk
peaks throughout the timeline of the project. These organizational
measures were established, without limiting the correct develop-
ment of work, i.e. without interfering with critic activities, consid-
ering mostly the reduction of simultaneous tasks with the aim of
diminishing the peaks obtained in each of the phases. Critical tasks
are those that cannot be delayed and hence be completed within a
predeﬁned / scheduled time and determine the critical path.
The modiﬁcations introduced preserve the duration of the pro-
ject and concern mainly in shifting tasks that are not on the critical
path and may have their schedule changed without major impact
on the overall project. The proposed and adopted alterations are
as follow:
– Considering the existence of three distinct periods concerning
the setting of concrete on pillars it was considered a shift on
the second period anticipating it by eight working days;
– Concrete setting in stairs were anticipated by eight working
days;
– Wall prooﬁng was anticipated by one working day, while the
second phase was delayed three working days;
– The ﬁrst pavement ﬁlling layer stages, on the very beginning
subdivided into three periods, was divided in two, anticipating
the second in eleven working days;
– The task of applying protection guards in interior and exterior
openings was delayed seventeen days;
– The task of applying protection guards in stairs was anticipated
nine days.
Project plans before and after the implementation of organiza-
tional measures are presented in Fig.8 and Fig.9.
Fig. 10 presents the combined histogram of accumulated risk
and working program resulting from the implementation of the
presented organizational measures. In the ﬁrst phase, period dur-
ing which the tasks have the highest risk level, a simple reduction
on one or two simultaneous tasks causes meaningful reductions in
the level of accumulated risk. Further, in the second phase, period
during which the tasks have a lower level of risk, the reduction of
tasks done simultaneously creates a graph with peaks in more
deﬁned levels.
4.3. Comparison between the initial and ﬁnal improvements
The organization measures implemented gave rise to a new risk
histogram that reduced peak risk and redistributed the accumu-
lated risk in a more homogeneous fashion. This redistribution gave
rise to an increase in risk level in some parts where the risk was
previously lower but resulted essentially in the reduction of risk
peaks that given their hazard brought higher beneﬁts to health
and safety and associated costs. As expected global accumulated
risk has not been reduced, it was simply redistributed along the
timeline of the project. In order to better judge on the redistribu-
tion of risk, Fig. 11 shows a comparison between the initial and
the latest results.

ment of organizational measures. Adapted from [5].

ment of organizational measures. Adapted from [5].

In order to better understand the improvements changes in the
histogram were highlighted – different colours were used to high-
light changes. According to Fig.12 the areas in green show a
decrease of accumulated risk and the areas in red, those with an
increase in accumulated risk.
The higher risk levels on the initial setting, corresponding to the
beginning of the third month of work, were redistributed along the
beginning of the second month. Further, some of the peaks identi-
ﬁed in the beginning of the ninth and tenth month of work were
redistributed along the seventh, eighth and mainly eleventh month
of work.
5. Discussion
The histogram of accumulated risk has shown that this con-
struction project is mainly characterized by two distinctive stages.
During the ﬁrst stage the higher risk accumulated tasks demand
special attention since higher levels of risk appear mainly due to
the cumulative effect of similar tasks duly mixed in the initial con-
structive process phase. The second stage is characterized by a high
number of activities developed simultaneously with meaningful
accumulated risk. That is, lower risk activities in conjunction with
the high simultaneity of tasks represent a level of accumulated risk
that cannot be underestimated.
Given the previous scenario organizational measures were
deﬁned and implemented to diminish the number of simultaneous
tasks. Shifting in time one or more of the tasks during the ﬁrst stage
should be enough to generate a signiﬁcant change in the distributed
risk since tasks at this stage possess higher levels of risk. The task in
the second stage carries a lower level of risk and therefore is more
difﬁcult to soften risk peaks levels. With the implementation of
the proposed organizational measures in the chronological register
of tasks it was possible to reduce the peaks of risk and transform
the histogram of accumulated risk into a smother and predictable
item. It was also veriﬁed that the global potential of existing risk
was not reduced; it was simply redistributed along the period of
time. The overall accumulated risk, as expected, was not reduced
since there was an overall redistribution of chronological tasks.
Although simultaneity was not taken into account it is known that
an increased number of simultaneous tasks give rise to increased
risk and hence a simultaneity coefﬁcient should be introduced.
Therefore, as well as redistributing tasks in time, risk should con-
template the effect of simultaneity since there is an augmented risk
while performing a higher number of tasks.
The results demonstrate that project planning should pay spe-
cial attention to risk maps since these have a strong impact in
the management of construction sites. Systematic changes in the
workforce, the continuous change of conditions and sceneries of
work, the exposure to the weather conditions and some other vari-
able factors render difﬁcult the task of identifying, observing, eval-
uating and gathering data that continuously mutate. It is therefore
important that safety managers have access to the risk characteris-
tic curves of each type of construction task in order to introduce
possible improvements regarding the reduction of accumulated
risk in order to accommodate changes in updates of the project
plan.
A method was developed in order to reduce peaks of previously
estimated risk levels through the reorganization of tasks in time
and space attaining a substantial reduction in peak risk tasks. It
is a new and innovative method because it allows companies that
adopt it to reduce the accumulated risks on a daily basis, and con-
sequently reduce accident levels in construction, as shown in
Fig.10, Fig.11 and Fig.12.
The organizational measures introduced and detailed previ-
ously suggest a number of actions that sustain more generic proce-
dures to be adopted by project managers as well as computer aided
tools. The following indications provide generic procedures to
reduce peak risk:
– Develop ﬁrst draft of project plan and identify problematic
spots;
– Fix critical path tasks and identify a time window for other
tasks;
– Avoid simultaneity of high risk tasks when redistributing tasks;
– Identify feasible solutions in the beginning of the project plan
that allow for simultaneity;
– Iterate through initial feasible solutions until a minimum risk
level is attained;

– Set the initial project plan tasks according to the above solution
and proceed, as above, searching for best feasible solutions
according to the previous approach.
Together with the reported state of the art concerning the
development of computer aided tools, according to the different
authors, it is fully justiﬁable the development of new tools that
incorporate and implement some of the presented organizational
measures in order to help managing risk under continuously vary-
ing construction site conditions taking into account a space dimen-
sion.
Thus,
it
is
evermore
required
further
research
into
methodologies that deal with risk assessment linked to project
planning in order to reduce construction site risks associated with
variable and evolving conditions.
6. Conclusion
With the implementation of the proposed organizational mea-
sures with computer aided tools primarily project planning related,
it is possible to reduce the peaks of risk and transform the his-
togram of accumulated risk into a smother and predictable item.
The reduction of risk to lower levels constitute a strong motivation
towards this approach since managing lower levels of risk results
in lighter risk measures which in turn reduce cost and hazard per-
taining to the construction site. Along with the side effects of
reducing the risk levels it is possible to envisage a more predictable
project planning. Along with the proposed organizational mea-
sures this work provides important insights pertaining to the char-
acteristic curve of accumulated risk in this type of building
construction. In further studies it would be important to determine
the curve of accumulated risk characteristic of other types of works
and enable a thorough comparison.
This study further unveils the potential pertaining to the devel-
opment of new computer aided tools, as well as, new methodolo-
gies
concerning
risk
management
intertwined
with
project
planning and managing. The reported organizational measures
were successful in reducing peak risk levels and contribute
towards the development of methodologies regarding risk man-
agement and its dynamic control during construction. The follow-
ing research step is to evaluate the efﬁciency of genetic algorithms
in optimizing the redistribution of tasks given the restrictions
posed by this problem targeted at reducing risk peaks.
