Abstract 
Based on the solution structure of white differential equation of DGM(2,1) model, we deduce the new 2-order grey 
derivative expression. In the specific application, we use new 2-order grey derivative expression instead of old expression 
to estimate parameters. Through accumulating example, we can see that the optimized DGM(2,1) model has higher 
simulation precision obviously.

1. Introduction     
The grey system theory which founded by professor J.L. Deng is a kind of theory which analyze the system 
on uncertainty in less data, incomplete information and devoid of experience[1]. As the elementary model, 
GM(1,1) model has applied extensively in the past twenty seven years, and obtain some satisfactory effect. 
But in the process of application, many scholars also discover the defects of GM(1,1) model. In order to make 
up the defect of GM(1,1) model, let grey model has more extensive application., scholars have done a lot of 
jobs. These jobs can be divided into two sorts generally, one sort is to optimize GM(1,1) model straightly by 
changing background value, grey derivative, the accumulation method of parameters, the optimized GM(1,1) 
model can be applied extensive[4,5,6,7]. Another sort is to construct some new grey models, such as GM(2,1)

model, DGM(2,1) model, Verhulst model, and so on. DGM(2,1) model is a kind of new grey model which is 
constructed by grey derivative and second-order grey derivative
�������. DGM(2,1) model can make up some 
defect of GM(1,1) model, but it still has its own defects. In this article, we deduce the new 2-order grey 
derivative expression based on the solution structure of white differential equation, and estimate the initial 
value in time responsive according to the principle of minimum of error sum of squares. so we construct 
optimized GM(2,1) model by optimizing 2-order grey derivative in order to make white differential equation 
and grey differential equation be more consistent. Through accumulating example, we see that the optimized 
DGM(2,1) model has higher simulation precision obviously.

3. Optimization of DGM(2,1)  
Paragraph [8] shows that the connotation expression of DGM(2,1) model is non-homogeneous exponential 
function, and we can see from theorem 2 mentioned above that the restored value deduced from the solution 
of white differential equation is also non-homogeneous exponential type. So we assume

In order to improve the simulation and prediction precision, we should make white differential equation and 
grey differential equation be more matching, so we should get a new expression of

Table 2 Comparison of the simulation precision 
From table 2, we can see that the optimized DGM(2,1) model(Model 3) has higher simulation precision 
obviously. 
5. Conclusion 
This article deduce the new 2-order grey derivative expression based on the solution structure of white 
differential equation of DGM(2,1) model, and proof that the old expression of 2-order grey derivative is the 
special situation of new 2-order grey derivative expression, so the new expression is more suitable. Through 
accumulating example, we can see that the optimized DGM(2,1) model has higher simulation precision 
obviously.
