In this article a real-time method is proposed that reduces the pose estimate error for robots capable of motion
on the 2D plane. The solution that the method provides addresses the recent introduction of low-cost panoramic
range scanners (2D LIDAR range sensors whose field of view is 360‚ó¶), whose use in robot localisation induces
elevated pose uncertainty due to their significantly increased measurement noise compared to prior, costlier
sensors. The solution employs scan-to-map-scan matching and, in contrast to prior art, its novelty lies in that
matching is performed without establishing correspondences between the two input scans; rather, the matching
problem is solved in closed form by virtue of exploiting the periodicity of the input signals. The correspondence-
free nature of the solution allows for dispensing with the calculation of correspondences between the input
range scans, which (a) becomes non-trivial and more error-prone with increasing input noise, and (b) involves
the setting of parameters whose output effects are sensitive to the parameters‚Äô correct configuration, and which
does not hold universal or predictive validity. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated through
extensive experiments on public domain data and over various measurement noise levels exhibited by the
aforementioned class of sensors. Through these experiments we show that the proposed method exhibits (a)
lower pose errors compared to state of the art methods, and (b) more robust pose error reduction rates
compared to those which are capable of real-time execution. The source code of its implementation is available
for download.
1. Introduction
Mobile robot localisation on one plane is a well-studied field in
robotics and several diverse approaches have been proposed in the
past. Probabilistic methods, e.g. the Kalman filter [1] or Monte Carlo
Localisation (MCL) methods [2‚Äì4] have been applied to the task of pose
tracking and have proven their success with respect to tracking efficacy.
At the same time, probabilistic methods are robust to sensor noise, dis-
crepancies between the robot‚Äôs environment and its corresponding map,
motion model mismatch with regard to the true kinematics of the robot,
and pose uncertainty [5‚Äì7]. These methods have also been employed
for global localisation, where a system is tasked with estimating the
robot‚Äôs pose under global pose uncertainty [8‚Äì10].
In practice, the pose estimate of localisation methods is beset by an
error which is often measured in centimeters or even decimeters [11,
12]. These errors are due to range scan measurements being distorted
by noise, or the map of the environment not matching the latter
adequately. Other reasons include the map being expressed as a finite

resolution grid, noisy or faulty and ever-drifting odometry (if at all
available), and the nature of the observation model. In certain condi-
tions such as industrial ones [13,14], the magnitude of the estimate‚Äôs
error is required to lie within constrained specifications. Therefore,
standalone or prosthetic methods have been employed or used in
tandem with well-established sturdy probabilistic (or otherwise) local-
isation methods, with many of them leveraging measurements from
onboard pre-existing LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) sensors.
LIDAR sensors have become popular in robot localisation due to
their high measurement precision, high update frequency, and almost
no need for preprocessing. The use of panoramic LIDAR sensors was
for a long time constrained to higher price ranges, low measurement
noise, and in the context of industry. In recent years, however, cheaper
but less accurate LIDAR sensors have become available. The former fact
facilitates their adoption and usage in research, but the latter poses a
challenge to both the robustness and accuracy of localisation methods.

between (a) the range scan captured from the robot‚Äôs actual pose
and (b) a virtual range scan derived by ray-casting the map of the
robot‚Äôs environment from the robot‚Äôs pose estimate. Due to its operating
principle, this technique may be termed scan-to-map-scan matching.
Related methods rest on establishing correspondences between fea-
tures, points, points and lines, distributions, or points and distributions.
However, methods resting on locating features presuppose structured
environments and the existence of features in a sufficiently undisturbed
state. Furthermore different environments exhibit different features,
and therefore the use of feature-finding methods must be tailored in
an ad-hoc manner. The majority of the rest use scan-matching methods
based on the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method [15‚Äì17], research
on which is ongoing for several decades [18‚Äì23]. However, ICP-based
methods are subject to the perplexities delimited by the underlying
process of establishing correspondences between the two input scans,
which are exacerbated in high levels of measurement noise. Further-
more, their use and performance is hindered by the needed tuning
of the plethora of parameters governing their response [24]. In any
case, the methodology of approaches that solve the scan-to-map-scan
matching task rests on establishing correspondences between the input
scans.
In this article we propose a method that solves scan-to-map-scan
matching in real time and in closed form that specifically targets
panoramic 2D LIDAR sensors. The central contributions of this article
are the following:
‚Ä¢ To the best of the authors‚Äô knowledge, the first real-time method
addressing the full 3D-matching of real-to-virtual 2D panoramic
range scans that operates without establishing correspondences of
any kind between input scans
‚Ä¢ The introduction of a method that aims at reducing the orienta-
tion error to lower than the sensor‚Äôs angle increment compared
to relevant prior work
‚Ä¢ The parameter set needed by the proposed method is smaller
in size and more intuitive to tune that those of state-of-the-art
methods, and trades execution time for accuracy
‚Ä¢ The extensive and thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art scan-
matching methods and of the proposed method on the task of
scan-to-map-scan matching, over five public domain benchmark
datasets and measurement noise levels from common-use com-
mercially available panoramic sensors
The proposed method assumes that (i) a panoramic range scan, (ii)
the map of the environment in which the robot operates, and (iii)
a pose estimate residing in the vicinity of the robot‚Äôs true pose are
available. After computing a virtual range scan from the measurement
sensor‚Äôs pose estimate, the method updates it by reducing first the
error of the orientation estimate and then that of the position estimate.
The process is iterated until sufficient convergence conditions are met.
The estimation of the 3D transformation between the robot‚Äôs true and
estimated pose is facilitated by the exclusive use of the first term of
the Discrete Fourier Transform of the difference in ranges between
the input real scan and computed virtual scans, where the range scan
termed ‚Äò‚Äòreal‚Äô‚Äô is a measurement of a physical range finder and those
termed ‚Äò‚Äòvirtual‚Äô‚Äô are generated by raycasting the map of the robot‚Äôs
environment.
In summary, (a) the orientation errors of the proposed method
are independent of the initial angular displacement, and (b) it allows
matching to preserve robustness in high levels of measurement noise
and map distortions. Specifically, the approach proposed is shown to be
more robust to measurement noise and map distortions than real-time
state-of-the-art methods in the sense of proportion of cases where the
pose estimate error is reduced after its application, and more accurate
in terms of pose error magnitudes.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2
formulates the problem and the objective of its solution. Section 3
defines necessary notions. Section 4 provides a bibliographical ex-

2. Problem formulation
Problem P.
Let a mobile robot capable of motion in the ùë•‚Äìùë¶ plane be
equipped with a coplanarly mounted 2D panoramic range scan sensor
emitting ùëÅùë† rays. Let also the following be available or standing:
‚Ä¢ The map ùë¥ of the environment the robot operates in
‚Ä¢ A 2D range scan ÓàøùëÖ, captured from its range sensor‚Äôs ‚Äì unknown
and sought-for ‚Äì pose ùíë(ùíç, ùúÉ), ùíç = (ùë•, ùë¶)
‚Ä¢ An estimate of the range scan sensor‚Äôs pose ÃÇùíë(ÃÇùíç, ÃÇùúÉ) in the map‚Äôs
frame of reference, where ÃÇùíç = (ÃÇùë•, ÃÇùë¶) is in a neighbourhood of ùíç
Then the objective is to reduce the 2-norm of the sensor‚Äôs pose error
ùíÜ(ùíë, ÃÇùíë) ‚âú ùíë ‚àí ÃÇùíë from its initial value
‚ÄñùíÜ(ùíë, ÃÇùíë)‚Äñ2 = ((ùë• ‚àí ÃÇùë•)2 + (ùë¶ ‚àí ÃÇùë¶)2 + (ùúÉ ‚àí ÃÇùúÉ)2)1‚àï2
(1)
by improving the sensor‚Äôs pose estimate to ÃÇùíë‚Ä≤(ÃÇùë•‚Ä≤, ÃÇùë¶‚Ä≤, ÃÇùúÉ‚Ä≤) so that
‚ÄñùíÜ(ùíë, ÃÇùíë‚Ä≤)‚Äñ2 < ‚ÄñùíÜ(ùíë, ÃÇùíë)‚Äñ2
(‚àó)
Assuming that the sensor‚Äôs pose with respect to the robot‚Äôs frame of
reference is known, the correction of the sensor‚Äôs pose estimate is equal
to the correction of the robot‚Äôs pose estimate with respect to the map‚Äôs
frame of reference. An example of a premise of Problem P is depicted
in Fig. 1 . Pose estimate ÃÇùíë is supplied externally from a localisation
system in the case of pose tracking, or as a pose hypothesis in the case
of global localisation.

Each ray is equiangularly spaced from its neighbouring rays (with the

the same environment at both capturing times. Let ùíëùëâ (ùë•ùëâ , ùë¶ùëâ , ùúÉùëâ ) be the
pose from which the sensor captured Óàøùëâ , expressed in some coordinate
system (usually a past pose estimate of the sensor). The objective of
scan-matching in two dimensions is to find the roto-translation ùíí =
(ùíï, ùúÉ), ùíï = (ùõ•ùë•, ùõ•ùë¶) that minimises the distance of the endpoints of Óàøùëâ

Remark I.
Scan-matching is employed in robotics as a means to
odometry, primarily in non-wheeled robots where no encoders can
be utilised, or as a useful ameliorator of the ever-drifting encoder-ed
odometry: scans captured at consecutive time instances, inputted to a
scan-matching algorithm, convey an estimate as to the pose of the scan
sensor at the second capture time relative to that captured first. Scan-
matching is being successfully employed in the tasks of simultaneous
localisation and mapping [26‚Äì28], local map construction [29‚Äì31], and
in people-tracking systems [32].
Definition IV.
Definition of a map-scan. A map-scan is a virtual scan
that encapsulates the same pieces of information as a scan derived from
a physical sensor. Only their underlying operating principle is different
due to the fact the map-scan refers to distances to obstacles within the
map of the robot‚Äôs environment rather than within the environment
itself‚Äîhence its virtuality. A map-scan is captured from a virtual sensor
and derived by means of locating intersections of rays emanating from
the estimate of the sensor‚Äôs pose and boundaries demarcating obstacles
in the map.
Definition V.
Scan-to-map-scan matching in two dimensions. Scan-
to-map-scan matching is defined in the same way as scan-to-scan
matching (Definition III) but with Óàøùëâ now derived not from the physical
environment of the robot but from its map.
Remark II.
The benefit of matching (a) a map-scan derived from
a virtual sensor from its estimated pose to (b) a scan derived from a
physical sensor from its actual pose is that the correction of the sensor‚Äôs
pose estimate provides the correction of the robot‚Äôs pose estimate:
Assume that a pose hypothesis exists in the general vicinity of the true
pose of a mobile robot equipped with a 2D range-scan sensor; assuming
that the range sensor is fixed at the same pose relative to the robot in
both real and virtual environments, the roto-translation of the virtual
scan‚Äôs endpoints that minimises their distance to their projection on
the physical scan equals the roto-translation that, when applied to the
robot‚Äôs estimated pose, will minimise its displacement with respect to
its real pose. Therefore extracting the relative roto-translation of the
virtual scan with respect to the real scan can be used as a correction of
the estimate of the robot‚Äôs pose within the map. The significance of this
correction lies in the fact that it may be used to reduce a robot‚Äôs pose
estimate error during pose-tracking, or to facilitate global localisation.
Remark III. In contrast to the problem of scan-matching, scan-to-map-
scan matching is an inherently coupled problem: since the geometry of
the endpoints of the real scan‚Äôs rays can be matched, without loss of
generality, only from the true pose of the robot, the robot‚Äôs orientation
can be extracted if and only if its location estimate coincides with
its real location, and its location can only be extracted if and only
if its orientation estimate equals its real orientation. However, both
are, in principle, unequal. This coupling is why an iterative method
is required, as we shall see in Section 5.3.
Remark IV. In contrast to scan-matching, where Óàøùëâ is an immutable
measurement laden with inevitable occlusions, in scan-to-map-scan
matching Óàøùëâ is generated from the map, which captures the robot‚Äôs
working environment in its entirety, thus transferring this property to
the virtual scan. This subtle difference makes it in principle possible for
the virtual scan Óàøùëâ to match the immutable measurement ÓàøùëÖ
‚Ä¢ exactly, i.e. to recover the robot‚Äôs true pose with arbitrary ac-
curacy (in the ideal case of perfect measurements and complete
map-to-environment coincidence)
‚Ä¢ without the need to establish correspondences between the two
scans (as this function has been invented for, and primarily
facilitates, the matching of sets that are in principle overlapping
in some areas but not in others, i.e. for the task of scan-matching)
Remark V. The importance of dispensing with the establishing of cor-
respondences ‚Äì aside from the fact that, strictly, they are not necessary
in the scan-to-map-scan matching task ‚Äì is in the fact that by the same
act the externally-configurable parameters which govern this function
are also dispensed with. Matching methods that rely on the establishing
of correspondences require the setting of these parameters, some of
whose tuning has been proved to be non-intuitive, effort-consuming,
and not globally-fitting to any environment or even to different poses
in the same environment [24].

4. State of the art approaches
This section serves as a recounting of approaches that aim to im-
prove a robot‚Äôs pose estimate during pose-tracking or perform global
localisation that rest on the principle of scan-to-map-scan matching.
In general, scan-to-map-scan methods pertaining to 2D LIDAR range
scan sensors compute the 3D transformation that aligns the input
sensed scan (Definition I) to a map-scan (Definition IV) best, in the
sense of minimising an error or alignment metric (e.g. Eq. (2)). In
coarse classification this is achieved by (a) correlating features ex-
tracted from both input scans [11,33,34], (b) resting on scan-matching
techniques [17,23,35‚Äì38] due to the indistinguishability of a virtual
scan with respect to a real scan from the point of view of a scan-
matching method (Definition V; Remark II) [14,39‚Äì42], and (c) by
other means, e.g. spectral techniques [43], Gauss‚ÄìNewton optimisa-
tion [44], Fourier analysis [24], or simply by randomly sampling the
available pose space [45].
The entirety of real-time scan-to-map-scan matching methods men-
tioned above perform matching by establishing correspondences be-
tween input scans (whether they be between raw measurements, fea-
tures, or other scan characteristics), and require the manual setting of
parameters that govern it, while these do not hold universal or predic-
tive validity (for an example pertaining to ICP-based methods see [24]).
Establishing correspondences for facilitating matching, in particular,
is a technique suitable for low-noise scans, which, in theory at least,
becomes cumbersome and ineffective as input noise increases. The
method proposed in this article addresses the above issues and exhibits
the merits found in Section 1. The rest of this section delves deeper into
each aforementioned method and describes its methodology.
In [33] a matching algorithm that deals in range scan features is in-
troduced. The algorithm operates by detecting rotation- and translation-
invariant features that are only computable in real-time (such as
extreme values in the polar representation of a range scan) in both
real and virtual scans. Subsequently, correspondences are established
between them. The roto-translation between the two is then computed
as the optimal transformation for mapping the latter‚Äôs features to the
former‚Äôs.
In [45] an elementary stochastic search algorithm that corrects the
robot‚Äôs translational and rotational errors due to odometric drift is
employed. This auxiliary localisation behaviour is activated whenever
an error measure is found to be above a preset threshold. This measure
is based on the relative deviation in detected ranges between rays from
a real scan and a map-scan. To avoid having to correct for the motion of
the robot while scan-matching, the robot is assumed to be standing still
for the whole duration of its pose correction. Therefore whenever the
error measure is found to be above its preset threshold the algorithm
halts the robot‚Äôs motion and picks a random pose in the neighbourhood
of its estimated pose. It then takes a virtual range scan from that pose
and computes the new error. If the error is lower than the one found
for the previous estimated pose, a new iteration starts, this time centred
around the newly found pose. If not, the algorithm keeps guessing poses
until it finds one whose error is lower than the previous one. The final
pose is then taken as the true pose of the robot, allowing for a correction
of the odometry. Experiments performed with this method showed that
it was able to correct a radial pose error of 0.3 m to 0.07 m, and an
angular pose error of 0.393 rad to 0.01 rad.
The authors of [11] use scan-matching in order to improve the
solution to the global localisation problem. Assuming that the robot‚Äôs
environment is structured and without any sort of symmetries, the
method identifies the robot‚Äôs global orientation by employing the HSM
scan-matcher [46]. HSM is used to obtain the robot‚Äôs heading by
matching the lines in the map of the environment with the lines from
the 2D range scan taken at the robot‚Äôs initial pose. Having found the
robot‚Äôs orientation, they estimate the robot‚Äôs location by calculating the
likelihood that each location on the map‚Äôs grid produced the input laser
scan. This likelihood is extracted by using the beam endpoint model
[6]. The robot‚Äôs position is the location from which the virtual scan
that scored the maximum probability was captured.
Likewise, in the context of global localisation, the method in [43]
first generates the generalised Voronoi diagram of the 2D grid map.
Its nodes are taken to be initial hypotheses of where the robot is
posed. From there virtual scans over an angular range of 2ùúã are
computed using raycasting the grid map. Correspondences between
each virtual scan and the scan captured from the physical sensor are
then established by using a spectral technique [47]. The latter finds
pairwise geometric relationships between its two input scans. These
correspondences are then used to generate 2D geometric histograms
that encode a sense of similarity between the true scan and all virtual
scans. The nodes from which the latter were captured are then ranked
according to this similarity measure and a threshold based on the
correlation coefficient of all combinations of scans is used to extract a
subset of candidate poses. This process is used to quickly sift between
all candidate poses. The final pose is that which achieves the maximum
number of correspondence pairs.
In [39] the occupancy grid map is first converted to a signed fitness
map which encodes the distance the closest obstacle for a given sensor
location. Through the fitness map the measurements of the 2D range
sensor are related to the environment‚Äôs map without extracting features
from either. The global localisation problem is then formulated as an
optimisation problem, where particle swarm optimisation is used to
explore the pose space to search for the most likely solution. This is
done by maximising the fitness function. In order to further improve
the search precision, scan-to-map-scan matching is performed via ICP:
from the poses of particles which hold the top fitness values virtual
scans are captured and matched against the latest scan measurement.
The output pose is that which resulted from scan-to-map-scan matching
and whose updated fitness value is the maximum among all similarly
treated particles.
By contrast, in order to solve Problem P in the context of locali-
sation of autonomous forklifts, the method introduced in [14] solves
scan-to-map-scan matching in two steps: Given a vehicle‚Äôs pose esti-
mate obtained through the use of MCL with KLD sampling [4], the
orientation between the real and virtual scans is first estimated via
scan-matching the two using an ICP variant. Specifically, scan-matching
is performed through the all-encompassing, highly accurate, efficient,
and outperformer of the state-of-the-art scan-matchers: PLICP [17].1
The authors‚Äô findings indicate that the improvement of the location
estimate through scan-matching with PLICP is unstable. Therefore they
conclude that utilising PLICP in industrial warehouse settings, where
milli-meter accuracy is required, in order to extract the relative trans-
lation between the two scans is precarious and unsuitable. Given that
the forklift‚Äôs orientation estimate error has decreased to as much as
0.13‚ó¶, the position estimate error is corrected by iteratively performing
scan-to-map-scan matching through a process that approximates the
displacement error at each iteration by a function of the first element
of the Discrete Fourier transform of the difference in ranges between
the real scan and that iteration‚Äôs map-scan.
A similar pipeline is presented in [44]. Instead of using PLICP off
the shelf, the authors develop a scan-matching algorithm that aligns
real scans with map-scans taken from MCL‚Äôs pose estimate using the
Gauss‚ÄìNewton method. This alignment is performed layer-by-layer in
increasing map resolution. Experiments conducted with a real robot
in unstructured environments show that the scan-to-map-scan matcher
achieves an average location accuracy of 0.017 m and an average
orientation accuracy of 0.5‚ó¶. In [40] and [41] PLICP is additionally used
as odometry whenever an odometry error measure is found to be larger
than a set threshold. However, in contrast to [44], scan-to-map-scan
1 In principle, if the assumptions of Problem P are fulfilled, any of the
available 2D scan matchers may be used to aim at attaining objective (‚àó).

matching is performed by chaining PLICP in tandem with GPM [48] in
order to mitigate the effects of large angular errors on PLICP.
The method introduced in [49] jointly considers odometry, scan-
matching and scan-to-map-scan matching of 2D LIDAR scans with
cadastral maps for localisation of autonomous vehicles in outdoor
scenarios. These are used as constraints in the solution of a graph
optimisation problem that computes the most likely vehicle pose given
measurements from the 2D range sensor. With regard to the cadas-
tral plans, non-building objects are filtered-out from the real laser
observation using a split and merge approach, which is combined
with weighted line fitting. The input range scan and the one derived
from the map are then aligned via Generalised ICP, and the resulting
pose transform is then added to the graph if and only if ICP has
converged. At the same time, a method for detecting the ambiguity
regarding the longitudinal position of the vehicle arising in corridor-
like environments is introduced. In [42] scan-to-map-scan matching is
employed in tandem with a particle filter. From the pose estimate of
the latter, a map-scan is computed and then matched against the range
scan captured from the physical sensor using PLICP. Feeding back the
resulting pose estimate to the population of the particle filter in the
form of a multitude of particles is shown to exhibit lower pose errors
compared to [44], where the resulting pose estimate is fed back in the
form of only one particle. Furthermore it is shown that this method
of feedback exhibits increased robustness compared to [14], where the
particle filter is initialised anew around the resulting estimate.
In [34] the proposed global localisation method is divided into two
phases: an offline and an online phase. During the offline phase, the
input map is partitioned into a 2D grid according to a set resolution.
A rotation-invariant location signature is then generated for the virtual
panoramic 2D range scan that is captured from each traversable cell
location within the map. All resulting signatures are then inserted into
an ANN search tree. In the online phase, for each incoming laser scan,
a signature of the input scan is generated in the same way as during the
offline phase. Then the signature is used for retrieving the neighbouring
candidate locations from the search tree: the output location is that
whose virtual scan‚Äôs signature is the closest neighbour of the signature
of the input measurement scan. In order to obtain the orientation of the
robot‚Äôs pose, a virtual scan is generated from the determined location
and registered to the measurement panoramic 2D range scan after pre-
processing and pre-aligning steps. The angular registration is performed
in 1-degree steps and the robot‚Äôs orientation is the one that which
records the minimum relative entropy between the virtual and real
scan.
In [24] the solution to the global localisation problem is given
entirely online. At first a dense cloud of hypotheses is generated within
the unoccupied interior of the robot‚Äôs map. Subsequently each hypoth-
esis is inputted to a rotation subsystem, which at first captures a virtual
scan from the hypothesis‚Äô pose, projects it to two dimensions, discretises
it, and matches it to the similarly-treated real scan via the application
of Fourier-Mellin Invariant matching [50]. The latter provides the
orientation difference between the two scans and, most importantly,
a measure of their similarity. After rotating the pose hypothesis the
translation component displaces it in order to match the location of
the sensor‚Äôs real location. At the end all similarity measures are ranked
and the pose hypothesis with the greatest similarity degree is outputted
as the system‚Äôs pose estimate.
In recent months a number of new scan-matching methods, offering
improvements on established methods or introducing new innovations,
have been introduced. In [36] NDT is used to model the sensor‚Äôs
environment in order to address its uncertainties and constraints. The
pose transformation between successive poses‚Äîthe solution to the
optimisation problem of Eq. (2)‚Äîis given by a modified stochastic
particle swarm optimisation approach that incorporates inertia weights
in its formulation. These weights encode the momentum expressed by
forces attracting the particle in keeping its current velocity, forces that
bias its motion towards its personal optimum, and forces that direct it
towards the swarm‚Äôs optimum pose thus far.
In contrast to NDT however, which establishes correspondences
by considering the distance of point positions to voxel distributions,
VGICP [23] aggregates the distribution of each point in the voxel
and establishes correspondences between these distributions and target
distributions, thus making VGICP a voxel-based distribution-to-multi-
distribution approach. This approach yields valid voxel distributions
even when there are few points in a voxel, resulting in an algorithm
that is robust to changes in voxel resolution. VGICP extends GICP [37]
in order to avoid costly nearest neighbour search, while reducing its
execution time.
In [38] a certifiable scan-matching algorithm is introduced. The
registration solution is first made insensitive to large number or spu-
rious correspondences by reformulating the problem in manner that
uses a truncated least squares cost. Rotation, translation, and scale
between the two input scans is decoupled with the use of a general
graph-theoretic framework, which allows for the pruning of outliers by
finding the graph‚Äôs maximum clique. Scale and translation are shown
to be solvable in polynomial time via an adaptive voting scheme, while
rotation is solved by being relaxed to a semidefinite program.
5. The proposed method
This section offers a dissection of the proposed method. In order to
solve Problem P, a map-scan Óàøùëâ is computed initially and each time
the pose estimate ÃÇùíë is updated.
The problem is iteratively decomposed into two disjunctive sub-
problems. The first is estimating the relative angle between ÓàøùëÖ and Óàøùëâ
under the assumption that both are captured from the same location.
The second is estimating the relative displacement of Óàøùëâ with respect to
ÓàøùëÖ under the assumption that both are captured from poses of the same
orientation. Solving the first sub-problem is followed by the solution
to the second sub-problem. This process is iterated until termination
conditions are met.
The orientation and location correction submethods are presented
in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. Section 5.3 presents the method of how these
two are woven together into the system that solves Problem P that is
proposed in this study.
5.1. Orientation correction
Let the assumptions of Problem P be standing. Let additionally ÃÇùíç = ùíç,
that is, only the sensor‚Äôs orientation needs to be estimated. Then let
virtual scan Óàøùëâ be computed via ray-casting ùë¥ from ÃÇùíë. An estimate of
the rotation of Óàøùëâ with respect to ÓàøùëÖ may be found in the following
way.
Let a panoramic range scan Óàø be captured from pose (ùë•, ùë¶, ùúÉ) in some
coordinate frame (Definition I). The coordinates of the end-point of the
scan‚Äôs ùëõth ray ùëõ = 0, 1, ‚Ä¶ , ùëÅùë† ‚àí 1 within that frame of reference are
(ùë•ùëõ, ùë¶ùëõ):
ùë•ùëõ ‚àí ùë• = ùëëùëõ cos(ùúÉ + 2ùúãùëõ
ùëÅùë†
‚àí ùúã) = ‚àíùëëùëõ cos(ùúÉ + 2ùúãùëõ
ùëÅùë†
)
(3)
ùë¶ùëõ ‚àí ùë¶ = ùëëùëõ sin(ùúÉ + 2ùúãùëõ

‚àí ùúã) = ‚àíùëëùëõ sin(ùúÉ + 2ùúãùëõ
ùëÅùë†
)
(4)
Here we make the observation that ‚àí(ùë•ùëõ ‚àí ùë•) and (ùë¶ùëõ ‚àí ùë¶) are, respec-
tively, the real and imaginary parts of the complex quantity

where the polar representation of complex ùë® is ùë® = |ùë®|ùëíùëñ‚à†ùë®.
Due to the fact that the sensor‚Äôs orientation ùúÉ is unknown, so are
the endpoints {(ùë•ùëÖ
ùëõ , ùë¶ùëÖ
ùëõ )}, and therefore quantities ùõøùë•, ùõøùë¶. In order to
gain an initial intuition as to the magnitudes of the latter we make the
observation that, by definition, ùëÅùë†ùõøùë• and ùëÅùë†ùõøùë¶ quantify the difference
of the approximation of line integrals over the closed paths provided
by the two scans‚Äô endpoints over the two principal axes ùë• and ùë¶. This
approximation is due to the finiteness of ùëÅùë†. Therefore, under the
assumptions that (a) the map of the environment is its perfect repre-
sentation and (b) the physical range scan is unaffected by disturbance,
as ùëÅùë† ‚Üí ‚àû, ùëÅùë†ùõøùë•, ùëÅùë†ùõøùë¶ ‚Üí 0, which in turn means that |ùëΩ 1| ‚Üí |ùëπ1| and
ùúÉ ‚àí ÃÇùúÉ ‚Üí ‚à†ùëπùüè ‚àí ‚à†ùëΩ ùüè.
Updating the orientation estimate by
ÃÇùúÉ‚Ä≤ = ÃÇùúÉ + ‚à†ùëπ1 ‚àí ‚à†ùëΩ 1
(13)
results in a residual orientation error ùúô:
ùúô = tan‚àí1
ùëÅùë†ùõøùë• tan(ùúÉ ‚àí ‚à†ùëπ1) ‚àí ùëÅùë†ùõøùë¶
|ùëπ1| + ùëÅùë†ùõøùë• + ùëÅùë†ùõøùë¶ tan(ùúÉ ‚àí ‚à†ùëπ1)
(14)
whose magnitude is inversely proportional to the number of rays of
the physical range sensor ùëÅùë† in the case where both ÓàøùëÖ and Óàøùëâ are
undisturbed by noise.
The finiteness of the physical sensor‚Äôs emitted rays, coupled with
the arbitrariness of the rate of changes in the environment (Fig. 1),
may result in portions of the map being undersampled. What is more
is that the number of emitted rays by the physical sensor is immutable.
In order to mitigate the effects of these constraints on the orientation
error, let 2ùúà virtual scans of size ùëÅùë† be generated at ùõæ‚àï2ùúà angular
increments starting from ÃÇùúÉ, ùúà ‚àà N‚â•0, where ùõæ = 2ùúã‚àïùëÅùë† is the physical
sensor‚Äôs angle increment. Let then the orientation correction process
(Eq. (13)) be carried out once between the real scan and the virtual
scan Óàøùëò
ùëâ captured from orientation ÃÇùúÉùëò = ÃÇùúÉ +ùëò‚ãÖùõæ‚àï2ùúà, ùëò = 0, ‚Ä¶ , 2ùúà ‚àí1, for
a total of 2ùúà times, resulting in 2ùúà orientation estimates ÃÇùúÉ‚Ä≤
ùëò. The angular
alignment between the virtual scan captured from pose (ùë•, ùë¶, ÃÇùúÉ‚Ä≤
ùëò) and the
real scan is captured by the Cumulative Absolute Error per Ray (CAER)
metric

which is proportional to the degree of misalignment between range
scan ÓàøùëÖ and map scan Óàøùëâ captured from pose (ùë•, ùë¶, ÃÇùúÉ‚Ä≤
ùëò), and therefore
between (ùë•, ùë¶, ùúÉ) and (ùë•, ùë¶, ÃÇùúÉ‚Ä≤
ùëò). A profile of the CAER metric is shown
in Fig. 3, for the general case of location and orientation incoincidence
between the sensor‚Äôs pose and its estimate.
Let now ùëòmin denote the index of the ùëòth virtual scan Óàøùëòmin
ùëâ
scoring
the minimum CAERùëò:
CAERùëòmin = min{CAERùëò}
ùëò = 0, ‚Ä¶ , 2ùúà ‚àí 1. Let also ÃÇùúÉùëòmin denote the angle ÃÇùúÉùëòmin = ‚à†ùëπ1 ‚àí ùëΩ ùëòmin
1
,
where ùëΩ ùëòmin
1
is the first term of the DFT of Óàøùëòmin
ùëâ
(Eq. (9)). Then,
updating the sensor‚Äôs orientation estimate by ÃÇùúÉ‚Ä≤ = ÃÇùúÉ + ÃÇùúÉùëòmin + ùëòmin ‚ãÖ ùõæ‚àï2ùúà
results in an orientation error whose maximum is equal to that of
updating it with (13) for ùúà = 0.
5.2. Location correction
Let now the real and estimated poses be equal in terms of ori-
entation but unequal in terms of position. If the map represents the
environment perfectly and the physical range sensor reports faultless
measurements then the estimate of the sensor‚Äôs position can be driven
arbitrarily close to its real position. In real conditions, when the rays of
either or both real and virtual range sensors are corrupted by bounded
additive noise, the position estimate can be made to be bounded in a
neighbourhood of the sensor‚Äôs real position. Theorems I and II formalise
these statements [51].

Theorem I. Let the assumptions of Problem P hold. Additionally, let ÃÇùúÉ = ùúÉ.
Let a map-scan Óàøùëâ be captured from ÃÇùíë within map ùë¥ and be denoted by
Óàøùëâ |ÃÇùíë. Assume that both ÓàøùëÖ and Óàøùëâ range scans are disturbance-free, that
is, the distances to obstacles the rays of the real scan capture correspond
to the true distance of the sensor to said obstacles, and that the map of the
environment captures the latter perfectly. Then, treating the estimate of the
location of the sensor as a state variable ÃÇùíç[ùëò] = [ÃÇùë•[ùëò], ÃÇùë¶[ùëò]]‚ä§ and updating

of Theorem I, the location error is proportional to the orientation error.
Theorem II.
Let the assumptions of Theorem I hold. Assume additionally
that the ranges of both real and virtual range scans ÓàøùëÖ and Óàøùëâ
are
affected by additive, bounded disturbances. Then ÃÇùíç[ùëò] is uniformly bounded
for ùëò ‚â• ùëò0 and uniformly ultimately bounded in a neighbourhood of ùíç.
Its size depends on the suprema of the disturbance corrupting the range
measurements of the two scans.
Compared to the case where no disturbances are present, a solution
satisfying objective (‚àó) is not strictly guaranteed for every starting
location ÃÇùíç[0]. Let us again denote by ùëòùë†ùë°ùëúùëù ‚àà (0, ùêº] the last index of
iteration, by ÃÇùíç
‚Ä≤ = ÃÇùíç[ùëòùë†ùë°ùëúùëù] the final estimate of the sensor‚Äôs location,
and by ùêµ the ultimate bound of the pose error. If ‚ÄñùíÜ(ùíç, ÃÇùíç[0])‚Äñ2 > ùêµ,
Theorem II guarantees the satisfaction of objective (‚àó) if ùëòùë†ùë°ùëúùëù ‚â• ùëò0. If,
on the other hand, ‚ÄñùíÜ(ùíç, ÃÇùíç[0])‚Äñ2 ‚â§ ùêµ, it is not certain that ‚ÄñùíÜ(ùíç, ÃÇùíç
‚Ä≤)‚Äñ2 <
‚ÄñùíÜ(ùíç, ÃÇùíç[0])‚Äñ2; what is certain in this case, though, is that ‚ÄñùíÜ(ùíç, ÃÇùíç[ùëò])‚Äñ2 ‚âØ ùêµ
for all ùëò ‚â• 0.
5.3. Joint correction of orientation and location
The previous two sections describe two methods of how it is possible
to (a) reduce the error of the orientation estimate when the position
estimate coincides with the sensor‚Äôs position, and (b) reduce the error of
the position estimate when the orientation estimate equals the sensor‚Äôs
orientation. In the general case, however, no equality stands. What
is more is that the problem is coupled: the optimal orientation error
cannot be attained in one step when the position error is not zero,
and the optimal position error cannot be attained in one step when
the orientation error is not zero. Therefore the first goal of a method
reducing both would be to first reduce the orientation error and then
reduce the location error. The second would be to iterate this process
until some termination condition is met. The method proposed by this
article is described in the following.
Given an input pose estimate ÃÇùíë(ÃÇùë•, ÃÇùë¶, ÃÇùúÉ), the real scan ÓàøùëÖ, and the
map ùë¥, the pose correction method proposed (Fig. 4) reduces the
error of the pose estimate by iteratively invoking the One-step Pose
Correction process (Fig. 5) until a set of termination conditions is met.
Denoting the former by X1SMSM, X1SMSM starts off with an initial
degree of sampling the map ùúà = ùúàmin. The input pose estimate is
processed by the One-step Pose Correction process, and its output ÃÇùíë‚Ä≤
is examined with regard to Recovery and Convergence conditions. If
the resulting pose estimate falls outside of the map ùë¥ then a new pose
estimate is generated from the initially supplied pose estimate, and the
process is reset. If no significant pose estimate correction is observed
‚ÄñÃÇùíë‚Ä≤ ‚àí ÃÇùíë‚Äñ2 < ùúÄùõøùëù, then the degree of map sampling ùúà is increased. Its
increase serves as a means of reducing the orientation and hence the
position estimate error further. Otherwise, the One-step Pose Correction
process is reiterated until no significant correction is observed. The
process is iterated until a maximum degree of map sampling is reached
ùúà = ùúàmax, at which point X1SMSM terminates if a terminal condition is
met. This terminal condition facilitates the avoidance of local maxima.
In the case where this condition is not met, a new pose is generated
from the initially supplied pose estimate, and the process is reset.
Given an input pose estimate ÃÇùíë(ÃÇùë•, ÃÇùë¶, ÃÇùúÉ), the real scan ÓàøùëÖ, the map
ùë¥, and a sampling degree ùúà, the One-step Pose Correction system
first calculates 2ùúà pose estimates ÃÇùë∑ ùëÇùê∂ = {(ÃÇùë•, ÃÇùë¶, ÃÇùúÉùëò)}, ùëò = 0, ‚Ä¶ , 2ùúà‚àí1
(Section 5.1). Its operation is denoted in Fig. 5 by the operator OC(‚ãÖ).
The location error of each pose estimate in set ÃÇùë∑ ùëÇùê∂ is then attempted to
be reduced by rehearsing the subsequent Position Correction operation
for one iteration. This operation produces pose estimate set ÃÇùë∑ ùëÖùëÉ ùê∂.
Subsequently, the CAER metric of each pose in ÃÇùë∑ ùëÖùëÉùê∂ is calculated.
The pose estimate ÃÇùíë ‚àà
ÃÇùë∑ ùëÖùëÉùê∂ that records the minimum CAER
among all pose estimates in ÃÇùë∑ ùëÖùëÉùê∂ is in principle the pose from which
the computed virtual scan records the least deviation from the real scan
among all poses in ÃÇùë∑ ùëÖùëÉùê∂. By capturing the CAER for each displaced
pose estimate in
ÃÇùë∑ ùëÖùëÉùê∂ it is possible to establish a less erroneous
pose error rank between orientation estimates in ÃÇùë∑ ùëÇùê∂ than if position
correction was not rehearsed, and simultaneously retain only one pose
estimate for the subsequent step of Position Correction proper.2 The
pose estimate in ÃÇùë∑ ùëÖùëÉùê∂ that records the lowest CAER value is then
inputted to the Position Correction subsystem, for a limited number
2 Alternatively, correcting the position of 2ùúà pose estimates and feeding
them back to the One-step Pose Correction method would incur exponential
costs in time of execution.

set to its resulting output, denoted by ÃÇùíë‚Ä≤. In practice, the pose set ÃÇùë∑ ùëÇùê∂
is supplemented with the pose that produces the minimum CAER over
time. This addition introduces a form of memory to the system, which
assists it in avoiding divergence and which, therefore, benefits speed of
execution.
6. Experiments
This section serves to test the efficacy and performance of the
proposed method, termed X1SMSM, against those of state-of-the-art
methods utilisable in the scan-to-map-scan matching task.
6.1. Experimental procedure
The experimental procedure was conducted using five established
and publicly available benchmark datasets provided courtesy of the

Department of Computer Science, University of Freiburg.3 Each dataset
comprises a collection of range scanner measurements and the pose
ùíì(ùë•, ùë¶, ùúÉ) from which these measurements were made. The signifier and
size of each dataset used for the experimental procedure is shown in
Table 1.
For purposes of comparison against scan-matching methods that
may be utilised in scan-to-map-scan matching, the experimental pro-
cedure is extended to the Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) scan-
matching method [35,52], FastGICP [37,53] and PLICP‚ó¶GPM [17,54].
The latter shall be denoted hereafter by the acronym CSM. GPM was
used initially in order to overcome the angular realignment prob-
lems [17] of PLICP. NDT, FastGICP, and CSM belong to the established
state-of-the-art methods of scan-matching [23,55‚Äì59]. In addition, for
comparison against contemporary state-of-the-art algorithms, the exper-
imental procedure is extended to FastVGICP [23,60], NDT-PSO [36,61],
and TEASER [38,62].
The experimental setup is the following. The rays of each dataset

therefore the remaining space is filled with a semicircular arc that
joins the scan‚Äôs two extreme ends. Its radius is set to the minimum
range between the two extreme rays of ùê∑ùëë

off the environment have been found equivalent with respect to the

performance of the tested methods. The resulting point-set is regarded
as the environment ùëæ ùëë
ùëò in which the range sensor operates (e.g. the
environment of Fig. 1). Then the map of the environment ùë¥ùëë
ùëò is set
to be ùëæ ùëë
ùëò. In order to induce distortions in the map, each coordinate
of all points in ùë¥ùëë
ùëò is perturbed by errors extracted from a normal
distribution Óà∫ùë¥
‚àº (0, ùúé2
ùë¥). What is considered the sensor‚Äôs actual
pose ùíëùëë
ùëò is generated randomly within the polygon formed by ùëæ ùëë
ùëò.
The range scan Óàøùëë
ùëÖ,ùëò that is considered to be reported by the physical
sensor is then computed by locating the intersection points between
ùëÅùë† rays emanating from ùíëùëë
ùëò and the polygon formed by ùëæ ùëë
ùëò across an
angular field of view ùúÜ = 2ùúã. The initial pose estimate of the sensor ÃÇùíëùëë
ùëò
is then obtained by perturbing the components of ùíëùëë with quantities
extracted from uniformly distributed error distributions ùëàùë•ùë¶(‚àíùõøùë•ùë¶, ùõøùë•ùë¶),
ùëàùúÉ(‚àíùõøùúÉ, ùõøùúÉ); ùõøùë•ùë¶, ùõøùúÉ ‚àà R‚â•0.
In order to test the performance of the above methods four levels
of noise acting on the range measurements of the real scan Óàøùëë
ùëÖ are
tested. The range measurements are perturbed by zero-mean normally-
distributed noise with standard deviation ùúéùëÖ ‚àà {0.03, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20}
m. The values of tested standard deviations were calculated from
commercially available panoramic LIDAR scanners by identifying the
magnitude of their reported maximum range errors and dividing it by a
factor of three. The rationale is that 99.73% of errors are located within
3ùúé around the actual range between a ray and an obstacle, assuming
errors are distributed normally. These are reported for price-appealing
but disturbance-laden panoramic sensors, e.g. the RPLIDAR A2M8, or
the YDLIDAR G4, G6, TG30, and X4 scanners [63‚Äì67]. In addition,
two levels of map distortion are tested: ùúéùë¥ ‚àà {0.0, 0.05} m. Maximal
displacements ùõøùë•ùë¶ and ùõøùúÉ are set to ùõøùë•ùë¶ = 0.20 m and ùõøùúÉ = ùúã‚àï4 rad.
The value of ùõøùë•ùë¶ was chosen as such from reports on positional errors
in real conditions [44]. The value of ùõøùúÉ was chosen as such in order
to include orientation errors at the initialisation stage of pose tracking
and errors induced due to diverging odometry readings. The size of the
input real scan was set to ùëÅùë† = 360 rays. The minimum and maximum
oversampling rates of X1SMSM were set to (ùúámin, ùúámax) = (2ùúàmin, 2ùúàmax) =
(22, 24). The number of iterations of the translational component were
set to ùêº = 2 and ùúÄùõøùëù = 10‚àí5 (Section 5.3). X1SMSM‚Äôs termination
condition was set to CAER(ÃÇùíë‚Ä≤) ‚â§ (ÃÇùúéùëÖ + ÃÇùúéùëâ )1‚àï2, where ÃÇùúéùëÖ and ÃÇùúéùëâ are
estimates of the standard deviation of noise affecting the rays of ÓàøùëÖ
and Óàøùëâ respectively.
For each experiment X1SMSM, CSM, NDT, FastGICP, and FastVGICP
ran for ùê∏ = 10 times across all instances of ùê∑ùëò, ùê∑ = {ùöäùöåùöéùöú, ùöèùöõùü∂ùüΩùüø,

method was tested a total of ùëÅùë°ùëúùë° = 10 √ó 2 √ó 4 √ó ‚àë |ùê∑ùëò| ‚âà 3.6 ‚ãÖ 106
times. The execution times of NDT-PSO and TEASER in the scan-to-
map-scan matching problem were measured in the order of seconds
per pose input‚Äîapproximately one order of magnitude larger than the
execution time of X1SMSM: the evaluation of NDT-PSO and TEASER
was performed once for every instance of ùê∑.
Experiments with X1SMSM, FastGICP, FastVGICP, CSM, and NDT
were carried out on a single thread, on a machine of a CPU frequency
of 4.0 GHz. NDT-PSO and TEASER are parallel implementations; their
experiments ran over four threads, with a machine of a CPU frequency
of 2.2 GHz.
The criterion on which the evaluation of all tests rests is the 2-norm
of the total pose error‚ÄîEq. (1) for ÃÇùíë ‚Üí ÃÇùíë‚Ä≤, where ÃÇùíë‚Ä≤ is the output of

algorithm, ùëë = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶ , |ùê∑ùëò|, ùëò ‚àà {0, 1, ‚Ä¶ , 4}, its offset from the actual
pose ùíëùëë
ùëò is recorded in the form of the 2-norm total error. The unit of
measurement of the total pose error is (m2+rad2)1‚àï2 and, where omitted
in the figures of the following subsections, it has been so for purposes
of economy of space and readability.

tained by all tested algorithms per standard deviation of measurement
noise and map corruption levels, over all conducted experiments. The
performance of all algorithms was approximately invariant over any

figures of this section.

deviation of noise affecting the rays of the real scan ùúéùëÖ.
6.3. Discussion
The proposed method‚Äôs pose error reduction rate is largely invariant
across real scan noise levels for a given level of map distortion. The
method manages to improve the pose estimate of at least 97.5% of all
input pose estimates with regard to the tested configurations (Fig. 6).

X1SMSM‚Äôs pose error reduction rate is on par with that of TEASER
but, in contrast, X1SMSM runs in real time, requires fewer computing
resources, and exhibits lower pose errors. According to the results the
performance of ICP-based methods in terms of the proportion of cases
where the pose estimate error was reduced deteriorates as real scan
noise increases. FastVGICP is the most consistent among ICP variants
with regard to the proportion of cases were pose errors were reduced.
NDT-PSO manages to increase the pose error reduction rate of NDT
but at a cost of significant increases in execution time and processing
resources required.
In terms of pose estimate errors (Fig. 7) the behaviour of X1SMSM is
more accurate than those of all tested methods across all configurations
and datasets tested; only CSM‚Äôs pose errors are comparable to those of
X1SMSM, and only in low levels of measurement noise and when the
map is disturbed. Additionally, the rate of increase of the interquartile
range for X1SMSM‚Äôs pose errors is consistently lower than that of all

tested methods. By contrast, the behaviour of CSM, GICP, VGICP is less
robust to measurement noise, and especially so at the upper range of
the spectrum of measurement noise exhibited by available panoramic
LIDAR sensors. It is presumed that the widening gap in performance
between these methods and X1SMSM, in terms of increasing measure-
ment noise, is a consequence of their modus operandi of establishing
correspondences between a point and a (line)point in its two input
scans [24]. This conjecture is supported by the fact that the more
laden a scan is with noise, the more difficult it is for the algorithm
to distinguish true correspondences from false. By contrast, X1SMSM
does not deal in correspondences and, ipso facto, does not require the
manual setting of parameters relating to establishing correspondences.
Focusing on the mean position and orientation errors of CSM,
TEASER, and X1SMSM (Fig. 10), and according to the evidence, the
orientation and position errors of CSM increase at a greater rate than
those of X1SMSM for a given level or map distortion, while starting
off at higher magnitudes. Interestingly, when the map is distorted, the
position errors of TEASER are invariant to the noise affecting the ranges
of the real scan.
X1SMSM‚Äôs lowest processing speed was approximately 225 ms per
pose input. In comparison, CSM‚Äôs execution times ranged from 34 to
Fig. 12. In principle a typical localisation scenario. Left: the pose of the LIDAR sensor,
denoted with black colour, and its estimate with magenta. Right: the real and virtual
scans captured from their respective poses in the local coordinate system of each sensor.
In this example ùúéùëÖ = 0.05 m and ùúéùë¥ = 0.0 m. Note how at this initial configuration
there are portions of the environment‚Äôs map visible only to the pose estimate, but the
corresponding portions of the environment are not visible to the sensor itself. (For
interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred
to the web version of this article.)
94 ms, NDT‚Äôs 85‚Äì111 ms, FastGICP‚Äôs 25‚Äì59 ms, and FastVGICP‚Äôs were
approximately constant at 7 ms. NDT-PSO‚Äôs execution times were ap-
proximately constant as well at 1.34 s, while TEASER had the greatest
variability and execution time at 1.3 ‚àí 3.3 seconds. This is due to the
fact that TEASER requires the measurement and virtual scan vectors to
be homologous, i.e. a reference and target point are required to be in
the same position in both vectors.4 The applicability of NDT-PSO and
TEASER is hindered both by their execution times and the fact that
their implementation requires multiple processor cores (> 4) in order to
run in real time‚Äîwhich may be unavailable in multi-subsystem systems
with limited resources. In any case all execution times should be taken
with a grain of salt, as they are specific to the map representation used,
the number of rays of the input range scan, and the processing power
available.
Finally, the proposed method‚Äôs increasing iterations with respect to
decreasing measurement noise (Fig. 11) suggests that the termination
criterion used during the experimental procedure is unevenly strict
across measurement noise levels.
7. Characterisation and limitations
In this section we give key characterisations of X1SMSM and com-
pare aspects of its performance against representative real-time scan-
matching methods.
7.1. Characterisation
Fig. 12 demonstrates in principle a scenario where scan-to-map-scan
matching may be applicable for pose estimate error reduction. In the
left-hand side figure the robot‚Äôs real pose is denoted with black, and
its initial estimate with magenta. The right-hand side figure shows the
real and virtual scans captured from sensor‚Äôs respective poses in the
local coordinate system of each sensor. Fig. 13 illustrates the interim
and final outputs of the alignment process carried out by X1SMSM.
The first row of Fig. 14 illustrates the dependence of the output
position errors on the initial position displacement (left) and the ini-
tial orientation displacement (right) across all experiments conducted
(Section 6) for ùúéùëÖ
= 0.03 m and ùúéùë¥
= 0.0 m. The second row

respectively. The second and fourth columns show the respective subsequent configurations in the map‚Äôs frame of reference. The third and sixth columns show the corresponding
pose estimate error with blue colour and the value of the CAER metric with red. Notice how the virtual scan transforms at each iteration to increasingly resemble the real scan

illustrates the dependence of the output orientation errors with re-
spect to the same initial configurations. According to the evidence
the output position error is dependent on the initial location dis-
placement between the real pose and its estimate, but independent
of the initial orientation displacement between them, with regard to
the tested displacement configurations. The output orientation error on
the other hand is independent of both initial location and orientation
displacements.
Figs. 15 and 16 depict the mean orientation errors of the orientation
correction subsystem of X1SMSM, along with those of CSM and NDT,
for varying levels of maximal initial orientation displacements ùõøùúÉ, range
sensor emitted rays ùëÅùë†, and range sensor noise level ùúéùëü, for two cases
of map-corruption levels ùúéùë¥, for one iteration. Each method was tested
100 times over the 778 instances of the laserazos dataset.5 These

results are captured in the case where the position of the sensor and its
estimate are coinciding so that the effect of the methods‚Äô orientation
correction subsystem is revealed.
The evidence shows that in complete coincidence of the map to its
referent environment the orientation errors of X1SMSM decrease with
increasing number of rays for a given level of sensor noise, regardless of
the value of initial orientation displacement between the sensor‚Äôs true
orientation and its estimate. In contrast, the orientation errors of CSM
and NDT (a) do not progressively decrease proportionally to the size
of scan rays, and (b) are not invariant to increasing initial orientation
displacement. Predictably, the orientation error of X1SMSM increases
for increasing sensor noise for a given number of rays emitted. When
the map is corrupted these correlations cease to exist for X1SMSM and,
therefore, since (a) the accuracy of the position correction subsystem
depends on the orientation error and (b) the processing time is pro-
portional to the range sensor‚Äôs size, from a computational-resources
perspective it is more efficient for an input real scan whose size is
greater than 360 rays to be downsampled to this size prior to matching.

7.2. Limitations
From the evidence of Section 6 X1SMSM is capable of addressing
initial position errors ranging to 0.20 m per component, with its
orientation correction subsystem being independent of initial location
errors (Fig. 14). However, the orientation correction subsystem may
fail to estimate the sensor‚Äôs real orientation at large initial position
errors. In Fig. 17 the pose estimate is displaced by 1.0 m in the x-wise
direction; the first orientation correction iteration misplaces the pose‚Äôs
orientation, on whose accuracy the location correction depends, which

further misplaces the estimate in terms of location. Although in this
example we have deactivated the recovery module, recovering from
the initial pose may finally yield an accurate pose estimate but this
would have happened at the expense of execution time. This situation is
unrealistic in pose tracking, but highlights a key limitation of X1SMSM.
The greatest challenge for the performance of a scan(‚Äìto‚Äìmap-scan)
matching method, aside from corrupted input data, is missing data.
Missing range information in range scan sensors manifests due to their
innate constraint of inability to detect ranges to objects that lie beyond
their maximum detectable range radius. The absence of usable data is
a function of a range sensor‚Äôs maximum range and the geometry of
its surrounding environment at any given sensing instant. In principle,
correspondence-finding methods ought to fare better in the face of
missing ranges than correspondenceless methods due to their ability
to establish true and discard false correspondences between separate
segments in their input scans. In order to guard against missing range
data and facilitate matching in their presence, X1SMSM duplicates a
sensor‚Äôs physical constraint of an upper range threshold in its genera-
tion of a virtual scan so that the latter is assisted in resembling its target
real scan as much as achievable. We illustrate the limitations of the
proposed method in the face of missing range measurements, and the
difference in performance between it and established state-of-the-art
correspondence-finding and correspondenceless methods in Fig. 18.
At the top row of the figure four distinct environments are depicted
in white colour. The radius of concentric circles around the sensor‚Äôs true
position (depicted in blue) equals the set maximum range for the sen-
sor. The colour of their perimeter signifies the proportion of real scan
ranges which are within that maximum range radius according to the
colourbar at the second row. The two latter rows of figures illustrate the
mean pose error of CSM (red), NDT (blue), and X1SMSM (green), over

Fig. 17. An exemplary condition where X1SMSM fails to converge: the initial position
estimate is displaced far from the sensor‚Äôs real position. The orientation correction
subsystem outputs an inaccurate orientation estimate and ipso facto the estimate‚Äôs
position diverges from its target. The third column shows the evolution of the pose error

ten iterations at the same maximum range level for two levels of sensor
noise, when the map of the environment is not corrupted with noise.
At low sensor noise levels, ICP-based methods seem to dominate
their counterparts due to their aforementioned merits. However, this
characteristic is reversed as measurement noise increases. CSM‚Äôs, NDT‚Äôs
and the proposed method‚Äôs performance deteriorates at irregular rates
and according to the particular characteristics of the sensor‚Äôs surround-
ings. CSM records the highest pose errors and the lowest robustness
to maximum range reduction overall. Compared to NDT, X1SMSM
exhibits greater accuracy at the lower and higher ends of the missing
ranges scale. Qualitatively, X1SMSM records its lowest performance
when it completely loses its footing over large areas at two opposite
directions: the figures of the third column summarise this limitation of
X1SMSM.
8. Applications
Scan-to-map-scan matching in two dimensions may be employed in
various contexts. The most usual application is in pose-tracking, where
the output of the tracking filter is fed to a scan-to-map-scan method in
order for it to provide a pose estimate of lower error [42] (Section 4).
In RFID localisation, for example, one seeks to accurately localise the
placement of tags in 3D space by relying on the accuracy of the pose
of a robot‚Äôs antennas, whose pose in space is provided by the LIDAR
sensor equipped to the robot. In this case position accuracy has more
gravity than orientation accuracy.
Scan-to-map-scan matching may also be used in shape-matching,
i.e. estimating the transformation between two similar shapes or de-
tecting those shapes from a collection that match a reference one. In
the first, a source pose would need to be computed, preferably via the
shapes‚Äô centroid, as the latter is located at the same point relative to all
shape-constituting points. Then from the source pose of the reference
shape a virtual scan would be captured, which in scan-to-map-scan
matching terms would be considered the real scan. Capturing virtual
scans initially from the source pose of the second shape and matching
them with the real scan would then provide the rotation and translation
transformation between the two. Detecting shapes that record similarity
to a reference one would involve the same process, but with a limited
number of recoveries so that the rejection of false samples be carried
out efficiently. The experimental procedure of Section 6 constitutes a
direct test on these applications.
Recently we have also used scan-to-map-scan matching for the
solution to the global localisation problem [24]. The introduction of
the CAER metric (Fig. 3) may be used to accelerate the solution to
the problem in the following manner: As standard a dense cloud of
hypotheses is generated in the unoccupied space of the map. Then the
CAER metric is computed for each pose hypothesis. The hypotheses
with the lowest CAER values would then be handed over to X1SMSM
for registration. The one whose final CAER value is the minimum would
then be considered the robot‚Äôs pose. Fig. 19 shows a sample global
localisation scenario.
9. Future steps
The limitations of X1SMSM dictate the course of future work. With
regard to missing range measurements due to inadequacy of a sensor‚Äôs
maximum range, work focus is needed on devising mechanisms or
methods whose pose error is more consistent with the case where there
are none, and across a greater range of proportion of missing measure-
ments. Furthermore, we conjecture that the estimation of discrepancies
ùõøùë•, ùõøùë¶ (Eqs. (10), (11)) will result in lower orientation estimate errors
(Eq. (14)) and therefore lower subsequent location estimate errors,
and translate X1SMSM‚Äôs ability in reducing its orientation error for
increasing range scan size when the map is not corrupted to the case
where it is. This will benefit speed of execution and will also aim at
additional pose error reductions.
10. Conclusions
This article introduced a method for reducing the pose estimate
error for robots equipped with LIDAR range sensors whose field of
view is 360‚ó¶ in a scan-to-map-scan matching manner. Contrary to
state-of-the-art approaches, the solution it provides to the problem
of scan-to-map-scan matching does not require the establishing of
correspondences between its two input scans, and is in closed form.
These facts account for (a) the method‚Äôs robustness against the typical
measurement noise levels exhibited by low-cost panoramic 2D LIDAR
sensors, whose measurement noise is significantly elevated compared
to prior sensors, (b) its lower pose errors compared to prior art, and (c)
its real-time execution. The proposed method assumes that a panoramic
range scan, the map of the environment in which the robot operates,
and a pose estimate residing in the vicinity of the robot‚Äôs true pose
are available. Therefore the proposed method‚Äôs placement within a
localisation system may be at the end of or at the same level as a pose
tracking method, or at the heart of global localisation.

Fig. 19. A typical global localisation scenario solvable with the use of scan-to-map-
scan matching. The robot‚Äôs true pose is denoted with black colour. Pose hypotheses are
dispersed in the unoccupied interior space of the map. Note how symmetries in the
environment make the CAER of ùíë5 lower than that of ùíë7, which is actually closer to the
real pose than ùíë5. With enough pose hypotheses the global localisation problem can be
solved in reduced time due to the use of the CAER metric before handing a hypothesis
over to the matching algorithm. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
After computing a virtual range scan from the measurement sensor‚Äôs
pose estimate, the method updates the estimate by reducing first the
orientation estimate‚Äôs error and then that of the position estimate. The
process is iterated until sufficient convergence conditions are met. The
correction of the orientation and location estimates is performed by
utilising the first coefficient of the Fourier Transform of the differ-
ence between the two scans. The proposed method exhibits higher
accuracy, consistent and greater pose error reduction rates compared
to established and contemporary state-of-the-art methods that may
by utilised in real time in the scan-to-map-scan task. The proposed
method‚Äôs implementation is available for download at https://github.
