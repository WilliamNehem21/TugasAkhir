The impulse towards a larger introduction of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the agricul-
tural ﬁeld is currently experiencing its momentum, as digitisation has large potentialities to provide beneﬁts for
both producers and consumers; on the other hand, pushing technological solutions into a rural context encounters
several challenges. In this work, we provide a survey of the most recent research activities, in the form of both
research projects and scientiﬁc literature, with the objective of showing the already achieved results, the current
investigations, and the still open challenges, both technical and non technical. We mainly focus on the EU ter-
ritory, identifying threats and concerns, and then looking at existing and upcoming solutions to overcome those
barriers.
1. Introduction
Smart Farming (SF) refers to the application of ICT to agriculture.
Data collected and analysed through ICT techniques support efﬁcient
production processes [1], thus motivating scientists, practitioners, pri-
vate and public companies to work towards the goal of developing and
encouraging the use of innovative technologies to support farmers on the
ground. According to the European Union (EU), the most relevant tech-
nologies and techniques to be fully exploited are the satellite imagery, the
use of agricultural robots, a larger use of sensor nodes to collect data, and
the potentialities of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery
and actuation. Those indications are contained into the declaration of
cooperation on A smart and sustainable digital future for European agricul-
ture and rural areas1 signed on April 2019 by 24 EU countries.
According to the aforementioned declaration, the ﬁrst obstacle to-
wards a full implementation of SF in rural areas is the lack of connec-
tivity, i.e., digital divide. The advent of 5G is promising to improve such a
situation in rural and low-income areas [2], but scattered coverage must
be still taken into account, as highlighted in recent surveys in the EU
territory [3]. Rural areas remain challenging, not being covered by any
Next Generation Access network: up to 53% at the end of 2017 in EU [3].
Putting this issue aside, a plethora of initiatives can be identiﬁed towards
the objective of the digitisation of agriculture. As an exemplary case,
Smart AKIS, an EU-funded thematic network promoted by the Agricultural
European Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) established in 2016, aims to
close the gap between scientiﬁc knowledge and practitioners, in order to
promote concrete solutions to be implemented. A solution can be deﬁned
as anything that makes the farming practice more controlled and accu-
rate through ICT, reducing both the costs and the environmental impact,
while also increasing the production. SF has the potential to also improve
work safety, contributing to the sustainability of agriculture [1], but its
socio-economic implications are debated [4].
In this innovative approach of farm management, a key component is
the use of hardware and software technologies, like the deploying of
sensor nodes, control systems, robotics, satellites for imagery and posi-
tioning, data storage and analysis, advisory systems, and terrestrial and
aerial drones. However, the aim of SF should not be just in industrializing
agriculture, but in making the whole process more efﬁcient, sustainable,
and of high quality, while respecting farmers’ needs.
SF dates back to the middle of the 80’s, but it has been practiced
commercially only since the 90’s [5]. However, many farmers are still
skeptical about the actual advantages it can offer. This can be explained
by considering the proﬁt and the direct beneﬁts for the farm. In fact, it is
not straightforward to identify those [6], for instance when considering

Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) for
software, machinery, and data. Farmers generally tend to identify SF as a
set of tools that beneﬁts only large holdings, both in crop and livestock
production. This is linked to the perception of high costs and complexity
of the involved technologies. What is lacking from this image is the
possibility that innovative technologies might not be only large-scale and
thus costly, but rather also slow and precise, plus small and cheap [7].
Nowadays, SF is rapidly taking advantage of recent technological
advancements for improving agricultural practices [8], further than
business models for lowering adoption costs. For instance, rental pro-
grams for farming equipment, like Trringo in India, make possible farm
mechanization processes with affordable costs for farmers, also providing
support services. Such an initiative can be categorised as cooperative
farming, potentially increasing the penetration of SF in low-income areas.
Karnott, a French company, is pushing both web services and hardware
solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready one. Karnott sells
a control unit to be installed on agricultural machines, offering several
services through a battery-powered device, collecting and exchanging
real-time data, as well as geolocation. Then, collected data can be
exploited through on-line services, like those provided by api-agro, a
secure platform to share data. Available data can be accessed and fed to
different management systems, thus offering a valuable repository for
farms. Taranis offers a platform using aerial and satellite imagery joint
with Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide a Decision Support
System (DSS) for Precision Farming (PF) applications. AgriOpenData
provides a DSS as well, exploiting blockchain, UAVs, and adding support
services on top of it. When considering fully autonomous solutions, Iron
Ox offers a complete robotic solution to grow plants, from seeds to har-
vest, with a hydroponic system able to strongly reduce the water con-
sumption. At last, traceability is experiencing a revolution thanks to
digital ledgers. Even if it cannot be considered immediately within the
umbrella of SF, still the origin and the quality of agricultural products
remains a central issue. Carrefour, a French multinational retailer, is
betting on blockchain as a solution to provide trustable data to consumers
and intermediate actors. Blockchain is used by Hectare Agritech in a farm
trading platform as well, highlighting how innovative paradigms can be
adapted to different use cases in the agricultural ﬁeld.
The aim of this work is to survey both research initiatives and sci-
entiﬁc literature on the topic of SF, looking at recent technologies and
techniques being used or being actively pushed for adoption. In addition,
we discuss still open challenges hampering such an objective. The rest of
this work is structured as follows: Section 2 surveys research and inno-
vation projects covering SF activities in the EU territory, then the scope of
the survey is enlarged by taking into account the state of the art in the
scientiﬁc literature. Section 3 discusses the open challenges at today,
considering both technical and non-technical factors. Finally, Section 4
draws the conclusions and opens to future directions.
2. State of the art
This section provides two main contributions. The ﬁrst one is in
Section 2.1, surveying relevant research projects recently funded by the
EU in the ﬁeld of SF; the aim is to highlight the increasing attention to-
wards those activities, and then to identify the involved technologies.
Table 1 provides an overview of surveyed R&I projects. Furthermore,
Fig. 1 depicts relevant agricultural operations as faced by the described
research projects, and the technological solutions exploited in the latter
ones. The second contribution is in Section 2.2, surveying the scientiﬁc
works that propose solutions for the implementation of SF. Table 2
provides an overview of surveyed literature, then a keyword analysis is
proposed in Fig. 2.

empowered strategies; strategic interventions have been funded to sup-
port the uptake of digital technologies, to develop new digital solutions
and to sustain the crucial assessment of the socio-economic impacts of
digitisation. In Table 1, 30 recent EU projects closely related to SF are
presented: the ﬁrst 21 projects, spanning from 2015 to 2019, propose,
develop, and test the use of digital technologies in this ﬁeld; the 9 pro-
jects in the last rows, spanning from 2012 to 2019, have the comple-
mentary objective of strengthen or evaluate the use of ICT in agriculture,
for instance through challenge-based strategies, or by setting up mar-
ketplaces to browse existing solutions ready for use. Most projects jointly
exploit multiple techniques and technologies; here, we highlight only the
most prominent ones.
2.1.1. Cloud/edge-based systems
Cloud platforms are mainly exploited in projects that are related to
monitoring activities, like growth of plants, water availability, soil
moisture maps, and so on. There is a clear dominance of cloud solutions
with respect to those based on edge solutions, because the former is a
more established option than the latter. The AgriCloud P2 project pro-
posed a cloud-based PF management system for a sustainable and
intensive agriculture to secure long-term food supply in Europe. The
APMAV project consists of an intuitive solution for agricultural man-
agement based on UAV technology and an intelligent cloud-based plat-
form
that

recommendations for driving down costs and improving crop perfor-
mance. The Flourish project leverages UAVs as well, aiming at surveying a
ﬁeld from the air, then at performing a targeted intervention on the
ground with an Unmanned Terrestrial Vehicle (UTV). The idea is to
provide a DSS requiring minimal user intervention to target PF applica-
tions. The SWAMP project develops Internet of Things (IoT)-based
methods and approaches for smart water management in the precision
irrigation domain, in order to utilize water more efﬁciently and effec-
tively, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation. The AfriCultuReS proj-
ect, beyond the use of cloud-based technology, also exploits the data

operations and paradigms are ranked according to the number of links.

collected from different sources (e.g. service providers, weather services)
to develop an integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning
system, based on remote sensing, to support decision making. The
DataBio project makes intensive use of big data techniques related to the
raw material production from agriculture, forestry, ﬁshery and aqua-
culture for the production of food, energy, and biomaterials in a sus-
tainable way, by means of a software platform integrating big data and
Earth Observation (EO) methods. Data-driven activities are also proposed
in the just started Dragon project, whose main efforts are directed to-
wards skill transfers to ease PF adoption. Large heterogeneous data
sources are considered and analysed to offer agricultural knowledge and
information systems by ambitiously leveraging several techniques. The
BigDataGrapes project makes use of big data techniques in the context of
viticulture, supporting decisions by exploiting real-time analysis of large,
diverse and multimodal data sources. It has been exploiting the use of
UAVs as well in vineyards. Last but not least, the IoF2020 project is one of
the most comprehensive projects from the point of view of SF digital
technologies: in particular, this project accelerates the adoption of IoT, in
order to secure sufﬁcient, safe and healthy food and at strengthening
competitiveness of farming and food chains in Europe. A large scale pilot
programme has been started in IoF2020 to develop and test speciﬁc
technological solutions in the following sectors: arable, dairy, fruits,
vegetables, and meat.
2.1.2. Unmanned vehicles
The use of unmanned vehicles is another trend of great interest.
Beyond the aforementioned Flourish, APMAV, BigDataGrapes, and
Dragon projects, the PANTHEON project, by taking advantage of the
technological advancements in the ﬁelds of robotics, remote sensing and
big data management, aims at designing an integrated system where
heterogeneous unmanned robotic components (terrestrial and aerial ro-
bots) move within the orchards to collect data and perform common
farming operations. The SWEEPER project has proposed a robotic system
to harvest sweet peppers in greenhouses, leveraging on machine vision
techniques to acquire both colour and distance information, and then
storing collected peppers in an on-board container. Another robotic
platform has been developed in the ROMI project to assist in weed
reduction and crop monitoring, reducing manual labour. Land robots also
acquire detailed information on sample plants, and an UAV assists by
providing information at crop level. The GreenPatrol-Robot project
designed and built a satellite-guided autonomous robot for pest control in
greenhouses. It exploits Galileo satellite services to navigate, achieving
good positioning accuracy inside greenhouses. The AFarCloud project
aims at the agricultural productivity increase via PF techniques. The
proposed solution is a distributed platform for autonomous farming ro-
bots that allows the integration and real-time cooperation of agricultural
systems to increase efﬁciency, productivity, and food quality. This plat-
form is integrated with a Farm Management System (FMS) to support
monitoring and decision-making solutions based on real-time data

mining techniques. The RUC-APS project is centered on management
approaches aiming at enhancing SF solutions in agriculture systems,
applying operational research to optimise farm production.
2.1.3. Satellite-based activities
Several projects are mainly based on improving the information
derived from satellite optical data. The AGRORADAR project aims at
delivering innovative algorithms and data models that can process
Copernicus EO Syntethic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to achieve precise
and detailed information. The AUDITOR project develops an improved
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation system for
services in PF applications. The project enables cost-effective PF services
to farmers, like recommendations regarding site-speciﬁc application of
water, fertilizer and pesticides. The WATER4AGRI project combines
microwave data obtained from different satellites to provide datasets for
retrieving key information about water availability for crops at ﬁeld
level. The SENSAGRI project combines optical and radar measurements
to develop three prototype services for near real-time operations: surface
soil moisture, green and brown Leaf Area Index (LAI), and crop type
mapping. The MISTRALE project provides soil moisture maps to decision
makers in water management using GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) via
satellites and UAVs. The project has developed a prototype sensor
embedded on a dedicated software platform. The APOLLO project brings
PF closer to farmers through affordable information services, making
extensive use of free and open EO data. The proposed services help
farmers to make better decisions by monitoring the growth and health of

crops, providing advice on when to irrigate and till their ﬁelds, and
estimating the size of their harvest. The services are designed to be al-
ways available thanks to a web platform and a mobile application.
2.1.4. Mitigating digital divide
Other research projects are mainly focused on bringing the advan-
tages of SF to farmers in a way compatible with their needs and digital
skills, thus reducing digital divide. The SMART-AKIS initiative sets up a
self-sustainable thematic network on SF technologies designed for the
effective exchange of knowledge among research, industry, and the
farming community, disseminating direct applicable research and com-
mercial solutions, and capturing grassroots level needs and innovative
ideas. The 4D4F project (Data Driven Dairy Decision For Farmers) focuses
on the beneﬁts provided by sensors in monitoring animals and environ-
ment, supporting informed decisions. The project hosts a large repository
of ICT solutions freely browseable by farmers. The SmartAgriHubs project
brings together 164 partners in the European agri-food sector, carrying
out 28 ﬂagship innovation experiments for digitisation in ﬁve agri-food
sectors: arable farming, livestock, vegetable, fruits, and aquaculture.
The overall goal of ICT-AGRI-2 is to strengthen the research within the
area of PF and to develop a common research agenda concerning ICT and
robotics in agriculture in Europe. Its main objectives are: mapping and
analysis of existing research and future needs; development of in-
struments and procedures for transnational funding activities; develop-
ment of strategic research agenda and programmes; and establishment of
international collaborations and networks. Other projects, like Nefertiti,
Euraknos, and Desira are setting up thematic networks with the objective
of promote networking activities, data sharing and knowledge exchange.
They leverage the vast set of already available ICT tools to promote their
use in SF contexts and to foster their adaption to practitioners’ needs. The
DESIRA project, started at June 2019, intends to collect practitioners’
needs through 20 national living labs in EU and then to design ICT use
cases to meet those demands in a Responsible Research and Innovation
(RRI) fashion. The Fairshare project has data collecting and sharing as
foremost objectives, in order to build a network able to reduce the
agricultural digital divide. Finally, FarmingBySatellite is an initiative to
promote the use of Galileo as GNSS and EO services. It launches a
biyearly challenge to identify promising ideas using satellite technologies
for SF purposes.
2.1.5. Considerations
Summing up, some considerations can be made: monitoring ﬁelds and
crops is quite diffused at today, leveraging local and remote sensing so-
lutions, i.e., in-ﬁeld sensors, UAVs, up to satellites. Another major chal-
lenge is the optimisation of water use. Unmanned vehicles enable semi-
and full-autonomous scenarios, currently representing a major objective
for both research institutes and private companies. Anyway, almost all
surveyed projects aim at providing DSSs instead of autonomous solu-
tions; in fact, there is still wide scepticism on them by practitioners as
viable alternatives to human decisions. To feed DSSs, data analysis
techniques are used, also supporting automatic actions based on feed-
back, and farmers’ decisions. Machine learning techniques are typically
exploited for dedicated applications in the projects we considered, such
as prediction and estimation of farming parameters to optimise livestock
production or crop monitoring.
2.2. Scientiﬁc literature
SF represents the evolution of agriculture driven by ICT technologies.
ICT provides tools, methods, and techniques with the potential to
improve both the modeling and the practice in this sector. SF is intrin-
sically tied to large-scale heterogeneous sensing [9], involving different
hardware, algorithms, and protocols, thus too focused approaches have
gained little traction at now. In what follows, we survey a very recent and
exemplary subset of the scientiﬁc literature on such a topic, then sche-
matised in Table 2. To further highlight what is currently trending in
recent scientiﬁc literature, we show the most used keywords in Fig. 2,
according to the four thematic clusters we deﬁne in Table 2. Each
keyword is presented weighted in its cluster according to the number of
occurrences. Finally, Table 3 maps typical application scenarios and data
types to commonly used sensing solutions [10,11].
2.2.1. Sensing techniques and management systems
SF makes large use of sensor nodes to collect data on the environment
and the phenomenon under observation. For instance, in the case of
agriculture, soil sensors, placed at different depths, complement data
collected from EO satellites, providing enriched information. More
generally, indoor and outdoor Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), both
mobile and ﬁxed, are used to collect heterogeneous data [14] for eval-
uating different indexes, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation
Index (NDVI), the excess green index, the LAI, and so on. Given the
fundamental role played by data and data sources in this context [12],
the historical evolution of sensing for PF in Ref. [5] offers a valuable
perspective. At the beginning, three methodological approaches were
considered: the ﬁrst two ones, namely farming by soil and site-speciﬁc crop
management, were contrasting because the former promoted soil map-
ping, while the latter promoted homogeneous actions in sub-units of farm
ﬁelds, i.e., a punctual approach versus a clustered one. The third
approach, namely proximal soil sensing, came later, consisting in contin-
uous real-time sensing by sensors mounted on tractors. It can be
considered the father of the PF approaches in use nowadays. Thanks to
satellites, proximal soil sensing evolved into remote soil sensing, intro-
ducing spectral analyses. To allow farm managers to exploit all those
heterogeneous data sources, increasing complex software platforms were
introduced to take advantage of raw data and of subsequent elaboration:
they are referred to as FMIS [13].
2.2.2. Unmanned vehicles
Real-time stream processing, analysis, and reasoning are key concepts
towards automation in the agricultural ﬁeld [22], i.e., towards a larger
use of robots that can adapt to space- and time-varying conditions with
minimal delay. Robots can perform very precise operations, and can
operate in ﬂeets, as proposed in Ref. [23], which considers both UTVs
and UAVs. Moving systems rely on GNSS techniques for precise posi-
tioning, and PF applications need large accuracy. Several commercial
systems integrate a GNSS receiver and use one or more ﬁxed Real-Time
Kinematic (RTK) reference base stations [26] for providing accuracy up
to centimeters. Further than precise positioning, robots depend on
machine-vision systems to navigate the environment [25]; according to
the technology and the scenario under consideration, speciﬁc spectral
signatures are of interest, as for instance hyperspectral imagery in both
local and remote sensing. Commercial devices, to be used on board,
already capture both RGB and Near Infrared Imagery (NIR) bands, and
stereovision systems are used for 3D maps [25].
Further than terrestrial vehicles, aerial ones have been revolutionis-
ing the practices in this sector. PF is taking large advantage of UAVs, with

several commercial systems able to ﬂy at different speeds and altitudes
[24], ranging from ﬁxed to rotary wing machines. UAVs are used for
monitoring scenarios, further than pesticide spraying, which is a key
application for PF [18]. Heavy and large UAVs can be used for such a
purpose in the case of large ﬁelds, jointly with multispectral techniques
to generate NDVI maps to be used for spraying pesticides and fertilizers
where needed. Such a potential has been subject to increasing attention
in the last years. For instance, UAVs can be used to assess if an area has
been subject to plowing, and the plowing depths. The authors in Ref. [15]
consider the use of UAVs for such a purpose as an alternative to the use of
satellites. In fact, according to the authors, even high-resolution satellites
cannot classify the roughness of the terrain, thus motivating the use of
UAVs. A RGB camera has been used for data collection and a visual
assessment, and collected georeferenced data are analysed to assess the
plowing depths. RGB and NIR are collected by means of an UAV also in
Ref. [16], with the aim of classifying plants and weeds. The proposed
system makes use of the Excess Green Index (ExG) [16] in the case of
RGB-only; if NIR is exploited as well, NDVI can be estimated and used
because of the richer information it provides. By combining these results
with geometric features, sugar beets can be recognised even in the case of
overlapping plants. NDVI has been used in viticulture for precision ap-
plications [21] as well: in fact, using an UAV to collect detailed images in
a vineyard, plant rows can be discriminated from inter-rows, identifying
missing plants with good precision.
UAVs can be seen as part of a WSN, acting as mobile nodes [17], thus
the analytical characterisation of the channel model between a moving
UAV and ﬁxed terrestrial nodes becomes of interest [20]. Low-power
802.15.4-based solutions have been investigated in rural contexts,
using UAVs as data mules [19].
2.2.3. IoT platforms
As aforementioned in Section 1, Internet connectivity is a key
requirement for SF. In fact, its availability allows IoT-based scenarios to
emerge [33], increasing the degree of remote control and automation.
This is well supported by IoT features, such as interoperability and
easiness of integration [36]. Anyway, in rural contexts, terrestrial con-
nectivity may be lacking. Because of this, aerospace solutions for con-
nectivity are a viable option [8].
Looking at the literature, reference [30] proposes an IoT platform for
PF based on FIWARE.2 It considers the case of a greenhouse, where
Internet connectivity is likely available, thus opening to data exchanges
via protocol stacks relying on common IoT protocols, like CoAP and
MQTT. In greenhouses, the main objectives are typically climate control
and soil monitoring. The Agricolus software platform, which is a
FIWARE-based DSS for tobacco crops, is described in Ref. [29], designed
to collect soil data via 802.15.4-based WSNs. The FIWARE middleware is
a software enabler in very different scenarios [13,29]. Along to climate
control systems, irrigation systems have been proposed to optimise water
use. In Ref. [28], FIWARE cloud components are integrated in a PF
application to reduce water use. In Ref. [31], tomatoes in a greenhouse
are monitored, and the authors propose an analytical framework to assess
the performance of different tested conﬁgurations by relying on plant
transpiration. The works in Refs. [27,32] consider the use of low-cost and
general purpose sensor nodes, built upon the Arduino platform and upon
MICAz Motes, respectively, as information sources in greenhouses. Being
able to deploy low-cost and easily replaceable sensor nodes is a priority
for a larger adoption of SF techniques. A core demand is related to power
consumption: battery-powered devices lasting several years, as for
instance ZigBee ones in Ref. [27], are fundamental in farm deployments.
Apart from FIWARE, a plethora of different platforms can be identi-
ﬁed as enablers for SF [34]. Those platforms aggregate heterogeneous
data, then analysed and interpreted in order to provide additional value.
Here, semantic analyses have been proposed as well, like for instance the
valuable work in Ref. [35]. The Agri-IoT architecture, a layered and
complex framework, provides additional value to DSSs because it further
facilitates informed and accurate decisions thanks to semantic web and
real-time reasoning.
2.2.4. Decision Support Systems
DSSs are one of the most used solutions for SF because they provide
support to farmers, offering a point of access to useful information, ac-
cording to the aim of the system, and suggesting a plausible course of
action in a given context. Aims can be very different: minimising the
impact of diseases in tomatoes by applying automatic climate control
[37]; ‘time-to-sow’ alerts, and cattle monitoring [38]; anticipating po-
tential crop dysfunctions in a proactive way [39]; pest control [40];
selecting appropriate alternative crops in a given area [41]. Those are
just few examples of what can be offered by recent developments of DSSs
in the agricultural sector.
2.2.5. Considerations
Some considerations can be made also here: for instance, looking at
Fig. 2, it is visible how data is a relevant keyword for all clusters. This is a
key topic in the context of SF, thus deepened in Section 3. A notable
exception is visible in the cluster Unmanned Vehicles, in which system
outnumbers data: this can be explained by taking into account that un-
manned vehicles are typically considered in an autonomous scenario, i.e.,
within a system composed of several interacting parts. The keywords
pertaining to the cluster Unmanned Vehicles take the most part of Fig. 2,
graphically highlighting the technological complexity of designed sys-
tems, and the very large number of operations that can be performed by
those. Finally, what in Fig. 1 can be put in relation with what presented in
Fig. 2: as an example, in the former monitoring operations are practically
ubiquitous, and this is conﬁrmed by the large number of occurrences of
keywords like thing (as in smart thing or IoT) and sensor in the latter.
3. Open challenges
This section brieﬂy discusses the open challenges hampering a larger
adoption of SF, summarised in Fig. 3 as well. Several technologies
pushing for a larger adoption of SF practices have already been cited
within this work, such as fully autonomous ﬂight control, early identi-
ﬁcation of plant diseases, and reliable virtual fences [1], as well as more
general ones, as AI, robotics, high performance computing, IoT, and 5G,
which are reported within the EU declaration cited in Section 1. AI
probably represents the largest challenge at now and, at the same time,
opportunity in several sectors, including the agricultural one. The EU is
largely investing on it because convinced it will be the upcoming
disruptive game changer. In fact, the AI4EU initiative, started at the
beginning of 2019, aims at the transformation of AI into a compelling
solution in several application scenarios.
3.1. Technical challenges
Looking at sensor nodes and sensor networks, we refer to the valuable
works in Refs. [14,42], which survey the use of ﬁxed and mobile solu-
tions. According to the authors, advances are needed to further lower
costs and to design speciﬁc solutions for the agricultural context, which
requires solutions able to resist to difﬁcult conditions (e.g., speciﬁc soil
properties, exposition to high/low temperature, water resistance, ﬁne
dusts, and so on). Further than costs, solutions are needed toward larger
energy efﬁciency, including energy harvesting techniques, and reliability
in data collection and transmission, in order to minimize the need of
maintenance for the deployed solutions. Speciﬁc issues of the agricultural
domain need targeted answers, in particular the deployment strategies,
to be designed according to ﬁelds segmentation and to farmers’
requirements.
One of the main drivers of the diffusion of WSN in agriculture has

smart solutions.

8
been IoT: it has marked the transition from closed-source systems and
disconnected software solutions towards connected systems built upon
interoperable solutions. Those characteristics are favorable to cost
reduction and to easiness of integration. Challenges here are overall
related to network capabilities, data security, and data privacy [33]. Data
is one of the most critical topic in the agricultural sector. Data ownership,
protection, and security are perceived as not sufﬁciently close to farmers’
needs, thus becoming threats to be mitigated, if not completely avoided.
In more words, nowadays, digital solutions for SF are under-utilised
because practitioners fear data misuse and the loss of control over their
business. Data protection must be enhanced to transform into a trans-
parent operation, keeping in mind that agriculture is typically a private
business activity (i.e., a not transparent activity), and data transfers to
external systems (e.g. cloud) must be controllable and well described to
increase acceptance. An option towards larger acceptance comes from
the possibility for farmers to beneﬁt from business with their data, and to
beneﬁt from public and ofﬁcial data released in an open fashion. On this,
the valuable work of the EU with the Galileo services is a notable example
of good practice, collecting and releasing data through application pro-
gramming interfaces [43]. Further from data, open and used standards
for data handling is compelling to move towards horizontal solutions
instead of vertical ones [44].
Large IoT platforms generate huge amounts of data to be analysed,
thus calling for data analytic techniques able to extract meaningful in-
formation. Nowadays, big data immediately come to mind [45] as a set of
strategies towards this objective, but it must be noted that its application
to agriculture is recent. Generally speaking, the big data paradigm goes in
an opposite direction with respect to acquiring more control over own
data by farmers. To counteract that, the possibility for farmers to
economically gain from sharing and accessing large volumes of data
works as an incentive [46]. In Ref. [47], the authors underline the dif-
ﬁculties in discovering and combining large heterogeneous datasets in
the agro-environmental ﬁeld, often complicated by lacking of metadata.
Furthermore, the need for semantic analyses and interoperability is
highlighted in Ref. [47]. Natural language processing and machine
learning techniques play a role here, facilitated by existing initiatives for
building and maintaining open large repositories for training purposes,
like CINERGI by Earthcube.
Once meaningful information is available thanks to raw data sources
and to analytics techniques, decision making is performed. This is where
machine learning techniques and, more generally, AI can be fully
exploited toward autonomous systems. To this aim, a fundamental
challenge is moving intelligence from cloud platforms to closer compu-
tation platforms, such as edge solutions, handling and processing data
close to the source, thus reducing delays. Multi-Access Edge Computing
(MEC), jointly with 5G, is expected to play a role here. In the case of
agricultural autonomous systems, real-time constraints are more easily
satisﬁed by edge solutions than remote centralised systems. According to
Ref. [48], in order to build sustainable infrastructure, the several
emerging architecture paradigms (with different degrees of centralised
and distributed entities) must comply to open standards for both easiness
of implementation and cost reduction. Environmental monitoring and
real-time agricultural data analytics and control can beneﬁt from those
paradigms, for instance by providing localized information about pollu-
tion and pests in the vicinity of edge servers [49].
3.2. Socio-economic and other non-technical challenges
This section discusses non-technical issues still holding back a larger
diffusion of SF, at least in the EU. In fact, uptake in EU is rather low if
compared to what expected [50]. Incentives and policies play a large
role, considering national and EU rules, economical and skills perspec-
tives. In Ref. [50], the authors show how ﬁnancial and government in-
centives are the most inﬂuential solution, followed by training and other
non-ﬁnancial support. Farmers’ concerns are related to the time to
recover the investment, and to the difﬁculties in evaluating the advan-
tages; small farms have almost no adoption at all, also because the ma-
chinery has no support for more advanced technology. Sole farmers show
a large interest in SF tools, which may come as unexpected, because it
reduces exposure to occupational accidents and injuries; anyway, those
barriers still hold back its use [51]. Because of those reasons, initiatives
like those presented in Section 1 have a signiﬁcant socio-economic value:
cooperative farming with support services for a better handling of costs
and needed investments; hardware solutions to transform legacy equip-
ment into SF-ready machinery to avoid too high initial costs and to have
time to familiarise with new technology; secure and open platforms for
sharing data and getting back useful information, helping in assessing
potential advantages. Research activities aiming at reducing the agri-
cultural digital divide have an impact as well, helping farmers with new
ICT-based tools in their daily work; on the other hand, different strategies
in designing innovative ICT tools must be considered, like using natural
language [52] to explicitly take into account potentially low-literate
speakers.
Nowadays, the right to access and use the collected data is at the
center of the discussion: COPA-COGECA, an European farming repre-
sentative organisation, in cooperation with CEMA, the European agri-
cultural machinery association, has recently released a code of conduct to
Figure 3. Overview of open challenges in the SF ﬁeld: technical challenges (on the right) are discussed in Section 3.1, non-technical challenges (on the left) are
discussed in Section 3.2.

grant the data originator (i.e., the farmer) a leading role in controlling the
access to and the use of data.3 The concerns on data use and access have
been explored also in Ref. [4], highlighting existing scepticism by
Australian farmers and divergence of expectations between involved
actors. On the one hand, marketers and traders expect that big data
techniques increase the reliability of predictions in the market dynamics;
on the other hand, farmers are convinced that power asymmetries will
increase, thus acting as a brake. Similar considerations are in Ref. [53],
when looking to Ireland: whilst recognizing that SF is a real opportunity
for the farming context, potential challenges and risks should be carefully
considered to anticipate and reduce the gap among winners and losers.
4. Conclusions and future directions
In this work, we surveyed the most relevant research activities aiming
at improving and encouraging the adoption of SF techniques in agricul-
tural contexts. Large efforts are currently poured to boost ICT use, at least
in the EU, where this analysis is focused. On the one hand, the already
established use of sensor nodes and heterogeneous data sources, as well
as simple analytic techniques, is pushing DSSs in the farms; on the other
hand, a growing need is there for ever advancing technology and open
standards to consolidate existing scenarios in an interoperable and low-
cost manner, as well as programmes to help ICT diffusion in areas
suffering from digital divide.
In the future, technology will have a growing role in agriculture [6].
Several operations will be automatised, from planting to harvesting,
thanks to increased robotisation, both terrestrial and aerial one. Soil in-
formation will be readily available, thus allowing for e.g. a ﬁner control
of pests and pesticides, combining local information with other data
sources, like weather and pollution data. In the end, an increase in pro-
duction is expected, joint with a reduction in chemicals today in use, thus
reducing pressure on soil. SF has the potential for a rapid and efﬁcient
growth in coming years, supported by policies that can fuel both R&D
efforts and farmers’ adoption through investments. Anyway, the main
barriers at today, i.e., vertical solutions, reduced digital skills and high
costs for farmers, poor telecommunication infrastructures, and concerns
on data ownership and use must be carefully addressed by technical and
non-technical actors to facilitate SF adoption.
