system, which is the integration of modern power engineering technology, distributed generation and energy 
storage technologies, what’s more, advanced sensing and monitoring control technology, and information 
processing and communication technology of new power transmission and distribution system. It is able to 
provide users with a range of value-added services and to realize the interaction between the grid and the users. 
Simultaneously it has self-healing and self-adaptive capacity, realizes the flexible access to new energy 
control, and achieves the intelligent analyses and intelligent decision on mass surveillance information. As a 
content of the smart grid construction --- intelligent automatic voltage control (Smart AVC) also faces with 
the need for simultaneous construction of smart grid [1]. Smart AVC answers the problem that the traditional 
automatic voltage control system has not involved and the future of Smart AVC must involve. Traditional 
AVC conducts the reactive power and voltage optimization control from the point of view of the whole 
network. In addition, it made an important contribution to the economic operation of the power grid. However, 
with the continuous development and growth of the grid and the optimal control of the continuous influx of 
new energy power generation, traditional reactive power optimization has been difficult to make the grid on a 
layer of stairs. Therefore, the establishment of intelligent automatic voltage control (Smart AVC) system has 
been imperative [1] [2]. 
2 Introduction to traditional AVC 
Traditional AVC is a voltage and reactive power optimization control in particular run cross-section. In 
essence, it is an optimal power flow problem and can be described by a non-linear optimization mathematical 
model. Usually, the security of the power grid operation is treated as the constraint conditions. And improving 
the economy is treated as the optimization objective. What’s more, traditional AVC realizes the whole 
network reactive power integrated optimization. The mathematical model can be briefly described as follows:

the requirements of the AVC are increasing. Particularly in the run maintenance-free’s the standard CIM 
embedding problem, new energy model for the access problem, and multi-objective optimization modeling 
issues on the AVC assessment have caused widespread concern. 
3. The research of the embedded way for the Smart AVC  
The shuttle of traditional AVC and EMS uses plug-AVC model. The model of AVC and data acquisition is 
realized by making interfaces with EMS. But this method brings a larger workload to run maintenance staff. 
They often maintain two systems of EMS and AVC, which is repeated labor and whose efficiency is too low. 
While traditional embedded method can also achieve AVC system embedded in the EMS system, but it also 
has two drawbacks as follows: 1) data-read uses the API functions provided by the EMS manufacturers good-
way package to read the database; 2) opening high-level database permissions may bring the security risks to 
the EMS system. 
So both traditional AVC’s connection and embedded method have some disadvantages. Adopting/Using 
the CIS interface part of the standard IEC61970 to realize the embedding, you can avoid these problems. 
Concrete embedded methods as follows: 
 GDA gets real-time model 
 HSDA gets data 
 IDL-defined interface achieves temote-control 
4 main functions of Smart AVC 
Smart AVC achieves the transformation mainly in the following three functions compared with the 
traditional AVC [5]. 
4.1 the research of the access to the new energy equivalent model 
1) wind turbine model 
The randomness of wind speed leads to the uncertainty of wind power. Wind power is directly proportional 
to wind speed’s cubic. But only part of wind energy can be used by wind turbine, which is converted into 
mechanical power. The expression of the random power:

. The  
function of the relationship can be obtained by experiment or the existed testing data. And it can use

Fig 1. the simplified equivalent circuit model of asynchronous generator 
Interpolation method to calculate the wind energy utilization coefficient. When the wind speed is larger 
than the cut-in wind speed and less than the rated wind speed, using type (4) can calculate the output power of 
wind turbine; when the wind speed is greater than the rated wind speed and smaller than the cut-out wind 
speed, output power of wind turbine is the rated power [4]. 
2) Asynchronous generator equivalent model 
In figure 1’s equivalent circuit, the circuit relationship can directly obtain the expression of wind power 
generator reactive power and active power

3) synchronous generator 
In general, the synchronous generator is usually divided into two synchronous generators: the synchronous 
generator has the ability to regulate the excitation and the excitation regulator does not have the capacity. The 
former’s control method has two kinds, which are named as voltage control and power factor control. But 
most of the actual synchronous generator is lack in excitation control capacity. In actual production, 
when the number of poles is short and the speed is high, salient pole structure is adopted.

4.2 multi-objective optimization modeling studies 
Traditional AVC considers the single-objective optimization problem, in reactive power flow optimization  
 
Figure 2. the equivalent circuit of implicit level sync generator  
Process, it will inevitably have some impacts on the system voltage stability. Thus, the improvement of the 
static voltage stability margin as a sub-objective function added reactive power flow optimization model on 
the basis of the traditional optimization objectives, to improve system voltage stability purposes expectations 
by optimizing calculation and adjustment. The mathematical model of the power system reactive power flow 
optimization including variable constraints, the trend of the constraint equations and the objective function is: 
The objective function of power system reactive power flow optimization generally includes technical and 
economic objectives. Economic objectives mainly include minimum active power least of the system; while 
technical objectives include system load node voltage level best (minimum voltage fluctuations), the system 
voltage stability margin. Therefore, the objective function can be expressed as:

4.3 The research of smart AVC alarm and assessment methods 
Traditional AVC just gives an alarm or unusual information, and does not give a reason for alarm or 
abnormal in the alarm and abnormal. As a result, traditional AVC leads the users that are unable to position 
these problems timely and accurately, and brings difficulties to the users when dealing with some extreme 
cases. In this case, if the cause of the alarm and abnormal real-time accurate is given real-timely and 
accurately, some unusual faults can take timely and effective solutions to ensure grid more secure and stable. 
The inference engine is an important part of the expert system. it uses the knowledge reasoning in expert 
systems. Using expert experience, knowledge and   some reasoning methods, we can introduce the results. By 
analysis and reasoning of the inference engine, we can use some information through the reasoning problem 
reasoning and restoring. 
1)The reasoning functions of abnormal and alarm  
By reversing the reasoning and analysis of abnormal events and completing reasoning exception 
information, getting the problem and finding the timely detection of problems, such as:reasoning of a 
communication error alarm condition;reasoning of channel abnormal alarm situation;reasoning of failed 
equipment and latching alarm. 
2)The reasoning function of the control command   
As for some systems that do not start or inability to modulate the special case, by inference to verify the 
correctness of system control, for example:the reasoning of voltage line alarm system without command case; 
the reasoning of voltage line system control command case. 
Intelligent assessment of the main research contents includes the following: 
1) By analyzing reactive power compensation curve, we can find the whole network reactive power weak

points and compensation capacity; 
2) Nalysis of current equipment network loss variation;

5 Conclusions

the future based on the analysis of the disadvantages of traditional AVC. And on this basis, it elaborates based 
on the standard CIM intelligent AVC embedding method and intelligent AVC, which differs from 
some of the new features of the traditional AVC in detail. Then it provides a new train of thought for the
