We present an interdisciplinary approach to data clustering, based on an algorithm originally developed for the
Big Data Modelling of Sustainable Development Goals (BDMSDG). Its application context combines mechanics of
machine learning techniques with underlying pedagogical domain knowledge–unifying the narratives of data
scientists and educationists in searching for potentially useful information in historical data. From an initial
structure masking, results from multiple samples of identiﬁed set of two to ﬁve clusters, reveal a consistent
number of three clear clusters. We present and discuss the results from a technical and soft perspectives to
stimulate interdisciplinarity and support decision making. We explain how the ﬁndings of this paper present not
only continuity of on–going clustering optimisation, but also an intriguing starting point for interdisciplinary
discussions aimed at enhancement of students performance.
1. Introduction
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals SDG [1] iden-
tiﬁes good quality education as the foundation for creating sustainable
development, improved quality of life, innovation and creativity. In-
vestment in the sector of education and pedagogical innovations are
well–documented, especially in the developed world. However, despite
all the evidence on its impact on our livelihood, we are still witnessing
huge gaps and variations in attainment and performance across the
world. This paper presents an interdisciplinary approach to Big Data
Modelling, based on an algorithm designed for machine learning tech-
niques. The main motivation of this paper is to expand pathways for
educationists and researchers in attaining uniﬁed efforts to uncover and
analyse such factors in interdisciplinary contexts. It seeks to address the
foregoing challenges by tracking undiscernible and potentially useful
information hidden in multiple data attributes. Unlike in Miguis et al.
[2], Brooks et al. [3] and Hua Leong and Marshall [4], where the focus
was on the segmentation of the dynamics of static groups, this paper
takes a Big Data modelling approach to tracking potential triggers of
performance among University students (3639 observations on 19 vari-
ables) over an 11-year period (2005–2016). This work follows national
guidelines of the Commission for Academic Accreditation (CAA) within
the Ministry of Education (MoE) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
which is authorized to license educational institutions, accredit programs
and grant degrees and other academic awards across the country.
The Standards that guide the foregoing processes and the criteria that
institutions must meet are speciﬁed in the Standards for Institutional
Licensure and Program Accreditation [5]. It is clearly stipulated in SILPA
[5] that institutions offering programs in professional ﬁelds such as
medicine and other health-related disciplines, education, engineering
and others must have to provide opportunities for learning through
workplace experience, such as internships or practicums. Internships
provide a structured practical learning experience where students are
academically supervised and undergo a rigorous process to complement
their theoretical learning. At the university degree level, internships are
usually required, as a part of the major's curriculum and as such they

provide students with the opportunity, to implement what they have
learned theoretically while being supervised to insure they are on the
right track. Research shows that through internships, students add more
value to their knowledge by getting exposed to real life experimental
learning experiences and opportunities. The paper is organised as fol-
lows. Section 1 presents the background, motivation, research aim, ob-
jectives and a brief review of relevant literature. Section 2 details the
methods–data description and modelling techniques, followed by
implementation, analyses, results and general discussions in Section 3.
Finally, concluding remarks are drawn in Section 4, highlighting poten-
tial new research directions.
1.1. Motivation
Attaining good quality education is the ideal dream of all learners,
institutions and nations across the world Pumilia [6], Meusburger [7].
The United Nations identiﬁes good quality education as the foundation
for creating sustainable development, naturally leading to improved
quality of life, innovation and creativity. In the modern era where we
generate more data than we can process, the issue becomes both a
challenge and an opportunity. In a typically academic environment
where thousands of multilateral demographic students study multiple
modules at different levels, the underlying and resulting data attributes
are highly correlated sources of Big Data [8,9]. Just what type of data,
how much of it and how fast it changes are questions that researchers
have to deal with routinely. A key motivation of this paper is to expand
pathways for educationists and researchers in attaining uniﬁed efforts to
uncover and analyse such factors in interdisciplinary contexts. It is ex-
pected that this work will contribute to the work of the Center for Higher
Education Data and Statistics (CHEDS) that collects vital educational data
for the MoE. CHEDS [10] makes evidence-based decisions, inﬂuencing
higher education policies and planning at both institutional and national
levels. This helps the educational sector to enhance their strengths and
ranking in the increasingly competitive world of higher education. Re-
ports and analyses will help in advancing students learning experiences
and curriculum designs.
1.2. Research aim and objectives
The aim of this paper is to highlight robust pathways for applying
machine learning techniques in real–life applications in an interdisci-
plinary context [11]. It seeks to address the problem around optimising
naturally arising patterns in large datasets–applying a clustering
technique within an integrated generic algorithm in detecting and
modelling potentially relevant educational performance data attributes.
Its objectives, listed below, are two–fold. Objectives 1 through 3 focus on
the technical aspects of the work, while 4 and 5 are on the underlying
domain knowledge.
1. To capture multiple data attributes on students' performance across
disciplines and carry out data cleaning, data wrangling and initial
exploratory analyses for the purpose of gaining insights into the data.
2. To explore initial data for indications of inherent patterns based on
selected key attributes– specialisation, level of study, gender and their
potential impact on performance.
3 To assess the performance of a novel algorithm based on the me-
chanics of a standard clustering algorithm.
4. To highlight pathways for educationists, data scientists and other
researchers to follow in engaging policy makers, development
stakeholders and the general public in putting generated data to use.
5. To share ﬁndings with colleagues across disciplines and contribute
towards uniﬁcation scientiﬁc research.
1.3. Preliminary studies
Attwell and Pumilia [6] emphasised the need for forging pedagogical
competences in analysing and sharing results across disciplines. They
particularly reiterated the use of open–source material in higher educa-
tion, mainly for providing scholars and learners with easy access to data,
information and knowledge. Data–driven investigations into aspects of
teaching, learning and assessment have attracted interests of many re-
searchers and professionals, not least educationists and data analysts for
many years. This paper looks at the two as homing in to a common
interdisciplinary problem and solution. While the former seek to enhance
the learning process, the latter focus mainly on the tools, techniques that
are deployed for learning enhancements. On face value, the two may be
seen as representing soft and technical skills respectively, but together
they form an interdisciplinary fabric upon which the learning process can
thrive. In recent years, interdisciplinarity has been widely promoted as a
learning methodology. For example Aikat et al. [12], see an interdisci-
plinary gap in graduate education, as it “…remains largely focused on
individual achievement within a single scientiﬁc domain.” They argue
that
lacking
interdisciplinary
pedagogy
deprives
students
of
data-oriented approaches that could help them “…translate scientiﬁc
data into new solutions to today's critical challenges.” Thus, they propose
a data-centered pedagogy for graduate education that uniﬁes the efforts
of the educationist and the data scientist. This paper has been strongly
inﬂuenced by the foregoing narratives [6,12], which despite a ten–year
gap between them, they didn't exhibit a strong data–driven evidence. In
searching for potentially useful information in the students data attri-
butes, we shall be adopting their narrative.
2. Methods
We present the study methodology as a collection of projects, relating
to cause-effect relationship between knowledge & development in a
spatio–temporal context. The methodology, described below, focuses on
gaining insights into the learning fabric of the sampled students, using
identiﬁable attributes as drivers, to learn the concept via unsupervised.
Its original ideas are in derive from predictive modelling derive from [8,
9], where it has been applied to map and deliver knowledge about so-
cietal SDG clusters.
2.1. Data sources
A total of 3639 observations of individual students on 19 variables
were obtained from a University data repository, in the United Arab
Emirates, spanning across the period 2005 through 2016 inclusive. The
ﬁnal data attributes, summarised in Table 1, were the result of a laborious
data preparation and cleaning process involving 4366 observations.
2.2. Implementation strategy
Implementation strategy is driven by model optimisation achieved by
harmonising data variability through Sampling-Measuring-Assessing
(SMA) Algorithm 1 [8,9,13]. The algorithm can be adapted for both
unsupervised and supervised modelling scenarios and, in a typical un-
supervised learning, where the goal is to cluster data objects according to
some measures of homogeneity (heterogeneity), the focus is on param-
eter estimation and likelihood. Implementation starts with Exploratory
Data Analysis (EDA), presenting the data in Table 1 in Fisher's correlation

Equation (1) holds in a multiple regression scenario, where the de-
viations between the ﬁtted values and the mean are replaced by the
deviations due to the linear relationship [14]. We can use cluster analysis
[15] and [16] to group students according to this type of similarity
measures. That is, given data X ¼ ½xi;j� and, assuming k distinct clusters,
i.e., C ¼ fc1; c2; …; ckg; each with a speciﬁed centroid, for each of the
vectors j ¼ 1; 2; …10; we can obtain the distance from vj 2 X to the
nearest centroid from each of the remaining points in set fx1; x2; …xkg as
D jðx1; x2; …xkÞ ¼ min

where xk 2 X and dð:Þ is an adopted measure of distance and the clus-
tering objective would then be to minimise the sum of the distances from
each of the data points in X to the nearest centroid. That is, optimal
partitioning of C requires identifying k vectors x*

solve the continuous optimisation function in Equation (3).

Minimisation will depend on the initial values in C and hence if we
let zi¼1;2;…;n be an indicator variable denoting group membership with
unknown values, the search for the optimal solution can be through
iterative smoothing of the random vector xjðz ¼ kÞ; for which we can
compute μ ¼ EðxÞ
and
δ ¼ fμk �μjy ¼ k 2 czg Given labelled data,
EDA outputs provide insights into the overall behaviour of the data
particularly how the attributes relate to the target variable. Typically,
SMA then learns the model in Equation (4), where D is the underlying
distribution.

The SMA algorithm also caters for association rules, which can be
used to investigate associations among the data attributes in Table 1 and
data clustering, for investigating variations among the variables and the
naturally emerging natural structures. The estimates can be obtained in
various ways, one of the most common method is the Metropolis-
Hastings algorithm, based on the original ideas of Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) simulation techniques [17], that allow for sampling from
probability distributions as long as the density function can be evaluated.
2.3. Sequence of analyses
Implementation goes through a sequence of logical steps. We deploy
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to provide initial insights into the
general behaviour of the student data attributes. Ideally, EDA should
guide through understanding interpretation of the analyses and results
from data visualisation and other summaries. Based on the data insights
from EDA, we adopt unsupervised modelling is implemented by
deploying Algorithm 1 based on Afﬁnity Propagation Clustering (APC)
algorithm as originally described in [18] and illustrated in [19]. Its
original ideas are to merge data clusters until satisfactory levels of sim-
ilarity (or dissimilarity) are achieved. This type of cluster merging is only
possible if the dataset has inherent clusters not less than the initial
number stipulated by the algorithm, hence the rationale for EDA.
Further, it should be possible to repeatedly extract samples from the data
that could then be merged into a cluster Frey and Dueck [18]. describe
the merged clusters as exemplars that maximize the levels of average
similarity. By repeated sampling and validation, we shall gain a better
understanding of the inﬂuential factors in the formation of clusters. In the
next exposition, we describe the mechanics of propagated clustering as
deployed via Algorithm 1 [8,9]. If we let

3. Implementation, analyses and results
Implementation goes through a sequence of logical steps. Insights
gained from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) guide the applications of
Algorithm 1 based on Afﬁnity Propagation Clustering algorithm as
originally described in [18] and illustrated in [19]. EDA plays a crucial
role in deﬁning the research problem and objectives. We adopt it here as
an initial step in grouping students according to some measures of
similarity.
3.1. Graphical data visualisation
The two panels in Fig. 1 provide basic insights into existing frequency
structures in the data based on three key attributes–specialisation, level
of study and gender. The most popular courses are law, education and
business administration at bachelors and diploma levels. Females have a
signiﬁcant representation in the three most popular courses. They
dominate in education, have a fare share in business administration and
they make over 34% of law enrolment.
Alongside the key performance metrics, we shall use the baseline
statistics above as the focal points of our analyses. The six panels in Fig. 2
provide the underlying distributional patterns of the Grade Point Average
(GPA) metric and they generally provide a rough idea about the number
of clusters, hence highlighting the path towards unsupervised modelling.
Our implementation strategy is driven by the structures in the two Figs. 1
and 2.

The six panels in Fig. 2 exhibit the overall GPA distributions between
prior and post–intern semesters, appearing to be fairly similar. As our
interest is in detecting naturally arising structures in, we can examine the
distributions from different bandwidths. Fig. 3 shows that only at very
low bandwidths we can detect underlying structured in each of the GPA
category–more pronounced in the before semester than in the other two.
The average GPAs before, in–semester and after semester are 2.74,
3.11 and 2.84 respectively, suggesting either spurious clusters or mask-
ing in the top left panel in Fig. 3. In the next exposition, we carry out
further explorations by looking at the densities of the individual domi-
nating categories–Law, Education and Business Administration.

3.2. Unsupervised modelling
The Afﬁnity Propagation Clustering algorithm generated heavily
overlapping clusters for the GPA data. Fig. 4 show patterns for two, three,
four and ﬁve clusters, clock–wise from top left respectively. They both
indicate a separation not based on the average GPA. Hence, we take a
closer look at the data to establish the basis of the clusters’ formation.

Table 2a shows the proportions of cases, based on selected attributes,
in each of the detected clusters. The rows in the ﬁrst column, coded as
C12, C22 for cluster 1 and 2 in the two cluster group, to C15 through C55
for cluster 1 through 5 for the ﬁve cluster group. The remaining columns
represent data from the attributes Specialisation and Gender. Table 2b
shows the average GPA levels in each of the selected categories. These
statistics are potentially useful in the sense that the choice of a course,
specialisation and performance are conditional on various factors
including the quality of teaching and delivery, course organisation and
general management as well as assessment and feedback students receive
[20]. Such statistics could help the [10] in the UAE in making
evidence-based decisions to guide and inﬂuence higher education pol-
icies and planning at all levels.

The two panels in Fig. 5 correspond to values in Table 2a and 2b
respectively. The horizontal axis on the left hand side panel corresponds
to the three specialisation categories and gender in the order given in the
two tables and the vertical axis represents the category percentage. The
horizontal axis on the right hand side panel displays the 14 clusters as
shown in the ﬁrst column of Table 2a, while the vertical axis shows the
average GPAs. By visual inspection through the line, cluster overlapping
is evident–those on the same horizontal line have similar scores.
As noted earlier, the clusters in Fig. 4 heavily overlap. Thus, to
determine the optimal number of clusters in the sampled data, we refer
back to the densities in Fig. 3 and the enrolment proportions and GPA
averages in Fig. 5. Repeated sampling through Algorithm 1 yields in the
consistent GPA average performance densities in Fig. 6.
The patterns in Fig. 6 are the best representations of the underlying
structure in the sampled data. They were obtained based on multiple runs
of sampling through the data inside the clusters in Fig. 4. Both panels
present a clear conclusion that in terms of GPA performance based on the
sampled data, we can isolate three distinct clusters, centered around
GPAs of 3.5, 3.0 and between 2.5 and 2.0. It is important to note that
three clusters are dependent on both level and gender, which the two
panels do not distinguish. While a table detailing the dominance in each
category may be useful, it is imperative to interpret such data in
conjunction with other relevant attributes, such as the left hand side
panel of Fig. 5. The data for each of the 14 clusters is available for po-
tential future examinations.

focused on the technical aspects of Big Data Modelling, for which it
deployed the afﬁnity clustering algorithm [18,19] based on the me-
chanics of the SMA algorithm [8,9]. On the other hand, it focused on the
soft, interdisciplinary aspects of BDM–i.e., applying machine learning
techniques to real–life applications in an interdisciplinary context. Ob-
jectives 1 through 3 were met in sub–sections 3.1 and 3.2. It is imperative
to note that more analyses could have been carried out based on the
settings in this paper. However, the scope for this application was
conﬁned to 3 of the original 19 attributes–i.e., Specialisation, Level and
Gender, so as to accommodate the technical aspect of the set objectives
under limited interdisciplinary interpretations. The ﬁndings presented in
this paper are therefore intended to fulﬁl objectives 4 and 5–i.e., they
should open new discussions and highlight novel paths for interdisci-
plinary research involving data scientists and educationists.
Even within this limited application, our ﬁndings show that there are
great potentials in incorporating interdisciplinary approaches in uni-
versity curricula, bringing together domain sciences on the one side and
data science on the other. Further tests and evaluations of the SMA al-
gorithm can conducted using a wide range of unsupervised and super-
vised techniques, with any combination of the 19 data attributes.
Algorithm 1 is also capable of handling association rules–originally
developed for analysing shopping transactions Agrawal et al. [21]. In this
particular application, association rules can play a unifying role between
unsupervised and supervised modelling in that they can capture under-
lying rules of association among the students’ data attributes. We expect
the technical and soft aspects of the paper to increasingly attract atten-
tion to collaborative, interdisciplinary research activities in various
sectors.
Finally, and as emphasised by Aikat et al. [12], our paper showed, via
real data, that uncovering attainment and performance triggers cannot be
conﬁned to silos of domain knowledge, neither to algorithms developed
by data scientists. A uniﬁed understanding can only be achieved through
cross–institutional collaborative research, sharing data and ﬁndings. The
outcomes of this work should provide useful inputs to the Center for
Higher Education Data and Statistics (CHEDS) of the United Arab Emir-
ates
in
forging
interdisciplinarity

Data availability
As noted in Section 3.2, the data attributes used in this study were
obtained via a semi–automated random selection and cleaning process by
the authors. They were reformatted to ﬁt in with the adopted modelling
strategy–hence, the data is only available from the authors, who have
retained both the raw and modiﬁed copies, should they be requested.
Funding
This work has not been supported by any grant, but rather it is an
outcome of ordinary Research and Scholarly Activities (RSA) allocation
to each of the two authors by their respective institutions.
Author contribution
As a result of previous joint work, both authors contributed equally to
this work–with KSM carrying out most of the data cleaning and auto-
mated selection and RAS providing the raw data and many of the insights
into designing the analyses layout based on his experiences with the
education system in the UAE.
