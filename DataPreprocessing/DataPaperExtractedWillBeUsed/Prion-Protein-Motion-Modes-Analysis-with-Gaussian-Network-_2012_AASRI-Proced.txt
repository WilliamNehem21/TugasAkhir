Abstract 
Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders caused by an aberrant accumulation of the misfolded cellular prion 
protein (PrPC) conformer, denoted as infectious scrapie isoform (PrPSc). The slow and fast motion models of huPrP and 
huPrP (E200K) structures were analyzed with the GNM in this paper. It can be seen that the largest fluctuation values 
corresponding to the helix 1. Residue 147 and residue 150 play an important role in the stability of the helix 1. The major 
consequence of the E200K substitution appears to be the redistribution of surface charges, resulting in an altered 
electrostatic potential in the mutant protein. This change is likely to affect the stability of the helix 1. Thus, their behavior 
might reflect that of wild-type PrP or that of mutants associated with transmissible forms of the disease.

1. Introduction 
Prion proteins (PrP) are associated with the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) in a variety 
of mammals, including bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
(CJD) in humans. According to the “protein only” hypothesis, the key event in the pathogenesis of prion

disorders is the conversion of a normal prion protein, PrPC, into a pathogenic (scrapie) form, PrPSc [1, 2]. The 
transition between PrPC and PrPSc occurs without any detectable covalent modifications to the protein 
molecule [3]. PrPC is a soluble protein with a high content of �-helices, whereas PrPSc is characterized by a 
high �-sheet content [4]. Considering that the “protein-only” hypothesis suggests a change of protein 
conformation as a possible cause of the onset of TSEs, the three-dimensional PrP structures have attracted 
keen interest. So far, NMR solution studies have been described for monomeric, cellular forms of PrP [5, 6]. 
Although some studies provide valuable insights into the PrP, the mechanism of conformational transitions of 
the PrPC-PrPSc is not fully clear [7, 8]. 
In this work, we used a simple model called the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) to study the dynamic 
properties of PrP. It is a coarse-grained model which is topology-based and independent of sequence 
specificity [9]. This model can provide the dynamic properties of proteins near an equilibrium state (usually 
native state). In this model, each residue is represented by its C-alpha atom, and the detailed interactions 
between residues to be in contact in the native state are replaced with springs. Some studies have indicated 
that such a simple treatment of the interactions in the native protein is sufficient to account for many 
experimental facts [10,11]. 
 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1.  Materials 
The NMR structures of huPrP include a globular domain and an N-terminal flexibly disordered “tail”. The 
globular domain contains of three �-helices that encompass residues 144–154 (helix 1), 173–194 (helix 2), 
and 200–228 (helix 3) and a short anti-parallel �-sheet comprising the residues 129–131 and 161–163 (PDB: 
1QM2) [5]. The structure of the E200K variant of huPrP was characterized by NMR spectroscopy (PDB: 
1FKC), which is similar to the wild-type huPrP [6]. 
2.2. Gaussian Network Model (GNM) 
The GNM describes a three-dimensional protein structure as an elastic network of C-alpha atoms 
connected by harmonic springs within a certain cutoff distance. For all springs, the force constant is taken as 
identical. The dynamics of the structure in the GNM is fully defined by the topology of contacts described by 
the Kirchhoff matrix �. For a network of N interacting sites, the elements of � are defined as [9]

3. Results and discussion 
3.1. The slow and fast motion modes of the huPrP 
The slow modes represent functionally relevant motions of protein. The fast modes correspond to 
geometric irregularity in the local structure and the fluctuations associated with fast modes are accompanied 
by a decrease in entropy larger than that for slow modes. Therefore, residues acting in the fast modes are 
thought to be kinetically hot residues and they are critically important for the stability of the tertiary fold [9]. 
The slow and fast motions of huPrP structure were calculated by the GNM, as shown in Fig. 1. The 
ordinates in Fig. 1(a) show the normalized distribution of squared fluctuations driven by the first slowest 
modes. From the figure, the domain (residues 140-160) exhibit large fluctuation values. The structure has the 
common hinge axes located around 131 and 160, among which Beta1 and Beta2, with the fluctuation values 
approximate to zero. It is also seen in Fig. 1(a), there is a local minimum (residue 147) in the region of large 
fluctuation. The ordinates in Fig. 1(b) show the normalized distribution of squared fluctuations driven by the 
fastest six modes of huPrP. From the figure, it is found that residue 147 and 150 exhibit a local maximum 
fluctuation value. Helix 1 is formed in the early protein folding process. These results show that the helix 1 
may play an important role in the stability of the protein.

3.2. The slow and fast motion modes of the huPrP (E200K) 
Although Glu200—Lys substitution has very little effect on the thermodynamic stability of PrP, numerous 
observations argue for a causative role of this mutation in CJD [7]. The structure of the E200K variant of 
huPrP was characterized by NMR [6]. Residue 200 is located at the beginning of helix 3 and is fully 
466

accessible to the solvent. The substitution has a major effect on the distribution of charges on the protein 
surface. The slow and fast motions of huPrP (E200K) structure were calculated by the GNM, as shown in Fig. 
2. It is seen in Fig. 2(a) that the slow motions of mutant is similar to the wild-type PrP. The flexibility of helix 
1 in the mutant is higher than that of the wild-type PrP. This indicates that the helix 1 can show more large 
movement and this may be result in the conformational transitions of protein. But the fluctuation of residue 
147 in the mutant PrP decreased remarkably, and the residue 150 with the fluctuation values approximate to 
zero in the fast motion mode, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The peaks of the fast modes correspond to residues that 
were thought, in the GNM, to be important for the stability of the protein. The fluctuation decrease of two 
residues implies that the PrP became more unstable in the mutant structure than in the wild-type structure. 
Helix 1 mainly contains some charge and hydrophilic residues. So the ability of hydrophobic interactions is 
poor. The stability and conformational transitions of helix 1 are mainly affected by the electrostatic 
interactions. The Glu200—Lys replacement has an effect on the distribution of charges on the protein surface, 
thus the change affects the stability of helix 1. The presence of additional positively charged patches in the 
E200K variant could further promote these interactions, placing the protein in an environment that is 
especially conducive to the transition into the pathogenic PrPSc conformation.

4. Conclusions 
The PrPC to PrPSc transformation involves a conversion from a soluble and predominantly �-helical protein 
to an aggregated form, which is substantially enriched in �-sheet. The slow and fast motion models of huPrP 
and huPrP (E200K) structures were calculated by the GNM in this paper. It can be seen that the largest 
fluctuation values corresponding to the helix 1. Residue 147 and residue 150 play an important role in the 
stability of the helix 1. The major consequence of the E200K substitution appears to be the redistribution of 
surface charges, resulting in an altered electrostatic potential in the mutant protein. The above change is likely 
to affect the stability of the helix 1. Thus, their behavior might reflect that of wild-type PrP or that of mutants 
associated with transmissible forms of the disease.
