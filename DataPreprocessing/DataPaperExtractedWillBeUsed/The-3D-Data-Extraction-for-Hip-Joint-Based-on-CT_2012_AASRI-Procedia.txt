Abstract 
The 3D data can be extracted by measuring healthy hip joint, which is the basis of making proper artificial hip conform to 
right physiological characteristics. In this paper, firstly, we use adaptive windows directed by neighbouring CT slices for 
reducing ranges of searching. Secondly, a method based on 2D contour characteristic points matching in multilayer is 
proposed to effectively correct contours. Thirdly, according to complexity in the primary contours, location and fitting 
quasi-circular contours femur head with circle are used to adjust contours of femur head. Finally, a projecting method 
based on distance transform has been used for locating key points of hip joint such as intersection of head and neck, which 
meets anatomy features, can obtain effective and efficient 3D data. In fact, experiment in this paper shows that the method 
in paper can accurately extract 3D data on proximal femur in CT Series Images.

1. Introduction 
Hip joint consists of femur head, neck and backbone. Femur head is the round end between femur and 
pelvic bone, surrounding by muscles. It looks like circularity in appearance. Femur neck is smaller which 
connects femur head and femur backbone. Femur below femur neck appears tubular. In order to make 
artificial hip fit the biological and physical characteristics, and matching the structure of acetabular bone better,

it is necessary to fully understand the pattern of hip joint. Extracting some information from hip surface is the 
foundation and basis of making artificial hip fit patients. 
Extracting hip contour is the premise of 3D data extracting. The segmentation of bones is difficult because 
of the irregular physiology bones structure, fuzziness of the contour line caused by conjunction of femur head 
and acetabular bone, low contrast and noise etc. No-seed region segmentation is employed in [1], this method 
is very useful since there are some holes in the region which can be ignored, but it depends on initial value too 
much. Non parameter Level Set method for image segmentation which proposed in [2] has great adaptability 
for images with low contrast, however it is complicated to calculate. In [3] the solution is introduced that 
extracting the dental contours from frame to frame with region growing method combined with radial line 
method. The new solution can get good segmentation if quasi circular bone parameters are fixed and 
interactive input is specific, but it seems not adaptive enough to resolve quasi circular femur segmentation 
with flexible radius, so its level of automation is not high. 
In view of the shortcomings of the former study, the paper proposes a method which extracts data based on 
associated interframe tracing based on interlayer pilot 2D contour characteristic combined with bidirectional 
contour information fusion, then it can quickly extract accurate 3D data on the femur surface. 
2. Primary Contours Extraction 
Some processes of original images based on gray level and border are useful to reduce the noises and errors 
that produced by shape mutations of bones. 
2.1. Primary contour determination 
The border tracking method [4] is improved to get primary contours, through searching clockwise the 
border of bone continuously till coming back to beginning position, then recording the subsequence of border 
points, combined to internal or external situation against border can determine border. However, this method 
gets more than one external border in a slice. Considering area occupied by required bone is bigger than other 
bones in ROI, we can pick the right border with calculating the biggest area as the primary contour. 
Meanwhile, by normalizing the contour point information, the 2-dimensional position data can be reduced to 
1-dimensional one. 
3.  Determining Series Contours With Interframe Tracing Method 
Interframe tracing method processes slices from bottom to up, it make all use of similarity between slices, 
employing the previous frame to conduct current frame how to update its contours to get an accurate result. 
3.1.  Determining adaptive window   
Adaptive window can be used for reducing analysis range of current frame image, because the contour in 
current contour must be close to contour in previous frame. In order to get the adaptive window, the detail is 
this as followed. 
� Construct a border rectangle 
b
R  according to all contour points boundary extreme values in previous frame. 
� Expand n pixels in the border rectangle 
b
R  along each direction respectively (n is the maximum possible 
difference value in neighboring frames), and it forms contour which surrounds the border rectangle 
b
R  in 
current frame. Data analysis in current frame will be focus on this area.

� For improving the accuracy of post analysis, integral image interpolation operation will be used in the 
border rectangle 
b
R  for three times. 
3.2. Determining edge points with characteristic matching  
The shell of bone is compact while core of bone is loose, and part bone edges are low contrast in some 
slices, then it results in trench curves among bone edges in Fig 1(c). To remove trench curve, matching 
contour points in two neighboring frame and finding all the matching points in current frame, examine length 
of neighboring matching points to decide whether neighbouring matching edge points should be adjusted.

The first step for adjusting is finding the frame range of femur head. In Fig 2(a), which is a cutaway view 
for bone, and there exists characters that the line link from top greater trochanter to bottom femur head is 
horizontal. The position is marked in Fig 2 as
b
K , and contour areas change greatly form frame 
b
K  to 
b 1
K � , 
we can get 
b
K  through find the biggest difference of contours between neighboring frames. In Fig 2(b)
e
K  is 
where femur head disappears, and it is an image projecting on XZ plane. In the top of head, horizontal 
distance is smallest, then it is easy to get
e
K , and
m
K  is where the center of head lies, due to the contour in  
m
K  appears close to circle, in frame
m
K contour has a biggest circle area. The second step is fitting the contour 
from frame
b
K  to
e
K  update the center of contour in every frame, which is helpful for removing interferent.  
4. Locating Key Points 
As long as position of head-neck intersection is ensured, other 3D data can be ensured, so head-neck 
intersection is very important. In order to meet the anatomy features for intersection, a projecting method 
based on distance transform has been used for locating key points. 
4.1 Determining section  
We cut the whole bone from top to bottom vertically, which make the section basically lie at the axile line. 
Due to section is vertical to XY plane, section depend on cut line on the top of bone. In order to find right cut 
line which evenly cut whole bone, we project all contours in all frames to XY plane as Fig 3(a).

   (c)

In Fig 3, the projecting contours can form a series of interlaced contour lines, and border tracking method is 
employed to find the enclosed external contour line P  of projecting contours in Fig 3(b).  Point

P  is the right cut line�then L  can cut every contour in every frame and form two intersections, eventually , 
all intersections can get a vertical section F as Fig 3(c). 
4.2 Locating head-neck intersection 
Considering head-neck intersection lies in corner of femur a a method based on distance transform in four 
neighborhoods is used to process the section F , and steps are like this. 
� Fill the section F with horizontal lines. 
� Set initial gray in area out of border F to 0, while initial gray in section F  is 255. 
� Current point gray is

Fig. 4. (a) intersection with distance transform; (b) head-neck angles 
After getting head-neck intersection, femur head center is easier obtained. In fact, head centre can get from 
frame 
m
K , then we can see from Fig 4(b), 
hP  is head centre, and 
nP  is head-neck intersection, combined with  
centre of bottom backbone forms a head-neck angle, which is widely used to diagnose whether the patient’s 
hip is deformed. 
5. Experiment And Results 
In this experiment, there are some hip joint CT series scanning images from male subjects (512 � 512 pixel, 
interlayer distance is 1mm, pixel distance is 0.78125mm). Choose 5 groups of images randomly for detecting 
of left side and right side in hip. Compared with manual segmentation results, the results of automatic head-
neck angle detection (demonstrate in table 1) are evaluated by objective different degree O . It is defined as in

From Table 1 above, we can see that most of subjects’ objective different degrees are less than 1.0, and 
results are stable, which indicates that the automatic segmentation results are coincide with manual ones. The 
298

main reason for results more than 1.0 in fifth groups is backbone length, which can be calculated from CT 
slices, if length below lesser trochanter is less than 5cm, backbone has a deflection between extracted 
backbone and vertical plane, which result in the inaccurate center of the bottom backbone. 
6. Conclusion 
In this paper, an automatic and effective method for hip segmentation and data extraction is proposed. We 
employ bottom-to-top strategy to process serial images. Meanwhile, this paper also introduces an associated 
interframe tracing method, and makes full use of contour in known slices to analyze contour of subsequent 
slices with interframe correlation, and avoid the interference of other contours, improve speed of obtaining. In 
order to locating head-neck intersection with projecting method based on distance transform, which meets  
anatomy features, can obtain effective and efficient 3D data. Compared with manual segmentation, the method 
can segment proximal surface of hip join femur accurately, and prepare a good basis for later study on 
characteristics of proximal femur.
