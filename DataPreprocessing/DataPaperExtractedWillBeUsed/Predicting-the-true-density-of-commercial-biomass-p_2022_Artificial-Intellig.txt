The use of biomass is increasing because it is a form of renewable energy that provides high heating value. Rapid
measurements could be used to check the quality of biomass pellets during production. This research aims to
apply a near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging system for the evaluation of the true density of individual bio-
mass pellets during the production process. Real-time measurement of the true density could be beneﬁcial for the
operation settings, such as the ratio of the binding agent to the raw material, the temperature of operation, the
production rate, and the mixing ratio. The true density could also be used for rough measurement of the bulk
density, which is a necessary parameter in commercial production. Therefore, knowledge of the true density is
required during production in order to maintain the pellet quality as well as operation conditions. A prediction
model was developed using partial least squares (PLS) regression across different wavelengths selected using
different spectral pre-treatment methods and variable selection methods. After model development, the perfor-
mance of the models was compared. The best model for predicting the true density of individual pellets was
developed with ﬁrst-derivative spectra (D1) and variables selected by the genetic algorithm (GA) method, and
the number of variables was reduced from 256 to 53 wavelengths. The model gave R2
cal, R2
val, SEC, SEP, and RPD
values of 0.88, 0.89, 0.08 g/cm3, 0.07 g/cm3, and 3.04, respectively. The optimal prediction model was applied
to construct distribution maps of the true density of individual biomass pellets, with the level of the predicted
values displayed in colour bars. This imaging technique could be used to check visually the true density of
biomass pellets during the production process for warnings to quality control equipment.

1. Introduction
The use of biomass is increasing because it is a form of renewable en-
ergy that is broadly accepted as a substitute for fossil fuels (Saosee et al.,
2020). Biomass is organic material used to generate heat energy. Bio-
mass, such as wood chips, sawdust, and agricultural residues such as
rice husks, rice straw, bagasse, sugarcane leaves, palm kernel shells,
and coconut shells, is waste from agro-industrial factories. These
waste products are processed into biomass pellets in order to increase
their value. Nowadays, biomass in pellet form is favoured because it
provides a low moisture content, high density, and consistent size. Bio-
mass pellets are also more convenient to store, and they are easy to
manage, move, and transport due to their grain-like ﬂow characteristics
(Zafar, 2022).
Forecasts of future global wood pellet demand predict a signiﬁcant
increase of up to 54 million tonnes in 2024 (40% demand for the heating
pellet market and 60% demand for the industrial pellet market)
(Strauss, 2020). Hence, a technology that helps to develop the produc-
tion process to ensure its efﬁciency is required. In a commercial context,
biomass pellets must meet the standard quality speciﬁcations. The
heating value, ash, moisture content (MC), bulk density, and so on
must meet the criteria of the standard quality speciﬁcations in order
to trade the biomass pellets (García-Maraver et al., 2011). The quality
of the biomass pellets is also an important factor in the combustion
process for the industrial sector (Department of Alternative Energy
Development and Efﬁciency, 2012). In general, the quality of biomass
pellets is determined in the laboratory by using the standard ASTM
E871–872 method (ASTM International, 1982). To satisfy the just-
in-time production system, the quality of the biomass needs to be
measured rapidly or in parallel during production. Therefore, real-
time/in-line/at-line and rapid measurement of biomass pellet quality
is necessary in the industry.

According to previous studies related to the inspection of biomass
pellets, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy techniques have been used
for rapid and non-destructive testing. Posom and Sirisomboon (2015)
predicted the MC and heating value of Jatropha curcas kernels using
Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy (wavenumber
range of 1,250,000–400,000 m−1) (R2 and RMSEP are 0.97 and 4.0%, re-
spectively, for moisture content prediction; R2 and RMSEP are 0.86 and
360 J/g, respectively, for heating value prediction). Posom and
Sirisomboon (2017) estimated C, H, N, O, and S and the lower heating
value of bamboo using FT-NIR spectrometry (12,500–3600 cm−1) and
reported RMSEP values of 0.532%, 0.0427%, 0.0276%, 1.110%, 0.00761%,
and 0.119 MJ/kg, respectively. Gillespie et al. (2015) evaluated the MC,
C, ash content, and gross caloriﬁc value of biomass pellets using NIR
spectroscopy (880–1720 nm), ﬁnding RMSEP values of 0.503%, 0.089%,
0.837%, and 0.912 MJ/kg, respectively. Pitak et al. (2021a) applied NIR
hyperspectral imaging of biomass pellets for the prediction of the fuel
ratio (FR), volatile matter (VM), ﬁxed carbon (FC), and ash content
(A), as well as C, H, N, and S (Pitak et al., 2021b). Likewise, Feng et al.
(2018) used this method to predict the moisture content (MC), ash con-
tent (A), volatile matter (VM), ﬁxed carbon (FC), and caloriﬁc value
(CV). As in previous works, they reported that NIR spectroscopy had a
high potential for in-line measurement of biomass qualities.
Important parameters of biomass pellets are their bulk density and
true density. Bulk density is deﬁned as the mass of the total number of
particles of the material divided by the total volume they occupy,
while the true density of solids is the ratio of the mass of the solid to
the volume occupied by that solid body (García-Maraver et al., 2011).
Although the true density is not a quality criterion for biomass pellets,
it can be checked rapidly and monitored during the production process
to conﬁrm the optimal ratio of the binding agent to the raw material, the
initial moisture content used, the temperature of operation, the produc-
tion rate, or operation conditions (da Silva et al., 2020). Moreover, the
true density can be used to make a rough estimate of the bulk density
(da Silva et al., 2020). The true density values of biomass pellets are al-
ways higher than the bulk density values because the volume of voids is
excluded from the calculation, and bulk density has a correlation with
the true density (Theerarattananoon et al., 2011).
Therefore, real-time measurement of the true density might be an
innovative method for controlling biomass pellet production in the
future. If the quality of the biomass pellets can be checked quickly and
accurately, this will allow better quality control and make it easier to
plan the production to keep up with the demands of the market.
NIR hyperspectral imaging has a high potential to be used for
real-time measurement, and its main advantage is that it facilitates
the visualization of the distribution of different chemical components
in a sample (Manley, 2014).
However, too large data sets of hyperspectral images can be a barrier
to analysis and in-line application. Therefore, reduction of the data set is
necessary. Wavelength selection was therefore used to reduce the num-
ber of wavelengths. Using a few signiﬁcant wavelengths in developing
the calibration model may be at least as accurate as using a full range
of wavelengths, and using just a handful of wavelengths is simple and
cost-effective (Liu et al., 2014). Appropriate chemometric methods
play an important role in the successful prediction of the density of in-
dividual pellets by NIR hyperspectral imaging. Therefore, we decided
to use wavelength selection methods combined with a multivariate
technique for developing the calibration model. Thus, this research
aims 1) to investigate a suitable model for predicting the true density
of individual biomass pellets using the NIR hyperspectral imaging
technique, including the effect of variable selection and spectral
pre-treatment, and 2) to create distribution maps of a pellet sample
for in-line applications.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sample
A total of 140 biomass pellets were used in the experiment, obtained
from 11 agricultural waste materials: ﬁlter cake (11 pellets), Leucaena
leucocephala (9 pellets), bamboo (9 pellets), cassava rhizome (15
pellets), bagasse (14 pellets), sugarcane leaves (15 pellets), straw (15
pellets), rice husk (14 pellets), eucalyptus bark (11 pellets), Napier
grass (13 pellets), and corn cob (14 pellets). All these agricultural
waste materials were transformed into pellets using a palletization
machine (KN-D-200, Tianjin Zhengyao Machinery, China). All the sam-
ples were then sealed in bags and stored at room temperature of about
25 ± 2 °C. Because the aim of this study was to estimate the true density
of biomass pellets produced from the production process, standardized
biomass pellet samples, with standardized parameters such as moisture
content ≤10% and a pellet diameter of 6 mm, were used in the experi-
ments to predict the true density. This condition facilitates the measure-
ment of NIR hyperspectral imaging and sample collection.
2.2. NIR hyperspectral imaging
The NIR hyperspectral imaging system includes a hyperspectral
camera (Imspector N17E, Specim, Finland), a CCD camera (Xeva 992,
Xenics Infrared Solutions, Belgium), two 500 W tungsten halogen light
sources (Lowel Light Inc., NY, USA), and control software (Specim's
LUMO Software Suite, Spectral Imaging Ltd., Oulu, Finland), with 320
pixels (with a spatial resolution of 30 μm per pixel) in the x-direction
and 497 pixels in the y-direction. The NIR hyperspectral imaging pro-
vided a wavelength range between 900 and 1700 nm, and the resolu-
tion was 3.2 nm. Approximately 11 pellets were placed on a sample
holder made of acrylic sheets and placed on a conveyor belt, whose
speed was 10 mm/s, for scanning. Before scanning, the camera was cal-
ibrated by 1) setting the frame rate (25 Hz) and exposure time (8 ms) of
the camera and 2) calibrating the NIR hyperspectral camera by scanning
dark and white reference, and then scanning pellet sample, respectively.
After scanning, the relative reﬂectance (R) values were calculated from
Eq. (1):
R ¼ Rsample � Rdark
Rwhite � Rdark
ð1Þ
where Rsample is the absolute reﬂectance value of the biomass pellets,
Rdark is the reﬂectance of the background (dark reference), and Rwhite
is the reﬂectance value of the acrylic sheet (white reference). The Rdark
was collected when the light source unit was turned off, and the Rwhite
was obtained by scanning a Teﬂon whiteboard. R was used to create a
prediction model in the next step.
2.3. Reference methods
After scanning, the true density was determined using the standard
ASTM E 873 method (ASTM International, 2013). The length of the bio-
mass pellets was measured using a vernier caliper (Eagle One) of size
0–150 mm with a resolution of 0.05 mm, and then the pellets were
weighed with digital scales (OHAUS PR224/E, maximum capacity
120 g, readability 0.1 mg). The true density was calculated using
Eq. (2) (ASTM International, 2013):

After that, the moisture content was determined using oven drying,
with samples dried at 105 °C until they reached a constant weight.
2.4. Model development
Fig. 1 shows the ﬂow diagram for the process of model development.
After scanning, the three-dimensional (3D) images of pellet samples
were obtained. They were converted to relative reﬂectance data. The re-
gion of interest (ROI) of the 3D NIR image was extracted using principal
component analysis (PCA). This process was carried out to distinguish
between biomass pellet pixels and the background pixels. After that,
the values of the background pixels were changed to zero, and the ROI
pixels of each pellet were averaged to one spectrum. The averaged re-
ﬂectance of each pellet was thus the representative spectrum and was
applied for model development.
The optimal model for predicting the true density was investigated.
The model was developed using different spectral pre-treatments, and
the variables (relative reﬂectance value at its corresponding wave-
lengths) selected using different methods were compared. Before
model creation, either the raw spectra or the pre-treated spectra
(including the ﬁrst derivative [D1], second derivative [D2], and standard
normal variate [SNV]) were used for model development (Liu et al.,
2014). The model was optimized using selected wavelengths obtained
from the correlation method (CM), variance method (VM), co-
variance method (COVM), and successive projections algorithm (SPA)
and genetic algorithm (GA) methods (Sratthaphut and Ruangwises,
2012; Fei and Yong, 2009). After that, their performance was compared.
The variable selection was investigated, including CM, VM, COVM,
SPA, and GA. For variable selection by CM, the correlation (r) between
X (spectral data) and Y (true density) was determined. The absolute
values of r were determined, and its corresponding wavelengths were

arranged in descending order. Then, the X data were arranged, with the
wavelength having the highest |r| in the ﬁrst column and the wave-
length having a lower |r| in the next column. For VM, for every wave-
length of X, the variance (var(X)) was determined. The X data were
arranged in descending order according to the variance values of X,
from the highest to the lowest value. Then, the arranged X data were
collected. For COVM, the co-variances between Y and X1, X2, X3, … Xn
were computed, where n is the number of wavelengths. The X data
were arranged in descending order according to the co-variance values
of X and Y, from the highest to the lowest value, and then the arranged X
data were obtained (Edelmann et al., 2021). The SPA method starts with
one wavelength and then sequentially selects a new wavelength with
the maximum projection value on the orthogonal subspace of the previ-
ously selected wavelength (Wang et al., 2016). The projections were
carried out on the X matrix in order to display the least collinearity
with the previous ones (Galvão et al., 2007). GAs are a type of mathe-
matical model inspired by Charles Darwin's idea of natural selection,
and they are another class of techniques used for wavelength selection
in chemometrics. A GA allows a population composed of many individ-
uals to evolve under speciﬁed selection rules to a state that maximizes
the ‘ﬁtness’ (Sratthaphut and Ruangwises, 2012). A combination of GA
and partial least squares (PLS) regression has the advantages of both
GAs (maximum ﬁtness) and PLS regression (maximum covariance be-
tween the absorbance value and measured value) (Sratthaphut and
Ruangwises, 2012). Pitak et al. (2021b) reported that the model for ele-
mental prediction (C, H, N, and S) developed using the GA wavelength
and PLS regression provided a higher accuracy than the model devel-
oped using the full wavelength range.
For the variable selection method, the most important wavelengths
are arranged in the ﬁrst column, and the next most signiﬁcant wave-
lengths are arranged in the next column, up to the last wavelength.
For model development, the total data were divided into two sets: the
calibration set and the validation set. The data were analysed using
the MATLAB program (R2019b, USA). The calibration model consists
of matrices X (m × n) and Y (m × 1). Matrix X consists of the relative re-
ﬂectance (R) of the pellets of the m samples recorded at n wavelengths.
Matrix Y contains the reference data determined using the reference
method (true density). The models were generated using Y and X1,
X1 to 2, X1 to 3, … X1 to n using partial least squares regression (PLSR)
and validated by one-fold cross-validation. After that, the number of
wavelengths and the corresponding spectral pre-treatment method
providing the lowest standard error of cross-validation (SECV) were se-
lected to test the validation set; this procedure yields the optimal model.
The performance of the models was calculated based on statistical
terms i.e. the coefﬁcient of determination (R2), standard error of calibration
(SEC), standard error of prediction (SEP), ratio of prediction to standard de-
viation (RPD), relative standard error of prediction (RSEP), and bias:

The model performance was indicated by the criteria R2 and
RPD: R2 > 0.90 and RPD > 3 indicates an excellent prediction model,
0.81 < R2 < 0.90 and 2.5 < RPD < 3 indicates a good prediction
model, 0.66 < R2 < 0.80 and 2.0 < RPD < 2.5 indicates an approximate
prediction model, and R2 < 0.66 and RPD < 2 indicates a poor prediction
model (Zornoza et al., 2008).
2.5. Visualization of the true density in the distribution map
The optimal model was obtained, including the optimal PLS factors,
spectral pre-treatment method, and selected wavelength. These were
applied to predict the true density and then used to create the spatial
prediction map, which was the visualization of the individual true
density. The spectrum in each pixel was used to calculate the pre-
dicted value (Ypre). The Ypre in each pixel channel was calculated
from Ypre = X × B, where X is the relative reﬂectance in each pixel
obtained from the test set, and B is the regression coefﬁcient ob-
tained from the optimal PLS regression. Ypre was represented as a
two-dimensional (2D) array of pixels. The predicted density was
represented using a colour level on a 2D distribution map (Su,
2020), which showed the spatial variations in the true density. The
true density of each pellet was assessed from the distribution map,

which illustrated in different colors the predicted true density. The
accuracy of the prediction was assessed by comparing, one by one,
the acquired distribution maps and the pellets whose true density
was known from the validation set. This information could be used
for visualizing in-line measurements in quality assessment and con-
trol. NIR hyperspectral image analysis was carried out using MATLAB
(R2019b, USA).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. NIR spectra of different biomass pellets
Fig. 2a and b show the averaged raw spectra and D2 spectra of the 11
biomass pellet types, respectively. The spectral proﬁle of each biomass
pellet is similar, but the relative reﬂectance values differ. While relative
reﬂectance of ﬁtter cake had a quite different compared to other bio-
mass. It can be seen that low true density had also low reﬂectance
value, while high true density had higher reﬂectance value. Solid den-
sity is the ratio of the measured mass to the measured volume. Low den-
sity had more air gaps in the material, which air can absorb light more
than organic matter. It causes a pellet with a low density had a lower re-
ﬂectance value. The obvious negative reﬂectance values of the biomass
pellets of the D2 spectra were at the wavelengths of 940 nm, 1230 nm
(vibrational band of C\\H (3ν) in hydrocarbon), 1326 nm, 1360 nm
(C\\H combination in hydrocarbon), 1390 nm (C\\H methyl in hydro-
carbon) and1450 nm (O\\H (2ν), .O-H in starch) (Williams, 2007;
Burns and Ciurczak, 1992).
Yang et al. (2016) reported similar results. For wood pellets, there
were many absorbance bands in the wavelength range of 1100–2500
nm, with the highest reﬂectance at the wavelengths of 1473, 1925,
2092, 2267, and 2328 nm. Gillespie et al. (2015) reported the wave-
lengths that impacted the prediction of MC, with an absorbance at the
wavelengths of 1384 nm (1st overtone of the O\\H bond structure)
and 915 nm (3rd overtone of the C\\H bond structure). Pitak et al.
(2021b) reported a high reﬂectance value at the wavelengths of 938,
1121, 1248, 1323, 1384, and 1440 nm of the second derivative (D2)
spectra.
3.2. Reference value
Table 1 presents the statistical properties of the true density (SD,
g/cm3) and moisture content (MC, %) of the 11 biomass pellet types
using the ASTM E 873 method, with SD values in the range of
0.53–1.48 g/cm3 and MC in the range of 2.36–10.04%. In the EN
14961–2 and ISO 17225-2 standards, the MC of wood pellets is <10%
(ASTM International, 2013; Gemco Energy Machinery Co., Ltd., 2022),
which corresponds to the scope of this research's aim to use pellets
with standardized parameters, such as moisture content ≤10%.
Fig. 3a and b show the standard deviation values of the 11 types of
biomass pellets. The true density is in the range of 0.04–0.09 g/cm3,
and the standard deviation values of the moisture content are between
0.5% and 1.9%.
This result is consistent with Feng et al. (2018), who reported that the
wood pellet moisture content ranged from 5.96% to 13.34%. In 2012,

Samuelsson et al., 2012 reported the trend of density and moisture con-
tent using sawdust pellets and found that the moisture content affected
the bulk density (kg/m3). The moisture value was in the range of
8–14%, and the total density in the range of 500–750 kg/m3. Moreover,
da Silva et al. (2020) reported the relationship between mechanical dura-
bility (%) and the bulk density (kg/m3), and they found that there was a
correlation and a strong trend with R2 = 0.94 and P-value = 0.004.
3.3. Results of the model development and the test-set method
Table 2 shows the results for predicting the true density of various
biomass pellets developed from different spectral pre-treatments and
different numbers of wavelengths from the respective variable selection
methods, demonstrating the selection of the variables N, R2
cal, SEC, R2
val,
SEP, RSEP, RPD, and bias. The prediction results depended on the devel-
opment methods, spectral pre-treatment, and the number of wave-
lengths. Overall, the models with different variable selection methods
gave the same performance, but the number of wavelengths differed.
The models developed with the full range of wavelengths (256
wavelengths)-raw spectra, VM (110 wavelengths)-D1 spectra, COVM
(100 wavelengths)-D1 spectra, and GA (100 wavelengths)-raw spectra
gave similar results, and the best accuracy for R2 and SEP was 0.90 and
0.07 g/cm3, respectively.
The method that had the fewest possible wavelengths, a low SEC,
and a low SEP was the best method and could be selected as the predic-
tion model. Hence, we recommend that the model developed with the
D1 spectra and 53 wavelengths selected by the GA method was the op-
timal model, since R2
val, SEP, RSEP, RPD, and bias were 0.89, 0.07 g/cm3,
6.40%, 3.04, and 0.00 g/cm3, respectively. The criterion for model selec-
tion was that if the performance was similar, the model developed with
fewer wavelengths should be selected. This model indicates an excellent
prediction model, could be used for quality control (Zornoza et al.,
2008). Our result was more accurate than that of other NIR research
studies. Sanseechan et al. (2018) used a portable NIR spectrometer for
rapid screening of the true density of sugarcane stalk, and the best
model in their study was developed with the pre-processing method
of smoothing the moving average, and R2, r2, SEC, SEP, bias, and RSEP
were 0.65, 0.67, 23.740 kg/m3, 22.131 kg/m3, −1.142 kg/m3, and
2.000%, respectively. Li et al. (2022) investigated appropriate pre-
processing, variable selection, and multivariate calibration techniques

to improve the density prediction accuracy of Chinese white poplar
(Populus tomentosa Carrière) wood. The results showed that the best
prediction was obtained by generalized regression neural network
(GRNN) models combined with the lifting wavelet transform (LWT)
and the competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) method
(R2p = 0.870, RMSEP = 13 kg/m3, RPDp = 2.774).
Table 3 shows the result of the model for predicting the true density
of the various biomass pellets in the validation set based on different ef-
fects. There are fewer samples in the moisture content range of 0–5%
than in the range of 5–10%. For the prediction of the true density in
the moisture content range of 5–10%, the SEP and bias were 0.074 and
0.003 g/cm3, respectively. The variety effect found that the SEP
and bias of rice husk were the lowest, with an SEP and bias of 0.007
and − 0.004 g/cm3, respectively.
Therefore, this model was excellent and could be used for quality
measurement. The RSEP (relative standard deviation of prediction),
which is the relative ratio of the absolute error of prediction to a refer-
ence value, showed that every predicted value gave an error of approx-
imately 6.40% of the reference value (John et al., 2007).
Fig. 4 shows SEC/SECV versus the number of wavelengths developed
with the GA-D1 method. The 53-wavelength model was selected be-
cause the SEC and SECV remained constant and because increasing the
number of wavelengths did not increase the accuracy.
Fig. 5 shows spectra and coefﬁcients on model prediction. Fig. 5a il-
lustrates the values obtained by the multiplication of regression coefﬁ-
cient values (see Fig. 5b) and the average spectra of D1 derivatives
spectra selected by the GA method (see Fig. 5c) as a function of wave-
length. The predicted true density value was calculated with the sum
of the multiplication of regression coefﬁcient values and the average
D1 spectra. Hence high-intensity peaks at any wavelength mean that
those wavelengths in Fig. 5a strongly affect the model prediction.
According to the peaks in Fig. 5a, some obvious peaks with high
values were at approximately 887, 939, 948, 1134, 1398 and 1433 nm,
means that these wavelengths inﬂuence the prediction.
Fig. 6a and b also show the results of the predicted and measured
values of the calibration set and validation set, considering two different
moisture ranges: 0–5% and 5–10%. The result shows that the different
MC ranges do not affect the prediction. Fig. 6c and d show the scatter
plots of the measured and predicted values of the calibration set, and
the validation set for the true density is affected by the different biomass
pellet types, which do not affect the accuracy.
3.4. Visualization of the true density results in a distribution map

distribution map of the quality level of each pellet in the different

biomass pellet types predicted by the D1 spectra coupled with 53 wave-
lengths from the variable selection method of the GA model. The pre-
dicted value of each pixel was then converted into a different colour
scale. The predictive distribution maps were converted into 2D NIR im-
ages of the true density. The highest pellet density values are shown in
red, medium values are shown in green, and the lowest value is shown
in blue. Other colour of predictive image in the linear colour scale
changed according to the level of predicted true density. The predicted
image demonstrated irregular colors in each pixel of each pellet because
true density in each pixel of each pellet was non-homogeneous. Other
causes, the spectrum in each pixel obtained from different angles of
incidence and reﬂection were different value. Even though the same
pellet, the reﬂectance values in each pixel were not equal. However,
overall colors of the pellet images from different true density were
clearly different. Therefore, the true density of pellet could be predicted
by observing the colors of the images. The higher true density contained
more red while the lower true density contained more blue. Displaying
colour images of the properties of biomass pellets may be convenient
and easy to apply online in the industry.
4. Conclusions
The NIR hyperspectral imaging technique is proposed for rapid mea-
surement of true density of biomass pellets. The prediction model were
developed using the full wavelength range, CM, VM, COVM, SPA, and GA
coupled with four pre-treatment methods including raw spectra, D1,
D2, and SNV. Then, their performances were compared. The result dem-
onstrated that true density model was excellent and could be used for
quality control. The most appropriate method predicts the true density
of GA biomass pellets and spectral conditioning with D1 by using 53
wavelengths. Then, a distribution map can show the speciﬁc properties
of the biomass pellets, in a form that can be easily viewed and used in
various procedures in the industrial sector, such as quality control in
the production process and quality selection before the product is
sold. The model can also be developed for other materials and applica-
tions in the future. The appropriate model and important wavelength
could be used for creating a low-cost camera for real time measuring
of true density upon conveyor belt for further.
