Abstract 
We can discuss about renewable energy sources from various points of view and with orientation to the various partial 
problematic. Extent of the contribution no way allows approaching the problematic in its whole complexity. In spite of 
this we will look at one of its side, mainly trading with renewable energy sources (RES) in area of electrical engineering. 
Goal of the contribution is to search main factors, influencing trading with chosen RES in Slovakian energetic market with 
closer orientation to the market with electricity, where influencing factors present energetic legislation, system of support 
for electricity production from RES, price regulation, final price of electricity with tariff of system’s service.

Introduction  
Renewable energy sources (RES) became in last time one of the main theme during discussions about 
energetic. Goals of European Union to 2020 had become one of the impulses for their gradual dominance in 
public interviews, among which we can speak about goal to achieve 20% rate of RES on energetic mix to 
2020. Electricity production from RES is one of the particular forms of electricity production that has 
preferred access, guaranteed by legislation and connection to the system, as well as preferred transition or 
distribution and taking of produced electricity that serves for covering of losses in distribution system (BNSR,

1. Slovak market with electricity produced from RES  
Production of electricity from RES is one of the special forms of electric energy production that has 
guaranteed and preferred access and connection to the system, preferred transition or distribution, as well as 
takes off produced electricity that serves for covering of losses in distribution system. Electricity, produced 
from RES is using for covering of losses in regional distribution systems for fixed prices, given by Bureau of 
net sector regulation (BNSRS) decree. Difference among fix prices of electricity and market prices of 
electricity on losses is paid to operator of distribution system through tariff of system’s service. Determination 
or accreditation of ways, processes and conditions of prices creation for electricity production from RES is in 
the hand of BNSR that is organ of state administration of price regulation in net sector together with Council 
for regulation (Tauš, Taušová, 2009). 
In Slovakia, similarly as in majority of EU membership states there are used regulating processes that 
revived RES market. In 2009 method of price roof started to be used instead of revenue method, or so-called 
“revenue cap”. Method of price roof is considered as “price cap, by which stabilization of prices during whole 
regulating period is achieved with considering of new investments to net industry in electro energetic and gas 
industry (BNSR, 2010). 
One of the possible supporting of production of electricity from RES means providing of surcharge for 
produced electric energy from RES (so-called green bonus, surplus). In spite official conception of “green 
bonus” is not used in Slovakia, its principle means producer sales produced electricity to final client or 
businessman with electricity, and moreover he has right to cash from operator of regional distribution system 
green bonuses. Such system started to be applied in Slovakia by acceptance of amending act No. 309/2009 Z. 
z. about RES support and highly effective combined production.  
New price of electricity, determined by BNSR for following period (not more then 3 years) cannot be less 
then 90 % of price, relevant in running period. This establishment is not relating to the determination of 
electric energy price for equipment of electricity producer, using solar or wind energy (Law No. 309/2009). 
Table 1 summarizes construction of electricity price for electricity, produced from RES, which consists 
from price of electricity on loss and surcharge. At the same time table 1 illustrates way of calculation of 
individual items and specification of correspondent paragraph of Law No. 309/2009 Z. z. about RES support 
and highly effective combined production, to which all correspondent items relate.

Except of undeniable convenience of system for purchase prices by guarantee of investors stability, this 
system brings also several risks, mainly considerable increasing of final price of electricity. In spite 
developing competition on market in area of electricity sale partially decreases final price of electricity, its 
height is considerably influenced by tariff of system’s operation. Growth of tariff price during last period had 
been characteristic mainly due to the RES support, meanwhile greatest part of support belong to photovoltaic 
power plants.

2. Support tools on RES market  
RES market is given by demand and supply. Supply consists from supplement and costs of RES and it is 
defined in investment and production phase of given project, orientated to RES using. On the other hand 
demand on RES is stimulated by tools, orientated to consumption.  
Next relations can be observed among price and volume. One group of tools has influence to the RES 
prices, or it strikes for easy trading with RES on market by price surcharges, the other group has legal 
characteristic and it prescribes minimal volume of energy, produced from RES that has to be produced or 
consumed (Dijk 2003). 
Intensity of RES development in individual EU states is rather different. It depends partially on 
geographical place and natural givenness of the country, but mainly on power of supportive tools applying.  
Development of support of RES energy production in 2009-2011 is documented by Figure 1, from which 
results significantly increased RES support in 2011, manifested also at final prices of electricity, meanwhile 
biggest rate of electricity production from RES belongs to photovoltaic (illustrated at Figure 2).

From the mentioned we can deduce that in spite in 2011 individual items of electric energy price were not 
increased, there was even occurring of several items decrease, not excluding power electricity, there occurred 
increasing of final price of electric energy for households averagely about 4,82% as a whole.  
3. Conclusion 
System of support of electricity production from RES connects very closely with RES trading in area of 
energetic. Prevailing and mostly used support tool is system of purchase prices, many times in combination 
with surcharges to market price that is used in majority of EU countries. Similarly effective seems to be also 
support by the way of investment donations and tax measurements that are used in large measure as well. 
System of obligatory quota in combination with trading green certificates is used as main system of support in 
Belgium, Romania, Poland, Italy and Great Britain. System of tender is less used tool for RES support and in 
present time it is realized in Ireland, Latvia, Italy or Great Britain. In connection with dominated purchase 
prices we can discuss about convenience of this system, since according some opinions this system of support 
deforms market and it is not sufficiently effective. System of obligatory quota is trying to be forefront as well 
as system of green certificates, which could bring more of market environment and at the same time more 
intensive development of electricity production from RES. But new member states are against that, since they 
apply system of purchase prices and creation of market system with green certificates would be in short time 
very demanding, till unrealizable. Due to the mentioned new member states are orientated rather to the 
increasing of quality of present supporting systems.  
Companies, acting in Slovakian energetic sector would welcome finishing of regulation of energy prices in 
areas, where various suppliers exist, since by this way product’s competition would be enabled. Price 
deregulation presents trend that is promoting also by European Commission. In case we consider fact that 
price of commodity element would be created in area, where there are no natural monopoly, according 
demand and offer, it lead to the decreasing of final price of energy. From the determined findings we can 
generalize that open markets with properly acting competition cannot exist in long time with regulated final 
prices of energy.
