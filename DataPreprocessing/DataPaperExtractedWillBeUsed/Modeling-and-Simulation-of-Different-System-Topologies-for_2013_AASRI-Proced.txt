Abstract 
Power Quality enhancement in a distribution network is achieved by shunt compensation device known as  Distribution 
static compensator (DSTATCOM).In this paper, three different system topologies for Distribution Static Compensators 
(DSTATCOMs) are modeled and tested using Simulink’SimPowerSystem Toolbox for power system quality studies. 
Simulation tests on a distribution system, equipped with the unbalanced and non-linear load. With the different system 
topologies of  Distribution Static Compensators (DSTATCOMs)  it is observed that power factor can be  improved in 
supply system. The DSTATCOM controls are based on Synchronous Reference Frame control. The modeled 
DSTATCOM topologies can be used to develop and test different, control strategies and methods for the DSTATCOM. 
These models can also aid instructors in teaching power quality courses.

1. Introduction 
Distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) is one of the power custom device that is used for Power 
Factor Improvement on source side [1]. The DSTATCOM has a Six-leg Voltage-Sourced Converter (VSC) 
with Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) as  a switching element. Different studies have been performed

 Pradeep Kumar et al. /  AASRI Procedia  5 ( 2013 )  249 – 261 
to evaluate the performance or propose control strategies for DSTATCOM to improve its performance [2-10]. 
Time domain simulations and /or practical experiments have been used to perform these studies.Time domain 
simulations have been shown to provide accurate prediction of the behaviour of Voltage-Sourced Converter 
(VSC) based FACTS devices [11]. There are many packages available to model and simulate VSC based 
FACTS devices such as EMTP, PSCAD, MATLAB/SIMULINK, PSIM. MATLAB/SIMULINK is the most 
widely used package in engineering sciences since it has many toolboxes that cover all engineering 
applications [12]. This paper models and simulates three different system topologies for Distribution static 
compensator (DSTATCOM) using Simulink’SimPowerSystem Toolbox. The DSTATCOM topologies are 
based on Synchronous Reference Frame (SRF) control [13].  
2. System Topologies for DSTATCOM  
There are different system topologies for the DSTATCOM.  Out of which, three are selected and used in this 
paper. The selected systems are: 
1- DSTATCOM with supply side-connected rectifier shown in Fig.1. (System 1)  
2- DSTATCOM with load-side-connected rectifier shown in Fig.2. (System 2)  
3- DSTATCOM with constant dc voltage shown in Fig.3.  (System 3) 
 The load which has been selected for these topologies are three phase unbalanced R-L load and diode 
rectifier as a nonlinear load. A step-up transformer for stepping up the voltage has been used in between the 
STATCOM and distribution system.

4. Simulation Results 
The three DSTATCOM topologies have been simulated for the power factor improvement mode. The total 
simulation period is 1.0 s. Based on the simulation results,the following analysis can be prepared: 
(1)The simulation results of sysem1 are depicted in Fig. 6. Load current is unbalanced and non-sinusoidal.  
Compensator current is sinusoidal in nature. The phase angle between source current and Terminal voltage are 
Zero degree. This ensure Power factor will be unity i.e. Power factor can be improved after the DSTATCOM 
is switched on. The dc link voltage Vdc as shown in Fig continues to increase until the DSTATCOM is 
switched on and finally reach the steady state value of 500V. It starts settling after 0.2 s. The dc voltage Vdc 
starts to build up on the dc capacitor Cdc.  
(2)The simulation results of sysem2 are depicted in Fig.7. The waveform of Load current, Compensator 
current, Source current and Terminal Voltage are same as in Fig.6 but the magnitude of load current is  
comparatively increased. Power factor can be improved after the DSTATCOM is switched on. The DC link 
voltage Vdc exponentially increasing with time as shown in Fig. The DC link voltage is not maintained 
constant but tending towards the value of 250 V. 
(3)The simulation results of sysem3 are depicted in Fig.8. The waveform of Load current, Compensator 
current, Source current and Terminal Voltage are same as in Fig. 6. Power factor can be improved after the 
DSTATCOM is switched on. The DC link voltage is maintained constant at 500 V before and after the 
DSTATCOM is switched on. This allows the DSTATCOM to improve Power Factor with almost no 
interruption in the load current.

5. Conclusion 
This paper has developed models for different system topologies of the Distribution Static Compensator 
(DSTATCOM) using Simulink’SimPowerSystem Toolbox. The control of the DSTATCOM system 
topologies is based on Synchronous Reference Frame control. Time domain simulations have been used to 
verify the operation of these models. These models can be easily modified to:  
1- Perform different types of power quality studies in a user friendly simulation environment for teaching and 
researching.  
2- Test control strategies and methods for the DSTATCOM.   
3- Develop models for other system topologies of the DSTATCOM, which is not considered is this paper, by 
modifying the existing modeled topologies.
