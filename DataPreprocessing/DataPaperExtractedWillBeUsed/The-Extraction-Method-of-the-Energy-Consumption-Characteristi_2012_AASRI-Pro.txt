Abstract 
The large coal-fired power generation system characterizes as complex structure, highly coupling and nonlinear 
correlation between energy consumption and external environment, resources and load demand. The attribute reduction 
method based on fuzzy rough set (FRS) was introduced to extract the dominant features related to energy consumption 
and eliminate the redundant features as well. Taking the reduced attributes as input variables, which provide the important 
base for analyze the energy consumption of the coal-fired power unit.

1. Introduction 
The large coal-fired power generation system was composed of many complex subsystems, and there were 
high-dimensional nonlinear associative relationships among various operating parameters. To determine the 
relationships among parameters under different operating conditions, and reconstruct the system operating 
state, thus the optimum controllable parameters of the boundary condition can be obtained, and then the 
operation optimization strategies can be formulated. All of this can be summarized as the analysis of complex 
systems modeling. 
Due to the characteristics of large span thermodynamic state, large flow, high hear flow density and large 
scale equipments etc, the nonlinear scale effect on energy transport, conversion and quality dissipation in

different levels of systems, processes and unit equipments of the large coal-fired generating units was obvious. 
At the same time, there were strong relationships between the power generation energy consumption and the 
environment, resources, loads.  
As the main way of energy production, large-scale coal-fired units, including (ultra) supercritical units, 
will bear rapid peak regulation operation, frequent change of working conditions in long time, stand the test of 
factors such as complex coal quality, the cold junction and environment etc. Its energy consumption level has 
distinct time-varying characteristics. Considering the characteristics of large coal-fired generating units, as 
well as the coupling effects of external factors, it was an important foundation of achieving energy saving of 
coal-fired power generation process to reveal the spatial and temporal distribution of unit energy consumption 
within the scope of total working conditions. However, due to the characteristics such as mechanism 
complexity, nonlinear, time-varying, large time delay, strong coupling, uncertainties and random disturbances 
of the equipment, systems and process, the traditional mechanism modeling method was difficult to establish 
the exact energy consumption space-time distribution model. 
The data in unit generating process database can reflect the operating conditions and characteristics of 
operating variables, process equipment and process directly or indirectly, and the data mining technology 
provides a powerful tool for knowledge discovery in databases. From the vast amounts of data, it can dig out 
useful information and knowledge, thus the powerful decision supports for the energy consumption online 
monitoring of large-scale coal-fired units, optimization of energy-saving operation and management can be 
provide. 
In response to these characteristics, features were extracted from real data of thermal power units though 
attribute reduction method based on fuzzy rough set (FRS) in basis of data mining technology in the paper. 
The relationship was analyzed among variables, between variables and energy consumption distributes, to 
reduce attribute table, drop redundant data. That provides the important research base for real unit energy 
consumption characteristics analysis in depth. 
2. Fuzzy rough sets theory 
Classical rough set theory proposed by Pawlak, was used to depict the incompleteness and uncertainty. It 
can classify information which was inaccurate, inconsistent and incomplete for effectively, and discover 
hidden knowledge, reveal the potential law. 
The function of knowledge classification of the rough set theory was achieved through attribute reduction. 
Attributes (characteristics) of the information system was not equally important, or even some of the attributes 
was redundant. The system will be mostly simplified by reducing attribute of knowledge in maintaining the 
system’s ability of classification, deleting irrelevant or unimportant attribute knowledge to extract the most 
relative characteristics and variation of the properties.  
The following was the relevant definition of the reduction of knowledge in rough set theory. Information 
system S=<U, C�D, V, f >, U was a non-empty objects set; C and D were the properties sets. Namely the 
condition attribute set was C and decision attribute set was D; V was a set of attribute value ; f was an 
information function. namely f �U×(C�D)→V. It specifies the object's property values of U in each group. 
In the given knowledge base K= (U, S), U was universe of discourse, S was the equivalence relation 
clusters on U. Then for each subset X�U and equivalence relation R�IND (K),  
R*(X) =� {x�U :[x]R�X}                                                                                                         (1) 
X was R’s lower approximation.        
The dependence of two attribute sets between C and D was defined as 
144  
 Zhao Ming et al. /  AASRI Procedia  1 ( 2012 )  142 – 149 
 
γC(D)=|POSC(D)|/|U|                                                                                                                   (2) 
POSC(D)=C*(D)�|U| represents the entire collection of the number of objects. 
For the condition attributes ai�C, ai on the importance of D was defined as 
γai (D)= γC(D)- γC-{ai } (D)                                                                                                         (3) 
The classical rough set theory can only deal with discrete or symbol-based property information system. 
The large-scale coal-fired unit energy consumption decision table (Table 2) based on the unit's actual 
operating data (shown in Table 1) was continuous real-value in this paper, and they need to be reduced by 
attribute discretization methods. But the discretization process will bound to lose some important information 
to have a negative impact on the classification results. Therefore, the reduction method based on fuzzy rough 
set theory attributes were adopted in the paper, fuzzy sets were used to replace the precise set, the fuzzy 
similarity relation was introduced to instead equivalence relations on the universe of discourse, the classical 
rough set theory was extended to fuzzy rough sets.

the dependence γC(D) of two attribute sets between C and D was defined as 
γC(D)=|POSC(D)|/|U|                                                                                                                            (8) 
To find out the importance of certain attributes, the heuristic algorithm was adopted. Properties were 
added one by one, and then changes investigated. If the corresponding changes were great after adding 
attribute in the classification, that was high important; on the contrary, that was low.

The importance of attribute Ci on D was defined as:  
γai (D)= γC+{ai } (D)-γC(D)                                                                                                                 (9) 
γC+{ai } (D) was the dependence of condition attribute relative to decision attribute after adding attribute ai,. 
If γai (D) = 0�so the attribute ai can be removed from the attribute set. It can be obtained a relationship 
between the condition attributes and decision attributes, and the set of {Ci} which plays a decisive role in the 
properties of the decision-making for D can be extracted , namely the energy consumption characteristics 
(referred to here as ‘energy label’) can be extracted. 
3. Attribute reduction algorithm based on fuzzy rough set  
The data in the paper was collected from the panshan power plant, Unit No. 3, 3250 data points total from 
March 2006 to May 2006. The 2260 controllable sample points were got though quasi-steady-state test, error 
and redundant data elimination, and other data de-noising and cleaning process. The energy consumption of a 
decision table was shown in Table 2. The decision table consists of 54 condition attributes (including 
controllable variables and uncontrollable variables) and one decision attribute (select supply coal consumption 
for decision-making attributes). The date of the unit energy consumption decision-making table, in order to 
eliminate the dimensionless impact, was normalized such as the type of the data shown in (10).

4. Theoretical verification of the results 
Plant system was a complex thermal system composed of many subsystems (equipment) which connected 
by specific way, working under multi-boundary conditions, completing the process of energy conversion 
thermal energy to mechanical energy and ultimately to electricity. 
Thermal system with specific device structures, material properties and system structures conducts the 
process of combustion, heat transfer, mass transfer and flow through each device inside and shows 
corresponding running state parameters in the constrained conditions such as  uncontrollable boundary 
conditions (such as power generation load, the local meteorological conditions, coal quality, etc.), controllable 
boundary conditions (such as the turbine initial operating parameter, circulating water flow, boiler primary or 
second air flow, etc.),system structures and device characteristics. These state parameters were ultimately 
expressed as the thermal and economic performance indicators of the unit’s thermal efficiency or power 
consumption rate. 
The most fundamental indicators of energy performance of thermal power units usually expressed as the 
coal consumption rate

respectively were load, circulating water inlet temperature 
(determined by the cooling tower performance and the ambient temperature), the circulating water flow, main 
steam pressure, main steam temperature, reheat steam temperature, coal characteristics.  
Therefore, the 10 attributes based on fuzzy rough set attribute reduction algorithm were extracted as input 
variables. The conclusions were consistent with the theoretical analysis; the key parameters affecting the unit 
energy consumption were the unit boundary condition parameters for the operation. This method provides an 
important basis for further study on optimization of unit consumption characteristics and operating parameters.
