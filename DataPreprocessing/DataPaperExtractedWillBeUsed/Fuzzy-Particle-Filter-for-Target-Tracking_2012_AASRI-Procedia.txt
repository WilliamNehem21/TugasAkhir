Abstract 
 For the lack of the traditional particle filter and particle filter based on the colour histogram in the background 
illumination and the deformation and transformation of target, fuzzy particle filter combined with the classical Monte 
Carlo algorithm employs fuzzy technique to extract the target features. Colour image sequence converts from RGB to 
L*a*b Colour space of the International Illumination Commission. Fuzzy particle filter and re-sampling weight 
superimposed is more effective in reducing the number of particles and enhances traditional particle filter capacity to the 
recognition positioning and real-time tracking. Experimental results displayed that the method in the target shape, attitude 
or background illumination in intraday variation tracked target in real time. The algorithm enhances the traditional particle 
filter robustness and real-time in the light of dramatic changes, background constant variation and the target deformation 
self-adaptive. And the partially obscured target is not lost.

1 Introduction 
The tracking target in the video sequence effectively has been a challenging issue in the computer vision[1-
2]. In recent years, particle filter as an efficient target state estimation method, which belongs to the non-
parametric estimation with not exhaustive search and has the advantage of high tracking accuracy, has been 
successfully applied in the field of target tracking and some across-domain[3-4]. It is high computational cost 
that each particle state is estimated at any frame image in the tracking process[2]. In the case of partial 
occlusion, illumination variation, changing posture and shape of targets, the real-time and robustness of the 
traditional particle filter becomes the problems, i.e HPF( Histogram-based particle filter). Vinu[5]  put 
forward to combine with the technology of the fuzzy feature measurement and the stability theory to improve

the timeliness and robustness of tracking on the basis of Ning [6]. The fuzzy particle measurement methods as 
well as superimposed weight sampling algorithm is employed in the paper to reduce the number of particles 
and improve the real-time quality. Y. Satoh  applied the color characteristics to implement  tracking[7]. 
2 Particle Filter Tracking Theory 
In the video tracking, the color position, speed, rate value range, direction of the target , etc., the choice of 
parameters depends on the purpose of use. When the posterior probability density function ( |

Table 1:Two sets of experimental results  as  follow , Because the based on the color histogram (HPF) is unable to track the target  after 
70 th in  Experiment 2  ,no result is showed  in the table . 
 
There is a target of various attitude change in the sequence. 116th showed that   the algorithm based on the 
color histogram m of particle filter (HPF) has obvious  deviation , the partially obscured target is not lost in 
the new algorithm .  The part of tracking the effect in the first experiment is displayed in Fig 1 ,2  the 
deviation Statistics in the tracking target is as shown in Fig 5 . As is shown in Fig 5, in the 20th, 80th, 100th 
frames respectively, due to the target deformation, similar with the background, similar goals shows 
interference, target error change  increased , so the   color  histogram-based particle effects get worse. 
In 2nd Experiment , the image size: 505*285 px ,about 120 frames , the sequence form: 
http://www.di.ens.fr/willow /SPAMS/ [12] ,the fuzzy particle filter  is with 
α=0.755, =0.556
β
 .As shown in Fig 3  
target becomes smaller, the method of the paper can also track with adaptive., FPF conclusion was verified 
according to the compare with the traditional based on the color histogram of particle filter algorithm .Shown 
in Fig 6, the thesis method the error statistic of x-coordinate , but the particle filter based on color histogram 
in fast illumination 70th frame lost target,  FPF also has big error, but also can track the target, since the 
background light changes quickly, the  tracking error was impacted. So Fig 6 and Table I only was displayed 
the FPF deviation statistics. The based on the HPF in 70th frames is unable to track the target , no statistics 
after 70th frames.. The table displayed above that the track effects of FPF experiment very ideal. Both of 
experimental results are statistical as Table 1 
6 Conclusion 
Therefore, a fuzzy particle filter, which is combined with fuzzy measurement technology and new re-
sampling method, and its robustness and real-time performance has been improved in the experiment. 
Particle filter algorithm can estimate the a posteriori distribution of the target state ,so it can be maintained 
with a variety of assumptions of the target state through a large number of particles, and therefore has strong 
handling capacity with a rapid light changes, the longer time occlusion .Thesis method, however, there are 
many insufficient or not involved in some research areas, which combined with the special traffic weather (for 
example, rain, fog, etc.), multi-target tracking  will be our next research item.
