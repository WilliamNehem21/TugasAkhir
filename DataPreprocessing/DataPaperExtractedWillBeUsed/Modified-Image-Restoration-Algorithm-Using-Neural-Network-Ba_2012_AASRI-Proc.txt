Abstract 
In this paper, we considered the neural network image restoration algorithm based on harmonic model and improved the 
efficiency of the algorithm. After analyzing the complexity of the algorithm, I found that the storage of the connection 
weight 
i j
w ,  wastes a lot of spaces. And when I made a deeper analysis of the
i j
w , , I found that there are many duplicated 
elements, and the distribution of the elements is regular. So I started from this point to improve the algorithm, and 
simplified the calculation of the connection weights matrix, and avoided a large amount of data storage. As a result, the 
space complexity reduced to 
O(n)
 from
)
(
O n2
, meanwhile, the time complexity is improved. This is a great improvement. 
At last, I made some data simulation experiment, and the result give a further description of the algorithm.��

1. Introduction 
In the image processing, image restoration has been one of the most important basic research subjects. 
Many application fields need clear and high quality images, so image restoration (such as denoising, 
deblurring etc.) is of great significance. The traditional image restoration method is mainly about image 
filtering processing. With most of the image information existing in the edge portion, therefore, image 
filtering is needed to not only remove the blur and noise from the image but also to keep the detail of the 
image. Because of image details and noise in frequency bands aliasing, making the image smoothing and the 
edge details remain becomes a pair of contradiction and the traditional filtering methods are difficult to deal 
with this kind of problem. The development of neural network technology in recent years to solve this 
contradiction of the image restoration provides a new method (Zhou Y T and Chellappa R, 1988; Paik JK and 
Katsaggelos AK, 1992; Yubing Han and Lenan Wu, 2004; Perry S.W and Guan L, 2000; Erler K and Jernigan 
E,1994; Wu W and Kundu A,1992). 
Neural network for image restoration model was first put forward by Zhou et al. (Zhou Y T and Chellappa 
R, 1988). They linked image restoration with Hopfield neural network through the energy function, and 
converted image restoration into optimization problem of the neural network calculation. However, using the 
Zhou method there are shortcomings that the network model is huge and network state is updated slow and so 
on. In order to overcome these disadvantages, Paik et al. (Paik JK and Katsaggelos AK, 1992) put forward an 
improved Hopfield neural network model for gray-scale image restoration. Later, the Paik method was 
improved by many scholars from the network model and the convergence rate and so forth (Yubing Han and 
Lenan Wu, 2004; Perry S.W and Guan L, 2000; Erler K and Jernigan E, 1994; Wu W and Kundu A, 1992). 
Literature (Yadong Wu, 2006) on the basis of Paik algorithm, using the regularization term based on the 
harmonic model, proposed a neural network algorithm based on the harmonic model. But the author in the 
analysis of the algorithm found that the storage of the connection weights needs a size of matrix
L� L
, 
among them
N
M
L
�
�
, M and N for the image width to height. For an image of the size 12�����, the 
connection weights matrix will be the 16384 d. It's not conducive to the computer processing. Then based on 
this algorithm an improved algorithm is proposed, to simplify the calculation of the connection weights.  
2. The Restoration Model 
According to the problem of the image restoration model, the image restoration problem can be 
transformed to minimize the following error function: 
                                                                                                                                                                   (1) 
Among them, �  represents the norm of
2L , x is the estimated value of the real image, y is the degraded 
image. x And y  for column vectors, namely
)
(
ix
x �
�
)
(
iy
y �
�In the above equation, the first term 
represents that finding a x makes 
H � x
 approximate y  in the case of minimum variance; the second term is 
the constraints of x , also called the regularization item; for regularization parameter � , it controls the 
proportion between removing fuzz and smoothing noise. Matrix H represents the distortion of the imaging 
system, which is the size of
L� L
Toeplitz matrix generated by the point spread function. D is the high-pass 
filter, which is a matrix generated by the regularization operator. In the traditional rehabilitation model, 
regularization operator is the Laplace operator. If the point spread function h  for the
1� r
 matrix, d  also 
should be written as the 
1� r
matrix. D is in the same form with H . The harmonic model will be introduced 
into the image restoration frame based on neural network as follows,  
     
(2)

 Yang Bing et al. /  AASRI Procedia  1 ( 2012 )  196 – 206 
 
 
Among them, DX  and DY  are the
L� L
 Toeplitz matrixes respectively generated by vertical and 
horizontal gradient. The connection weight is for, 
                                                      (3)  
                                                               
3. The Recovery Algorithm 
Based on the above model, the algorithm generated by referencing the structure of the Paik algorithm can 
be found in the literature [8], time complexity of the algorithm is
)
(
O n3
, and space complexity is
)
(
O n2
. 
Then we will improve it as follows. 
First of all, several definitions and theorems prepared for the improved algorithm are introduced. 
For a matrix 
�

A
�

,it is the Toeplitz matrix; i.e., for all the 
n

� �
�
j
i
i j
a
a
. And A is 
also the symmetric matrix. Then A is called the symmetric Toeplitz matrix.

That is a symmetric Toeplitz matrix.

That is W for the symmetric matrix; 
Thus, W is a symmetric Toeplitz matrix. QED.

Proof: This proposition is divided into two parts to prove: 
(1) From the above discussion we know the structure of H , making
j

From theorem 1, it is known that W is a

Let's talk about the actual significance of the theorems above in the algorithms. In the image restoration

                                                           (27) 
Among them, H � DX  and DY  are all the Toeplitz matrixes . From theorem 1 and its inferences to 
know, the generated matrix
�
�
L L

W
�
�
,
 is a symmetric Toeplitz matrix; assume that the point spread 
function h  for the
1� r
 matrix which generates H . In actual applications, the image size
L �� r
, we 
think
2 �1
L � r
. So from the corollaries of theorem 1 reasoning and theorem 2 we can know some key 
features of the matrixW : 
(1) The number and the values of nonzero elements are defined, which can be expressed by using the 
elements of h .And along with the changes of L , the values will not be changed; 
(2) The elements of the matrixW are regular. All elements and some element of the first line are in same 
value, and this equivalence relation follows certain rule. 
Based on the two points above, we think that in the course of the algorithm, there is no need to generate the 
Toeplitz matrix H , and only need to calculate its certain numerical values according to the rule. If we do so, 
for the original algorithm space complexity and time complexity will have a very big improvement. The 
following describes the algorithm of calculatingW .

4. The Experimental Results and Discussion 
The algorithms in the last section are from matrix internal data features, looking for the relationship 
between dates. The improvement is that it avoids the redundant data storage, thus avoiding the generation of 
large scale matrix. 
The calculating process of W only needs
2r times; in the original algorithm, external circulation times 
are
2L . In practical application

the Gaussian white noise with the variance of 25, using the MSE and PSNR as measures. In the algorithm, the

Seen from the pictures, the algorithm in noise removal performance is very good, but in keeping the edge 
of performance is relatively insufficient, which confirmed the previous theoretical knowledge: Harmonic 
canonical in the gradient and the edge of the two orthogonal directions are diffused, and has the same 
diffusion coefficient. Therefore, the harmonic model in noise smoothing also fuzzes edges of the image. Fuzzy

5.  The End 
This paper first studied the complexity of the original algorithm, and then had a detailed analysis of the 
calculation process of connection weight matrix, finding the internal structural features. By the form of 
Theorem 1and 2 it was summarized and the theorems was applied to the original algorithm. Then we put 
forward a new improved algorithm saving time and space and finally did the data simulation experiment, 
which not only deepened the understanding to the algorithm, but also illustrated the advantages of the 
improvement algorithm.
