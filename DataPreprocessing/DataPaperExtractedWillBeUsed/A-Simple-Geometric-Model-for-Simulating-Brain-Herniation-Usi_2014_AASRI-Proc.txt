Abstract 
The intracranial space (ICS) is incompletely separated by the cerebral falx and the cerebellar tentorium into three 
compartments. To simulate brain herniation, defined as part of the brain shifting from one compartment to another, we 
proposed a simplified model of the supratentorial space (STS) based on computed tomographic (CT) images obtained 
from 50 subjects. 
After identifying skull regions, we manually outlined the STS regions on CT slices. Pertinent dimensions of the STS 
and its openings were measured. The average volumes of the ICS and the STS were 1326 and 1154 mL. The average 
length, width and height of the STS were 154.7, 136.1, and 90.3 mm. The average length and height of the subfalcine 
space (SFS) were 85.8 and 52.1 mm, while the average length and width of midbrain were 37.9 and 30.9 mm. 
Based on these data, we constructed a half sphere STS model with a diameter of 160 mm and a volume of 1072 mL. A 
40 mm circle representing the tentorial incisura is removed from the center of its equatorial plane. This model is then 
divided into two compartments by its intact mid-sagittal plane, which had another 80 mm semicircle removed to simulate 
the SFS.

1. Introduction 
Lying within the cranial cavity, the human brain is composed of the cerebral hemispheres and the 
cerebellum, incompletely separated by the cerebral falx between the hemispheres and the cerebellar tentorium 
between the cerebrum and the cerebellum [1]. In other words, the intracranial space (ICS) is separated into the 
supratentorial space (STS) and the infratentorial space (ITS) by the tentorium. Because the brain is roughly 
bilateral symmetric, the falx is often used to represent the intact mid-sagittal plane (iMSP) and the separated 
cerebral hemispheres connect at the subfalcine space (SFS) [2]. The tentorial incisura (TI), an opening at the 
center of the tentorium, provides the only communication between the STS and the ITS [3]. The TI is divided 
into the anterior, middle, and posterior incisural spaces, with the midbrain (upper brainstem) occupying the 
middle one.  
Different types of intracranial mass, such as hematomas, tumors, abscesses, or swelling brains after infarcts, 
can cause brain shift, followed by herniation, brainstem compression and death. With increased intracranial 
pressure (ICP), the diseased or injured cerebral hemisphere may herniate through the SFS to the other side, 
resulting in subfalcine herniation (SFH) which is manifested as midline shift (MLS) on brain images [4]. With 
bilateral cerebral lesions or further elevation of the ICP, the medial part of the cerebrum may herniate through 
the TI, resulting in transtentorial herniation (TTH) and brain stem compression. On images, one can find 
changes in the shape of the brainstem and effacement of the cisternal spaces around it [4]. Both types of 
cerebral herniation, SFH and TTH, are clinically and radiologically important phenomena that require special 
attention of physicians.  
We have proposed methods that can automatically measure MLS with symmetry-based and landmark-
based methods, and the results were verified clinically [5-8]. To our knowledge, however, there has been no 
biomechanical model dedicated to simulating brain herniation in the literature. In this study, we try develop a 
simple 3-dimensional geometric model that can be applied to simulate brain deformation, especially brain 
herniation occurring at the STS, caused by a supratentorial intracranial mass, based on computed tomographic 
(CT) images of patients with no intracranial pathologies. 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Materials 
Compared to females, males have larger skulls and thus larger intracranial volumes (ICVs) [9, 10]. To 
create a generalized model, we collected computed tomographic (CT) images from 25 consecutive male and 
25 consecutive female patients with brain concussion visiting the emergency room of Taipei Hospital, 
Department of Health, New Taipei City, Taiwan, between April and May in 2013. Patients with skull 
fractures, intracranial hematomas, history of neurological illnesses or intracranial surgeries, were excluded 
from this study.  
All brain CT scans were done with a standard protocol using a Somatom Definition AS+ 128-slice scanner 
(Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The field of view (FOV) was 250x250 mm. For patients with head injury only, 
contiguous 5-mm slices were obtained from the foramen magnum to the vertex with the gantry parallel to the 
orbitomeatal (OM) line. For those with concomitant facial and/or cervical spine injury, contiguous 5-mm 
slices were obtained from the neck to the vertex with the gantry perpendicular to the patient’s couch. 
Each CT image was 512x512 pixels in size, resulting in a resolution of 0.49 mm per pixel. To rule out the 
diagnosis of intracranial hematoma, the original CT density values were transformed from Hounsfield units to 
8-bit gray values in a windowed value range (center 35 HU, width 150 HU) [6]. CT slices at levels from the 
97

foramen magnum to the vertex were downloaded to a personal computer. All images were then inspected 
again by a board-certified neurosurgeon to confirm the absence of any exclusion criteria mentioned above. 
2.2. Methods 
For each CT data set, the global gray level histogram was obtained. Then, pixels with bone density in all 
CT slices of the given data set were automatically tagged using a threshold derived from the histogram. The 
detailed settings were previously described [6, 7].  
We have developed an algorithm that can differentiate the intracranial regions from the extracranial ones 
automatically [11]. With in the ICS, however, it is difficult to separate the STS from the ITS because the 
cerebellar tentorium is thin and has gray levels similar to the brain itself. Therefore, we manually labeled the 
boundary between the STS and the ITS and labeled the regions on the computer screen. The skull base 
openings of these regions were also labeled to prevent failures of the region-growing algorithm.  
Using planimetry method of the Cavalieri principle, the volume of a given region is its area multiplied by 
the slice thickness. The total ICV, the volume of the STS (V_STS) and that of the ITS (V_ITS) of the patient, 
are the sum of the volumetric results of all corresponding regions across all CT slices. We also measured the 
length and width of the STS, defined as the largest anteroposterior diameter and the largest transverse 
diameter among all STS regions. The height of the STS is the total thickness of the STS volume, counted 
from the vertex to the level of the midbrain.  
In addition to the volume and outer dimensions of the STS, we also measured the sizes of its openings, 
namely the SFS and the TI. The SFS and the TI meets at the midbrain. Due to the complex anatomy in this 
region, we only tried to identify the midbrain and omitted other structures such as vessels, nerves and the 
pituitary gland. The midbrains in the patients were manually recognized by human experts and their lengths 
and the widths were recorded. We measured its length of the SFS at the level of interventricular foramen of 
Monro [4]. We also counted the number of slices containing connected cerebral hemispheres from the corpus 
callosum down to the level of the midbrain and the total thickness was considered the height of the SFS. 
3. Results 
The ages of the patients ranged from 18 to 66 years with a mean of 37 ± 14 years. The mean ages of female 
and male patients were 39 ± 15 and 35 ±14 years, respectively. 
3.1. Biometric Results 
Results of manual volumetry are listed in Table 1. The ICVs in the 50 patients ranged from 1040 to 1716 
mL, with a mean of 1326 ± 138 mL. The V_STS ranged from 915 to 1480 mL with a mean of 1154 ± 119 mL, 
while the V_ITS ranged from 125 to 236 mL with a mean of 171 ± 23 mL. The ratio between V_STS and 
ICV had a small range from 0.85 to 0.89 with a mean of 0.87 ± 0.01. The volumes of all intracranial 
compartments were larger in males (p < 0.001, one-tail t-test). The volumes of the STS and the ITS are highly 
correlated, with a correlation coefficient of 0.777 (p < 0.001).

Measurement results of outer and inner dimensions of the STS are listed in Table 2. The length of the STS 
in these 50 patients ranged from 138.7 to 175.8 mm with a mean of 153.7 ± 8.0 mm, while the width of the 
STS ranged from 116.7 to 150.9 mm with a mean of 136.1 ± 7.3 mm. The ratio between the length and the 
width of the STS ranged from 0.95 to 1.36 with a mean of 1.13 ± 0.09. The height of the STS ranged from 
75.0 to 100.0 mm with a mean of 90.3 ± 4.5 mm. All outer dimensions of the STS were larger in males (p = 
0.010 for the length, p = 0.001 for the width, and p = 0.002 for the height). The length/width ratio did not 
differ between males and females (p=0.904).  
The length of the brainstem in these 50 patients ranged from 24.9 to 36.1 mm with a mean of 30.9 ± 2.5 
mm, while the width of the brainstem ranged from 30.3 to 48.3 mm with a mean of 37.9 ± 4.7 mm. Compared 
to females, the length of the brainstem was larger in males, but the difference in brainstem width was only 
marginally significant (p = 0.054). The length of the SFS ranged from 67.8 to 103.9 mm with a mean of 85.8 
± 7.0 mm, while the height of the SFS ranged from 35.0 to 65.0 mm with a mean of 52.1 ± 5.7 mm. Males 
have larger SFS heights and lengths, but only the former showed significant difference (p = 0.006). 
3.2. Model Specification 
Based on craniometric data from last section, we constructed a simple model of the STS. The model 
assumes the shape of the upper half of a sphere with a diameter of 160 mm. The volume of this STS model is 
1072 mL, which is 6.7% smaller than the average V_STS but is very close to that of females, 1077 mL. Both 
the length and the width of this model are 160 mm. The length of the model is 3.9% larger than that of 
craniometry, while the width of the model is 17.6% larger. The height of the model, 80 mm, is 11% smaller 
than the average height of the STS obtained from craniometry. 
The outer surface of this model simulates the convexity surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres. On the other 
hand, the irregular basal surface of the cerebrum, including the orbital roof, the sphenoid ridge, the middle 
cranial fossa floor and the tentorial surface, is simplified and represented by a flat equatorial plane in this 
model. A 40 mm circle is removed from the center of the basal plane to simulate the midbrain occupying the 
TI.

To model the partially connected cerebral hemispheres, our model is divided into two compartments by the 
iMSP. As a result, each cerebral “hemisphere”, which assumes the shape of quarter sphere, has three surfaces: 
the convexity, the basal and the interhemispheric surfaces. The sickle-shaped falx cerebri is a strong arched 
process which descends vertically in the longitudinal fissure, or the iMSP [1]. It is narrow in front and broad 
behind. To model the falx, a semicircle 80 mm in diameter is removed from the iMSP to simulate the SFS. 
The center of this semicircle is located 20 mm anterior to the center of the basal plane. The posterior ends of 
SFS and the TI meet at the falcotentorial junction, which is adjacent to the posterior aspect of the midbrain. 
We have implemented our model using ANSYS ED 10.0 (ANSYS, Inc., Canonsburg, PA) software 
environment. The cutaway view is shown in Fig. 1.

left, anterior-posterior, and cranial-caudal (superior-inferior) anatomical axes, respectively. The left anterior quarter of the hemispheric 
object (A14) is removed to show the non-convexity surfaces. The interhemispheric surface is composed of the falx cerebri (A8) and the 
subfalcine space (A6). The basal surface is composed of the immobile part (A16) and the tentorial incisura (A2 and A7).

4. Discussion 
4.1. Volumetry Results 
In this study, we performed measurements on the volumes and dimensions of the ICS. The ICVs obtained 
in our patient population seems smaller than those described in the literature (male: 1400-1600 mL, female: 
1250-1450 mL) [9]. In addition to potential errors in the postprocessing process, partial volume effect caused 
by slice thickness may be the most important factor causing this discrepancy. Compared to the filling method, 
Sahin et al. had demonstrated a 3.7% underestimation of ICV using CT craniometry on dry skulls with 5-mm 
slices, probably due to partial volume effect [12, 13]. On the other hand, Sahin also noticed the systemic 
overestimating using 2-mm CT slices but the reason was unknown. This phenomenon may explain why 
studies using thin-cut slices or “volumetric” CT images may actually overestimate the ICV, such as the study 
done by Abbott et al. [14]. 
The ratio between V_ITS and ICV is important in patients with Chiari malformation type I. Using 
volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Sgouros et al. measured these values in healthy and diseased 
pediatric subjects. In the healthy group, the ICV was 1383 mL, the V_ITS 186 mL and the PFV/ICV ratio was 
0.135 [15]. In our study, the ratio between V_ITS and ICV ranged from 0.11 to 0.15 with an average of 0.13, 
which is very close to the normal value described by Sgouros. 
We laboriously separated the STS regions from the ITS regions in this study. Lescot et al. also manually 
segmented the STS on 5-mm CT slices in 15 diseased and 15 healthy subjects [16]. They separated 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) voxels from brain voxels using thresholding. The average supratentorial brain 
volume of their healthy subjects was 1041 ± 108 mL, while the total intracranial CSF volume (V_CSF) was 
127 ± 56 mL. The mean V_STS in current study (1154 mL) is compatible with Lescot’s observation. 
4.2. Model versus Reality 
Historiaclly, ICV estimation from craniometric parameters utilized the outer dimensions of the calvarial 
skull, A, B, and C, as well as its thickness, t. The ICV can then be calculated using the ellipsoid formula, ICV 
= pi / 6 * (A – 2t) (B – 2t) (C – 2t) [10]. In this study, we measured the inner dimensions of the skull directly 
on CT images. Since the thickness of the skull varied widely [17], we consider our method a better estimate 
because the ICV can be calculated directly.  
In our simplified model of the STS, we did not take shape variation and sex difference into account. The 
outer and inner dimensions of the STS are simplified. The average length, width and height of the STS in our 
patients were 154.7, 136.1, and 90.3 mm. If we assuming that the STS is half ellipsoid in shape, the average 
V_STS would be 989 mL, considerably smaller than the actual volume of 1154 mL.  
There are two reasons that can explain the underestimation caused by direct application of the ellipsoid 
formula. First, basal parts of the cerebral hemispheres are located below the level of the midbrain. In this 
study, about 13% of the V_STS was located caudal to the slice containing the midbrain and was not included 
in volumetry. Secondly, the largest lengths and widths of the STSs did not appear in the basal slice containing 
the TI (or the midbrain). Most of them were 20 mm, or 3-5 slices, above the basal slice. Direct application of 
the ellipsoid formula, which has the largest area at its equatorial plane, results in underestimation. On the 
other hand, with a length and width larger than the actual craniometry, our STS model can compensate for the 
underestimation of the volume. 
Males have larger ICVs and V_STSs than females. Compare to females, the ICV was 15% larger, the 
V_STS 14% larger, the V_ITS 20% larger in males in this study. The average length, width, and height, as 
well as the inner dimensions, of the STS were about 4% larger in males. The model we created has a V_STS 
101
 Ke-Chun Huang et al. /  AASRI Procedia  6 ( 2014 )  95 – 102 
close to that of females. To create a half sphere model that has a V_STS of the males, the diameter would be 
approximately 168 mm.  
Theoretically, the CT studies produce a series of images that are parallel to the OM line. However, the 
actual gantry tilt angle varied from -2 to 28.2 degrees, depending on patient posture and whether there is need 
for cervical spine imaging. We did not find any relationship between the degree of gantry tilt and variables we 
measured (p=0.374). Sahin noted larger difference between volumetric results using coronal and axial slices 
of 10-mm thickness but the difference is small with 5-mm slices. [12]  
The volumes of the STS and the ITS are highly correlated to that of ICV. Males have larger ICVs and thus 
larger V_STSs. In this study, all female patients have ICVs smaller than 1400 mL, while two male patients 
have ICVs larger than 1550 mL. Significant amount of extra-cerebral CSF exceeding 180 mL was observed in 
the patient with the largest ICV of 1716 mL, who had a ventricular CSF volume of 87 mL. On the other hand, 
smaller ventricles were observed in those with smaller ICVs. Since our model has a volume slightly smaller 
than the average V_STS of all male and female patients, we consider this model applicable to all patients 
except those with extremely large ICVs. 
4.3. Potential applications 
The goal of this study is to develop a simple 3-dimensional geometric model of the STS that can be used in 
biomechanical simulations of brain herniation. Ideally, the cerebral hemispheres should fit tightly into both 
halves of the STS with minimal volume at the subdural and subarachnoid spaces. Under this condition, the 
dimensions of the cerebral hemispheres can be approximated by those of the STS model, obviating the need 
of creating another object to represent the skull. Boundary conditions, such as deformation or pressure loads, 
can be directly applied to our model. We can model SFH by immobilizing the falx cerebri (Area 8 in Fig. 1) 
while allowing brain movement at the SFS (Area 6). Similarly, we can model TTH by allowing free brain 
movement at the TI but limiting brain movement along the equatorial surface at other parts of the basal 
surface.
5. Conclusion 
Based on CT craniometry, we have constructed a simple geometric model of the supratentorial space for 
simulating brain herniation. Having a volume close to that of a female adult, this model can be used in 
biomechanical studies.
