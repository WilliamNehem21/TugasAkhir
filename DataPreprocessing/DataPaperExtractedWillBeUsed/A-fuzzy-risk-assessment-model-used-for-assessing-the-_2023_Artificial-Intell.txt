African swine fever (ASF) is a contagious and lethal hemorrhagic disease with a high case fatality rate. Since 2007,
ASF has been spreading into many countries, especially in Europe and Asia. Given that there is no effective vaccine
and treatment to deal with ASF, prevention is an important way for a country to avoid the effects of the virus.
Australia is currently ASF-free but the disease has been reported in many neighboring countries, such as
Indonesia, Timor-Leste, and Papua New Guinea. Therefore, it is necessary for Australia to maintain hyper-
vigilance to prevent the ASF introduction. In this paper, we propose the use of fuzzy concepts to establish a
fuzzy risk assessment model to predict the ASF introduction risk in Australia. From the analysis, the international
passengers (IP) and international import trade (IIT) are concluded as the two main ASF introduction factors
based on transmission features and past research. From the established fuzzy risk assessment model based on
the analysis of the 2019 and 2020 data, the risks of ASF introduction into Australia are considered to be low.
The model further deduced that the Asian region was the major source of potential risks. Finally, in order to val-
idate the effectiveness of the established fuzzy risk assessment model, the qualitative data from the Department
for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs of the United Kingdom was used. From the validation results, it has shown
that the results were consistent when the same data is adopted, and thus proved that the functionality of the
established fuzzy risk assessment model for assessing the risk in Australia.

1. Introduction
African swine fever (ASF) is a transmittable disease and seriously
threatens swine health. It can cause hemorrhagic fever with a high fatal-
ity rate, which could sometimes be almost 100% in domestic and wild
pigs. This means that if ASF cause an outbreak, a huge damage could
be created to the pig industry and the economy of a country
(Sánchez-Cordón et al., 2018). For instance, the breeding stock in
China had decreased by 40% due to the ASF epidemic in 2018 (Huang,
2020), and the price of pork has signiﬁcantly increased while the Con-
sumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 4%. In recent years, ASF had spread
quickly in many countries. In 2007, ASF (genotype II) was ﬁrst reported
in Georgia. After that, ASF was spread from Georgia to the Caucasus and
then to the European continent in just a few years (EFSA Panel on
Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) et al., 2019). Since 2014, the infec-
tion has spread to Eastern, Central, and Western Europe, including
Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Latvia, Czech Republic, Romania, Hungary,
Bulgaria, and Belgium (Chenais et al., 2019; Ito et al., 2020). In Septem-
ber 2020, Germany has conﬁrmed the ﬁrst case of ASF (Sauter-Louis
et al., 2021). In terms of timeline and geographic location, ASF had
spread to Western Europe from Eastern Europe. Asia has not reported
any ASF cases before 2018. However, the ﬁrst ASF case appeared in
the city of Shenyang, Liaoning province in August 2018 (Zhao et al.,
2019). Since then, ASF had transmitted to many Asian countries and re-
gions, including Mongolia, South Korea, Vietnam, Philippines, Laos,
Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Timor-Leste, and Papua
New Guinea (Mighell and Ward, 2021; Food and Agriculture
Organisation of the United Nations [FAO], 2022). ASF appears to have
followed the pandemic trend, and it may spread to more countries
(Ito et al., 2020).
One way to avoid ASF outbreak for a country is to investigate the ASF
transmission pathways. ASF transmission has many pathways, involv-
ing feral pigs, domestic pigs and pig products, and soft ticks of the
genus Ornithodoros (Chenais et al., 2019). Humans are recognised as
being responsible for long distance virus transmission (Chenais et al.,
2019; Rocque et al., 2011). For instance, in March 2017, an ASF outbreak
was recorded in Irkutsk, Russia, and soon, the virus spread thousands of
kilometers into Europe.Another recent example is the Timor-Leste

outbreak situation (Lu et al., 2020), where its outbreak points were
2000 km from the nearest outbreak. International travelers and trade
are two important human activity pathways for the introduction of
the virus into ASF-free countries. De La Rocque et al. (2011) considered
that the development of international travel and trade has increased the
risk of the spread of various infectious diseases. According to Ito et al.
(2020), there is a negligible risk via feral pig and vehicle movements
but there is a risk posed by pork bring into the countries by travelers.
Ito et al. (2020) suggested that the pork products in international air
passengers' luggage (PPAP) could be a route that ASF introduce into
ASF-free country. Jurado et al. (2019a, 2019b) shared similar opinion.
Central News Agency [CAN] (2019) reported a packet of pork was de-
tected to contain positive ASF virus on February 19, 2019 at Taipei
Songshan Airport. It was similar in South Korea, there were pork prod-
ucts detected with Chinese passengers in 2018 (Kim et al., 2019).
Sugiura et al. (2020) also reported that illegal pork products brought
into Japan by international travelers was on the rise, and this could
lead to ASF entering Japan. Therefore, PPAP has been proven to be a po-
tential route for the spread of ASF across borders. Apart from PPAP,
transport-associated routes (TAR) is also a route of ASF introduction
into virus free territories, most of those were related to transport for in-
ternational travel and import trade (Mur et al., 2012).As an example,
contaminated pork and other pig products from international transport
had introduced ASF to some ASF-free countries, such as Georgia
(Beltrán-Alcrudo et al., 2008).
Jurado et al. (2019a, 2019b)’s quantitative model showed the prob-
ability of ASF introduction was related to the weight (kg) of PPAP
brought into the region and the probability of PPAP being contaminated
with ASF. This study also showed that the size of these two data was re-
lated to the number of visitors and the passengers' country of origin. Ac-
cording to the OIE-WAHIS (2021) and Jurado et al. (2019a, 2019b)’s
research, the countries where ASF has been reported were deﬁned as
ASF high-risk. A similar principle was adopted for the variables of TAR
from Mur et al. (2012)’s model. The level of ASF introduction risk by
TAR was affected by the cargo ships originating from ASF-infected coun-
tries. In addition, 90% of global trade is by sea freight (TFG, 2020). There-
fore, the larger the import trade could lead to a higher amount of
shipping, which could also increase the risk of ASF introduction. It also
means that the greater the proportion of passengers and imports from
ASF high-risk countries, the greater the risk of ASF introduction.
Building a risk assessment model on ASF can play an important role
in the national bio-security. A mathematical model is an effective tool
for the prediction of the infection spread (Bhuju et al., 2020). Quantita-
tive models were established for the prediction of the risk of ASF intro-
duction (Ito et al., 2020; Jurado et al. (2019a, 2019b); Mur et al., 2012).
However, the data collection standards are different between the
country's statistical bureaus. Many types of data could be difﬁcult to
ﬁnd, such as the annual weight of pork products by passengers, the pos-
sibility of passengers carrying pork products. On the other hand, due to
the lack of reliable data, many inferred probabilities are not accurate,
which seriously affects the accuracy of the quantitative models. For ex-
ample, Ito et al. (2020) mentioned that many farmers sell infected pigs
with ASF, which has a direct effect on the risk assessment of the pork
products. In addition, the models mentioned in Andraud et al. (2021)
and Schettino et al. (2021)’s studies may not be appropriate to be ap-
plied in all countries. As shown, these models are developed for use in
inland countries such as Romania and Kazakhstan. Thus, most of the
land ASF risk introduction factors, such as truck transport and wild
boar, are not necessary to be taken into consideration. In addition,
Schettino et al. (2021) studied national districts ranking based on ASF
outbreak risk factors rather than risk assessment of ASF introduction
into their countries. The directions of evaluation are different from
that of the island countries. Given the different factors for consideration
and the availabilities of the data required, it is difﬁcult to use any
existing risk assessment models directly for assessing the introduction
risk for Australia.
Although Australia is still free of ASF, there is still a risk that the virus
could be introduced into the country. Since 2007, in addition to the
trend of ASF covering Europe to the West, there is also a trend of the
ASF invading the Asia-Paciﬁc region to the south (Fig. 1), meaning
very close to Australia geographically. In fact, Mighell and Ward
(2021) made similar prediction that ASF is likely to enter Australia in
the next few years. However, in order to continue modelling and
assessing the risk factors, it is necessary to build a ﬂexible and versatile
risk assessment model that can provide insights of the factors. This will
enable Australia to improve the prediction, prevention and other mea-
sures to maintain its ASF-free status. Therefore, in this work, we en-
deavor to establish a new model using fuzzy logic for the assessment
of the introduction risk of ASF into Australia.
In medicine and biology ﬁelds, many concepts are uncertain or fuzzy
(Massad et al., 1999). Massad et al. (1999) mentioned that there are
several levels of uncertainty in, in epidemiology of infections. For exam-
ple, poor public health conditions could lead to an increased spread of
infectious diseases. However, the standard of “poor” is vaguely deﬁned,
but somehow being able to be processed by human using logical reason-
ing. Human experts normally use such vaguely deﬁned terms for deci-
sion making. In this context, many ASF introduction risk factors, such
as PPAP and, TAR, are difﬁcult to be quantiﬁed accurately for assessing
the ASF introduction risk. Therefore, this paper has adopted a new es-
tablished model by using fuzzy concepts to deal with unclear, incom-
plete or ambiguous data. Fuzzy logic can handle the types of
incomplete and uncertain information data (Zadeh, 1975). Fuzzy logic
is different from classic logic which is dualistic that can be classiﬁed as
true or false only (Shapiro and Kouri Kissel, 2018). However, fuzzy
logic is used to deal with the concept of partially true or degree between
the ‘totally true’ and ‘totally false’, and an effective way to handle the un-
certainty and imprecise data (Zadeh, 1988; Zadeh, 2008). Massad et al.
(1999) suggested that fuzzy logic is an effective tool to create rules for
modelling the prevention of infections spread. Recently, fuzzy logic
has been introduced in many models of infections. Arji et al. (2019)
showed that the fuzzy logic model had been widely applied in the diag-
nosis infectious diseases, such as dengue fever, hepatitis and tuberculo-
sis. Bhuju et al. (2020) used fuzzy approach to analyses the transmission
dynamics of dengue. Issa et al. (2021) developed a risk model to evalu-
ate COVID-19 transmission by fuzzy logic. Besides able to handle incom-
plete and vaguely deﬁned variables, fuzzy rule based system can also
provide human understandable fuzzy rules, which means that the as-
sessment can be traced and understandable by human. Therefore,
fuzzy system has been selected as the method to establish the new
risk assessment model for Australia in this paper. The methodology pre-
sented in this paper can easily be used to build similar risk assessment
model with adaption to the factors and availability of data for different
countries.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Data collection & tool
The ﬁrst step in building the ASF introduction risk assessment model
for Australia is to source for the available data that can contribute to the
factors used in the model. The data of international tourism and total
imports of goods, by source country was gathered from the Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS, 2020) and the World Tourism Barometer
[UNWTO] (2020; 2021). The ﬁgures of international passengers of air-
line by uplift country was acquired from the Bureau of Infrastructure
and Transport Research Economics (BITRE, 2019; BITRE, 2020). The
countries ranking and others information of import values were ac-
quired from the Ports Australia and the International Trade Centre
(Internatinal Trade Central [ITC], 2020). The list of countries with the
ASF situation was from OIE-World Animal Health Information database
interface (WAHIS, 2021).

2.2. Fuzzy model
2.2.1. Fuzzy variables
The fuzzy risk assessment model is constructed using the MATLAB
R2020b software. According to previous research (Jurado et al.
(2019a, 2019b); Ito et al., 2020; Mur et al., 2012; De La Rocque
et al., 2011), and the location of Australia, international passengers
(IP) and international import trade (IIT) have been deﬁned as the
two major factors to be considered for assessing the ASF virus intro-
duction to Australia. With pork products carried by IP being one of
the ASF introduction risks, the number of IP is an important contrib-
uting factor. As mentioned earlier, the ASF introduction risk is related
to shipping. While independent statistics on maritime transport
from Australia open public data is not available, and given that 98%
of Australian international trade is via sea freight according to the
Ports Australia. It means that the number of the IIT is related to that
of the freight, and in turn to ASF introduction risk. Thus, IP and IIT
are two variables used to build this model. However, there are
some factors which could also affect IP and IIT (Ito et al., 2020;
Jurado et al. (2019a, 2019b); Mur et al., 2012). This could suggest
that the model can be structured into hierarchical manner using
two layers as shown in Fig. 2. Kamthan and Singh (2020) proposed
the multiple-input single-output system which was suitable for this
paper. A system is divided into several subsystems, each subsystem
has speciﬁc variables, rules and membership functions. After that, it
is hierarchically connected to obtain a single output. The two vari-
ables, IP and IIT will then become the variables in the upper layer. Ac-
cording to previous research (Ito et al., 2020; Jurado et al. (2019a,
2019b); Mur et al., 2012) and the publicly available information
(World Animal Health Information database interface [WAHIS],
2021; TFG, 2020), the annual number of international passengers,
import amount, and those percentage from high risk countries
could affect annual risk value from IP and IIT. Therefore, IP and IIT
are respectively affected by the two variables in the upper layer.
The annual number of passengers, percentage of that from ASF high
risk countries, and the annual amount of international import and
percentage of that with ASF high risk countries will be investigated
in the ﬁrst layer (Fig. 2).
2.2.2. Membership functions and fuzzy sets
The next step in building the fuzzy risk assessment model for
Australia is to deﬁne the fuzzy membership functions. There are three
commonly used fuzzy membership functions, which are Gaussian, Trap-
ezoid and Triangular (Loan et al., 2014). The domain is deﬁned to ‘X', and
all elements are denoted ‘x', where x ∊ X. In order to model the ambigu-
ity, fuzzy uses the range [0,1] to replace the crisp set (0,1) to describe
the degree of truth for elements belonging to the fuzzy set (Zadeh
et al., 1996). According to the previous research, triangular membership
function was often used in other type risk assessment models (Issa et al.,
2021). In this paper, we have also adopted the triangular membership

Fig. 2. The structure of the fuzzy risk assessment model. It includes two layers, and there
are four input variables in the ﬁrst layers. IP represents international passengers (IP)
and IIT is the international import trade (IIT).

function. Based on the characteristics of the variable, the range of mem-
bership function is set to [0,100] in this model to align to the range of
percentage, which is between 0 and 100%.
In order to be consistent, the membership function ranges of IP and
IIT are also set from 0 to 100. The number of passengers is obtained from
the international tourist arrivals-country rankings (World Tourism
Barometer [UNWTO], 2020). Since the highest point was always under
90 million in recent decades, 100 million is set to be the upper limit.
Thus, the range is set between 0 and 100 million and corresponds to
the range from 0 to 100. The range of import was set in a similar man-
ner. According to WTO data, the import value of the United State and
China are much higher than any other countries. If their import amounts
are set as the upper limit, it may affect the effect of the model. Therefore,
10 billion is set as the upper limit. Countries with more than 10 billion
are usually only China and the United States. However, in the model,
the upper limit is set at 10 billion and it will set to 10 billion when the
ﬁgure exceeds 10 billion.
In this paper, the membership function is deﬁned as μ(x).
The domain is X, A is the subset of X, the range is from xa to xb, μA(x) is
the membership function of A, and their relationship is shown below:

Based on past similar research and common fuzzy set partition rules
(Issa et al., 2021; Mandal et al., 2012; Mur et al., 2012) the variable is di-
vided into 5 fuzzy sets (Fig. 3) to deﬁne the output and input level (very
low (VL), low (L), medium (M), high (H), very high (VH)) (Table 1). In
this paper, ﬁve fuzzy sets cover the entire universe of discourse by
using an equidistant distribution method (Fig. 3). Five risk levels are
used to deﬁne the risk level of the assessment as shown in Table 1.
After which, the transitions from one risk level to another are designed
using fuzzy overlapping to create the fuzzy membership functions as
shown in Fig. 3.
2.2.3. Fuzzy rules and veriﬁcation
In this research, we have adopted the Mamdani inference system,
and the structure is:
Rᵢ: if x1 is A1
ᵢ and x2 is A2
ᵢ …xn is An
ᵢ then u is Uᵢ.
Rᵢ represents the i-th fuzzy rule. A is the fuzzy set of the input
variable, x. U is the fuzzy set of output variable, u. The Mandani
inference system is used as it is easier for human to understand the
decision made.
In this paper, linguistic variables are adopted to replace the mathe-
matical formulas, which is more suitable for inference uncertain con-
cepts for human (Zadeh, 1975). The introduction risk is affected by
two factor variables, IP and IIT. Until now, there are no commonly
agreed standard to deﬁne IP and IIT. Therefore, we could not acquire
speciﬁc data to build the model. Thus, the paper uses common behavior
and similar model experience, while literature on other infections was
used to deﬁne the rules (Issa et al., 2021). Apart from that, it is assumed
that two input parameters IP and IIT are equal to p and t, and the output
which is the risk degree of ASF introduction into Australia (RAM), is
equal to j. The Mandani rule relationship could be shown as follows:
If IP is p and IIT is t, then RAM is j.
In this paper, the matrix approach is used to deﬁne the fuzzy rules.
The abscissa is represented by p (IP) and the ordinate is represented
by t (IIT). According to the customized grade standard, the grade
range of the rectangular area can be determined. For example, very
low is from 0 to 20. Then, the upper limit of the very low is 20. Therefore,
the very low range of the rectangular area is in the range between 0 and
400 (Fig. 4). Similarly, the rectangular area range of each level could be
obtained (Table 3). After that, the median of each degree of the horizon-
tal and vertical coordinates is used to determine the fuzzy rules by the
level range of the rectangular area (Fig. 4). For instance, when IT is
low, IIP is medium, and the degree of the output can then be inferred.
The medians of low and medium degrees are 30 and 50 respectively
and 30 times 50 is 1500. According to Table 3, 1500 is located in the
low range. Thus, when IT is low and IIP is medium, and the output is
low. Apart from that, Issa et al. (2021)’s model also provide similar
methodology for building the fuzzy rules.
Next, validation is carried to validate the established fuzzy risk as-
sessment model. Random ﬁgures are entered into the model. Occasion-
ally some outputs turn out to be unreasonable. For instance, in some
input range, it appears that although the input is increased but the out-
put is ﬁxed or decreased. This means that some linguistic variables of
the output part are so similar such that the assessment of the model is
misguided. Therefore, a small number of rules are revised and opti-
mized with reference to the design methodology in Issa et al. (2021)’s
model. The rules can be described as follows:
If IP is low AND IIT is low, then the risk of ASF introduction (RAI) is
low.
The rules could be stated in the matrix as shown in Table 2. The rules
of other layers also adopted the same method. In total, the number of
fuzzy rules in this model is 75. After the rule bases are formulated, the

The data of annual international visitors to Australia, the annual per-
centage of ﬂight lines by countries, the Australia's import value per year
and the proportion of the import value by countries are used (see
Table 3). The two outputs of the ﬁrst layer are then acquired, i.e. the
results of the risk level of IP and IIT, which are entered in the next
layer as the inputs (Fig. 2).
In this paper, the data of the last two years (2019 and 2020) are used
and the trend were analyzed by comparing the two-year results.
2.4. Model validation
In order to assess the validity of the model, other assessment results
can be used to validate the functionality of the established fuzzy risk as-
sessment model. According to the Department for Enviorment Food and
Rural Affairs of United kingdom government (2018), a qualitative
method was used to assess the risk of ASF introduction to the United
Kingdom which was also divided into ﬁve risk levels (i.e. very low,
low, medium, high and very high). DEFRA referred to a variety of data
from other European countries and their own country, such as trade
amount, pig import amount. Based on the survival time of ASFV in dif-
ferent biological environments, the ASF epidemiology and the outbreak
situation in Europe, it calculated the risk level of the ASF impact for the
UK through different pathways. One parameter of their method, which
is transport is similar to the IIT variable of the established fuzzy risk as-
sessment model. Thus, the number of United Kingdom import and the
percentage of import value are used in our model (Internatinal Trade
Central [ITC], 2020). After that, the risk levels generated by the two
methods are compared.

3. Results
3.1. The analysis for ASF-introduction to Australia
According to the statistic of Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS]
(2020) and World Tourism Barometer [UNWTO] (2020), the ﬁgure of
the international tourism to Australia is 9.47 million in 2019. However,
the ﬁgure has decreased 80.7% to 1.8 million in 2020 due to the COVID-
19 pandemic. In addition, data from BITRE (2019 & 2020) show that the
ﬂight percentage of ASF high risk countries accounted for 28.8% and 24%
in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The amount of Australia's import
were 214 and 202 billion dollars in 2019 and 2020, respectively
(Internatinal Trade Central [ITC], 2020). The probability of import
amount from ASF high risk countries (World Animal Health
Information database interface [WAHIS], 2021) are 44.9% and 47.0%
after calculation based on merchandise imports sheet of Australian
Bureau of Statistics [ABS] (2020). Data of the ﬁrst layer variables are
showed in Table 4.
After inferring the ﬁrst layer, the risk values of IP are 19.9 (2019) and
11.6 (2020) and those of IIT are 24.7 (2019) and 24.8 (2020). All outputs
of ﬁrst layer are then entered to the second layer as inputs. The ﬁnal out-
puts, i.e. the risk of ASF introduction to Australia, are therefore 24.4
(2019) and 21.3 (2020) (Table 5). All of the outputs indicated low risk
(L) from the fuzzy risk assessment model. Thus, the risk of ASF introduc-
tion in Australia is low risk (L). The result is obtained as can be traced
back to the ﬁrst layer of the risk assessment model structure (Fig. 2).
The number of tourists, 9.47 million and 1.8 million, input into the
model belonged to the VL and the percentage, 28.8% and 24% are also
belonged to the L. To better understand which fuzzy rule is used to
infer such decision, the following fuzzy rule can be observed.
If the annual tourist amount is VL and the percentage is L, then the IP
is VL.
For another part, the values of IP are 19.9 and 11.6, both of them are
considered as VL. It is similar to the calculation of the IIT, the import
amounts are 214 and 202 billion (L). The ﬁgure of percentage, 44.9%
and 47.0%, belonged to M. Therefore, the fuzzy rule triggered is as
follow.
If the import amount is L and the percentage is M, then the IP is L.
Thus, both of the ﬁgures, IIT are L (24.7, 24.8).
The rule used is then:
If IP is VL AND IIT is L, then the risk of ASF introduction (RAI) is VL.
As a result, this will provide the ﬁnal value to indicate the risk level of
the ASF introduction into Australia.
3.2. The result of model validation
The ﬁgure of the United Kingdom import amount was 692 billion
dollars in 2019 (World Trade Organization [WTO], 2020) and the per-
centage of import amount from ASF high risk countries was 47.6% (trad-
ing economics). After putting the data into the established fuzzy risk
assessment model, the output (i.e. risk level) obtained is 46.7. It belongs
to the medium risk level. According to the prediction result of
Department for Enviorment Food and Rural Affairs of United kingdom
government (2018), the risk of transport was medium. The two predic-
tion results are basically the same. Therefore, the prediction of this fuzzy
risk assessment model has been validated.
4. Discussion
4.1. Results analysis
In this paper, the prediction results based on 2019 and 2020 data are
due to that, the data of 2019 was highest than past and could represent
the highest Australia level in normal years. For compare and analyze the
trend after COVID-19 epidemic, 2020 data is cited.
The output value of this model is affected by the second layer input
variables (Fig. 2). However, the second layer inputs are the outputs of
the ﬁrst layer. Those are also affected by the ﬁrst layer inputs. Thus,
the ﬁnal output of the model is ultimately affected by the ﬁrst layer.
However, this presented an opportunity to understand which part of
the model provided the effect of the ﬁnal prediction. The advantage of
using fuzzy modelling is the ability to be traced back by using human
understandable fuzzy rules. The Australia risk degree is low (24.4 and
21.3), which is due to that some Australia's values of the ﬁrst layer in-
puts are located in the low or very low degree in the world, such as an-
nual import amount and annual international tourist amount. In
addition, the IP is from 19.9 to 11.6 but is the ﬁnal output just from
24.4 to 21.3. The drop is not obvious as IP because IIT is relative stable,
according to one of the rules as follow:
If IP is VL AND IIT is L, then the risk of ASF introduction (RAI) is VL.
However, both of the IP values belong to VL, and IIT values belong to
L but both of the ﬁnal results belong to the L. Although the value (19.9)
of IP (2019) belongs to VL but it is very close to the next degree (L). In
other words, the attribution degree is closer to the L level than most
VL level values, this affected the ﬁnal output. IP (2020) decrease causes
the ﬁnal result decrease but the ﬁnal result is also located to L. It may be
due to that the intersection and the boundary between fuzzy sets is
large and unclear than those between crisp sets. Thus, the degree loca-
tion of output may not be completely corresponding to the fuzzy rules.
In our results, the risks of TAR are similar between 2019 and 2020
but the ﬁgure of IP has signiﬁcantly decreased from 19.9 to 11.6. The
major reason is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to huge decrease
of international tourists. To prevent COVID-19 spread, most countries
have adopted lockdown, widely restricted international travel (Sam
et al., 2020). World Tourism Barometer [UNWTO] (2020) reported
that the international tourism had reduced by 74% or 1 billion. It
means that, the risk factors brought by passengers have decreased,
and the major risk will be due to the international trade in the next
few years. However, international tourism will eventually recover.
Behsudi (2020) suggests that international travel may return to the
level of 2019 by 2023. The risk will increase again and our model will

provide the direction for such ASF risk from the model. In addition, the
major ASF risk will be coming from Asia. According to the data of the im-
port with high ASF risk countries (Table 3), three of the top ﬁve coun-
tries are Asian countries, China, Malaysia, South Korea and the three
Asian countries account for about 80% of all high-risk countries. In addi-
tion, the top four ﬂights amount from high risk countries or regions are
all from Asia. These include China, Indonesia, Hong Kong (China) and
Malaysia (Table 3) which altogether account for almost all the high-
risk countries. Coincidentally, the other papers also predicted that the
introduction risk from Asian countries is high. Ito et al. (2020) suggested
that China and Vietnam could be the top countries with highest ASF in-
troduction risk into Japan. Jurado et al. (2019a, 2019b) suggests that
most of the ASF-introduction risk into the United States is related to
ﬂights from China and Hong Kong (China). Therefore, it could be con-
cluded that Asia will be the highest risk region of ASF introduction
into Australia.
The model is depended on the available data and the features of ASF
cross-border spread to provide the corresponding variables. By compar-
ing with the inference of the Department for Enviorment Food and Rural
Affairs of United kingdom government (2018), the result of this fuzzy
model can be validated. However, the fuzzy model objectively infers
input values based on the rule base. The size of input represents the ob-
jective conditions of the tested country. In reality, high risk does not
necessarily mean that it will happen, and low risk does not mean it
will never happen. For example, in terms of the number of international
tourists and international trade, the United States may be a high-risk
country. However, until now, the United States is still ASF-free. Japan,
like Australia, is an island country but Japan's import trade is much
larger than Australia, and it is closer to high-risk areas such as China
and South Korea. Japan is also ASF-free. It shows that the spread of
ASF may be also related to others factor such as diagnosis level, public
health conditions, and economic level. For example, since ASF outbreak
in China in 2018, it has spread to 15 Asian countries by October 2021.
However, apart from South Korea, the remaining countries are all not
high-income countries (Hamadeh et al., 2021). Therefore, getting
more accurate assessment could only be achieved by gathering other
types of data. As the methodology presented in this paper, the fuzzy
risk assessment can be established and adjusted easily with any new
data or knowledge.
4.2. Fuzzy model features analysis
Fuzzy model is mostly depended on fuzzy rules to describe the rela-
tionships between fuzzy sets, and the fuzzy rules are usually expressed
in the form of IF-THEN (Zadeh, 1988; Perﬁlieva, 2006). Mamdani fuzzy
inference is a common fuzzy inference system used in many ﬁelds and is
very suitable for medical research, due to its computation efﬁciency and
can be directly interpreted (Gayathri and Sumathi, 2015). There are
three main advantages. To begin with, the use of fuzzy model is easy
to understand and ﬂexible to be build. It also provides a set of human
understandable fuzzy rules, which the results can be traced back easily
to the variables that determine the output. In addition, the model could
be easily modiﬁed or changed. The creation of fuzzy model requires the
combination of knowledge and data, and it does not require large
amount of labeled data that many machine learning techniques require.
Taking this research as an example, the data available are inconsistent
and could be different from country to country due to the unique condi-
tions of each country. If other researchers want to use the established
methodology to investigate other countries' situation or other infec-
tions, this modelling allows the adding, deletion or replacement of the
input variables by using the same principles in creating the model. Fi-
nally, fuzzy model could help to deal with uncertain or hypothetical
problems. Compared with crisp sets, fuzzy sets generally have overlap-
ping boundaries. There is overlap between adjacent fuzzy sets (Mandal
et al., 2012) to model the fuzziness between the fuzzy sets. The ability of
modelling the overlapping between the memberships as demonstrated
in this paper could model the vagueness and uncertainty better.
All models will normally have some limitations in application or de-
velopment. There are some limitations in the proposed methodology in
this paper. Firstly, the variables used in this paper is subject to the avail-
abilities of the data. For example, some of the international tourists
come to Australia by cruise ships. However, there is no information on
the nationality distribution of cruise passengers and the number of an-
nual arrivals from the Australia's statistical websites. It is good to note
that this is a limitation from the available data perspective and not a
limitation from the use of the fuzzy modelling. When any new data is
available, the steps and methodology reported in this paper that used
to establish the fuzzy risk assessment can be repeated easily. Secondly,
similar to Issa et al. (2021), the output of the fuzzy model, depend
very much on the design of the fuzzy membership. If the range of the
value is too big, the output variation could be very small when the
fuzzy membership is evenly distributed. The fuzzy model output is
also limited by the number of fuzzy memberships used in the input
and output model. Using more fuzzy membership will improve the res-
olution of the model. However, it is worth noted that with the increase
in the number of fuzzy membership (i.e. linguistics terms), the number
of fuzzy rules may increase signiﬁcantly as well, thus making the fuzzy
model more difﬁcult to be interpreted. Finally, the model is only a quan-
titative analysis and only make a risk assessment based on objective
conditions, more study will need to be done to translate the quantitative
indication of the risk.
5. Conclusion
In this study, we have built a quantitative fuzzy risk assessment
model to assess the ASF introduction risk into Australia. The contribu-
tion of this paper is two folds. Firstly, the ASF introduction risk assess-
ment model has been established using fuzzy modelling technique.
Secondly, the established model is used to provide insights of the risk
level for the ASF introduction into Australia. Our analysis is based on
the number of international tourists, import amount and the percentage
of those from high ASF risk countries. From the analysis of the data col-
lected for Australia and by using our fuzzy risk assessment model, the
following can be concluded. Australia is a low risk country to ASF intro-
duction. The risk from international tourists has shown a downward
trend between 2019 and 2020. According to the analysis for import
and ﬂight amount, the highest introduction risk will be from Asia coun-
tries. This study will help customs and other relevant departments de-
velop more effective inspection and monitoring methods to protect
Australia's biosecurity.
