Abstract 
The existing GO methodology algorithm is theoretical, and hard to solve with computer. In this paper, we research a new 
method to get the reliability of system based on GO methodology. According to some properties of the operators in GO 
chart, GO chart can be transformed into series structure, then the minimal path sets are induced based on Enumeration 
method from first operator to last one. It is very convenient for computer to calculate the system reliability with the new 
method based on minimal path sets. The case study indicates the method is suitable for practical engineering, which can 
be used to possess the quantitative analysis of complex GO methodology models.

1. Introduction  
The GO methodology is an available method of system reliability analysis. Different with some other 
modeling method, such as static FTA, it is a success-oriented one and mainly be used to solve the problem of 
systems with multiple states and time-sequential signals. This method was first introduced from Kaman 
Science Company of USA in the middle of 1960s, and had been used to analyze the safety and reliability of 
weapon system. In the early 1980s, Go methodology had got the further improvement and development.

Meanwhile, on the basis of GO methodology two scholars developed the GO-FLOW methodology, which is 
more suitable for reliability analysis of phased-mission systems and dynamic systems [3-5]. 
In the early 1980s, Institute for Standardization of Nuclear Industry first introduced GO methodology in 
China. In recent years, GO methodology has developed rapidly in theory and practical method, such as the 
probability accumulation algorithm and probability quantitative analysis method with common cause failures. 
By far, GO methodology has been used to analyze or assess the reliability of many practical engineering 
systems, such as nuclear power plant power system, natural gas pipes system and aviation electronic 
equipment. Although GO methodology has many advantages, the existing algorithm is theoretical, and hard to 
solve with computer, which makes it difficult to apply and popularize in complex engineering systems. 
Therefore, the GO methodology for computer solving becomes the bottle neck to generalize the method [2]. 
In this paper, a new algorithm is provided. First, the GO chart is transformed into series structure. Based on 
the minimal path sets. Last, it can directly deduce the minimal path sets and calculate the value of system 
reliability. It will simplify the programming and decrease the computational consumption. 
2. Algorithm of GO Methodology 
Zhupei Shen had presented two algorithms of GO methodology [2]. 
compute the signal state probability, then using combination and simplification to obtain minimum path sets 
and cut sets. However, if the number of operators rises, the number of state combination will explode. 
The other is Probability Accumulation algorithm, which can be used to compute the state probability of the 
oreover, the algorithm 
can get the minimal cuts of the two-state system with quantificational computing [5]. 
2.1. Path Sets and Minimal Path Sets.  
The system reliability may also be determined using minimal path sets. A path is a set of components 
whose functioning ensures that the system functions. A minimal path is one in which all the components 
within the set must function for the system to function [6]. 
2.2. GO Chart Processing 
GO methodology has defined seventeen kinds of operators, denoted with the type of 1-17. In the GO 
methodology, every operator represent a specific component, the signal-flows represent connections between 
the operators. The operators represent specific function and the input and output signals have to obey the 
operation rules.  
Although GO methodology owns seventeen kinds of operators, only ten of them are usually used. We 
denote them by set A, A={1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}
, the type 2, 10 
and 11 operators are logical operators and they represent logical relation of multiple input signals, others are 
functional operators. The logical 
so 
the logical operators are not included in the minimal path set. 
From the set of function operator, type 6, 7 and 8 operators have two input signals, when we deduce the 
minimal path sets by Enumeration method, first, put the second input signal in series with the main input 
signal. Then, delete the same operators between second input signal and main input signal. Then, getting a 
new chart where type 6, 7 and 8 operators have only one input signal. From Figure 1, we know type 1, 3, and 
5 operators have only one input signal. These 
be possessed. 
370  
 Yong Chen et al. /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  368 – 374 
 
In the set of logical operator, these three kinds of operator only represent the logical relationship among the 
signals. Generally, each logical operator has at least two or more than two input signals. When deduce the 
minimal path sets, we need processing the logical operators. If GO chart include the type 2 operator, according 
to the property of OR gate, add the operator OR gate and the operators after OR gate to N signals before OR 
gate. If GO chart include the type 10 operator, let N signals before AND gate become one signal, after it delete 
the same operators in these N signals. If GO chart include the type 11 operator, let the operators which 
connect with the K-out-of-M gate become in series with each other by K operator, So we have 
�
� �
 kinds of 
combination, and support the operators  forward of these 
�
� �
 kinds combination. 
If a signal is connected to two or more operators as the input signal (or one operator have two or more than 
two output signals), then this signal is defined as a shared signal. When GO chart has a shared signal, copy all 
the operators behind this operator onto the shared signals.

3. Case Study 
3.1. System Definition 
Water supply system as example has two states: the success and the failure. This system has one water 
source and two waterways, each way includes an electric pump, a check valve and two control valves which 
are in parallel and always closed. So every waterway has two water supply export, and the system have four 
water supply export. Electric pump on each waterway has its own power. Only the power state is success, the 
pump can work, two control valves in each waterway are controlled by own control signal. Only the control 
signal is success, the control valve can open. The successful state is that at least two water supply export 
successful. Figure 1 shows the water supply system principle diagram.

3.2. Establishing Reliability Model with GO Methodology 
The GO methodology Model is easy established based on water supply system functional diagram. First, 
according to the function of water supply system components, corresponding type of operators represent 
specific components. For example, water source is the input of the system, which is represented by type 5 
operator. Similarly, powers and drive signals are also represented by type 5 operator. The electric pump needs 
the control signal to operator normally, which is represented by type 6 operator. Here, the primary input signal 
is from water source, and the secondary control signal is the output of the power. Similarly, control valves 
must operate upon receiving the control signals, which are also represented by type 6 operator. The check 
valves are two states components, which we use operator 1. 
For water supply system, at least two water supply export are successful, then the water supply is 
successful, this logical relationship is represented by type 11 operator. Figure 2 shows the GO chart of this 
water supply system.

The first number in the operators of the GO chart represents the type of operators, the second number 
represents the numbering of operators, and the numbers on the signal line mean the numbering of signals. 
The input of the system consists of the water power, the power and the drive signal sources, which are 
represented by Type 5 operator, the check valves are represented by Type 1 operator. The electric pumps and 
control valves are represented by Type 6 operator. 
3.3. Deducing the Minimal Path Sets on Go Chart 
From Figure 2, the system starts from operator 5-1, ends with operator 11-14. This Go chart is too complex 
to deduce the minimal path sets directly, it should be dealt with, form the last operator to the first one. First, 
operator 11-14 is a 2-out-of-4 gate, let the four operators which connect with operator 11-14 in series by two, 
so there are 
2
4
C kinds of combination, and the 6 kinds of combination are 6-6 and 6-7,6-6 and 6-12,6-6 and 6-
13,6-12 and 6-13,6-7 and 6-12,6-7 and 6-13.  
Next, from Figure 2, the operator 6-7 connect with operator 11-14, then find the operator which is the input 
of operator 6-7 based on GO chart. According to the figure 2, find that operator 5-5 and 1-4 are all connected 
with operator 6-7. Similarly, operator 5-5 and 1-4 are the input of operator 6-6, and in Figure 2, operator 6-6 is 
connected with operator 6-7. Operator 5-
Operator 6-3 is connected with operator 6-6 and behind operator 6-6, we find operator 6-3 has two input signal 
5-1 and 5-2. Figure 3 is the one of the minimal path of the water supply system.

Similarly, we deduce the rest of 5 kinds of combination. At last, according to the operator type, we remove 
all logical operators and get the final minimal path sets in Table 1, and Figure 4 shows the final Go chart.

4.Conclusions 
In this paper, we propose a new method to calculate the reliability of GO methodology. According to 
logical relationship of the operators in GO chart, we transform GO chart into series model, then get the 
minimal path sets based on enumeration method from first operator to last one. This new algorithm is suitable 
for computer aided solving. The application of the case indicates the method can be used in practical 
engineering, which can efficiently deal with the quantitative analysis of complex GO methodology models.
