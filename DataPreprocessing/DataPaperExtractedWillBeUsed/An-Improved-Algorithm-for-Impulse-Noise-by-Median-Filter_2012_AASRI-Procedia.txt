Abstract 
This paper proposes an algorithm to improve image processing for impulse noise by median filter. Isolate noise points in 
an image are detected by way of indiscernibility on rough sets. The improved algorithm enhances the detection capability 
of the single element of an image. Impulse noise is removed by a method of improvement of choice of threshold and 
filtering templates of median filter. Experiment simulation showed that the method of image enhancement proposed is 
superior to the traditional method in effectively improving image degradation and image clarity.

1. Introduction 
A principal thrust of image processing is the utilization of methodologies that facilitate knowledge 
processing on state-of-the-art scientific exploration�manufacture, transportation, communication, etc.. There 
are urgent needs for developing a new method of improvement quality of degradation image.  
Image degradation is generally caused by Gaussian noise and impulse noise. For example, images 
collected with a camera contain Gaussian noise due to the characteristics of physical devices and electronic 
systems and pictures taken contain pulses noise caused by the external environment interference.  
Denoising of image is realized by way of image filtering which can be divided into spatial domain, 
frequency domain and wavelet domain [1-3]. The most common spatial domain filtering has two kinds of 
linear filters and nonlinear filters. Linear filters include linear average filter, inverse gradient weighted filter, 
etc. Nonlinear filter is mainly used by median filter to remove impulse noise [4-7].

Choice of threshold and filtering templates of median filter to determine impulse noise is key operation.  
This article is intended to improve image processing for median filter of impulse noise. Isolate noise points in 
an image are detected by idea of indiscernibility on rough sets. Impulse noise is removed by a method of 
improvement of choice of threshold and filtering templates of median filter.

3 An Improved Algorithm for Impulse Noise By Median Filtering 
Median filter is constructed with an odd number of points of a sliding filter window, the window in the 
gray value of each point the value of the centre of the window instead of the gray value of pixels. Specific 
operation is as follows: 
1� Take a 
m� m
 window template, m is odd. Graph window template will roam a pixel position 
coinciding with the template center and read the gray value of each pixel corresponding to 
ijf  in 
the template. 
2� Gray values of all pixels from small to large order to generate monotonic data sequence� �
ijf
, and to 
find the middle of a 
� �
ijf
median
 . 
3� The value of
� �
ijf
median
is assigned to the middle of the center of the pixel corresponding to the 
template. 
The image detail ambiguity caused by linear filters and filter out glitches and grain noise can be 
overcome by this way. But for some more details (special points, lines, spire) of the image should not be used 
median filtering method. 
A threshold M is defined to judge noise in a median filter. If the difference of the centre pixel and around 
centre pixels is greater than M, then the current pixel is judged as a noise point.  
Consider as shown in figure 1 shows the templates, we will centre around 13 pixels and 24 
neighbourhood pixels, for a vector b, a definition  is given as following:

A threshold of an image of a template can be defined as: 
         
M � � ��
                                                                                                                                     (6) 
If meet �

, we can judge the current centre pixel is noise points. 
In order to improve judge impulse noise, an image of a template is divided into 8 direction as four groups, 
respectively is:

number of impulse noise is more than 18, even if the absolute difference value of around the pixel is greater 
than the threshold value, but the absolute grey value of  the centre pixel of a group of above four groups is no 
more than the threshold, it is not regarded as noise point. 
4 Experiment Results and Analysis 
An experiment simulation of image processing for impulse noise by median filter is realized by normal 
median filter� adaptive median filter�impulse noise median filter, and improved median filter in this paper 
with an image Lena of adding chili and salt noise in a 5 x5 window. In order to compare the improving image 
degradation and image clarity by method proposed in this article and with other median filter methods 
[2,4,8,10].  
The simulation results in Matlab7.8 is shown in Figure 2. Some comparison results of the signal-to-noise 
ratio are given in the Table 1.

Adaptive median filter

37.32dB 
 
It is shown that signal-to-noise ratio of an image is improved by normal median filter than linear filter, but 
the whole image edge details is lost, image vision is blurred; Adaptive threshold median filter is of obvious 
enhancement effect, but a part of edge pixel is  incorrectly judged to noise. Impulse noise median filter 
enhances image edge to become clearly. But from the noise image we can see, it is a part of wired pixel edge 
was judged to noise. The improved median filter proposed here will reduce the effect of the image edge, and 
increase the signal-to-noise ratio in effectively improving image degradation and image clarity.

5 Conclusions 
The main issue what we are interested is effective improvement of image processing for impulse noise 
by median filter. The main works completed in this paper are that a way of detection of isolate noise points in 
an image is proposed by way of indiscernibility on rough sets. A choice of threshold and filtering templates of 
median filter is suggested to remove impulse noise. An improved algorithm enhances the detection capability 
of the single element of an image. The feasibility of the proposed approaches of improvement of image 
processing for impulse noise by median filter is supported by some of examples.
