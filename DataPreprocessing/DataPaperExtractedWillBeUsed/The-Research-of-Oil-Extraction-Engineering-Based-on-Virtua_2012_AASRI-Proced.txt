information of wellbore status, and increase analysis utilization rate is the most important management 
problem which the managers face.  
With the development of information technology, oil industry also introduce virtual reality. We can make 
use of immersion, interaction, imagination which are characteristics of virtual reality to interpret earthquake 
data 3D visualization, design and optimize well location and borehole contrail of oil drilling, engineering 
design oil platform on the sea, construct reservoir model and simulate oil reservoir numerical value, create 
realistic virtual enviroment to train special operations. 
This article is an application of virtual reality used in exhibition wellbore real time and simulating 
underground operation.With this technology, we can show wellbore tool model vividly, assemble wellbore 
dynamically, simulate statues of underground reservoir and operation measures, provide visual situation of 
underground pipe column for researcher and manager to make effective decision.  
2. System framework and function analysis 
This system works in the browser/server (B/S) mode, the B/S model can increase the data sharing and 
improve the utilization rate of software, maintenance is reduced greatly. System structure is shown in figure 1.

3 The key technology of system and implementation 
3.1. 3d model built based on VR 
3d model created is justified or not is be the key to virtual reality system whether success, the outstanding 
model can give users into vivid feeling[2], the user immersed in a virtual environment, and the system response 
in time, no apparent delay's feeling. Here briefly explain the system of the applications of the modeling 
process and optimization technique. 
The modeling of the main wellhole tool is the use of geometric modeling technique, 3dsmax to simulate 
the tools from appearance. Specific modeling process as follows [3]: 
(1) The data collection, according to the tools to create model, select the texture and drawing pictures. 
(2) Determine the hierarchical structure model, through the analysis of the model, the model tree 
segmentation and separately modeling and model integration at last. The advantage of this is that improve the 
utilization rate of the model, reduce duplication of work, but also conducive to management. And 3dsmax 
also offers a hierarchical structure to organize and manage complex model. 
(3) The construction of the model. According to the model of the structure and drawings, followed by go 
up to below, by inside to outside principle, use 3dsmax step by step to provide the dots, lines, planes and 
solids, create and modify tools, to create 3d model. 
(4) Model optimization.After the built model, should remove redundant polygons and will shape the 
triangle. And deal with model and the texture and enhance the material model fidelity. 
Figure 2 shows Y443-108 (II) that is a drill style packer model. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig.2. Drill style packer model 
We use example technology, and texture mapping technology LOD technology in model optimization. In 
this project, because many tools is widely used ,so if every tool, component is to recreate, and load into 
memory to operate, it will cause great waste of resources, so it can use examples technology, the same tools in 
memory store only one instance, after translation, zoom and turn we can get other tools. The LOD is the 
technology trading space for time , in this project we constructing some details of the different hierarchy 
model, when driver the model it can automatically select the relevant details according to judge rules, so as to 
achieve the real-time model simplified, and do not affect visual result. And texture mapping technology is the

2d image digital mapping to the surface of the model, makes the number of object face reduce for the use of 
the texture and the simplified model is vivid. 
3.2. Measures simulation based on particle system 
The basic ideas of particle system is [4]: using a lot of tiny particles primitive, which have certain life cycle 
and attributes as a basic element to show irregular fuzzy object. 
Fracturing, stopping water, acidification, the cutting technology etc that used in increase production, are 
simulation the liquid like water, oil and foam. Take acidification for example, its principle is through the acid 
on the rock cementation, or space, crack formation, restore or improve the gap and fracture permeability. So 
in the simulation, we should inject acid underground, acid in the rock go on chemical reaction, and viscous 
liquid turn into bubble etc. 
Below is the definition of the acid particles data structure: 
class   particle 
{ float   p_lifetime;       // The life cycle of particles 
   int     p_type;         // The type of particles (liquid or gas) 
   float   p_color;        // Particle color 
   float   p_alpha;        // Particle transparency 
   float   x,y;            // Particle position 
   float   vx0�vy0;       // The initial velocity of particle 
   float   vx�vy ;         // The current rate of particles 
float   d;             // Particle position 
   float   xd,yd;          // Particles movement in the x, y direction  
}  
Through the particles construction and realization above, we can simulation acidification process better. In 
the system we use polygon to replace point particle, and use the texture mapping technology to make acid 
pictures map to the polygon. It can not only improve the efficiency of the draw, and can enhance the 
authenticity of the simulation. Figure 3 shows the acidification simulation result. 
3.3. Database design and inquire technology 
We design data structure according to the information organization, access method, relevance, replaceable 
treatment method[5]. Combined with production database structure, according to the needs of each module and 
the relationship between the data flow design, we determine the following several sets of data table: 
(1)3d model information Table(MODEL) 
3d model information table used to store the name of the model, the path and the corresponding tools name 
and relevant information, the system call tools model through the table data and assemble dynamically, table 
structure is shown in table 1.

(3)Development data table of oil production plant 
Oil field production data amount is large, including oil production management, underground work, 
development trends, static development, dynamic development, oil field experiment test etc, 44 tables in all, 
so we do not need a detailed list here. 
For the use of the system more convenient, we adopted in inquires dynamic form technology and fuzzy 
query technique. 
In the realization of dynamic form, we can show required field in a database to users in the form checkbox, 
users can choose interesting fields to form customization. And in the internal implementation process, user's 
choosing field is also based on multiple inquires construction data set process. The system will treat all input 
inquires "logic and" conditions or "logic or", and pass combined inquires into the bottom logical library of 
dynamic form, operate interactively by processing function of the logical library and database, eventually 
return the data that meet the conditions and show to the user in the form of form. 
If users don't remember well number, they can use fuzzy query method. Fuzzy query well number, system 
call a database to find the matching well number when users input a character from the beginning "—", this 
could be more user-friendly. In realization, system use the database fuzzy matching inquiries, basic query 
statement is: SELECT field FROM table WHERE a field Like conditions, about conditions, SQL provides 
four matching mode: 
1�% : means any zero or more characters. It can match any type and length of characters, in some cases if 
it represent chinese we need to use two (% %) [6]. 
For example SELECT * FROM [dba01] WHERE JH LIKE '% -S4%'�it will find out record that JH (well 
number) is G152-S44, G152-S443, G153-443, G154-463 which contains S4-. 
 2�_ : means any single characters. It can match any single character, it is used to limit characters length 
of the expression.  
For example SELECT * FROM [dba01] WHERE JH LIKE ' G152-S4_%'�it will find out G152-S44�
G152-S443,etc� 
194  
 Li Hui et al. /  AASRI Procedia  1 ( 2012 )  189 – 195 
3�[ ]�means one of the characters (similar to the regular expression) list in brackets. Specify a character, 
string or range, required match object is any of them. 
For example SELECT * FROM [dba01] WHERE JH LIKE ' [GZN]10'�it will inquires data that contain 
G10, Z10 and N10, rather than GZN10.  
4�[^] �means a single character not listed in the brackets. It is the same as [], but it requires that match 
object is any character but not the specified character. 
3.4. System realization 
We use 3dsmax to construct system model, after model has been created we derive model for s3d form 
with plug-in module in 3dsmax , and import s3d in the webmax for further editor, after the completion release 
into n3d at last. 
We use Visual studio.net 2008, c # language for system platform, Oracle database on the back stage. 
System operate in browser/server mode on local area network, client is browser on the front stage, users 
install 3d browser plug-in through the automatic download (or manually download), operate in the browser; 
server provide the WWW services and Oracle database service on the back stage. 
4. Conclusion 
The wellbore information dynamic processing and display system is the use of virtual reality technology to 
display 3d and manipulate, dynamically draw strata and dynamically display assignment measures. According 
to the actual application feedback, this system can provide a complete inquiry, analysis tools for engineering 
design personnel, and directly shows the problems of the various parts information, the well completion status 
and production measures and so on. It also guide the construction work in well site, help drilling crews and 
other subjects crews interact and cooperate together, and it can be used in the complex accident prevention 
treatment, real-time data analysis and decision, etc. 
The feature of this system is spatial, integration, real-time, modeling, visual. The research for 3d 
visualization technology and its software system has important significance for constructing "digital oilfield" 
and increasing our country’s oilfield information level.
