The feeding method is of great signiﬁcance for aquaculture production and cost. In recent years, research on in-
telligent feeding, a method based on ﬁsh appetite, has been trending. Few studies, however, have focused on ﬁsh
welfare issues that can result from intelligent feeding. In this study, an adaptive feeder based on a practical intel-
ligent feeding method was designed to evaluate whether this intelligent feeding method would impair ﬁsh wel-
fare compared to traditional automatic feeding. The results indicated that the amount of residual feed and size
inhomogeneity in the traditional group was signiﬁcantly higher than that in the intelligent group. The results
of the growth indicator showed that the weight gain rate (WGR) in the intelligent feeding group was signiﬁcantly
higher (30.17%) than in the traditional feeding group. Although no signiﬁcant differences were observed in the
survival rate (SR), the condition factor (CF) and the hepatosomatic index (HSI), the speciﬁc growth rate (SGR)
in the intelligent feeding group was signiﬁcantly increased by 8.33% while the feed conversion rate (FCR) was re-
duced by a remarkable 17.07% compared to the traditional feeding group. Moreover, intelligent feeding signiﬁ-
cantly improved the pepsin activity of the bass. In terms of immunity and antioxidant capacity, however, the
ﬁsh in the intelligent feeding group had a signiﬁcantly lower lysozyme (LZM) level than those fed with the tra-
ditional method. For superoxide dismutase (SOD), the intelligent group also displayed a lower activity value, al-
though it was not signiﬁcant. The intelligent feeding group had 0.14 nmol/mg protein higher malondialdehyde
(MDA) activity than the traditional group. Regarding stress, although no statistical signiﬁcance was observed,
the cortisol level in the intelligent group was 1.9 ng/ml higher than in the traditional group. Together, these
data suggested that the intelligent feeding method can signiﬁcantly improve ﬁsh growth but may also result in
stress and suppress innate immunity.

1. Introduction
Feed management is a non-trivial aspect of ﬁsh aquaculture. The
feeding method, to a great extent, determines ﬁsh production (Føre
et al., 2011; López-Olmeda et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2019). Feeding ac-
cording to ﬁsh requirements is effective and as such is becoming in-
creasingly accepted in aquaculture (Zhou et al., 2018b). Until now,
many studies have attempted to establish the endpoint of feeding
based on ﬁsh appetite (Zhou et al., 2018b; Li et al., 2020). For example,
underwater acoustic technology has long been applied to determine the
feeding endpoint of salmon in sea cages by detecting the residual feeds
(Juell, 1991; Juell et al., 1993). Similarly, Atoum et al. (2015) also
established models to determine the feeding endpoint by detecting
the residual feeds using different cameras. Residual feed detection-
based feeding depends heavily on high-quality detection instruments
and the breeding environment. In view of this, novel intelligent feeding
methods that characterize the variation of dissolved oxygen (DO) and
temperature in the water during feeding have been developed (Wu
et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2019). Although this kind of feeding revealed
better performance compared to traditional feeding, it does not apply
to increasingly industrialized aquaculture (such as recirculating aqua-
culture systems (RAS)) to a great extent as the DO and temperature
are stably maintained in this setting.
In contrast to the methods above, ﬁsh appetite quantiﬁcation in real
production using the characteristics of ﬁsh feeding behavior is more fea-
sible. With the rapid development of artiﬁcial intelligence and technol-
ogy, feeding according to ﬁsh feeding behavior has been a trending area
of research in aquaculture (Sun et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2017). Chang
et al. (2005) constructed a feedback control system, which could

determine the feeding endpoint, by quantifying the aggregation behav-
ior of eels during feeding. Zhou et al. (2017, 2018a) measured the de-
gree of ﬁsh feeding activity by analyzing the aggregation and
dispersion of ﬁsh schools. Liu et al. (2014) quantiﬁed the feeding inten-
sity of Atlantic salmon in RAS using inter-frame differential characteris-
tics caused by ﬁsh feeding behaviors. Similarly, Ye et al. (2016)
developed a novel method to assess the feeding activity of tilapia in
RAS based on the Lucas-Kanade optical ﬂow algorithm and entropy.
Zhou et al. (2019) also graded the feeding activity of tilapia in RAS
using a customized convolutional neural network (CNN). The above
methods depend heavily on the water turbidity and light environment,
where the clearer the foreground (location of the ﬁsh school), the better
the performance, however, these conditions are difﬁcult to achieve in
practical production. Zhao et al. (2017) established a model based on
the motion characteristics of the reﬂective areas caused by ﬁsh feeding
behaviors to assess appetite. This method, to a great level, can avoid the
above limitations.
The intelligent feeding methods above could improve production
and reduce costs to a large extent (Zhou et al., 2018a), however,
whether these intelligent methods are beneﬁcial to ﬁsh welfare in aqua-
culture remains little unknown. Therefore, to understand the effects of
the intelligent feeding method on ﬁsh growth more comprehensively,
an adaptive feeder based on a practical and typical intelligent feeding
method (Zhao et al., 2017) was designed. Fish welfare was evaluated
by measuring the corresponding growth and biochemical and immune
indexes throughout a 47-day production experiment.
In this study, Micropterus salmoides, one of the ﬁve domestic ﬁsh in
China, was used as the experimental objects as its indispensable status
in the Chinese freshwater aquaculture system. Besides, in view of the
trend of industrial RAS in aquaculture, our study was implemented in
the environment of the industrial RAS.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Fish samples
All Micropterus salmoides were purchased from the ﬁsh hatchery of
Suzhou (Jiangsu, China). Before the experiment, the ﬁsh were accli-
mated in a laboratory RAS and fed a commercial diet (protein: 42%,
lipid: 8%, ash: 13%) daily for 14 days (Zhao et al., 2017). During acclima-
tion, the ﬁsh were fed 3 times a day (08:30, 16:00, 19:30), and the total
amount of feed did not exceed 5% of the bodyweight per day. After that,
384 ﬁsh (32 ± 5 g) of a similar size were chosen and randomly and
evenly distributed to six cylindrical culture ponds (two groups, each
in triplicate).
2.2. Experimental system
2.2.1. RAS structure
The experimental system consisted of two independent RAS, where
each RAS contained three culture ponds (diameter: 1 m, water depth:
0.5 m) coupled with a bioﬁlter, solid removal, feeder, oxygen supply,
light emitting diode (LED), and ultraviolet lamp (UV). The water used
in this experiment was ammonia removal tap water with aeration for
>24 h and UV sterilization. The circulating water volume of each pond
was 300 L/h, and the daily water exchange volume was 15% of the
total. The full spectrum energy-saving lighting lamp was used to simu-
late the light period (08:00–20:00 light, 20:00–08:00 dark) during the
experiment. The temperature was maintained at 25 ± 0.5 °C, dissolved
oxygen ≥5.5 mg/L, pH at 7.2 ± 0.5, nitrate ≤0.5 mg/L, and ammonia ni-
trogen ≤0.8 mg/L for the entirety of the acclimation period and
experiment.
2.2.2. Feeder
Fig. 1 (a) shows the feeder, which includes the walking system,
weight sensor and feeder. The camera used for monitoring the ﬁsh ac-
tivity was installed at the bottom of the feeder, facing down the water
surface (1.3 m above the water surface). For the intelligent group, feed-
ing was performed using the adaptive feeder, which was controlled by
the adaptive feeding algorithm (see adaptive feeding algorithm below
for details). For the traditional group, the ﬁsh were fed quantitively
(see experimental design and sampling for details). The total feeding
amount (TFA) at each time point was divided into 3 parts on average,
and then the ﬁsh were fed at intervals of approximately 30 s.
2.3. Adaptive feeding algorithm
The adaptive feeding system is outlined in Fig. 2. The feeding system
proposed in this paper can adjust the feeding amount according to ﬁsh
appetite. The appetite of juvenile Micropterus salmoides was assessed
using a modiﬁed kinetic energy model (Zhao et al., 2017). During the
feeding (at intervals of approximately 30 s), the appetite assessment
(Ek) at each feeding point was compared with a kinetic energy threshold
Th (set to 140 in this study), which was determined by K-means cluster-
ing. The feeding continued until Ek was smaller than Th, and the feeding

amount at each feeding point (except the ﬁrst two feedings) was ob-
tained by Eq. (1):

where X(i) and Ek(i) are the i-th feeding quantity and i-th appetite as-
sessment result, respectively. Note that the ﬁrst two feeding amounts
were set to 10% TFA. The feeding amount decreased over the feeding
time. When X(i) decreased to a certain extent (set to 3% TFA), the min-
imum feed amount (i.e., 3% TFA) was implemented.
2.4. Experimental design and sampling
The two treatment groups in this experiment were the same except
for the feeding method. The ﬁsh were fed 3 times a day (08:30, 16:00,
19:30) with the same commercial feed during the experiment and
weighed every 15 days. The feeding amount in the traditional group
was adjusted according to the weight change of the ﬁsh. The uneaten
feed remaining on the water surface was collected and weighted
15 min after feeding of each group separately to prevent the residual
feed produced in the experiment from contaminating the water.
At the end of the experiment, all ﬁsh were deprived of food for 24 h.
The ﬁsh were then anesthetized (in the whole pond) deeply with
MS-222 (120 mg/L) followed by weighing, grading, and sampling. The
ﬁsh were divided into 3 levels according to the thickness of the back
using grading sieves with a gap width of 1.2 cm and 1.7 cm, and the
number of ﬁsh in each level was counted. The ﬁve ﬁsh from each level
were randomly sampled and stored at −20 °C for whole-body proxi-
mate composition analysis (all ﬁsh at this level would be sampled if
the ﬁsh less than 5). The length and weight were measured from an
additional ﬁve ﬁsh randomly selected from each level. In addition, the
livers were also removed and individually weighed to determine the
hepatosomatic index. Then, a blood sample was immediately collected
for centrifugation to separate the serum, and serum samples were fro-
zen and stored at −40 °C for subsequent analysis. In addition to the
blood samples, livers were also sampled. After the rinse in normal saline
solution, the sampled livers were then stored at −40 °C for the analysis
of antioxidant enzyme activities and immune-related parameters (ana-
lyzed by Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).
2.5. Growth performance evaluation
The long-term growth performance of the feeding methods was
assessed using the ﬁsh survival rate (SR), the weight gain rate (WGR),
the ﬁsh speciﬁc growth rate (SGR), the feed conversion rate (FCR), the
condition factor (CF), and the hepatosomatic index (HSI). These param-
eters are deﬁned in Eqs. (2)–(7), respectively.

W1, W2 and W0 are the total weight (g) of the ﬁsh at the beginning of
the trial, the end of the trial and the dead individuals during the test, re-

total number of ﬁsh, and N2 is the number of ﬁsh at the end of the
trial. WB is the ﬁsh weight (g), L is the ﬁsh length (cm), WL is the fresh
liver weight (g), and t is the breeding time.
2.6. Proximate composition analysis
The proximate composition of the ﬁsh diets was determined by stan-
dard methods of the Association of Ofﬁcial Analytical Chemists (AOAC,
2000). The amounts of crude protein and crude lipid were measured
by Coomassie blue staining and the Soxhlet extraction method, respec-
tively. Moisture was measured by drying at 100 °C to a constant weight,
and ash was determined by heating at 550 ± 25 °C for 4 h in a mufﬂe
furnace.
2.7. Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 20
for Windows, and all the data are presented as the mean ± standard
error (SE). Following the test of normality and heteroscedasticity, inde-
pendent sample t-tests were used to analyze the test data with p set at
0.05 signiﬁcance threshold.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Growth performance
3.1.1. Daily feed intake and size homogeneity
In order to explore the relationship between feed intake and resi-
dues in different feeding methods, the daily feed intakes, and residues
of the Micropterus salmoides were recorded and shown in Fig. 3. During
the experiment, the total feeding amount in the intelligent group was
11,077 g, and the feed residue accounted for 0.39%. Whereas in the tra-
ditional group, the total feeding amount and the feed residue proportion
were 11,700 g, and 8.84%, respectively. Although no signiﬁcant differ-
ence was observed in the total feed amount of the two groups, the
amount of residual feed in the traditional group was signiﬁcantly higher
than that in the intelligent group, which indicated that the intelligent
feeding method could better meet the food requirement of juvenile
Micropterus salmoides and might be more conducive to ﬁsh growth.
In real production, the homogeneity of ﬁsh size is being emphasized
due to its indispensable role in quality and yield to aquatic products. In
order to study the inﬂuence of different feeding methods on size homo-
geneity, the ﬁsh in the ﬁsh in the two groups were graded into three
levels (level 1: smaller than 1.2 cm; level 2: between 1.2 cm and 1.7
cm; level 3: bigger than 1.7 cm) according to their body thickness at
the end of the experiment. Fig. 4 shows the grading result of the ﬁsh,
where the horizontal axis is the value of the grading level, and the
vertical axis denotes the number of ﬁsh. It can be seen from Fig. 4
(a) and (b) that ﬁsh in the intelligent group have a better size homoge-
neity compared to the traditional group. In other words, the intelligent
feeding method can weaken the size differentiation of ﬁsh in aquacul-
ture to some extent.
3.1.2. Growth indicator
To evaluate the performance of the intelligent feeding and tradi-
tional feeding methods, the ﬁsh growth parameters (SR, WGR, FCR,
HIS, CF, and SGR) were measured and illustrated in Table 1. Generally,
the feeding method had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence (p > 0.05) on SR, HIS,
and CF, however, signiﬁcant differences (p < 0.05) were observed in

WGR, SGR, and FCR. Speciﬁcally, WGR in the intelligent group was
30.17% higher than in the traditional group. In addition, the intelligent
feeding group displayed an FCR decrease of 17.07% compared to the tra-
ditional group.
As shown above, ﬁsh fed with the adaptive feeder showed a higher
WGR and SGR. The higher FCR in the traditional group may be due to in-
sufﬁcient feeding, which would decrease the proportion of food energy
used for growth. In addition, food wastage during a lower appetite pe-
riod could also increase FCR (Juell et al., 1993). In other words, the
lower FCR of the intelligent group indicates that the intelligent feeding
method can effectively reduce the cost of feed and improve feed efﬁ-
ciency. Therefore, the intelligent feeding method showed beneﬁts,
such that all ﬁsh growth parameters (especially the FCR) in the intelli-
gent group were improved to a certain extent compared to the tradi-
tional group.
3.1.3. Digestive enzyme activity
Fish digestive enzyme activity is closely related to ﬁsh growth
(Guerrera et al., 2015; Nofouzi et al., 2019; Thongprajukaew et al.,
2011). No signiﬁcant difference in amylase and lipase activity was ob-
served between the two feeding methods (Table 2). Pepsin activity in
the intelligent feeding group was signiﬁcantly higher than the tradi-
tional group. These results indicate that ﬁsh fed with the intelligent
feeding method had better protein digestion. This feature is critical to
the digestion and absorption of protein in the feed and promotes the
rapid growth of ﬁsh.
3.2. Biochemical and immunological indicators
For a comprehensive evaluation of feeding methods in aquaculture,
ﬁsh welfare must also be assessed (Santurtun et al., 2018). Previous
studies have demonstrated biochemical parameters and immunological
indicators are closely related to the health and welfare of ﬁsh (Sankian
et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2019; Yildiz and Altunay, 2011). To evaluate the
effects of different feeding methods on ﬁsh welfare, both the biochem-
ical and immunological indicators were measured here (Table 3). Al-
though no signiﬁcant differences in the cortisol level or superoxide
dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) activities were detected
between the two groups (p > 0.05), the cortisol level and MDA activity
in the intelligent group increased by 9.45% and 19.44%, respectively, and
the SOD activity declined by 6.25%. The traditional group had a signiﬁ-
cantly higher level of lysozyme (LZM) compared to the intelligent
group (p < 0.05).
Cortisol, extracted from the adrenal cortex, is an adrenocortical hor-
mone that plays a key role in carbohydrate metabolism and is usually
used to assess the ﬁsh stress response (Brijs et al., 2018; Ellis et al.,
2012; Fevolden et al., 1994; Hoseini et al., 2020; Santurtun et al.,
2018). A short-term increase in the cortisol level can promote the
breakdown of body proteins while accelerating sugar synthesis and fat
oxidation and enhancing non-speciﬁc immunity (Demers and Bayne,
1997), however, if the cortisol level remains high, it will result in re-
duced fat synthesis, bodyweight loss, growth stagnation and innate im-
munosuppression (Demers and Bayne, 1997; Gregory and Wood,
1999). Previous studies suggested that frequent feeding stimulation
would cause continuous excitement and alertness of the ﬁsh, which
would increase the cortisol level and affect normal growth and ﬁsh wel-
fare (Huntingford et al., 2012). In the current aquaculture, most breed-
ing objects, especially the Micropterus salmoides, tend to eat non-
stationary feed. Thus, many feeding methods, including intelligent feed-
ing, are based on the feeding strategy of repeated feeding in an event.
This feeding strategy can not only make feed loss easy to be observed
and determine when to stop feeding, but also leave enough time for
the intelligent feeding algorithm to calculate. Few studies, however,
have focused on ﬁsh welfare that can result from intelligent feeding.
In this study, the intelligent feeding method stimulates the ﬁsh many
times during feeding, which may increase the cortisol level. Further-
more, the feeding strategy (continuous feeding of a low amount per
time) in the intelligent group may lead to individuals with a higher so-
cial hierarchy occupying the feeding area and prevent others from ap-
proaching this area. The ﬁsh in a lower social hierarchy may then be
continually excited and alert, which would increase the cortisol level
in the intelligent group. Although the cortisol level may gradually return
to normal when the feeding is ﬁnished, the cortisol in the intelligent
group would eventually accumulate and be higher than compared to
the traditional group. In this study, the lack of a signiﬁcant difference
in the cortisol level may be due to the relatively short breeding time.
Nonetheless, the cortisol level is still an effective parameter that reﬂects
ﬁsh welfare.
Lysozyme, an alkaline enzyme that can hydrolyze mucopolysaccha-
rides of pathogenic bacteria, has anti-inﬂammatory, antibacterial and
antiviral effects on the body (Rauta et al., 2012). In the intelligent
group, multiple feeding stimulations resulted in depressed lysozyme
levels, however, previous studies have shown that cortisol plays a medi-
ating role in the process of environmental impact on immune organs.
Demers and Bayne (1997) also emphasized that lysozyme may be a
rather small component of innate resistance, whereas cortisol may
have rather widespread negative effects on resistance mechanisms.
For the intelligent group, the phenomenon of higher cortisol but lower
lysozyme levels indicates that a higher susceptibility to pathogens can
lead to a negative effect on the health and welfare of the ﬁsh.
The antioxidant capacity of the immune system is also closely re-
lated to ﬁsh health (Dawood et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). The SOD
and MDA activities can indirectly reﬂect the ﬁsh antioxidant capacity
(Viarengo et al., 1995). In this study, the SOD activity in the intelligent
group was lower than the traditional group, but the MDA activity in
the intelligent group was higher than in the traditional group. The intel-
ligent group, which was subjected to multiple stimulations during the
feeding process, may have an increased consumption of metabolism
and energy. This phenomenon, to a certain extent, would promote the
generation of oxygen free radicals and increase the MDA activity in
the intelligent group. Although no signiﬁcant differences in the SOD
and MDA activities were observed, the generation of oxygen free radi-
cals slightly increased the MDA activity in the intelligent group
compared to the traditional group. The intelligent group, however,
demonstrated lower SOD activity.
How to realize intelligent feeding for the cultured ﬁsh in the RAS, is
not only the challenge in production management but the key scientiﬁc
problem in welfare farming. Different from the traditional feeding

of ﬁsh school and improve ﬁsh growth but may also result in stress
and suppress innate immunity. At present, although intelligent feeding
has been an active area in aquaculture research, few studies have fo-
cused on how to combine the appropriate feeding strategy with an in-
telligent feeding algorithm. This deﬁciency may underlie the stress
and innate immune suppression observed during intelligent feeding.
Moreover, ﬁsh feeding and appetite vary from species to species and
are susceptible to a variety of external factors, including the environ-
ment and management practices. Therefore, intelligent feeding in the
future should target speciﬁc breeds, not only combining feeding strate-
gies but also adapting to changes in the environment.
3.3. Proximate composition
Energy intake plays an important role in determining the primary
proximate composition in growing ﬁsh (Cardinal et al., 2011). To
study the effects of the two feeding methods on the proximate compo-
sition of ﬁsh ﬂesh, the moisture, ash, crude protein, and crude lipid
levels were measured as shown in Table 4. No signiﬁcant differences
in moisture, ash, or crude lipid (p > 0.05) were observed between the
two groups, however, the traditional group had a signiﬁcantly higher
level of crude protein (3.99%) compared to the intelligent group (p <
0.05).
In theory, the ﬁsh in the intelligent group can acquire sufﬁcient en-
ergy intake, which would promote a more preferable body proximate
composition versus the traditional group, but the opposite result was
obtained. In this study, the ﬁsh in the intelligent feeding group were
stimulated many times during a feeding, resulting in relatively acceler-
ated metabolism and consequently higher energy consumption. Hence,
juvenile Micropterus salmoides may consume body protein ﬁrst, which
would result in signiﬁcantly lower crude protein levels observed in
the intelligent group.
4. Conclusions
To explore whether the intelligent feeding methods that have been
proposed so far would impair ﬁsh welfare in real production, an adap-
tive feeder based on a practical intelligent feeding method was de-
signed. In contrast to traditional feeding, the intelligent feeding
method was more conducive to improving ﬁsh growth performance
and reducing feed cost in aquaculture, however, intelligent feeding
would eventually result in a higher cortisol level and lower lysozyme
level, which is harmful to the ﬁsh immune system and general welfare.
In the future, with the development of multi-functional, high-precision
sensors, the improved or potential methods will be proposed to provide
more and more intelligent solutions to address as many feeding prob-
lems as possible, and these methods could potentially improve breeding
efﬁciency and ﬁsh welfare.
