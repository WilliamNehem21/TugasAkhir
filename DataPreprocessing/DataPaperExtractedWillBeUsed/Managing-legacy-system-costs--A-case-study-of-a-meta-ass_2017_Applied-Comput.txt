Abstract
Financial services organisations spend a signiﬁcant amount of their IT budgets maintain-
ing legacy systems. This paper identiﬁes the characteristics of legacy systems and explores why such
systems are so costly to maintain and support. Three models for the assessment and management of
legacy system costs are examined and a new meta-model that addresses differences between the
existing models is proposed. The new meta-model is then applied to a large UK ﬁnancial services
company - FinCo. Input data for the new meta-model are provided by the company’s senior busi-
ness and IT executives and the results compared with the ﬁrm’s actual legacy system management
plans. The paper concludes by identifying improvements the company should make to these current
legacy system management plans and its longer-term strategy for managing legacy systems.

1. Introduction
The ﬁnancial services industry is one of the biggest spenders on
IT but the majority of this spend is on maintenance activities
required to keep legacy systems operational [1]. By some esti-
mates, seventy-ﬁve per cent of the IT budgets of banks and
insurance companies are consumed maintaining existing sys-
tems [2,3]. Consequently, identifying and implementing appro-
priate solutions to contain the maintenance cost of legacy
systems is a signiﬁcant requirement for many organisations.
Over ﬁfteen years ago Bennet et al. [4] observed that
research into legacy system assessment approached the subject
as a technical issue rather than as a broader business problem.
More recently Alkazemi et al. [5] recognise this technical
‘‘bias”, noting the need for tools for senior management to
be able to make informed decisions about legacy systems,
while Plant [6] identiﬁes the difﬁculty of engaging senior
management in such decisions.
Extant literature proposes a number of models for use in
assessing legacy systems and recommending approaches for
how these systems should be managed to minimise their

maintenance costs [5,7,8]. However, while the earlier published
models include a wide range of assessment criteria they do not
include more contemporary architectural considerations such
as extensibility and interoperability. Conversely, a recent
model by Alkazemi et al. [5] lacks recognition of detail such
as lines of code and control ﬂow as proposed by De Lucia
et al. [7]. In an attempt to address these anomalies and unify
the positive features of the varying approaches, this paper pro-
poses a new meta-model derived from a range of existing mod-
els. The utility of the meta-model is then assessed through its
application to FinCo - a large UK ﬁnancial services company.
By using a case study we seek to answer the following research
questions: is the meta-model effective for analysing the
company’s
core
IT
system,
Customer
Service
System
(CSS), to assess whether it is a legacy system? And, if so,
does
the
meta-model
identify
appropriate
solutions
to
contain the maintenance costs for CSS? Further details of
our research methodology, ﬁndings and conclusions are
discussed below.
2. What is a legacy system?
In 2001, Brooke and Ramage [9] concluded that no standard
deﬁnition of a legacy system exists. Some of the current sugges-
tions include the following:
� old information systems that remain in operation within an
organisation [10, p. 314].
� any business critical software systems that signiﬁcantly
resist modiﬁcation and their failure can have a signiﬁcant
impact on the business [11, p. 36].
� a legacy application or system may be based on outdated
technologies, but is critical to day-to-day operations [12].
Many of today’s legacy systems were built in a time when
computer processing and storage capacity were far more
expensive than they are today [15]. Consequently, efﬁciency
frequently took precedence over a system being understood
or maintainable, with the inevitable consequences in terms of
degradation [13]. System degradation can also be caused by
poor documentation and version control amongst other fac-
tors, but as De Lucia et al. [7] observe, whatever the cause such
deterioration inevitably increases maintenance costs. This lar-
gely explains the high proportion of total IT expenditure
organisations commit to system maintenance. Furthermore,
Alkazemi et al. [5] contend legacy systems do not reﬂect con-
temporary architectural advances such as the emphasis on pro-
gram reuse and construction of component libraries. These
more recent approaches facilitate the constant evolution of sys-
tems and help prevent systems becoming legacy with their
resultant high maintenance costs.
The deﬁnition of a legacy system adopted in this paper is a
system that is business critical and demonstrates one or more
of the following additional characteristics: old age, obsolete
languages, poor if any documentation, inadequate data man-
agement, a degraded structure, limited support capability
and capacity, changed to meet business needs, increasing main-
tenance costs, and lacking the necessary architecture to evolve
[14,10,9,17]. It is this deﬁnition of a legacy system that is
applied to FinCo to determine whether the company’s system
can be identiﬁed as legacy.
3. Legacy system cost management solutions
A number of solutions to minimise the cost of maintaining
legacy systems have been proposed. For example, De Lucia
et al. [7, p. 642] refer to ‘‘ordinary maintenance, reverse engi-
neering, restructuring, reengineering, migration, wrapping,
replacement with commercial off-the-shelf software and dis-
carding”. These authors acknowledge that there is confusion
in the use of some of these terms in the literature, noting
reengineering and migration as examples.
Bennet et al. [4] are more concise in proposing, ‘‘discard”,
‘‘wrap”, ‘‘outsource”, ‘‘freeze”, ‘‘carry on” and ‘‘reverse engi-
neering” as potential solutions. As it is unlikely that out-
sourcing would negate the need to implement one of the
other solutions proposed, the suggestion that outsourcing
offers a solution for managing legacy systems must be ques-
tioned. The viability of carry on as a solution for an indeﬁnite
period also seems questionable for a business critical system.
Additionally, it is highly likely that even a very stable old sys-
tem will need some form of remediation at some point. For
example, if the availability of people with the skills required
to support an obsolete language is in decline this will require
some form of corrective action.
Where there is consistency in the legacy system literature is
in recognising that a decision on the best option to manage
such systems should be based on a structured assessment
incorporating economic and quality factors. These decisions
must be taken and supported by a broad range of stakeholders
within the organisation and not limited to technical consider-
ations alone [14,18–20]. Additionally, research by Khadka
et al. [11] suggests that the characteristics of an organisation
operating and supporting the legacy system must be consid-
ered. It is essential that organisational factors such as resis-
tance to change and/or weakness in systems support be
reﬂected in any proposed system solution.
4. A new legacy system assessment model
Ransom et al. [8], De Lucia et al. [7] and Alkazemi et al. [5]
each propose models that assess a legacy system based on
deﬁned business and technical attributes and then propose
solutions to manage the system. Each model emphasises differ-
ent attributes. De Lucia et al. provide more detail than the
others on business value and technical quality. However, Ran-
som et al. offer important insights into gaps in organisational
capability and culture that must be mitigated in an implemen-
tation plan. Alkazemi et al., in turn, add a number of contem-
porary architectural considerations. Each model therefore
incorporates valuable features but without being as compre-
hensive as it could be. To address this issue we propose a
new meta-model derived from the three existing models com-
bining business and technical factors with contemporary archi-
tecture attributes and organisational considerations to produce
a more extensive, uniﬁed approach that recognises the real-
world complexity of legacy systems (Fig. 1).
The model output can then be plotted on a decisional
matrix [14] that indicates a recommended solution (Fig. 2).
In the case of FinCo the model’s output was compared with
the company’s actual legacy system management plans to iden-
tify areas of divergence and thus potential improvements in
these plans.

5. Research methodology
Given the organisational nature of the subject under investiga-
tion and the design of the meta-model it was clear that a case
study that provided the basis for situational analysis was an
appropriate research approach [21,22]. Time and resource con-
straints combined with access opportunities meant a single
case study was both a pragmatic course of action while also
providing the necessary exploratory device/pilot study to test
the utility of the meta-model [23]. As a large ﬁnancial services
company with four million accounts FinCo was identiﬁed as a
highly relevant case study, not least because in common with
many other similar companies FinCo estimates that mainte-
nance of its core system, CSS, which supports the majority
of the ﬁrm’s business operations, accounts for 75–80% of the
annual IT budget.
A questionnaire administered face-to-face to ten of FinCo’s
senior business and IT executives was chosen as the main
method for data collection (see Appendix A for details of par-
ticipants). The questionnaire focused on the following:
� The applicability of the proposed deﬁnition of legacy sys-
tems to FinCo’s CSS system.
� The applicability of the proposed meta-model’s business
and technical attributes to FinCo.
� An estimated measure of each business and technical attri-
bute for FinCo’s core system.
� The applicability of the proposed meta-model’s organisa-
tional attributes to legacy system solution selection for
FinCo.
� An estimated measure of each organisational attribute for
FinCo.
Documentary analysis was also conducted on FinCo’s cur-
rent IT plans to determine the actual decisions FinCo had
made about its core system, CSS. The research data were anal-
ysed using the meta-model proposed in Section 4, and the
results applied in the decisional matrix. The model’s output
was then compared with the company’s actual legacy system
management plans to identify areas of divergence and thus
potential improvements in these plans.
6. Analysis and ﬁndings
6.1. Is CSS a legacy system?
This section examines whether CSS is a legacy system or not in
accordance with the deﬁnition presented in Section 2.
Eleven of the characteristics associated with legacy systems
discussed
in
Section
2
were
investigated
(Table
1).
Respondents were asked to indicate which, if any, of these
characteristics
they
would
associate
with
FinCo’s
core
system, answering yes, no, maybe or don’t know for each
characteristic.
With 11 system characteristics and 10 respondents there
were a total of 110 responses for this part of the questionnaire.
75 of the 110 responses agreed the characteristics were applica-
ble to CSS and 29 said they may be. Six of the responses were
negative and none answered, don’t know. The high proportion
of positive responses to these questions suggests that FinCo’s
CSS platform conforms to the deﬁnition of legacy systems
proposed in Section 2 and should be treated as such. No legacy
system attributes other than those already identiﬁed in the
literature were proposed in response to the open question
asking for suggestions of new attributes that should be
considered.
6.2. Use of business value attributes and calculation of business
value index in legacy system assessment
The meta-model has ten business value attributes. When asked
whether the 10 business attributes are used in assessing the
CSS legacy platforms in FinCo, 71 of the 100 responses were
positive, nine were negative and two were don’t know
(Table 2).
For each individual business attribute, the very low to very
high and don’t know answers by respondents were re-coded as
values from 1 to 5 and 0 respectively, to facilitate plotting on
the decisional matrix. Questionnaire responses with the same
value for each of the business value attributes were aggregated
across the ten FinCo respondents and results tabulated in
Table 2. 66% of the 100 attribute values were recorded as high
or very high. Only 5% were rated low or very low.

The business value for each attribute is calculated from
respondents’ re-coded answers and then a consolidated busi-
ness value is determined as shown in Fig. 3.
The results of these calculations are presented in Table 2.
The consolidated business attribute value for FinCo’s CSS is
4.12. This compares with a maximum value of 5 and places
CSS in the top two quadrants of the decisional matrix. The
high business value indicates that the solution recommended
by the assessment will be to conduct extensive re-engineering,
replacement by a commercial off-the-shelf system (COTS) if
available, or continue normal system maintenance. The techni-
cal value is required to complete the assessment and identify a
recommended solution.
6.3. Use of technical value attributes and calculation of technical
value index in legacy system assessment
The meta-model has 23 technical value attributes. When asked
whether these are used in assessing the legacy systems in
FinCo, 60% of the 230 responses were positive and 13% were
negative (Table 3). The highest concentration of don’t know
responses was in the maintainability category. The 18 negative
responses were distributed across 17 attributes.
As for the business attributes, the technical attribute mea-
sure answers were re-coded to provide an attribute value.
The common re-coded values for each of the 23 technical attri-
butes were aggregated across the FinCo respondents and are
tabulated in Table 3.
6.4. Application of decisional matrix
When plotted in the decisional matrix the consolidated busi-
ness attribute and technical attribute value for FinCo is in
the High Business Value - Low Technical Value (HBV-LTV)
quadrant (Fig. 4).
Maintainability attributes account for 72% of all don’t
know responses by FinCo. To explore the impact of this con-
centration of don’t know responses on the overall results, the
analysis was rerun excluding all the maintainability responses.
Though the outcome is an increase in the technical value for
FinCo’s CSS from 2.32 to 2.63, the combined business and
revised technical value remains in the same quadrant when
plotted in the decisional matrix.

To examine the dispersion of results across respondents,
business and technical values were calculated for the input of
each of the ten respondents and plotted together with the
aggregated value for FinCo in the decisional matrix (Fig. 5).
This chart shows a concentration for nine of the results.
Ten of the data points are inside the HBV-LTV quadrant
and the eleventh is only marginally outside.

6.5. Inﬂuence of organisational attributes on legacy system
solution selection
More than a third of respondents demonstrate uncertainty
about the six organisational attributes identiﬁed in the litera-
ture inﬂuencing legacy system remediation plans in FinCo
(Table 4). This doubt is reinforced by FinCo’s IT plans which
show limited signs of these factors being considered. The inter-
nal development and maintenance value index is 4.4 compared
with a maximum value of 5 and lower index values for all of
the other attributes. This suggests that FinCo may have a
gap between its emphasis on internal development and mainte-
nance and its organisational capability to deliver its legacy sys-
tem management plans through these means.
6.6. Legacy system management actions proposed by FinCo
The remediation actions planned by FinCo for its legacy sys-
tem were identiﬁed by reviewing the company’s IT plans.
These plans conclude that no suitable COTS is available to
replace FinCo’s CSS platform. This ﬁnding is consistent with
the high business value placed on the specialist functions per-
formed by CSS.
The remediation plans involve major reengineering of Fin-
Co’s legacy platform including addressing architectural style
and consumption constraints, source code translation, operat-
ing system and hardware replacement and outsourcing of data
centre management. These extensive plans are consistent with
the recommendations made by Sommerville [14] for systems
mapped in the HBV-LTV quadrant when no COTS is avail-
able. While the plans involve outsourcing of the data centres
to capitalise on external expertise in this area, there is little evi-
dence of any other limitations in FinCo’s organisational attri-
butes inﬂuencing the legacy system remediation plans or being
addressed as part of these plans.
7. Conclusions and recommendations
In this paper we set out to construct a legacy system assess-
ment meta-model and then carry out situational analysis of
the utility of this device by applying it to a real case – FinCo.
In so doing we accept the argument that one rationale for
using a single case study is that it can conﬁrm or challenge
whether a theory’s or model’s propositions are correct
[22,23]. Our aim was therefore to use FinCo to examine the
effectiveness of the meta-model for analysing IT systems and
assessing whether these are legacy systems, and, if so, the util-
ity of the meta-model for identifying appropriate solutions to
contain legacy system maintenance costs.
As the analysis in the previous section demonstrates, Fin-
Co’s core operating platform, CSS, is business critical and
exhibits a very high proportion of the characteristics attributa-
ble to legacy systems. It therefore conforms to the legacy sys-
tem deﬁnition we proposed in Section 2 and should be assessed

as such. The high proportion of positive questionnaire
responses also indicate that the business and technical value
attributes proposed in the meta-model are valid for use in
legacy system assessment. We would add, however, that this
is not a particularly surprising ﬁnding given our meta-model
combines business and technical factors with contemporary
architecture attributes and organisational considerations from
three existing, research based, models – as discussed in Sec-
tion 3. The value of the uniﬁed meta-model is therefore that
it provides a holistic approach that recognises the real-world
complexity of legacy systems. Thus, while we accept the widely
held view that generalising from a single case study is difﬁcult,
our view is that given the meta-model’s construction it could
prove a useful analytical device for any organisation in a sim-
ilar situation to FinCo.
That said, there are several important observations to make
on the meta-model by way of concluding this paper. The ﬁrst is
to note that despite the disparate knowledge of the FinCo
respondents all but one of the individual outcomes plot into
the HBV-LTV quadrant when mapped onto the decisional
matrix. This is also true for the mapping of the consolidated
response and the consolidated response excluding all answers
from the maintainability section. Thus we conclude that
although the technical knowledge of the assessment partici-
pants varied considerably the results show a high degree of
consistency in the output of the meta-model.
Second, given our knowledge of the FinCo respondents we
attribute the high number of don’t know responses to the main-
tainability section of the technical attribute list compared with
business attributes as due to the limited technical knowledge of
the senior business respondents. By comparison, members of
FinCo’s technical team were better placed to offer a view on
both business and technical attributes. This suggests that bias-
ing the assessment participant selection in favour of senior
technical representatives may lead to a more informed analy-
sis. However, such an approach would serve to perpetuate
the concerns discussed earlier in the paper about the lack of
broad business participation in such important and potentially
very expensive decisions for FinCo, as well as ownership of the
outcome [4–6]. An alternative approach would be to share the
output of the meta-model and decisional matrix with all the
FinCo respondents in a group meeting to help foster discus-
sion on the results and build greater common understanding
and ownership across the institution. Another approach might
be for respondents to complete the questionnaire in a joint
forum where all of the participants have the opportunity to
gain a greater understanding of the questions and foster debate
about potential concerns.
Finally, we note that FinCo’s IT plans to reengineer to
improve quality are consistent with the actions expected for
a system assessed as being in the HBV-LTV quadrant of the
decisional matrix when no COTS is available. This indicates
that the meta-model has identiﬁed an appropriate solution
for FinCo to contain its CSS maintenance costs, as asked in
the research questions. However, these plans do not reﬂect
the organisational constraints identiﬁed through the compre-
hensive, real-world assessment provided by the meta-model.
While a very high percentage of FinCo responses indicate
the legacy system solutions selected are inﬂuenced by the
organisational attributes explored, there is only limited evi-
dence of this actually happening in FinCo’s IT plans. This
weakness in the proposed plans may have become evident
and constructively debated had the questionnaire been com-
pleted in a joint forum or the results of the questionnaire dis-
cussed in such a forum. They were not. Our view is, therefore,
that failure to consider organisational constraints when formu-
lating legacy system solutions is likely to have a signiﬁcant
detrimental impact on FinCo’s ability to execute its plans –
as it would for organisations more broadly, we would argue.
Ultimately, then, we would argue that the meta-model based
assessment of FinCo’s CSS legacy system suggests the com-
pany re-examine its plans to ensure it has the organisational
capabilities to deliver on them. Furthermore, by applying the
meta-model to each of the platforms in its portfolio of systems,
FinCo has the opportunity to establish an understanding of
the relative needs of its platforms from a legacy system man-
agement perspective and incorporate this portfolio assessment
into its long-term IT strategy.
Appendix A
The questionnaire was administered face-to-face to ten of Fin-
Co’s senior business and IT executives. The FinCo participants
were as follows:
– CEO
– CIO
– Senior Business Data Steward
– Head of Business Change Management
– Head of IT Strategy & Architecture
– Head of Business Management for IT
– Head of IT Development
