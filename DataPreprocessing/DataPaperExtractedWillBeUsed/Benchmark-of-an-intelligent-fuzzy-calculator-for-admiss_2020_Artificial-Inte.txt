This paper proposes a calculator for estimation of drawbar pull supplied by mechanical front wheel drive tractor
based on nominal input variable of tractor driving mode in two-wheel drive (2WD) and four-wheel drive (4WD),
and numeral input variables of tractor weight (53.04–78.45 kN) and slip of driving wheels (1.4–15.1%) utilizing
intelligent fuzzy systems. The systems were developed by means of various input membership functions, output
membership functions, defuzziﬁcation methods, and training cycles. The prominent developed system for esti-
mation of the drawbar pull yielded a user-friendly intelligent fuzzy calculator with admissible accuracy (coefﬁ-
cient of determination = 0.993). Data obtained from the calculator revealed increasing nonlinear trend of the
drawbar pull in range of 12.9–57.5 kN as concurrent augment of slip of the wheels and tractor weight, for
2WD mode. In case of the 4WD mode, it nonlinearly raised from 12.8 to 77.7 kN. Therefore, effect of the slip
and weight on the drawbar pull was found synergetic. Moreover, the drawbar pull ranges elucidated that the
drawbar pull proliferated as the 4WD mode was employed rather than the 2WD mode. Generally, benchmark
of the prominent developed intelligent fuzzy system, not only provide simple calculator with the widest applica-
bility for different tractor models, but also produces added values in enrichment of realization level in domain of
tractor drawbar pull concepts.

1. Introduction
Investigation on drawbar pull supplied by off road driving wheels
has been interest for researchers from six decades ago. Available pub-
lished documents indicate that, for the ﬁrst time, Forrest et al. (1962)
attempted to ascertain effect of various parameters on the drawbar
pull. This attempt was followed afterwards by other agricultural engi-
neers in time periods of sixties and seventies of the twentieth century
(McLeod et al., 1966; Zombori, 1967; Burt et al., 1974; Burt et al.,
1979; Raghavan and McKyes, 1979). These researches have been con-
tinued until recent years (Bailey and Burt, 1981; Burt and Bailey,
1982; Burt et al., 1984; Foda, 1991; Taghavifar and Mardani, 2015;
Kumar et al., 2019). In the mentioned research works, for speciﬁc soil
conditions, main inﬂuential factors affecting the drawbar pull were re-
ported as dynamic weight, slip, and dimensions of the wheel.
Parallel to these researches in the sixties, army engineers of the
United States of America in Waterways Experiment Station started
their efforts for studying drawbar pull of off road driving wheels.
Outcome of their efforts led to presentation of a new engineering pa-
rameter for wheel size and soil characteristics. The parameter has
been called wheel mobility number (Freitag, 1966; Freitag, 1968). The
parameter was subsequently employed by engineers (Wismer and
Luth, 1973; Wismer and Luth, 1974) in technical center of Deere & Com-
pany in order to develop mathematical model for estimation of gross
traction force and the drawbar pull of the wheel. The model proposed
by the engineers estimates the gross traction force and drawbar pull
based on dynamic weight, slip, and dimensions of the wheel. This ap-
proach of mathematical modeling has been followed by other re-
searchers (Gee-Clough, 1980; Wulfsohn et al., 1988; Sharma and
Pandey, 1998; Srivastava et al., 2006; Maclaurin, 2014; Mason et al.,
2018) based on the main mentioned inﬂuential factors. However,
some miscellaneous mathematical models have been yet developed
by other researchers (Hayes and Ligon, 1981; Ashmore et al., 1987;
Upadhyaya et al., 1989; Evans et al., 1991; Vechinski et al., 1998;
Sharma and Pandey, 2001; Rosca et al., 2014).
Since some agricultural engineers (Southwell, 1964; Steinbruegge
and Larsen, 1966; Kliefoth, 1966; Southwell, 1967; Domier and
Persson, 1968; Domier and Friesen, 1969; Wang et al., 1989) in the
sixties and seventies of the twentieth century tended to ascertain draw-
bar pull supplied by tractor in various processes, the aforementioned re-
searchers who concerned with development of mathematical models
suggested utilization of the models for estimation of tractor drawbar

pull. The utilization can be performed by summation of drawbar pull
provided by each driving wheel. Main drawback of this method is attrib-
uted to model conditions which are established for speciﬁc tire type
(bias and radial ply), soil texture (silt, clay, and sandy), slip value, tested
surface and environment (Tiwari et al., 2010; Keen et al., 2013; Sunusi
et al., 2020). Another drawback of the method is related to its applica-
tion for the MFWD tractors. Front and rear driving wheels of the
MFWD tractors have different dimensions, dynamic weight, and tire in-
ﬂation pressure. Thus, utilization of the mathematical models for esti-
mation of drawbar pull of the MFWD tractors in speciﬁc conditions
results in frequently consequent calculations. These calculations can
be partly decreased by employment of new parameter of tractor mobil-
ity number (tractor vehicle number). Concept of the tractor vehicle
number was initially introduced by Grisso et al. (1992) and completed
by Taylor et al. (1995), afterward. However, this scheme was also not
a drastic effort for presenting a method for direct estimation of the
drawbar pull. Hence, development of a general model for estimation
of drawbar pull supplied by the MFWD tractor based on some major
tractor parameters is a highlight topic for researchers, undoubtedly.
Notable progress of computer simulation tools for multivariate esti-
mations of phenomena leads to worldwide application of the tools in
engineering and scientiﬁc works. Literature screening process proved
this fact for attempts conducted by researchers (Battiato and Diserens,
2013; Battiato and Diserens, 2017) in case of estimation of drawbar
pull supplied by the MFWD tractor. In the cited works, the researchers
developed a computer program for estimation of the tractor drawbar
pull as function of several input parameters (weight of front and rear
axles, soil mechanical characterizations, tire speciﬁcations, tractor ge-
ometry, and slip of driving wheels). The developed program was fed
with constant soil characterizations for the front and rear wheels. How-
ever, bulk density and cone index of soil are proliferated after passage of
front wheels (Rush, 1969; Holm, 1969; Bashford et al., 1988; Abebe
et al., 1989; Srivastava et al., 2006; Lyasko, 2010; Taghavifar and
Mardani, 2014a). Thus, the rear wheels encounter with higher cone
index and bulk density of soil. This deﬁciency in assumptions results
in decrement of conﬁdence level of the program for accurate estimation
of the drawbar pull. From another point of view, although estimation of
the tractor drawbar pull by the developed program is relatively appro-
priate for broad spectrum of conditions, high numbers of prerequisite
input parameters of the program prevent the widest employment of
the program by engineers, researchers, and associated managers. There-
fore, it is indispensable to take a drastic effort for development of
general computer simulation system working like simple calculator
for estimation of the drawbar pull based on minimum major input pa-
rameters of the MFWD tractor.
Among several computer simulation systems, intelligent types are
simulation workspaces typically worked through predetermined se-
quential calculations for foundation of correlation between output and
input data. These types are well known simulation systems due to
their capability for intelligent simulation of multiple input and output
parameters with self-training algorithm for nonlinear and uncertain
phenomena. These outstanding capabilities result in applying intelli-
gent simulation systems in ﬁeld of Biosystems Engineering researches
in recent years in case of two well-known types of the simulation sys-
tems (neural and fuzzy systems). Details of development and validation
of neural simulation systems in these researches can be found in some
published documents (Taghavifar and Mardani, 2014b; Shafaei et al.,
2016a; Taghavifar and Mardani, 2017; Shafaei et al., 2018a; Shafaei
et al., 2019a). Furthermore, there are some documents in literature for
successful application of fuzzy simulation systems in these researches
(Khoshnevisan et al., 2014; Daneshmand et al., 2015; Shafaei et al.,
2018b; Elijah et al., 2020). Analysis of the literature for performance of
intelligent neural and fuzzy simulation systems approved that the
fuzzy systems can estimate phenomena with higher accuracy than neu-
ral systems. This fact has been remarkably publicized by the same au-
thors (Shafaei et al., 2015; Shafaei et al., 2018c; Shafaei et al., 2019b;
Shafaei et al., 2019c; Shafaei et al., 2019d) in case of compound effect
of nominal and numeral input parameter on output target.
According to dearth of information in the published works for offer-
ing general computer simulation system for estimation of drawbar pull
supplied by the MFWD tractor and reliability of fuzzy simulation sys-
tems for multivariate estimation of nominal and numeral input vari-
ables, proved in the literature, this study was intended to develop
fuzzy simulation systems for estimation of the drawbar pull on the
basis of combined major nominal input variable of tractor driving
mode (2WD and 4WD) and numeral input variables of tractor weight,
and slip of driving wheels. In this regard, it was expected to provide
prominent simulation system with user-friendly environment which
works like a simple calculator.
2. Research methodology
2.1. Speciﬁcations of tractors
Eleven MFWD models of New Holland tractors were considered in
this study. The New Holland type was selected because it is a popular
tractor that is frequently sold and supported in Iran. The models in con-
junction with some engineering speciﬁcations are tabulated in Table 1.
2.2. Drawbar pull tests
The NTTL has spearhead for testing tractors and reported source of
reliable data. These data have been arranged for fuel consumption,
wheel slip, engine speed, forward speed, drawbar pull, drawbar
power, and hydraulic oil temperature of tested tractor. The hydraulic
oil temperature was measured and monitored to verify steady state op-
erating conditions of the tractor and data collection procedure (Roeber
et al., 2017).
From 1986, the NTTL has tested performance of tractors based on of-
ﬁcial procedure described by the OECD standard (Kocher et al., 2011).
Currently, the OECD standard Code 2 was devoted for ofﬁcial testing
of performance of agricultural and forestry tractors under steady state
controlled conditions (OECD, 2020). According to the standard, the
tests must be conducted on concrete ﬂat surface in order to eliminate ef-
fect of soil characteristics on tractor performance. During the tests, the
tractor was loaded by a load car. The load car controlled the loads ap-
plied to the tractor. The load car was a Caterpillar articulated dump
truck. The load car was outﬁtted with two load cell transducers

(1232ALD-100-K-B, Scottsdale, Ariz) connected together in series form
and attached to tested tractor hitch to measure drawbar pull supplied
by the tractor. The drawbar pull was initially measured in the ﬁrst
load cell transducer, while the second one was employed to conﬁrm
measured load by the ﬁrst one (Roeber et al., 2017). Moreover, the
load car was equipped with two controllers for data acquisition with
collection rate of 1 kHz and load control. The exterior-mounted control-
ler was a NI CRIO 9073 and the controller inside the cab was a NI
PIX1042Q. Software interface was LabVIEW version 12.0F3 (Kocher
et al., 2017). Actual forward speed was also measured using a non-
driving ﬁfth wheel traveled under the load car. Meanwhile, forward
speed of rear wheels of the tested tractor was measured as theoretical
forward speed (Howard et al., 2013). Therefore, slip values of the tested
tractor wheels were ascertained and logged in the data acquisition
based on Eq. (1) (Muro and O'Brien, 2004; Andreev et al., 2010;
Maclaurin, 2018).

The data collecting procedures were carried out twice over approx-
imately 61 m length of straightaway. If similar results were achieved
for two tests, next load set point was applied. If the results were not sim-
ilar, more data were collected until two tests showed similar results. De-
tails for test track with concrete ﬂat surface were fully explained by
Howard et al. (2013). The test data sets (288 sets) considered in this
study for all eleven MFWD models of New Holland tractor were col-
lected at the NTTL from 2000 to 2004.

2.4. Development of intelligent fuzzy systems
Intelligent fuzzy systems were developed to estimate drawbar pull
supplied by the MFWD tractor, based on three independent input vari-
ables of slip of driving wheels, tractor weight, and tractor driving mode.
The intelligent fuzzy system has ﬁve layers comprising various nodes
in each layer. These ﬁve layers are called fuzziﬁcation, normalization,
fuzzy rule, defuzziﬁcation, and output layer, respectively. The intelli-
gent fuzzy estimation is accomplished through passing data sets in
these ﬁve layers. The estimation scenario is explained in following
paragraph.
When input data sets are imported into the system in the ﬁrst layer
nodes, they are graded between zero and one by input membership
functions (trapezium, triangular, sigmoid, constant, generalized bell
(Gbell) and Gaussian). The graded data are transferred to the second
layer nodes as input data. The numerical weights are assigned to the
data in the second layer. Additionally, the second layer normalizes the
weighted input data. The weighted input data are shifted to the third
layer nodes as input data of fuzzy rules. These rules are deﬁned based
on the IF and THEN structure through self-training algorithm. These def-
initions are intelligently tuned regarding relationships between input
and output data. Output data obtained by the rules are collected and ag-
gregated to one output value in the fourth layer nodes. This value is con-
verted to anticipate output target by defuzziﬁcation method (weighted
sum and weighted average). Output membership functions (constant
and linear) are used for this task. The desired output target is ultimately
achieved in the ﬁfth layer node.
In the fuzzy workspace of Matlab R2016b software, data sets obtained
from the ofﬁcial NTTL reports were randomly shufﬂed and classiﬁed into
three clusters. The clusters including 70% (202 data sets), 15% (43 data
sets) and 15% (43 data sets) for training, validating and testing, respec-
tively, of each developed system. To estimate the drawbar pull
(12.9–57.5 kN) based on input variables of tractor weight (53.04–78.45
kN), slip of driving wheels (1.4–15.1%), and tractor driving mode
(2WD and 4WD), the ranges of the tractor weight and slip of driving
wheels were directly deﬁned in the workspace and integers 2 and 4
were assigned for the 2WD and 4WD, respectively. Development process
was frequently accomplished until the best structure of the system with
the highest estimation accuracy was reached. The process was ﬁnalized
utilizing different types of input membership functions (trapezium, tri-
angular, sigmoid, constant, generalized bell (Gbell) and Gaussian), the
numbers of input membership functions, types of output membership
functions (constant and linear), training cycles, and defuzziﬁcation
methods (weighted sum and weighted average). To avoid prolongation
of the paper, equation descriptions of input membership functions, out-
put membership functions, and defuzziﬁcation methods are referred to
Jang (1993). Operational ﬂowchart for selection of the prominent system
is depicted in Fig. 1.
2.5. Performance appraisal of developed intelligent fuzzy systems
To apprise performance of developed intelligent fuzzy systems for
estimation of drawbar pull supplied by the MFWD tractor, suitability
criteria of regression coefﬁcient of determination was calculated based
on Eq. (6) (Shafaei et al., 2016b). Moreover, absolute and relative errors
of estimation were ascertained by Eqs. (7) and (8), respectively (Shafaei
et al., 2017a). Mean of absolute values of estimation errors was also cal-
culated by Eq. (9). The highest values of coefﬁcient of determination and
the lowest values of absolute and relative errors of estimation indicated
the best system for estimation of the drawbar pull.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Statistical descriptions
Table 2 lists values of statistical descriptor indices obtained for draw-
bar pull supplied by the MFWD tractor. The minimum and maximum
values of the drawbar pull for each tractor model in the Table 2 were
found in the lowest and highest slip values of driving wheels, respec-
tively, for the both 2WD and 4WD modes. This result for the tested trac-
tors is consistent with the results for tested wheels in soil bin facility

2010).
In the Table 2, the standard deviation values with low ﬂuctuation
range (7.09–18.15 kN) for measured drawbar pull conﬁrmed high accu-
racy of the NTTL instrumentation system. Moreover, taking note from
the Table 2 demonstrates relatively high values were obtained for coef-
ﬁcient of variation and coefﬁcient of non-uniformity of the drawbar
pull. These high values indicated noteworthy changes of the drawbar
pull as affected by slip of driving wheels and tractor weight.

deviation modulus (2.893%). Structure of the developed system number
15 in accordance with other 19 developed systems are tabulated in
Table 3. The Table 3 implies that structure of the developed system
number 15 comprised 174 training cycles, 3 input membership func-
tions for slip of driving wheels and tractor weight, and 2 input member-
ship functions for tractor driving mode, Gaussian and linear function for
input and output, respectively, and weighted average defuzziﬁcation
method.
Graphical demonstration of superior value of coefﬁcient of determi-
nation as depicted in Fig. 5 shows that the estimated and actual values of
the drawbar pull were appropriately clustered close to 1:1 line which
indicate excellent correlation between the estimated and actual values.
Additionally, scattered distribution of estimation error in Fig. 6 obvi-
ously shows that no speciﬁc pattern was recognizable in the errors for
the prominent system and distribution of the error values was ran-
domly scattered. Mean of absolute values of estimation errors was
found to be 1.043 kN. Fig. 7 exhibits frequency of estimation error
which is shown low ranges of percentage of the errors. Therefore, it
can be concluded that estimation error of the prominent system was
not sensitive to actual data and consequently, it is inferred that the
system was appropriately matched to actual data. Similar to this result,
the previous authors (Sefeedpari et al., 2016; Shafaei et al., 2017b;
Shafaei et al., 2018d; Kaveh et al., 2018) in their Biosystems Engineering
researches have positively reported adequacy of intelligent fuzzy sys-
tem for estimation of desired variables.
According to the observed results, it is found that the drawbar pull
was acceptably estimated by the prominent system developed in this
research. The prominent system yielded a user-friendly intelligent
fuzzy calculator. User interface of the calculator is illustrated in Fig. 8.
The calculator can be simply employed based on importing values of
tractor driving mode, tractor weight, and slip of driving wheels in allow-
able range in predetermined place (bottom red bold framework in the
Fig. 8). Consequently, tractor drawbar pull can be also observed in
predetermined place (top red bold framework in the Fig. 8).
3.3. Ascertainment of drawbar pull trend
To ascertain trend of drawbar pull supplied by the MFWD tractors,
three-dimensional surface plots have been drawn in Fig. 9 based on out-
put data from the calculator. The Fig. 9 elucidates how the drawbar pull

changed as slip of driving wheels and tractor weight varied. Physical
perception obtained from the Fig. 9 indicates that the drawbar pull
nonlinearly proliferated as slip of driving wheels and tractor weight in-
creased in ranges of 1.4–15.1% and 53.04–78.45 kN, respectively, for
both tractor driving modes of the 2WD and 4WD. These results have
been obtained for the drawbar pull of the tractors tested in the NTTL
on concrete ﬂat surface. For the drawbar pull augmentation of tractors
working on soil surface, some interpretations have been addressed by
previous authors as mentioned in following paragraph.
When tractor weight augments, weight of its wheels increases, de-
terministically. As weight of driving wheels ascends, greater soil volume
between tire lugs is trapped which is led to increase resistive shear
forces of soil volume. This task reinforces interaction of soil and tire,
and consequently results in proliferation of net traction force
(Taghavifar and Mardani, 2015; Taghavifar et al., 2015). When net trac-
tion force developed by the driving wheels augments, obtained drawbar
pull of the tractor increases. Meanwhile, the drawbar pull augmentation
with wheel slip increment could be attributed to rise of resistive tangen-
tial forces of deformable soil layers compacted by the wheel, as the slip
increases and thereby results in increment of net traction force
(Taghavifar and Mardani, 2014c; Taghavifar and Mardani, 2014d;
Taghavifar and Mardani, 2015). When net traction force generated by
driving wheels increases, obtained drawbar pull for the tractor rises.
The same results for increase of the tractor drawbar pull as a result of in-
crement of slip of driving wheels and tractor weight have been found by
Richardson and Cooper (1970) and Rasool and Raheman (2018).
It must be spotlighted that slip of driving wheels have indirect rela-
tion with inﬂation pressure, dynamic load, and tire type (bias and radial
ply). Tire types of the New Holland tractors in this study were radial ply.
Radial ply tires develop higher gross traction force than bias ply ones
(VandenBerg and Reed, 1962; Forrest et al., 1962; Taylor et al., 1976;
Gee-Clough et al., 1977; Wulfsohn et al., 1988; Kumar et al., 2019).
Moreover, the radial ply tires have lower slip (Cegnar and Fausti,
1961; Worthington, 1962; Coates, 1985) and rolling resistance force
(Thaden, 1962; McAllister, 1983; Kurjenluoma et al., 2009; Kumar
et al., 2019) in comparison with the bias ply tires in the same conditions
of tire and soil. These facts are corresponded to footprint of radial ply
tire on soil than that of the bias ply tires (Thaden, 1962; Kumar et al.,
Fig. 7. Frequency of estimation error of drawbar pull supplied by the MFWD tractors.

2018). The higher footprint with narrower and longer shape (Cegnar
and Fausti, 1961; VandenBerg and Reed, 1962; Taylor et al., 1976) dis-
tributes uniform ground contact pressure and decreases rolling resis-
tance force, and ﬁnally leads to lower slip and higher gross traction
force (Cegnar and Fausti, 1961). Therefore, in the same conditions of
soil and wheels, employment of radial ply tire rather than bias ply tire
type could be an effective way for increment of net traction force gener-
ated by driving wheel as well as the tractor drawbar pull.
To more clearly inspect trend of variations of the drawbar pull as af-
fected by the variables, dual effect of slip of driving wheels and tractor
weight on the drawbar pull should be considered. To do this, projected
area of the three-dimensional surfaces on horizontal plane are mani-
fested in Fig. 10. The projected areas in the Fig. 10 clarify that the dual
effect of slip of driving wheels and tractor weight on the drawbar pull
was increasingly synergistic. It is plausible in the 2WD projected area
that the drawbar pull proliferated from the lowest bound (<10kN) to
the highest bound (>50 kN) as congruent increment of slip of driving
wheels and tractor weight from 0 to 16% and 50 to 80 kN, respectively.
In case of the 4WD, it proliferated from the lowest bound (<10 kN)
to the highest bound (>80 kN). According to these bounds, it was
found that the drawbar pull of the 4WD was changed in higher bound
(average bound = 45.45 kN) than that of the 2WD (average bound =
37.92 kN). This fact could be attributed to employment of four driving
wheels of the 4WD tractor than two driving wheels of the 2WD tractor
which is resulted in higher total net traction force produced by driving
wheels. Consequently, drawbar pull supplied by the 4WD mode is
higher than that of the 2WD mode. This result is compatible with that
of statistical reports obtained from the Table 2.
3.4. Application restrictions of developed calculator
In this study, the intelligent fuzzy system of developed calculator has
been trained based on the drawbar pull data sets of some tractors tested
in the NTTL. It must be acknowledged that drawbar pull tests in the
NTTL have been commonly performed on concrete ﬂat surface. There-
fore, the calculator in this form can be used for construction and indus-
trial environments with concrete ﬂat surface and it cannot be employed
for various soil conditions and types of the MFWD tractor. This restric-
tion implies necessity of adoption of the calculator for different models
of the MFWD tractors and soil conditions in future research works by
retraining the intelligent system of the calculator with more speciﬁc
data sets. Another inherent drawback of the calculator is regarded to
workspace of its user interface. Since the calculator has been developed
in fuzzy workspace of the Matlab software, dependency of its user inter-
face on the software restricts its broad employment. Therefore, this re-
striction dictates necessity of a drastic effort for development of
spreadsheet graphical user interface for the calculator like ones sug-
gested by some previous researchers (Al-Hamed and Al-Janobi, 2001;

4. Summary and conclusion
This paper deals with benchmark of a simple calculator for admissi-
ble estimation of drawbar pull supplied by the MFWD tractors. To do
this, different intelligent fuzzy systems were developed and appraised
based on nominal input variable of tractor driving mode (2WD and
4WD), and numeral input variables of tractor weight (53.04–78.45
kN) and slip of driving wheels (1.4–15.1%). The prominent developed
system yielded a user-friendly intelligent fuzzy calculator with admissi-
ble accuracy (coefﬁcient of determination = 0.993, root mean square
error = 1.289 kN, mean relative deviation modulus = 2.893% and
mean of absolute values of estimation errors = 1.043 kN). Hence, it
can be asserted that problematic challenge of estimation of tractor
drawbar pull by frequent employments of mathematical models for
each tractor driving wheels was obviated and thereby, improvement
of state of the art was achieved in this realm. Moreover, physical percep-
tion obtained from calculator data emphasized that the drawbar pull
was augmented as slip of driving wheels and tractor weight increased.
Meanwhile, higher capability in supply of drawbar pull for the 4WD
compared to the 2WD mode of the MFWD tractor was approved. There-
fore, it can be ﬁnally concluded that the calculator is beneﬁcial for trac-
tor manufacturers and researchers to study and compare the drawbar
pull of the MFWD tractors.
