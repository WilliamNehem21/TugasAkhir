The A 2A adenosine receptor (A 2A R) is emerging as a promising drug target for cancer immunotherapy. Novel 
A 2A R antagonists are highly demanded due to few candidates entering clinic trials speciﬁc for cancer treatment. 
Structure-based virtual screening has made a great contribution to discover novel A 2A R antagonists, but most 
depended on ineﬃcient molecular docking on relatively small molecular databases. In this work, a deep learning 
strategy was applied to accelerate docking-based virtual screening, through which new structural types of A 2A R 
antagonists for an extremely large molecular library were found successfully. 
Introduction 
In recent years, cancer immunotherapy has set oﬀ a new revolu- 
tion in cancer treatment. The central idea is to promote or reactivate 
the immune response in immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment 
(TME) to kill tumor cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting cy- 
totoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed 
cell death protein 1 (PD-1) have made great success in clinic treatment 
[1] . However, this immunotherapy does not always work because there 
are alternative immune mechanisms to control the immune response. 
Adenosine, an essential signaling molecule, is actually a key immuno- 
suppressor, which can prevent an overzealous immune response under 
normal physiological conditions [2] . Within TME, high levels of adeno- 
sine inhibit the immune reaction toward tumor cells through activating 
the adenosine receptor-mediated immunosuppressive signaling in im- 
mune cells [3] . There are four types of adenosine receptors, namely A 1 R, 
A 2A R, A 2B R, and A 3 R. However, only A 2A R and A 2B R have immunosup- 
pressive function. A 2A R receives special attention as a target for cancer 
immunotherapy due to its high expression in immune cells and high 
aﬃnity for adenosine [4] . Some early developed A 2A R antagonists for 
neurological diseases indeed exhibit impressive anti-tumor eﬀects when 
turning to cancers [5] . Recently, a series of novel A 2A R antagonists have 
been developed speciﬁcally for cancer immunotherapy. They are eﬀec- 
tive in a variety of tumors by both monotherapy and combination, which 
represent a very promising strategy for cancer treatment. Some of them 
even showed dual antagonistic eﬀects on A 2A R and A 2B R [6] . However,

only several compounds have been processed to early phase clinical tri- 
als. Therefore, it is still necessary to develop novel A 2A R antagonists to 
combat cancers. 
Since the ﬁrst antagonist co-crystal structure of A 2A R was resolved, 
A 2A R has become one of the best structurally characterized drug targets 
[7] . The structure data have led to the discovery of many highly ac- 
tive antagonists. Structure-based virtual screening made a special con- 
tribution to the discovery of novel A 2A R antagonists. In the early days, 
Katritch et al. and Carlsson et al. applied this strategy to screen A 2A R an- 
tagonists from millions of compounds [8 , 9] . Both of them obtained tens 
of new structural types of active compounds. In the following years, 
some other studies also proved the eﬀectiveness of structure-based vir- 
tual screening in the discovery of A 2A R antagonists [10–16] , in par- 
ticular by molecular docking methods. Recently, Wang et al. reported 
deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) 
based classiﬁcation models which can accelerate this process [17] . After 
preparation using the deep learning models, the number of compounds 
used for ﬁnal molecular docking was reduced by 90% and several potent 
A 2A R antagonists were identiﬁed. In fact, a series of deep learning-based 
virtual screening methods [18 , 19] have been proposed in past few years 
and shown superior performance over traditional docking-based meth- 
ods in terms of eﬃciency or scoring accuracy. 
In this study, the Deep Docking algorithm reported by Gentile et al. 
[20] was particularly employed to search for A 2A R antagonists, as 
it demonstrated up to 100-fold data reduction and 6000-fold enrich- 
ment of high scoring molecules in docking-based virtual screening. This

means it can achieve the screening of super large molecular library with 
minimal computational cost. Here, it was applied to screen the Enamine 
REAL library with 1.4 billion commercially available compounds. Ac- 
cording to the Deep Docking protocol, a series of relatively small molec- 
ular subsets were ﬁrst extracted from the library to iteratively train deep 
learning models to identify molecules with favorable scores as potential 
active compounds. Then, the model with the best performance on en- 
richment of true active compounds was used to predict the remaining 
molecules in the Enamine database. The molecules with high docking 
scores were then selected as virtual hits (VHs) and docked to the crys- 
tal structure of A 2A R receptor and automatically ﬁltered with pharma- 
cophore models which characterized the binding modes of known A 2A R 
antagonists. The ﬁltered compound poses were further examined by vi- 
sual inspection, which generated the ﬁnal hit list for virtual screening. 
To validate the eﬀectiveness of the computational method, tens of com- 
pounds were selected for in vitro assay and a series of novel A 2A R antag- 
onist was successfully identiﬁed. The screening results demonstrated the 
eﬀectiveness of the Deep Docking method to accelerate virtual screen- 
ing from a super large molecular library and the potential to facilitate 
traditional virtual screening. 
Methods and materials 
Data sources 
The Enamine REAL library with 1.4 billion commercially available 
compounds were downloaded in SMILES format from the Enamine of- 
ﬁcial website [21] for both model construction and virtual screening. 
The SMILES strings [22] were transformed to the Morgan ﬁngerprints 
[23] for model training using the RDKit package under the environment 
of python 3.6. In addition, 1983 known A 2A R antagonists were extracted 
from the ChEMBL database [24] for model evaluation. 
Workﬂow for the construction of Deep Docking model 
Gentile et al proposed a so called Deep Docking workﬂow to speed 
up the virtual screening on large databases. It is a docking-based deep 
learning model which is built on a multi-layer feed-forward neural net- 
work (FNN) to correlate the docking scores of molecules with molecu- 
lar descriptors such as molecular ﬁngerprints. The FNN model allows to 
identify molecules with favorable docking score purely through molec- 
ular descriptors and avoid the actual docking calculation. To improve 
model performance, its model training was designed as an iterative pro- 
cedure through increasing the size of the training set step by step. In cur- 
rent study, model training followed similar workﬂow as Gentile’s work 
( Figure 1 ). First of all, 1.5 million molecules were randomly sampled 
from the Enamine database and divided into three equal parts, namely 
training, validation and test sets. Molecules in each set were docked to 
the ligand-binding pocket of A 2A R using Qvina docking method [25] to 
generate docking scores. These molecules were divided into virtual hit 
(VH) and non-VH by a docking score cut-oﬀ, which, at the beginning, 
was set to classify top S percentage (the boundary level) of scored 
molecules in the validation set as VH class and the remaining higher 
scored molecules (i.e. The docking score is a negative value) as non- 
VH class. To be noted, molecules failed in docking were discarded. The 
Morgan ﬁngerprints of molecules in the training set were used to train 
the Deep Docking model. The model was then used to predict the prob- 
ability of being VH for the rest of molecules in the Enamine database, 
so that the time consuming docking calculation for the large database 
can be spared. A probability threshold is set by ensuring 90% recovery 
of true VHs in the validation set (i.e. 90% VHs classiﬁed by docking 
score in validation set are correctly predicted by the model) and then 
the Deep Docking model classiﬁed compounds in database into VHs and 
non-VHs. Since second iteration, 0.5 million molecules (sample set) were 
randomly sampled from predicted VHs of last iteration and added into 
the training set to build a new model, while the validation and test set 
kept unchanged. The docking calculation was also done on the sample 
set for creating class labels and a lower score cut-oﬀ was applied to re- 
assign class labels for molecules in the training set. The reduction of 
score cutoﬀ was done by lowering the boundary level for molecules in 
the validation set, i.e. the top ( S - m ) percentage compounds were as- 
signed to the VH class. The iterative process was terminated until the 
capability of the model to identify favorable scoring molecules could 
not be improved. In current study, the S was initially set to 1 and the m 
was set to 0.1. 
In each iteration, 12 FNN models with various hyper-parameter were 
built for selection. The same hyper-parameters used in Gentile’s work 
were employed in this study (Table S1). Speciﬁcally, maximum 500 
epochs, learning rate of 0.0001 and a dropout frequency of 0.7 were 
used for all training runs. In addition, weight ratio for non-VH/VH class 
were set to either 2 or 3 to deal with the highly imbalanced nature of 
the data set (less than 1% VHs). The number of hidden layers in FNNs 
was set to either 2 or 3 and the number of neurons in each layer were 
set to 1000, 1500 and 2000 respectively. 
Model evaluation 
Deep Docking models were evaluated with normalized precision 
FPDE (full predicted database enrichment) which was calculated as the

ratio between precision and random precision as shown in Eqs. 1 - 3 , the 
random precision was calculated as the proportion of true VHs in test 
set. Another parameter for evaluation is recall, which were calculated 
as the percentage of true VHs in the predicted VHs and the proportion 
of true VHs correctly predicted by the model respectively. Here, the true 
VH refers to the molecule classiﬁed as VH class by their actual docking 
score in each iteration, while the predicted VH refers to the compound 
predicted to be VH by the Deep Docking model. On the other hand, the 
screening capability of Deep Docking model was evaluated using the 
area under the curve of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC-AUC) 
curve. Besides, enrichment factor (EF) was also computed to examine 
the enrichment of high scoring or known A 2A R active molecules among 
the test set molecules sorted by the probability of being active in Deep 
Docking model. For calculation of EF, top 1% and 10% level were used 
for evaluation. Above mentioned metrics were calculated by following

Workﬂow of deep learning-based virtual screening 
The virtual screening of A 2A R antagonists was shown in Figure 2 . 
The ﬁnal Deep Docking model for virtual screening was derived after 
four iterations of model training. It was used to select compounds from 
the whole Enamine database. Among the predicted VHs, the top 0.5 mil- 
lion molecules were selected for further Glide docking [26] . The Glide 
docking poses were further ﬁltered by using pharmacophore models de- 
rived from X-ray complex structures of A 2A R antagonists. The deﬁnition 
of pharmacophore features will be described in latter section. Further- 
more, top 5000 docking poses passed the pharmacophore ﬁltering were 
checked by visual inspection to select ﬁnal compound list. 
Qvina docking 
Qvina docking software [25] was employed for Deep Docking model 
construction due to its particularly high eﬃciency in computation and 
high accuracy in reproduction of the crystal binding poses of diﬀerent 
A 2A R antagonists (Figure S1). At ﬁrst, three-dimensional (3D) conform- 
ers of ligands were generated using the OMEGA [27] module in OpenEye 
software package. A co-crystal structure of A 2A R (PDBID: 4EIY) with 
antagonist [28] was selected as docking receptor. The centroid of the 
crystal ligand was used to deﬁne the center of docking space. Only one 
docking pose was retained for each molecule and the binding energy 
was calculated as the docking score to evaluate molecules. 
Glide docking 
For the second stage of virtual screening, Glide docking method was 
employed [26] . The same protein structure was used as protein model. It 
was prepared using Protein Preparation Wizard module in Schrödinger 
software, in which a box with side length of 20 Å was centered on the 
crystal ligand and deﬁned as the docking site by Receptor Grid Gen- 
eration module. The protonation states of residues were generated at 
pH 7.0 using the Epik algorithm [29] . Ligands were prepared with the 
LigPrep module and Glide in standard precision mode (Glide-SP) was 
adopted for the docking. Maximal 10 docking poses were kept for each 
molecule. GlideScore was used as the docking score to evaluate binding 
aﬃnity. 
Building of pharmacophore model 
To further ﬁlter docking results, pharmacophore models were con- 
structed by combining key pharmacophore features of X-ray bound con- 
formation of ligands. In total 21 co-crystal protein structures (Table 
S2) were retrieved from PDB database [30] and aligned in Maestro. 
The common features among the ligands were identiﬁed by compar- 
ing aligned ligand bound conformations. These features were recog- 
nized as key pharmacophore features for ligand binding and shown in 
Figure 3 . They were then assembled into several hierarchical pharma- 
cophore models (as shown in Table 2 ) for docking pose ﬁltering.

In vitro assay 
A 2A R is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) located in the cell mem- 
brane. When bound with adenosine by its extracellular domain, the re- 
ceptor is activated and then stimulates the release of cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate (cAMP) in cells. Based on this mechanism, a cellular 
assay named Ultra Lance cAMP (PerkinElmer, catalog no. TRF0262) 
was employed to determine cAMP produced by cells upon A 2A R ac- 
tivation through time resolved ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer 
technique. In the reaction kit, Europium-labeled cAMP tracer complexes 
compete with cellular cAMPs to bind with the cAMP-speciﬁc antibod- 
ies labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 dye. In the absence of cellular cAMP, 
maximum ﬂuorescence signal was generated at 665 nM. The cellular 
cAMP upon A 2A R activation decrease the ﬂuorescence signal, while an- 
tagonists can reverse this signal proportionally. The inhibition of A 2A R 
antagonists was quantitatively evaluated through this method. 
Results and discussion 
Construction of Deep Docking model 
In each iteration, 12 FNN models were trained and the model with 
highest FPDE value was considered as the best model for sampling com- 
pounds in each iteration and outputting the probability of being VH. 
Four iterations of model training were done and model performance 
was shown in Table 1 . In general, the ROC-AUC values during all iter- 
ations were above 0.9, which means that the model in each iteration 
can largely predict the docking score (i.e. predict VHs via Deep Docking 
model) for molecules in the database and false positive rate was main- 
tained at a low level. It seems that after four iterations the ROC-AUC 
values converged, so the model of the fourth round was taken as our 
ﬁnal model. On the other hand, the docking score cut-oﬀ for discrimi- 
nating VHs and non-hits, supposed to decrease step by step, kept at the 
same level in the ﬁrst three iterations. This is because that more than 
1% of VHs in validation set had the docking score lower than the cut- 
oﬀ value of -9.8 kcal/mol and the lowest docking score of molecules 
in validation set was -9.9 kcal/mol (Table S3). Therefore, lowering the 
boundary level of VHs in validation set could no longer reduce the cut- 
oﬀ value with more iterations. The FPDE result was gradually improved 
through iterative training and the recovery rate of VHs in test set seems 
irregular, but the values were always larger than 90% for all iterations. 
This was comparable to the predeﬁned recovery rate in validation set 
and suggested that all models can be extended to external data set. Ad- 
ditionally, it was found that the number of predicted VHs from the VH 
list of last round was constantly decreased, which means the new mod- 
els led to less VHs. This indicated that the model became more stringent 
in picking up lower scored compounds after iterative training. At last, 
the enrichment of true VHs in the test set at top 1% and 10% levels 
was investigated ( Table 2 ). Obviously, true VHs tended to concentrate 
among the top ranked predicted VHs regarding the enrichment factors 
at both 1% and 10% level and in the last iteration, the EFs for VHs 
were the largest. Interestingly, all models demonstrated large power for 
enriching the known active compounds among the test set compounds, 
although not a single active compound was included in the training set.

In the end, the model built in the fourth iteration was selected as our 
ﬁnal model for carrying out virtual screening of A 2A R antagonists due 
to its balance performance in all aspects. 
Virtual screening 
In order to ﬁnd novel A 2A R antagonists, virtual screening on the 
Enamine REAL library was made using the above mentioned Deep Dock- 
ing model. The predicted probability of being active was used to rank 
compounds in the database. The top 0.5 million molecules were further 
docked using Glide docking method and each molecule had maximal 
10 docking poses, which were ranked by GlideScore. Then, eight phar- 
macophore models were built to ﬁlter out docking poses which doesn’t 
fullﬁl the pharmacophore features ( Table 3 ). Based on the alignment of 
crystal structures of A 2A R, two hydrogen bonds with Asn253 (i.e., hb1 
and hb2) and one aromatic feature corresponding to the PI-PI stacking 
interaction with Phe168 (i.e., ha1) were found to be common for all 
A 2A R antagonists. They were included in each pharmacophore model. 
Considering the diﬀerent binding modes among the A 2A R antagonists, 
the hydrogen bonds with His278 (hb3) and His250 (hb4) and the hy- 
drophobic interaction with Trp246 (hp2) were optionally selected to 
combine with the common features, which resulted in seven pharma- 
cophore models. After pharmacophore ﬁltering, 13718 molecules which 
at least possessed three common pharmacophore features (hb1, hb2 and 
ha1) were remained. Among them, the number of molecules matching 
the hydrophobic feature hp1 was much larger than with other phar- 
macophore models. In fact, majority of known A 2A R antagonists made 
hydrophobic interaction with Trp246. Only a few molecules matched all 
pharmacophore features. In the end, the top 3000 compounds among the 
13718 compounds passing the pharmacophore ﬁltering were selected 
and their docking poses were further checked by visual inspection, and 
39 available molecules were ﬁnally ordered for activity validation. Their 
structures were shown in Table S4. 
Activity validation 
The activities of 39 compounds obtained by virtual screening were 
tested in vitro. Ultra Lance cAMP assay was employed to measure the 
inhibition of A 2A R-stimulated release of cAMP in cells. Repetition test 
at a single concentration of 10 𝜇M identiﬁed two active compounds, 
namely Z1941887486 and Z4255667667 (Figure 4A/B). Both active 
compounds showed larger than 50% inhibition. Further test showed 
Fig. 4. Structure, inhibitory activity and binding mode of the compound Z1941887486 (A) and Z4255667667 (B). The inhibition was tested at diﬀerent concentra- 
tions. The binding poses of Z1941887486 and Z4255667667 were respectively aligned with a known antagonist ZM241385, whose structure was shown in panel 
C. Z1941887486 and Z4255667667 were shown as yellow sticks, while ZM241385 was shown as pink sticks. Most residues were shown as green lines, while the 
critical residue Phe168 and Asn253 were shown as green sticks. The binding surface was also shown in the ﬁgure. Red dashes represent hydrogen bond interactions 
between compounds and residues.

that their half inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) was 3.662 𝜇M and 4.515, 
respectively. These two active compounds shared the same structural 
moiety which is novel comparing with known A 2A R antagonists, their 
structures and predicted binding modes can be also seen in Figure 4A/B. 
They both have a pyrrolopyridine ring participate in the key hydro- 
gen bonds with Asn153 and PI-PI stacking interaction with Phe168. 
Therefore, this molecular moiety can form hydrogen bond interactions 
with A 2A R. The fact that these two compounds have diﬀerent bromide 
substituents on the pyrrolopyridine ring indicates that this structure 
moiety may be tolerant to various R-group decoration for further op- 
timization. By analyzing their docking poses, it seems that the amide 
linker of Z1941887486 makes one hydrogen bond interaction with the 
side chain of Glu169, which appeared in some known antagonists. 
Z4255667667 misses this interaction, but could make one hydrogen 
bond with the backbone of Glu169 by its terminal nitrile group. At the 
entry of the pocket, Z1941887486 has a pyridine ring make aromatic 
interaction with Tyr271, while its terminal 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran sub- 
stituent makes an additional hydrogen bond with Lys153. Z4255667667 
just has a cyclohexane located at this place, which exhibits much diﬀer- 
ence in structure from Z1941887486. Compared to the known highly 
active compound ZM241385 [31] with similar binding mode (PDB code 
is 4EIY) ( Figure 4 C), which was also identiﬁed as positive compound by 
the model, these two compounds just have a bromine substitution lo- 
cated at the inner pocket formed by Trp246, His250 and His278, while 
ZM241385 has an aromatic substituent at this region. This may account 
for their relatively weaker activity and suggest a direction for further 
optimization of the hit structures. 
Conclusion 
Deep Docking is a novel deep learning workﬂow suitable for screen- 
ing against super large molecular library. In this work, the method was 
applied to screen the Enamine REAL library with billions of compounds. 
Four iterations of model training were conducted, yielding high-quality 
Deep Docking models for virtual screening. The top ranked VHs based 
on the Deep Docking model went through a second round of Glide dock- 
ing and the pharmacophore model-based ﬁltering procedure. After man- 
ual inspection, 39 molecules were ﬁnally ordered for wet-lab test. In the 
follow-up in vitro assay, two compounds were conﬁrmed to be A 2A R hits 
and they possessed a novel scaﬀold. To our best knowledge, this is the 
ﬁrst study to validate the eﬀectiveness of the Deep Docking method on 
virtual screening. Looking back to the whole screening process, the deep 
learning model based on the docking of around 3 million compounds 
successfully helped us ﬁnd two active compounds from the Enamine 
database instead of docking the entire molecular library which is much 
more computationally expensive.
