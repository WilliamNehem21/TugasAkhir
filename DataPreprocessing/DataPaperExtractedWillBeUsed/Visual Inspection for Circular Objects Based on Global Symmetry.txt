Abstract 
The research is aimed to accomplish an automatic visual inspection system for circular objects using cameras and image 
processing technique. The main concern of the paper is on the pattern analysis of circular objects based on image analysis.  
First, the authors propose a computational method using global symmetry to locate objects before the further inspection 
process. It aims at designing a symmetry measure based on distance weight, phase weight and intensity weight. Such 
measure can be used to locate centers of circles, even for those with weak contrast under uncertain complex backgrounds. 
Then based on the measure, similarities of arbitrary circular objects are given and tested. The experimental results for the 
proposed approach are promising.

1. Introduction 
When we look at an object with bad quality such as broken edges or contaminated surfaces, we can 
effortlessly perceive the abnormality without seeing a regular one. People possess a natural visual perception 
mechanism based on symmetry detection [1, 2]. Accumulated evidences have indicated that symmetry 
detection appears to have great potentials for computer-vision-based applications [3, 4, 5].

Mathematically, symmetry is defined by some characteristic fixity under a class of Euclidian 
transformations [3, 6]. As for image processing, definition and detection for symmetry becomes more complex 
due to the difficulty in selecting definite features. The existing work includes methods based on frequent 
features by using wavelets [6] and Fourier transforms [5, 7]. And, based on spatial features includes those of 
using gradients and local points [8, 9, 10]. Also, global symmetry is calculated based on the symmetry of 
energy, topology, biological mechanisms or other features [2, 4, 11, 12, 13].   
However, few efforts have been put to implement symmetry into real vision-based applications. Moreover, 
it is still a challenging task to extract objects under cluttered backgrounds, especially for objects with weak 
contrast and varying illuminations. For example, it is well known that there are many classical methods to find 
circles in images, such as moments, Hough transforms, active contours, least-square methods [14, 15]. 
However, these methods completely fail when objects' gradients are weaker than those of their backgrounds.  
In this paper, we propose a computational method to inspect circular objects using global symmetry. A 
symmetry measure is designed based on gradients and distances of interest. It is suitable to inspect arbitrary 
circular objects robustly, even for those with weak contrast under strong cluttered backgrounds. The method is 
tested in several experiments and has been successfully applied into real vision-based inspecting systems.

It describes the symmetries of intensities, structures and directions. The extreme point of (6) means the 
point with the maximal symmetric measure. So it is center for circular objects.  In cluttered backgrounds, the 
noise can be efficiently filtered out since it is irregular and non-symmetric.  
2.5. Main contribution 
The symmetry measure described in the paper was inspired by the previous work of Reisfeld [6]. However, 
we extend the algorithm in the following aspects. Firstly, by extending the distance weight function with 
different scales of interest distances, a symmetry measure of global or local can be computed. Whereas 
Reisfeld  detects only local symmetry. Secondly, a much simpler phase weight function is given for the 
detection of bilateral and mirror symmetry of all directions. It’s more efficient in calculating the symmetry 
measure than the weight in [6]. Thirdly, we add a new intensity weight function for balancing the symmetric 
weak edges. Finally, we apply the proposed method into real industrial inspecting systems. 
3. Inspection for circular objects 
3.1. Circular objects location 
In the paper, the maximal scale 
umax
 is set as the diameter of the object. The symmetry scale vector 
1
( , 2
,
,
n )
U
u u
u
 is obtained by the algorithm of global optimization in [16].  
In order to get a full-scale information for an object within its maximal interest distance 
umax
, the 
deviation 
i  is usually set to guarantee 
0
D i
. 
Then from (6), the center of a circular object corresponds to the maximum in the corresponding symmetry 
map

3.2. Similarities for measuring objects

calculate the similarity measure ( SM ). The size of ROI  is

where

Certainly, SM  can be got based on some invariant content-based descriptors [17, 18, 19]. In the paper, 
Fourier-Mellin transform [15] is used to describe the arbitrary separated circular object. 
4. Experimental Results 
The method is tested in a real application system for inspecting medical lids. The defects of lids include 
malformed shapes, broken edges, stained surfaces, and so on. Sample lids are shown in Fig.1. The distance 
weight functions in (3) are constructed by taking the lids' three main symmetric circular patterns, 
and
30
Rroi
. The referenced vector 
 is obtained by averaging the vectors of ROIs  obtained from 500 
regular images. A total number of 100,000 sample lids are tested and the result is shown in Table 1.  
The other test is given for inspecting compact discs (CDs) which contain non-symmetric patterns, with 
weak contrasts under a strongly cluttered background, as shown in Fig.2.  For speed, only the maximal scale 
is set in the distance weight function for the purpose of locating objects.  The other parameters for calculating 
the symmetric map are set similar to the above experiment. 
In Fig.2 (a), the edge of the disc (Fig.2(b)) is very weak compared to the strong cluttered background.  Only 
the symmetric weak edges are strengthened as in Fig.3(c). Based on the gradient map in Fig.2 (b), classical 
methods of finding circles failed [14, 15]. However, the proposed method gives the well separated object 
according to the symmetric map in Fig.2 (d). Then Fourier-Mellin transform [15] is used for representing the 
separated CD. The total test number is 1000 and the inspecting result is shown in Table 1.

5. Conclusion 
In this paper, a systematic approach for robustly inspecting circular objects is given. The proposed 
symmetry measure, on the one hand, can directly be used to inspect circular objects with symmetric patterns. 
On the other hand, it can locate arbitrary circular objects under uncertain backgrounds. In the latter case, after 
the object is located, a content-based descriptor is used to achieve the inspecting task.
