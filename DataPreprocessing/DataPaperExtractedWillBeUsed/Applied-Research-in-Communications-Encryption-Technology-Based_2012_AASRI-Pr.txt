1. Introduction 
Communication equipment radio, especially military radios, which wish only the receiver receives 
communication contents, namely to ensure the communication information is confidential. The traditional 
approach is by using encryption technique of cryptology to encrypt communication content; as a result, other 
receivers without secret key cannot understand the contents. As information become mojibake after being 
encrypted, it is easy to attract interceptors’ attention and arouse their desire of password cracking. Once the 
content is decrypted there is no longer a protective action; even if the interceptor cannot crack, he also can 
intercept the confidential  information successfully or can interfere with the procedure of communication. 
Therefore, cryptology can only protect the contents in transferring.

Therefore, it is in urgently need of another kind of alternative technology or technology replenishing 
cryptology, which should even be able to continue to protect content after it is decrypted. The "digital 
watermarking" of covert communication technology has the capacity to meet these requirements, because it 
not only protects the content of the communicating information, but more important it hides the existence of 
communication facts, and thus confuse interceptors. After confidential information is encrypted, and then 
conduct covert communication, which adds another layer of protection. Meanwhile in general use digital 
watermarking will not be eliminated. Even after the process of decryption, encryption, compression, digital - 
analog conversion and the file format transformation, the clever designed watermark can continue to exist. 
     The biggest advantage of covert communication is that except for the two sides of communication, any 
other third parties don’t know the existence of covert communication, which is more protective than simply 
encrypt code, making the encryption mechanism from "cannot understand" to "invisible" to avoid being the 
attack target for busybodies. 
For example, hide confidential information (images, texts, and sounds) in the public image, and then 
transmit, which looks like other non-confidential images, with the result of being very easy to escape the 
attention or password-cracking of the illegal interception. This is what the traditional encryption 
communication system lack of; it is in this case that makes the hidden communication technology has 
important application prospect in military communications. 
2. Concept of digital watermarking and system model 
     The so-called Digital Watermarking technology refers to embed covert information in digitized data like 
voice, image or video, these information is usually invisible and cannot be observed or aware of by human 
vision perceptual system, can only be collected by dedicated monitor or reader.[3] Through information which 
hided in the multi-media contents, people can reach the purpose of confirming contents creator, purchaser or 
judging whether the contents are true, complete or not.  
      Digital watermarking is an important branch of information hiding technology research. By embedding 
confidential information ——watermarking in original data, it affirms the ownership of the data, verifies 
integrity of data, tracks the source of data, controls usage of data and delivery of confidential information. 
According to goal and requirement of covert information, digital watermarking should have the following 
basic characteristics:  
� Hide: watermark information and source data integrate together, without changing the data storage space; 
besides the source data must not has obvious change phenomenon. 
� Robustness: It means that embedded watermarking data after going through various processing operation 
and against operation, which avoid losing or damage the watermarking information.  
� Security: it refers the now location and content of watermarking information is unknown, which needs to 
apply covert arithmetic and take measures like adopting pretreatment (for example, encryption) to 
watermarking.  
All digital watermarking systems compose two essential parts: watermarking embedding system and 
watermarking detection system. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 respectively represent the general process of watermarking 
embedment and watermarking detection:

In the process of watermarking embedment, the first step is t produce watermarking. The information 
you want to embed in can be all kinds of nature, such as number, image and text so forth. The use of password 
is to enhance the security by protecting non-authorized people from reading messages. The output of 
watermarking embedding process is image works with embedded watermarking.

��������
Fig. 2. watermarking detection processes 
The input of the watermarking detection process is the image be tested, it may not be watermarking 
embedded, or it may be images been watermarking embedded and then attacked. Because of different 
watermarking algorithm, the input of watermarking detection process can also be password, intact face and so 
on. The Input of the watermarking detection process may be the watermarking been detected, or a confidence 
value about whether watermarking is involved in the detected signals.   
When the radios transfer confidential information, they embed confidential information as watermarking 
in a carrier which can be put in public. The carrier can be digital signals like text, picture and sound.  
In radio watermarking encryption scheme, it should use double or multiple watermarking mechanism: in 
carriers except for embedding robustness watermarking in order to hide information, it also embeds half 
fragile watermarking unrelated to contents, fragile watermarking, in the use of distinguishing from enemy and 
recognizing if the information are attacked or distorted. Once we can’t detect the watermarking, we can judge 
the original contents are attacked or they are not from our party, which can be effectively prevent statistical 
attack which robustness watermarking can’t resist. 
3. watermarking algorithm based on integration 
One important application of digital watermarking is data hiding. In the approved watermarking project, it 
just needs to judge whether the watermarking exist or not, so meaningless watermarking can be embedded. 
However, in the watermarking project carrying with confidential data, the watermarking is meaningful and the 
amount of information of watermarking is bigger.  
Technology methods of data hidden mainly have spatial domain algorithm and transform domain 
algorithm. Digital image hiding algorithm based on integration is one kind of spatial domain algorithm. It uses 
Bzier Curve one time, hiding confidential images in the original images which have the same size. This kind 
of algorithm has the characteristics of simple calculation, easy to realize and high quality of regained 
confidential image. It also can embed any form of binary stream files in digital images. In selecting proper 
parameters, it can exactly recover the binary stream files. The biggest feature of this algorithm is high ability 
of hiding data. In the case of gray level image the same as original image, its biggest hidden ability can be 
3bits�pixel, so the main application of this algorithm is hide of confidential data.

3.1.  Basic idea based on integration 
In Computer Graphics and Computer aided design, we often use a kind of blending function method, that is 
suppose we preset n+1 point in the space, then P0,P1, to Pn call parametric curve below the n times Bzier 
Curve, whose control point is {P\i=1,1,…,n}.

Normally we treat broken line P0,P1, to Pn as Control Polygon of P(t), point P0,P1, to Pn as Control vertex 
of P(t).

4. Conclusion 
The development of digital watermarking technology just has ten years, Data hiding by the use of digital 
media is still a new field of study, but it also is a practical which is closer combined with specific application. 
The realization of encrypting radio confidential information by using digital watermarking technology is also 
a new try. The results will be better if it is combined with the existing encryption technology. We believe 
there will be new radio security equipments made by digital watermarking in the future.
