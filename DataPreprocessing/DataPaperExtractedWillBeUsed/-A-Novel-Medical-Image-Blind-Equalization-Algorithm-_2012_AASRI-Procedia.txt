Abstract 
A novel adaptive variable step-size constant module medical CT image blind equalization algorithm was proposed. The 
proposed algorithm overcomes the shortcoming of conventional constant module blind equalization algorithm with the 
fixed iteration step-size. The processing of image restoration transformed by a linear operation is equivalent to one 
dimensional blind equalization. The constant modulus blind equalization cost function applied to medical CT image was 
founded. The mean square error was utilized as step-size control factor to speed up the convergence and improve the 
performance of the algorithm. Computer simulations show that new algorithm improves peak signal to noise ratio, 
restoration effects and efficiency of operations, and decrease state residual error.

Medical CT image reflects the degree that the organs and tissues absorb X-ray. It benefits discovering 
small lesions of microstructure in vivo. And it is a most important assistant means in the field of medical 
image diagnosis. However, in the process of imaging and transfer, due to the image affected the two-
dimensional channel, namely point spread function, and the image blurring will carry out. The degraded CT

images will have an influence on affecting normal display and diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, in nature, 
the process of the CT image degradation is often unknown. Blind image restoration is that, in the case of 
unknown degradation information, interference and noise are removed, the lost image will be recovered, and 
the restored image approaches the original image as much as possible.  
At present, according to different recovery process, blind image restoration will be divided into parameter 
estimation method, non-parameter iterative method and so on. Gordana Pavlovic proposed a blind image 
restoration algorithm based on maximum likelihood criterion[1]. The difficulty of this method is the 
establishment of image probability density function. Its accuracy has a directly influence on the image 
restoration results. Dalong Li combined maximum likelihood estimation with support vector regression to 
solve blind image restoration algorithm[2]. The algorithm is robust to noise, but the training process makes 
the computational cost increase. Aristidis.C.Likas et al utilized machine learning mechanism to solve the 
model, and derived the discrete form of Bayesian model[3]. On this basis, Dimitris G. Tzikas et al estimated 
not only point spread function but also support domain, and proposed an improved Bayesian model to 
improve the robustness of the algorithm[4]. The algorithm preferably reserved the image boundary features, 
but the method requires a higher estimate of the model. Ming Jiang proposed a blind maximum expected 
restoration method, and the algorithm was applied to blind CT images restoration[5]. Zhang Hang adopted the 
structure of alternating minimization to solve blind image restoration problem[6]. In the fuzzy identification 
stage, total variation regularization algorithm was used; during the restoration stage, Weber's law and total 
variation regularization were combined. Kim-Hui Yap makes use of neural networks as a classifier, and each 
neuron's decision error is called soft decision error[7]. Establish the link between soft decision error and the 
traditional blind image restoration cost function. The cost function was optimized by solving soft decision 
error to achieve the minimum. Jonathon A. Chambers transform blind image restoration into signal 
classification problem in the support region[8]. The algorithm improved the convergence speed of 
classification by the key strategy of a resetting. In short, blind image restoration algorithm has been widely 
used, and in-depth researched. This paper utilized a signal transformation, and blind equalization technique of 
signal processing was applied to CT medical image restoration. 
Without any training sequence, blind equalization algorithm only makes use of receiving sequence�s
transcendent knowledge to poise the idiosyncrasy of channel and make the output sequence of equalizer be 
close to the sending sequence. It is an important frontier hot research topic in the domain of communication, 
signal and information processing, detection theory and other disciplines. In the existing blind equalization 
algorithm, the most widely used algorithm is the constant modulus blind equalization algorithm, which 
generally adopts a fixed step size, and the convergence speed and steady-state residual error become 
contradictory. Constant modulus algorithm is a classical algorithm[9], and it was widely used in various field 
of blind equalization. This paper utilized the similarity between the process of image degradation and inter-
signal interface. On the base of the literature[10], a variable step-size constant modulus image blind 
equalization algorithm based on dimension reduction was proposed. Dimension reduction was used to 
complete transforming from two-dimensional image signal into a one-dimensional complex signal sequence. 
The constant modulus cost function was established. The strategy of variable step-size was introduced to 
improve the convergence properties of constant modulus algorithm. The optimal estimation of the dimension 
reduction signal was obtained, and then images estimate were obtained by dimension rising. The method 
completed the restoration of the image by sophisticated constant modulus blind equalization algorithm, 
avoided the two-dimensional matrix inverse iteration operation, reduced the complexity of the algorithm, and 
effectively eliminated the impact of the point spread function. Image restoration has well been carried out. 
Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.

In order to utilize blind equalization technology pass to realize medical CT image restoration, firstly, two-
dimensional medical CT images should be transformed into one-dimensional row or column sequence. 
However, a single row or column transform weakened blind equalization algorithm's ability that overcomes 
point spread function’s affect. This paper proposed an image blind equalization based on simultaneous row 
and column signal transform. The block diagram is shown in Fig.1.

The shortcoming of the traditional constant modulus algorithm is slow convergence. From equation (12) 
can be seen, the algorithm adopted a fixed step size. The larger step size is, the quicker convergence speed is, 
but the larger step size causes large steady residual error. The small step size can reduce steady residual error 
and increase the convergence precision, but at one time it depresses convergence speed and tracking capacity, 
or even results in divergence algorithm. In order to resolve the contradiction, the fixed step size was replaced 
by a variable step size. Variable step size image blind equalization algorithm was put forward. In the other 
375

word, the step size was increased during the diffusion of the algorithm; the step size was reduced after the 
convergence of the algorithm to improve the accuracy of convergence.   
In order to achieve variable step size constant modulus blind equalization algorithm, the step size factor �
should be a function of a variable parameter, and during the convergence of algorithm, the parameter 
possesses gradually change in the trend.

By equation (15), the optimal estimation of dimension reduction sequence can be obtained, and the optimal 
estimation of the reconstructed image was obtained. However, in order to ensure effective convergence of the 
algorithm, the maximum step size must not exceed the upper limit of step factor, and thus the parameter value 
of should be reasonably selected. 
4. Experimental simulation 
In order to validate the algorithm, the experiment adopted 8-bit, the size of 256 × 256, CT images. The 
degradation of CT image is an approximate Gaussian process[12], the point spread function is taken as 15 × 
15 Gaussian matrix, and its variance is 0.1. The original image passed through the point spread system, and 
the degraded image was added by Gaussian white noise with mean 0 and variance 0.008. And it was shown in 
Fig.2(a). In the simulation, the order of the transversal filter is 21, and its initial value was�

5. Conclusion 
Constant modulus blind equalization algorithm in the communication system was applied to blind image 
restoration. Firstly, dimension reduction was utilized to transform the image into one-dimensional signal. The 
cost function of constant modulus applied to image restoration was constructed. In order to overcome the 
defects of constant modulus algorithm, slow convergence, the mean square error signal was utilized to control 
step size factors, speed up the convergence rate. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the algorithm, 
the algorithm not only gets better in the restoration effect and improves the peak signal to noise ratio, and 
obtains better convergence. The improved algorithm adopts variable step-size and resolves the conflict 
between convergence speed and state residual error in conventional constant algorithms. Theory analysis and 
simulation indicate this algorithm has smaller state residual error and faster convergence speed.
