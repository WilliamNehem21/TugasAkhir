Abstract 
In this paper, two asymptotic stability criterions of the trivial solutions to a class of forth order nonlinear systems are 
improved, and an error which exists in the proof of Theorem 2 of the paper [1] is pointed out.

Introduction 
Lyapunov stability is named after Aleksandr Lyapunov, a Russian mathematician who published his book 
"The General Problem of Stability of Motion" in 1892[1]. Lyapunov was the first to consider the 
modifications necessary in nonlinear systems to the linear theory of stability based on linearizing near a point 
of equilibrium. His work, initially published in Russian and then translated to French, received little attention

for many years. Interest in it started suddenly during the Cold War (1953-1962) period when the so-called 
"Second Method of Lyapunov" was found to be applicable to the stability of aerospace guidance systems 
which typically contain strong nonlinearities not treatable by other methods. A large number of publications 
appeared then in the control and systems literature. More recently the concept of Lyapunov exponent (related 
to Lyapunov's First Method of discussing stability) has received wide interest in connection with chaos theory. 
Lyapunov stability methods have also been applied to finding equilibrium solutions in traffic assignment 
problems following the work by MJ Smith and MB Wisten. 
Various types of stability may be discussed for the solutions of differential equations describing dynamical 
systems. The most important type is that concerning the stability of solutions near to a point of equilibrium. 
This may be discussed by the theory of Lyapunov. In simple terms, if all solutions of the dynamical system 
that start out near an equilibrium point 
 and stay near 
 forever, then 
 is Lyapunov stable. More 
strongly, if 
 is Lyapunov stable and all solutions that start out near 
 and converge to 
, then 
is 
asymptotically stable. The notion of exponential stability guarantees a minimal rate of decay, i.e., an estimate 
of how quickly the solutions converge. The idea of Lyapunov stability can be extended to infinite-dimensional 
manifolds, where it is known as structural stability, which concerns the behavior of different but "nearby" 
solutions to differential equations. Input-to-state stability (ISS) applies Lyapunov notions to systems with 
inputs. 
In the�paper[3],  Liapunov function for a fourth order linear system with constant coefficients is given by 
means of the Barbashin’s formula, and then stability of the trivial solutions to a class of forth order nonlinear 
systems is studied by applying the comparison method. But, we think it necessary to point out the following 
two problems: 
First, the two stable theorems in [2] are treaded

 as 
stability condition, therefore the given conditions in [2] cannot ensure that the function 
( , , , )
V x y z u
 is 
positive in arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin. 
Next, an error exists in the proof of theorem 2 in [2]. Because we cannot assert that

, the paper [2] hasn’t finished the proving of 
Theorem 2. 
In this Paper, we improve upon the two asymptotic stability criterions in [2] and obtain the following 
conclusions.
