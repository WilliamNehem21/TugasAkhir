The most active study topic in the field of computer vision is dealing with saturation in image deblurring. The Deep Multi Patch Framework (DMPHN) is primarily utilized in dynamic scene deblurring, and its fine- to-coarse hierarchical representation results in lower processing costs. The contribution of the framework in gathering and processing local residual information of blur at the courser levels in the hierarchy makes the dynamic scene deblurring successful. The existing framework uses the traditional CNN with the convolutional filter, which is a generalized linear model (GLM) that goes along with a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. When the samples of latent concepts are not linearly separable then the linear CNN cannot abstract the good representations. Because saturation in an image contradicts the linear properties of the blur model, the present Deep Multi Patch architecture with linear CNN is unable to collect the necessary local information of blur in an image. In CNN, the higher-level layer maps to the larger regions of the input image by combining the lower-level concepts from each local patch. Due to the framework’s incapacity to retain information at lower levels, noticeable ringing artifacts and poor deblurring performance resulted. We designed a nonlinear function approximator for this section, which was influenced by the good abstraction capabilities of "Network-in-Network". The nonlinear features of saturated pixels and blur are successfully captured by this upgraded DMPHN with a nonlinear function approximator. Compared to the current DMPHN model, the suggested approach greatly reduced the number of trainable parameters while improving the time cost. On the GoPro, Synthetic, and Natural Saturated Blurred Image datasets, the upgraded DMPHN network achieves superior deblurring performance with better PSNR and SSIM than the state-of-the-art.





Introduction

Motion blurring is a process of degradation of the image due to different conditions for example camera shake, relative motion between the camera and object, depth variations (Few to mention) during image capturing. The process of generating a sharp image by removing blur from a degraded image is called Image Deblurring. Image deblurring is the most basic step yet very important in computer vision applications. The blurring process is mathematically modeled as
𝑦 = (𝑥 ∗ 𝑘) + 𝑛	(1)
Where y is a degraded or blurred image, x is a latent or sharp image, k is blur kernel, n is noise added and * is the convolutional operation. From a couple of decades, several types of research have been made on image deblurring and results are mostly successful but still, some of the problems have to be looked into deeper insight. Out of which the saturated -pixels and their effect in image deblurring are a key
problem to be addressed [1–11]. When the image is captured in low light conditions with extended exposure time, a bright spot in the image will be saturated by clipping pixel intensity to its maximum value [12]. These saturated pixels violate the linear blur model assumed by many existing algorithms and such pixels cause noticeable ringing artifacts in deblurred images as shown in Fig. 1. The blurred images with saturated pixels are modeled as [13],
𝑦 = 𝑐(𝑥 ∗ 𝑘) + 𝑛	(2)
Where y is a degraded or blurred image, c is the clipping function, x is a latent or sharp image, k is blur kernel, n is noise added and * is the convolutional operation.
Handling Saturated pixels in image deblurring have acquired great interest in computer vision applications. Many researchers have made major contributions in handling such outliers exclusively [2,13,15–27]. In the field of Image deblurring, many approaches have been developed

in different directions by considering various problems of interest. The Non-Blind and Blind Deblurring are the two main approaches, where the known blur kernel in the Non-Blind Deblurring process and the unknown blur kernel in the Blind Deblurring approach. Most of the images captured are naturally blurred and there will be no information about the blur kernel. Hence most of the approaches come under the Blind Deblurring category. These two categories are further considered the key problems (outliers) such as uniform and non-uniform motion blur, Saturated pixels, Non-Gaussian noise, and are few to mention. The conventional methods for dynamic scene blind image deblurring use various regularizations or constraints to estimate the motion blur filters, which involve non-convex nonlinear optimization. Moreover, the blur patterns which are assumed spatially uniform are restrictive and lead to poor deblurring results for complex blur patterns. With the advantage of its learning capabilities, neural network (CNN) approaches overcome the difficulties from conventional blind deconvolution methods to some extent. There was no exclusion with CNN-based methods such that finding blur kernel was crucial before recovering latent image. Unless designing the blur model carefully, blur kernel estimation is so delicate and sensitive in presence of saturation and noise, which leads to the introduction of artifacts in resulting images. There is a possibility of finding latent images directly without restrictions on the blur kernel model (end to end) in multi-scale CNN. The scale recurrent [4] and multi-scale network architecture [18] with deep CNN under a course- to-fine scheme have been introduced to make use of deblurring clues at different processing levels. Parameters are shared across the scales in Scale recurrent structure, which results in a struggle to recover deblurring quality and a costly runtime due to a huge number of training parameters since the large-sized filters used by the struc- ture. Multi-scale strategies suffer from expensive computation due to their upsampling operations. Deep Multi-Patch Hierarchical Network (DMPHN) is an end-to-end approach [11] that addressed the aforemen- tioned problem through a fine-to-course hierarchical representation. A Multi-patch network reduces the computational cost by avoiding up- sampling operations, instead, the input blurry image is divided into patches at multiple levels. Along with that, a multi-patch model with a stacked version is introduced to handle the performance saturation concerning depth. With the advantage of computational cost, Fig. 3 illustrates the higher-level layer in DMPHN maps to the larger portions of the input image by combining the lower-level concepts from each

suppressing the fine image structures, the 3 × 3 filters in the deeper learn abstract features (features contaminated by outliers). Second, by
layers lose high-frequency components. Because of these mistakes, it is hard for the network to figure out which features are the best, which leads to ringing effects and bad deblurring Fig. 2. To address this issue, we present Improved DMPHN, whose performance is higher compared to current state-of-the-art deblurring methods. Our contributions are summarized below:
Instead of using an expensive 3 × 3-size filter, we used a 1 × 1-size
filter at the beginning and end of the encoder and decoder of a
multipatch network respectively.
Other than the GoPro dataset, we trained the proposed model with synthetic and real-world images with saturated pixels pro- vided by [28], which makes the model stronger in learning re- quired features.
We avoid learning abstract features and blurring fine image struc- tures by using 1X1 sized filters instead of 3X3 sized filters in the proposed network model. It also reduces the number of model pa- rameters and increases the network’s nonlinearity. The model is more general and better at deblurring after being trained with synthetic and real-world images with various types and levels of blur and saturation. The experimental results show the clear benefits of the proposed Improved DMPHN (Name IDMPHN) model in handling saturated pixels effectively in motion deblurring with a significant reduction in ringing artifacts and support deblurring of 720-pixels images in real-time (at 30 frames per second). The paper contributes a brief framework of the associated effort of inception modules and Deep Multi-Patch Hierar- chical Network in Section 3. The implementation method containing the reformed basic model and the overall architectural structure of the network is described in Section 4. Estimation of our experimental results, aiming at investigating qualitative and quantitative estimations
are given in Section 5., and our study is concluded in Section 6.

Literature review

In recent years, the conventional deblurring methods have concen- trated on three main features, i.e., probabilistic noise model [1,15, 16,29], strong priors of natural images [2,3,30,31], and estimation of blur kernel [17,32–34]. Recently, learning-based approaches (CNNs) are evolved tremendously in the image deblurring process due to their self-learning capabilities, computational speed, and robustness. Some stages in the conventional methods are replaced with learning-based methods [35–37], and some techniques completely avoid blur kernel estimation by learning an end-to-end mapping [4,18,38].
Image deblurring falls into two groups based on the knowledge of the blur kernel. The first group is non-blind deblurring [13,15,19,27], where the blur kernel is known and the solution is a purely inverse problem. The second group is blind deblurring [1–3,5–7,10,14–17,21, 26,29–33,38], where there is no clue of blur type and this method is more accurate but ill-posed. Statistical and learning methods are



the two approaches in Blind deblurring. Bayesian probability mod- els and handcrafted image priors are utilized for framing statistical methods. Some of the statistical-based approaches have been imple- mented using CNN’s [22,35,37,39]. Many recent efforts have been made on motion deblurring using an end-to-end approach and have de- veloped a deblurring framework by using multiscale and scale-recurrent networks [4,18]. [40]Proposed a novel multi-scale channel attention network (MSCAN) for successful blind deblurring of dynamic single image situations. [41] developed a technique for image deblurring that uses RAW photos directly and looked into novel neural network struc- tures that aid in RAW-based learning. Built a new dataset with both RAW and processed sRGB photographs, and created a new model to take use of RAW images’ special properties. [42] proposed an exemplar- based, end-to-end trainable deblurring technique. More specifically, the deblurring is assisted by the utilization of the exemplar’s most pertinent features. [43] The Defocus Image Deblurring Auxiliary Learning Net (DID-ANet), a novel network architecture created for single image defocus deblurring. A new method termed spatial pyramid pooling channel attention (SPPCA) is proposed for more powerful network representation. Most of these multi-scale architectures have the short- coming of more processing time due to the huge number of parameters. Nested skip connections and parameter-selective sharing techniques are introduced in [44] to improve the efficiency of large-scale recurrent networks. To get around these problems with multi-scale and scale recurrent networks, the Deep multi-patch hierarchical network [11] was constructed.
Few statistical-based approaches have been developed for handling
saturation in image deblurring. [15] extended the Bayesian Framework and suggested a statistical model analyze the effect of outliers. [16] obtained improved deblurring results by replacing the piecewise func- tion in [15] with a continuous probability function. [17] discussed the effect of outliers on the performance of the system in kernel approximation and suggested a confidence function to eliminate the effect of outliers while estimating the blur kernel. [20] substituted the confidence function introduced in [17] with the data fidelity term in the loss function. [39] estimated the blur kernel by incorporating inliers identified successively. All these [17,20,39] methods are resulting in ringing artifacts in the deblurred images. [19] approximated the blur kernel by considering light streaks and this method fails when there are no light streaks in the image. [45] developed a novel blind mo- tion deblurring technique for light streaks in blurry photos. The main concept is to use the shape of the light streak as a cue to estimate the blur kernel and describe the non-linear blur generated by outliers like the Huber’s M-estimation in blind deconvolution. [23] proposed an edge-aware SR Network for motion deblurring and dataset synthesis approach to handler outliers. [24] considered saturated and unsatu- rated pixels together during the deblurring process to preserve most of the edge information in the image and used an effective MAP-based optimization framework but the MAP optimization does not work well in presence of large outliers. [26] addressed the problem with [24] by introducing a method that identifies and discards the outliers directly during updation of both kernel estimation and latent image. Discarding outliers in [26] may lose the important information of edges and leads to ringing effects in the final latent image. [40]proposed a unique local intensity-based prior, the patch-wise minimal pixels (PMP) prior, is proposed. It is quite adept at distinguishing between sharp and blurry images. Hence there is a trade-off between outlier detection, rejection, and carrying it through the deblurring process is a challenging task and there is room for improving the performance of existing models. The new model is aimed in this direction, and the following are the main distinctions between the proposed technique and other recent approaches in development for similar reasons.
Under the coarse-to-fine scheme, most networks use a lot of training parameters because their filters are big. So, the multi- scale [18], scale-recurrent [44], and existing DMPHN [11] meth- ods have a long run time and make it hard to improve the quality of deblurring.



/ig. 3. The suggested system makes advantage of the encoder and decoder architecture’s generic structure [11].



Increasing the network depth for very low-resolution input in multi-scale approaches and the DMPHN network by sub dividing the blurred image into increasingly smaller grids has no effect on the deblurring performance.
In this study, we address the above challenges with the multi-scale, scale-recurrent, and DMPHN architectures.
Unlike multi-scale and scale-recurrent network models, which need expensive inference, our technique uses a residual-like de- sign, which requires relatively small-size filters, resulting in fewer network parameters.
Instead of a multi-scale architecture, we use a multi-patch setup so that we can use feature map concatenations. This lets the lower level focus on local information and use the leftover information to make information for the coarser grid, which improved the performance.
In contrast to the DHMPHN architecture, we utilized a 1 × 1-size
multipatch network rather of a costly 3 × 3-size filter. It prevents filter at the beginning and end of the encoder and decoder of a
the acquisition of abstract attributes and the blurring of fine visual structures. It minimizes the number of model parameters and increases the nonlinearity of the network.

Proposed method

The proposed system used the general framework of the encoder and decoder architecture shown in Fig. 3. The modifications made in
approximator i.e. 1 × 1 convolution filter [46,47] is included in encoder this work to the encoder–decoder architecture is a Nonlinear function
and decoder to capture the nonlinear properties of saturated pixels and blur. Outline of the modifications made to the basic encoder–decoder architecture is explained in this section alongside the overall architec- ture of the proposed network. In this work, the modified network design is primarily founded on a method called Deep Multi-Patch Hierarchical Network [11].

Micro neural network

It is evident that in CNN, the higher-level layer maps to the larger regions of the input image by combining the lower-level concepts from each local patch. Hence it is required to make good abstraction at lower levels to make higher levels work better which is possible by Micro neural networks and explained in the following section
Network-in-Network (NIN) is a method suggested by [46] shown in Fig. 4 to improve the representational capabilities of neural networks. The NIN act as a micro neural network that enhances the discrimination ability of inlier and outlier (more complex structures of saturated pix- els) properties for local patches within the receptive field. In traditional CNN, the convolutional filter is a generalized linear model (GLM) that goes along with a nonlinear activation function to scan the input.







/ig. 4. The NIN (Network-in-Network) approach proposed by [46].



When the samples of latent concepts are not linearly separable then the linear CNN cannot abstract the good representations. The Conventional CNN is designed in such a way that the model can abstract the good representations by utilizing a set of over-complete filters to capture all the variations of the latent concepts. But the utilization of numerous filters for this purpose may put additional load on subsequent layers. In CNN, the higher-level layer map to the larger regions of the input image by combining the lower-level concepts from each local patch. Hence it is required to make good abstraction at lower levels to make higher levels work better. With these advantages of NIN as a micro neural network is combined into existing Convolution Neural Network architecture in hunt of better abstractions for all the levels of features. Inspired by ‘‘Network-in-Network’’ for classification tasks, the existing DMPHN modeled with conventional CNN layers is modified by intro- ducing micro neural networks to capture the nonlinear properties of saturated pixels and motion blur to achieve improved image deblurring results with less computational complexity.

Enhanced encoder–decoder

The enhanced encoder–decoder architecture is introduced in this section. The differences between enhanced encoder–decoder architec- ture and architecture proposed in [11] are shown.
The contribution of the DMPHN framework [11] in gathering and processing local residual information of blur at the courser levels in the hierarchy makes the dynamic scene deblurring successful. The problem with the framework is, First, errors propagate from lower level to
3 × 3 sized filters learn abstract features (features contaminated by out- higher level structures in the architecture as the deeper layers with liers). Second, by suppressing the fine image structures, the 3 × 3 filters
in the deeper layers lose high-frequency components.Third, it is unable to capture the appropriate local information of blur around saturation regions since the blur model is non-linear around the saturation regions represented in Eq. (2).This loss of information due to the inability of framework introduces prominent ringing artifacts and limits deblurring performance shown in Fig. 2.
We solved this problem by introducing a Micro Neural Network explained in Section 3 to the building blocks of the encoder–decoder. In contrary to existing DMPHN [11], we replace the convolutional filter
with the kernel size of 3X3 with a 1 × 1 kernel performing as a more
convolution layers to 1 × 1 [49]. The 1 × 1 convolution increases of our model by limiting expressivity, we restrict the filter sizes of
nonlinearity to improve accuracy. It also cuts down on the number of

have a general overview of the image. This helps capture smaller, more
that would be extracted by 3 × 3 would be generic, and spread across complex features in the image. For large image patches, the features
the image. This helps capture the very basic components but not the specific components in the image. Since each level of our network
combination of 3 × 3 and 1 × 1 convolutions gives the best results. The focuses on different levels of blur or different sized image patches, a
success revealed in the above lines represents the effectiveness of our IDMPHN.

Encoder-decoder structure
The architecture of our IDMPHN network is shown in Fig. 5. Every stage of the architecture comprises one encoder with fifteen convolu- tional layers, six residual links, and six Rectified Linear Units (ReLU). Every encoder will follow by one decoder whose architecture is similar to the layers of the encoder except deconvolution layers are introduced to generate deblurred images in place two convolution layers. The architectural difference between the proposed DMPHN design in [11] and our IDMPHN architecture is shown in red.

Network architecture

This section highlights that our network design is constructed on the model proposed by [11]. The complete structure of our IDMPHN design is shown in Fig. 6. Following the similar approach, the blurry input image is equally divided into Four, Two, and One patch(es) from level-Three to level-One, correspondingly, as shown in Fig. 6. The intermediate feature map of each patch at each level is achieved from the corresponding encoder. At each level, the features extracted are different with more depth at lower levels, the information at all the levels is gated to the highest level. Hence, the top level contains all the information received from the lower levels, the residual links help in providing the information at the upper levels. It is important to note that each feature map of every patch is of the same size for convolutional operations from the lower level to the higher level of the
are adjusted according to the size of upper-level feature maps. Let 𝐴1 architecture. For element-wise addition, feature maps from lower levels be the initial blurry input image and the 𝑗th patch at the 𝑖th level is

the output features of encoder 𝐸𝑖 for input patch 𝐴𝑖𝑗 , and 𝑃𝑖𝑗 represents the output patches from the output of decoder 𝐷𝑖.
The process of deblurring begins at level 3. Input blurred image 𝐴1
is divided into 4 patches i.e. 𝐴3,𝑗 , j = 1 to 4. These non-overlapped image patches are given to encoder 𝐸3. The output of the encoder is a

However, stacking multiple convolutional layers on top of each other endows the network with the ability to abstract details in deeper layers [48]. Although this property is useful for classification and other similar tasks, it is not suitable for image deblurring because finer details of an image must be preserved for a good reconstruction. To extract all of the necessary features from the image, simply having large number filters of the same size is not enough. Inspired from inception [46] layers
of GoogLeNet [47], we employ two sets of convolutional filters(3 × 3
and 1 × 1). To prevent learning abstract features in the later layers

Experiment and evaluation

This section presents the details of implementation and performance evaluation of the proposed method compared to the existing methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Implementation

The code is written in Python and tested on a Personal Com- puter with an NVIDIA GeForce 920MX graphics card using the Py- Torch library. The training dataset is created by cropping photos into 256X256 pixels at random. Following that, the obtained patches from

the cropped photos are fed into each level’s inputs. The batch size has been set at six. The weights are optimized using Adam optimizer for 2 epochs. The initial learning rate is set to 0.0001 and the decay rate to 0.1. The image is normalized to the range [0, 1], and then 0.5 is subtracted. Due to CPU memory constraints, the deepest Stacking model trained and evaluated is (1-2-4).

Experiments:

This section assesses the proposed system’s performance on both synthetic and real-world images and compares it to current state-of- the-art systems. We compare our method to state-of-the-art algorithms by running large numerical tests on two benchmark datasets with saturated pixels [18,28]. Then, to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we use some hard real-world instances with large saturated regions.

trained our model with 100 pairs of randomly chosen images out of 3214 pairs, due to hardware limitations. Our method tested on synthetically blurred images of varied blur types and compared with the existing DMPHN [11] model trained with 2103 image pairs, where our model showed better results in handling different blur types with and without additional saturation both quantitative and qualitatively since the model can learn and capture the blur along with saturation regions at initial stages, shown in Fig. 7 and Table 1. Our IDMPHN model outperforms the existing DMPHN model for all blur types, but somewhat worse for motion blur, because the DMPHN model is ex- clusively trained and tailored to deal with motion blur using a bigger training set [18]. Even with a low training set, our model handles motion blur comparably well to DMPHN, and training with a larger dataset would improve deblurring quality, as shown in Section 5.2.2.


Saturated dataset from [28]
The dataset provided by [28] contains 30 sharp latent saturated images, 4 synthetic uniform blur kernels. Three different blur types are used to generate 3 different datasets with the help of these 30 sharp latent images and are as follows,
Disc blur + saturation + noise. Disc kernel with radius 7 shown in Fig. 10(a) is applied on sharp images first, then each pixel intensities are multiplied by scale factor 1.3, finally, Gaussian noise with zero mean and Variance of 0.05 is added.
angle=45𝑜 shown in Fig. 10(b) is applied on sharp images first, then Motion blur + saturation + noise. Motion kernel with length=10 and
each pixel intensities are multiplied by scale factor 1.3 to increase the saturation level, finally, Gaussian noise with zero mean and Variance of 0.05 is added.
Synthetic uniform blur+ saturation + noise:. The sharp image is blurred by convolving with one particular uniform blur kernel out of 4 uniform blur kernels provided in dataset [28] shown in Fig. 10(c), then each pixel intensities are multiplied by scale factor 1.3, finally, Gaussian noise with zero mean and Variance of 0.05 is added.
Dataset with each blur type mentioned above consists of 30 pairs of blurred and sharp images and altogether 90 blurred and 30 sharp images. Our model is trained and tested with the individual type of blur dataset mentioned in Section 5.2.2 and results are compared with state- of-the-art methods. Figs. 11 and 12 illustrate the qualitative results of two separate disc blurred images, Image-1 and Image-2, respectively. Table 3 exhibit the quantitative results. It is observed that the proposed model is working better for two different challenging blurred images with highly saturated regions. For further verification of the deblurring capacity of our model, the testing is done on two more blur types which are Motion-Sat and Uniform-Sat blur. Figs. 8 and 9 exhibit the qualitative effects of motion and uniform blurred pictures, respectively. The quantitative comparison in Table 4 demonstrates that the model performs better in terms of motion and uniform blur.

Generalization of the proposed model:

To verify the generalization of our model in deblurring the varied levels of saturated images, we trained our model with 87 blurred and
27 clean images mentioned in Section 5.2.2 and tested with chal- lenging examples with abundant saturated pixels chosen from the literature, consolidated by [28] which includes Non-Uniform and Real blurred images. Table 5 shows the quantitative results of our model for non-uniform blur inputs. Fig. 13 represents deblurred images of Non-Uniform blurred input. Fig. 14 represents the deblurred images of naturally blurred input images. The state-of-the-art approaches [2, 11,15–20,22,24,26] are less effective due to the side effects caused by saturated pixels, and their deblurred results contain ringing artifacts, and some features are not recovered properly, as it is visible in Fig. 13 & 14 .

Processing speed & number of trainable parameters:

Compared to the previous DMPHN model [11], the suggested model reduced the time cost by around 1%. For 100 epochs with a batch size of six, the time cost is estimated for both models using GoPro and Lai’s dataset. Thus, the present DMPHN model has already been demonstrated to be several times quicker than the other techniques. Aside from DMPHN, our approach performs far better than any other method. To compensate for the lower time cost, our model features 62.7% less trainable parameters than the previous DMPHN model [11]. Table 2

the improved DMPHN framework captures the appropriate nonlinear properties of saturated pixels along with the blur at the courser lev- els. The enhanced feature discrimination capability of these Micro networks within the receptive fields of local patches avoids the propa- gation of the error due to saturated pixels through the layers which reduce prominent ringing artifacts in the deblurred images. When compared to state-of-the-art results, the upgraded DMPHN network provides faster processing speed with less network parameters and

better performance with increased PSNR and SSIM on GoPro, synthetic, and hard real-world examples.

/uture scope

It is no longer beneficial to divide the blurred image into smaller grids within the network. The finest levels cannot contribute to the residuals of coarser levels because coarser levels have lower empirical losses on training data. IDMPHN’s deblurring performance is enhanced
to a good extent with the help of 1 × 1 convolutional filters intro-
duced at the beginning and end stages of each decoder and encoder, respectively, though there is a lack of local features in narrower grids. Furthermore, the IDMPHN performance can be improved by stacking many network models horizontally rather than vertically, as demon- strated in Fig. 15. The model’s performance can be improved further by training the network using a suitable data set and fine-tuning network parameters.
