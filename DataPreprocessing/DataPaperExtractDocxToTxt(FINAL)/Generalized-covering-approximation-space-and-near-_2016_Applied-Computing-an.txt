Abstract In this paper, we shall integrate some ideas in terms of concepts in topology. First, we introduce some new concepts of rough membership relations and functions in the generalized covering approximation space. Second, we introduce some topological applications namely ‘‘near concepts’’ in the general- ized covering approximation space. Accordingly, several types of fuzzy sets are constructed. The basic notions of near approximations are introduced and suffi- ciently illustrated. Near concepts are provided to be easy tools to classify the sets and to help for measuring exactness and roughness of sets. Many proved results, examples and counter examples are provided. Finally, we give two practical examples to illustrate our approaches.

Introduction

Rough set theory, a mathematical tool to deal with inexact or uncertain knowledge in information systems, has originally described the indiscernibility of elements by equivalence relations. Covering rough sets [1–9,11,12] is a natural extension of clas- sical rough sets by relaxing the partitions arising from equivalence relations to cov- erings. In our work [6], we have introduced a framework to generalize covering approximation space that was introduced by Zhu [11]. In fact, we have introduced the generalized covering approximation space 5n – CAS as a generalization to rough set theory and covering approximation space. The 5n – CAS is defined by the triple
⟨U; 1; Cn⟩, where U – Ø be a finite set, 1 be a binary relation on U and Cn be n-cover of U associated to 1, where n ∈ {r; l} (for more details see [6]).
The main works in this paper are divided into three parts. In the beginning of
work, we introduce some new generalized definitions to rough membership rela- tions (resp. functions) and new types of fuzzy sets in 5n – CAS. Second part aims to introduce one of an important topological concepts which are called ‘‘near con- cepts’’ in rough context (specially, in 5n – CAS ). In fact, we apply near concepts in 5n – CAS to define different tools for modifying the original operations. The sug- gested methods in this paper represent easy mathematical tools to approximate the rough sets and removing the uncertainty (vagueness) of sets. In addition, compar- isons between the suggested methods are obtained and many examples (resp. counter examples) to illustrate these connections are provided. Hence, we can say that our approaches are very useful in rough context namely, in information analysis and in decision making. Finally, in the end of paper, simple practical examples are provided to illustrate the suggested methods and to show the impor- tance of these methods in rough context namely in information system and in multi-valued information system. In addition, we give some comparisons between our approaches and others approaches such as Pawlak and Lin approaches.

j-Rough membership relations, j-rough membership functions and j-fuzzy sets

The present section is devoted to introduce new definitions for rough membership relations and functions as easy tools to classify the sets and help for measuring exactness and roughness of sets. These rough membership functions allow us to define four different fuzzy sets in 5n – CAS. Moreover, the suggested rough mem- bership relations (resp. functions) are more accurate than classical rough member- ship function that was given by Lin [10] and the other types.
Definition 2.1. Let ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, and A C U. Then we say that:
x is ‘‘j-surely’’ belongs to A, written x ∈j A, if x ∈ 1j (A).
x is ‘‘j-possibly’’ belongs to X, written x ∈¯j A, if x ∈ 1j(A).

These two rough membership relations are called ‘‘j-strong’’ and ‘‘j-weak’’ membership relations respectively.
Lemma 2.1. Let ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, and A C U. Then the following state- ments are true in general:


Proof. Straightforward. 
The converse of the above lemma is not true in general, as the following exam- ple illustrates:

Example  2.1. Let  ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩  be  a  5n – CAS,  where  U = {a; b; c; d}  and 1= {(a; a); (b; b); (c; c); (c; b); (c; d); (d; a)}. We will show the above remark in case of j = r and the other cases similarly: Suppose that A = {a; b; d}, then we get 1r(A) = {a; b} and 1r(A)= U. Clearly d ∈ A but d Rr A and c ∈¯r A but c R A.
The following proposition is very interesting since it is give the relationships between different types of membership relations ∈j and ∈¯j. Accordingly, we will illustrate the importance of using these different types of these membership relations.
Proposition 2.1. Let ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, and A C U. Then the following are true generally


Proof. We will prove the first statement and the others similarly:
(i) If x ∈i A ⇒ x ∈ 1i(A) ⇒ x ∈ 1r(A) ⇒ x ∈r A.
Also, if x ∈r A ⇒ x ∈ 1r(A) ⇒ x ∈ 1u(A) ⇒ x ∈u A. 
The converse of the above proposition is not true in general as the following example illustrates.

Example 2.2. Let ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, where U = {a; b; c; d} and 1= {(a; a); (a; b); (b; c); (b; d); (c; a); (d; a)}. Suppose that A = {b; c; d}. Then 1u(A) = Ø, 1r(A) = {c; d}, 1l(A) = {b} and 1i(A) = {b; c; d}. Accordingly, c ∈r A and b ∈l A but b Ru A and c Ru A. Also b ∈i A and c ∈i A but b Rr A and c Rl A. By similar way, we can illustrate the others cases.

Definition  2.2. Let  ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩ be  a  5n – CAS,  and  A C U.  Then  for  each
j ∈ {r; l; i; u} and x ∈ U:

The j- rough membership functions on U for subset A are l j
: U → [0; 1] where

l j (x) = |Nj (x)∩A| and |A| denotes the cardinality of A.
A	|Nj(x)|
The rough j-membership function expresses conditional probability that x belongs to A given 1 and can be interpreted as a degree that x belongs to A in view of information about x expressed by 1. Moreover, in case of infinite universe, the

above membership function l j
neighborhoods for each point.
can be use for spaces having locally finite minimal

Lemma 2.2. Let ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, and A C U. Then for every x ∈ U


Proof. We will prove first statement and the others similarly:
lu (x) = 1 ⇒ x ∈u A ⇒ x ∈r A ⇒ lr (x) = 1.	Also,
A	A
lr (x) = 1 ⇒ x ∈r A ⇒ x ∈i A ⇒ li (x) = 1. 
A	A


Remark 2.1.
According to the above results, we can prove that li


is more accurate than

the others types that is:
If x ∈ A ⇒ lu (x) 6 lr (x) 6 li (x)	and
A	A	A
if x ∈ A ⇒ lu (x) 6 ll (x) 6 li (x).
A	A	A
If x R A ⇒ li (x) 6 lr (x) 6 lu (x)	and
A	A	A
if x ∈ A ⇒ li (x) 6 ll (x) 6 lu (x).
A	A	A
The converse of the above lemma is not true in general.
The following example illustrates Remark 2.1.

Example 2.3. According to Example 2.2, consider the subset A = {b; c; d}. Then we get




One of the key issues in all fuzzy sets is how to determine fuzzy membership functions. A membership functions provides a measure of the degree of similarity of element to fuzzy set. The following definition uses the j-rough membership

functions l j
to define four different types of fuzzy sets in 5n – CAS.

Definition 2.3. Let ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, and A C U. Then the j-fuzzy sets in U
is the set of ordered pairs:
Aej = ÿx; l j (x) x ∈ U};	∀j ∈ {r; l; i; u}.
Example 2.4. According to Example 2.3, consider the subset A = {b; c; d}. Then we get
Ae =  (a; 0);  b; 1 ; (c; 1); (d; 1) ;	Ae =  (a; 0); (b; 1);  c; 2 ;  d; 2  ;

Ae =  (a; 0);  b; 1  ;  c; 2  ;  d; 2   ;	and	Ae = {(a; 0); (b; 1); (c; 1); (d; 1)}.

Near rough concepts in the generalized covering approximation space 5n CAS

The main goal of this section is to introduce one of the important topological applications which are named ‘‘near concepts’’ in 5n – CAS. Moreover, we intro- duce the new concepts ‘‘j-near approximations’’ (resp. j-near boundary regions and j-near accuracy measures) to generalize the j-approximations (resp. j- boundary regions and j-accuracy measures). In addition, we introduce near exact- ness and near roughness by applying near concepts to make more accuracy for definability of sets in 5n – CAS.
Definition 3.1. Let ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, and A C U. Thus we define ‘‘near rough’’ sets in U as follows: For each j ∈ {r; l; i; u}, the subset A is called
j-Pre rough set (briefly p ) if A C 1 1 (A) .
j-Semi rough set (briefly s ) if A C 1 1 (A) .
cj-rough set if A C	1j 1j	∪ 1j 1j(A)  .
The above sets are called ‘‘j-near rough sets’’ and the families of j-near rough sets of U denotes by Kj(U), for each K ∈ {P; S; c}.

Remark 3.1. The family of j-pre rough sets and the family of j-semi rough sets are not comparable as the following example illustrates.
Example 3.1. Let ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, where U = {a; b; c; d} and
1= {(a; a); (a; b);(b; a); (b; b); (c; a); (c; b); (c; c); (c; d); (d; d)}.
We will show the above remark in case of j = r and the other cases similarly as follows:
Nr(a) = {a; b} = Nr(b);	Nr(c) = U;	Nr(d) = {d}.
Thus, we compute the j-near rough sets for j = r as follows:
The family of r-pre rough sets is: Pr(U) = {U; Ø; {a}; {b}; {d}; {a; b}; {a; d};
{b; d}; {a; b; d}; {a; c; d}; {b; c; d}}.
The	family	of	r-semi	rough	sets	is:	Sr(U) = {U; Ø; {d}; {a; b}; {c; d};
{a; b; c}; {a; b; d}}.
The main goal of the following definitions is to introduce the new approxima- tion operators (j-near approximations) which modify and generalize the j- approximations.
Definition 3.2. Let ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, and A C U. Then we define the j-near approximations of any subset A as follows: For each j ∈ {r; l; i; u}
The j-pre lower and the j-pre upper approximations of A are defined respec- tively by
1p(A) =  x ∈ A|Nj(x) C 1j(A)}  and  1p(A)= A ∪ {x ∈ Ac|Nj(x)∩ 1j(A) – Ø}
The j-semi lower and the j-semi upper approximations of A are defined respectively by
1s(A)=  x ∈ A Nj(x)∩ 1j(A) – Ø} and 1s(A)= A ∪ x ∈ 1j(A) Nj(x) C 1j(A)}
The cj-lower and the cj-upper approximations of A are defined respectively by
1c(A)= 1p(A)∪ 1s(A)	and	1c(A)= 1p(A)∩ 1s(A)
j	j	j	j	j

Definition 3.3. Let ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, and A C U. Then we define the j-near boundary, j-near positive and j-near negative regions of A are defined respectively as follows:
∀j ∈ {r; l; i; u};  k ∈ {p; s; c} : Bk(A)= 1k(A)— 1k(A);  POSk(A)
j	j	j	j
= 1k(A)	and	NEGk(A)= U — 1k(A).
j	j	j

Definition 3.4. Let ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, and A C U. Then, for each j ∈ {r; l; i; u}; k ∈ {p; s; c}, the j-near accuracy of the j-near approximations of A C U is defined by

1k(A)
k	k


Definition 3.5. Let ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, and A C U. Then, for each
j ∈ {r; l; i; u}; k ∈ {p; s; c}, the subset A is called ‘‘j-near definable (briefly kj-
exact) set’’ if 1k(A) = 1k(A)= A. Otherwise, it is called j-near rough (briefly
j	j
kj-rough). It is clear that A is kj-exact if dk(A) = 1 and Bk(A) = Ø. Otherwise, it
j	j
is kj-rough.

Remark 3.2. In the 5n – CAS; ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩, we can compute the j-near approxima- tions of any subset A C U, directly by using the j-approximations, as the following lemma illustrates.
Lemma 3.1. Let ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, and A C U. Then, for each j ∈ {r; l; i; u}:

Proof. From Definition 3.2, the proof is obvious. 
Lemma  3.2. Let  ⟨U; 1; Cn⟩  be  a  5n – CAS,  and  A C U.  Then,  for  each j ∈ {r; l; i; u}; k ∈ {p; s; c} :
The subset A is kj-rough set if A = 1k(A).
The following proposition introduces the fundamental properties of the j-near approximations.
Proposition	3.1. Let	⟨U; 1; Cn⟩	be	a	5n – CAS,	and	A; B C U.	Then,
∀j ∈ {r; l; i; u}; k ∈ {p; s; c} :


Proof. Firstly, the proof of (1), (2), (10) and (11) is obvious directly from Definition 3.2.
Now, we will prove the left properties for case k = p and the other cases similarly.
(3) If A C B then 1p(A)=  x ∈ A|Nj(x) C 1j(A)} C x ∈ B|Nj(x) C 1j(B)}
= 1p(B).
The proof of (4)–(8), by similar way as (3).
(9) From Lemma 3.1, we get
 1p(Ac  c	 A ∩ 1 ÿ1 (A)  c = Ac ∪ 1 ÿ1 (A)  c = Ac ∪ 1 ÿ1 (A) = 1p(A).

Similarly, 1p(A)=  1p(Ac) c. h
The following results introduce the relationships between the j-approximations and the j-near approximations. Moreover, these results show the importance of applying near concepts in 5n – CAS.
Theorem	3.1. Let	⟨U, 1, Cn⟩	be	a	5n – CAS,	and	A C U.	Then,
∀j ∈ {r, l, i, u}, k ∈ {p, s, c} :
1j(A) C 1k(A) C A C 1k(A) C 1j(A)
j	j
Proof. We will prove the proposition in case of k = p and the other cases similarly:
Let x ∈ 1j(A), then x ∈ A such that Nj(x) C A. Thus x ∈ A such that
Nj(x) C 1j(A) and this implies x ∈ 1p(A). By duality, we get 1p(A) C 1j(A). 
j	j
Corollary	3.1. Let	⟨U, 1, Cn⟩	be	a	5n – CAS,	and	A C U.	Then
∀j ∈ {r, l, i, u}, k ∈ {p, s, c}:


Remark 3.3. The main goals of the following example are:
The converse of the above results is not true in general.
Using near concepts in rough context is very useful for removing the vague- ness of sets and accordingly, these approaches is very useful in decision making.

Example 3.2. Let ⟨U, 1, Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, where U = {a, b, c, d} and
1= {(a, a), (a, b),(b, a), (b, b), (c, a), (c, b), (c, c), (c, d), (d, d)}.
Thus, we get Nr(a) = {a, b} = Nr(b), Nr(c) = U, Nr(d) = {d}.
By using Definitions 3.2 and 3.4, the following table gives comparisons between
the j-accuracy of approximations and the kj-accuracy of approximations of the all subsets of U, where j = r, ∀k ∈ {p, s, c} :
From Table 3.1, we notice that:
Using cr in constructing the approximations of sets is more accurate than
others	types,	since	for	any	subset	A C U , dr(A) 6 dc(A)	and
r
dk(A) 6 dc(A), ∀k ∈ {p, s}
r	r	. Thus, these approaches will helps to extract and
discovery the hidden information in data that collected from real-life appli-
cations. For example, all shaded sets in Table 3.1.
Every r-exact set is r-near exact, but the converse is not true. For example, shaded sets in Table 3.1.

Remark 3.4. The following result is very interesting because it is prove that the j- near approaches are more accurate than the j-approaches. Moreover, it is illus- trates the importance of j-near concepts in exactness of sets.
Proposition  3.2. Let  ⟨U, 1, Cn⟩  be  a  5n – CAS,  and  A C U.  Then
∀j ∈ {r, l, i, u}, k ∈ {p, s, c}, the following is true in general: If A is j-exact set, then it is kj-exact.




Proof. If A is j-exact set, then Bj(A) = Ø. Thus, by Corollary 3.1, Bk(A) = Ø and
accordingly A is kj-exact. 
The converse of the above proposition is not true in general as Example 3.2 illustrates.
The main goal of the following results is to introduce the relationships between different types of j-near approximations, j-near boundary, j-near accuracy and j- near exactness respectively.
Proposition 3.3. Let ⟨U, 1, Cn⟩ be 5n – CAS and A C U. Then, ∀j ∈ {r, l, i, u}, the following statements are true in general:


Proof. By using Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2, the proof is obvious. 
Corollary 3.2. Let ⟨U, 1, Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, and A C U. Then ∀j ∈ {r, l, i, u}, the following statements are true in general:


Corollary 3.3. Let ⟨U, 1, Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, and A C U. Then ∀j ∈ {r, l, i, u}, the following statements are true in general:


Remark 3.5.
The converse of the above results is not true in general as the following exam- ple illustrates.
∀j ∈ {r, l, i, u}, dc(A) = max dp(A), dS(A) , where max represents the maxi-

Example 3.3. According to Example 3.2, it is clear that A is cr-exact but it is not sr- exact. In addition, the subset B is cr-exact but it is not pr-exact.
The relationships between different types of j-near approximations (for each j ∈ {r, l, i, u}) are not comparable (no it is not like to the j-approximations as in [6]) as the following remark illustrates.
Remark 3.6. Let ⟨U, 1, Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, and A C U. Then ∀k ∈ {p, s, c}, the fol- lowing statements are not true in general:


The following example illustrates this remark.
Example 3.4. Let ⟨U, 1, Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, where U = {a, b, c, d} and
1= {(a, a), (b, b), (b, a), (c, a), (c, d), (d, a), (d, c), (d, a)}.
Now suppose that A = {b}, B = {a, d} and C = {a, c}. Thus, we get 1p(A) = Ø, but 1p(A) = A and 1p(B) = {d}, but 1p(B) = {a, d}. In addition, we have

j-near rough membership relations, j-near rough membership functions and j-near fuzzy sets in 5n CAS
By considering j-near concepts, the new concepts ‘‘j-near rough membership rela- tions’’ (resp. ‘‘j-near rough membership functions’’) are provided to modify and generalize the j-membership relations (resp. j-membership functions) in 5n – CAS. The near rough membership functions are considered as easy tools to classify the sets and help for measuring near exactness and near roughness of sets. The existence of near rough membership functions made us introduce the concept of near fuzzy sets.
Definition  4.1. Let  ⟨U, 1, Cn⟩  be  a  5n – CAS,  and  A C U.  Then
∀j ∈ {r, l, i, u}, k ∈ {p, s, c}, we say:
x is ‘‘j-near surely’’ (briefly kj-surely) belongs to A, written x ∈k A, if
x ∈ 1k(A).
x is ‘‘j-near possibly’’ (briefly kj-possibly) belongs to X, written x ∈¯k A, if
x ∈ 1k(A).



Lemma	4.1. Let	⟨U, 1, Cn⟩	be	a	5n – CAS,	and	A C U.	Thus
∀j ∈ {r, l, i, u}, k ∈ {p, s, c}, the following statements are true in general:


Proof. Straightforward. 
The converse of the above lemma is not true in general, as the following exam- ple illustrates:

Example 4.1. Consider U = {a, b, c, d} and 1= {(a, a), (b, b), (b, a), (c, a), (c, d), (d, a), (d, c), (d, a)}.
Thus, we get Nr(a) = {a}, Nr(b) = {a, b}, Nr(c) = {a, c, d}, Nr(d) = {d}.
We will show the above remark in case of (j = r and k = p) and the other cases similarly:
Suppose that A = {b, d}, then we get 1p(A) = {d} and 1p(A)= {b, c, d}.
r	r
Clearly d ∈ A but d Rp A and c ∈¯p A but c R A.
r	r
Remark 4.1. We can redefine the j-near approximations by using ∈k and ∈¯k as
j	j
follows:
For any A, B C U :	1k(A) = nx ∈ U x ∈k Ao and 1k(A)= nx ∈ U x ∈¯k Ao.
The following proposition is very interesting since it is give the relationships between the j-rough membership relations and j-near rough membership relations. Accordingly, we will show the importance of using these different types of j-near rough membership relations.
Proposition	4.1. Let	⟨U, 1, Cn⟩	be	a	5n – CAS,	and	A C U.	Then
∀j ∈ {r, l, i, u}, k ∈ {p, s, c}, the following statements are true in general:


Proof. We will prove first statement and the other similarly:
(i) x ∈j A ⇒ x ∈ 1j(A) ⇒ x ∈ 1k(A) ⇒ x ∈k A.	 
j	j

The converse of the above proposition is not true in general as the following example illustrates.
Example	4.2. Let	U = {a, b, c, d}	and
1= {(a, a), (b, b), (b, a), (c, a), (c, d), (d, a), (d, c), (d, a)}.
We will show the above remark in case of (j = r and k = s) and the other cases similarly:
Suppose  that  A = {a, c} and B = {b, d},  then  we  get  1r(A) = {a} and
1s(A) = {a, c}.
Clearly c ∈s A, but c Rr A although c ∈ A.
Also 1r(B)= {b, c, d} and 1s(B)= {b, d}. Clearly c ¯Rs B, but c ∈¯r B although
r	r
c R B.
Definition 4.2. Let ⟨U, 1, Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, and A C U. Thus we can define the j- near  rough  membership  functions  for  5n – CAS  as  follows:  For  each j ∈ {r, l, i, u}, k ∈ {p, s, c} and x ∈ U, the j-near rough membership functions on U for subset A are lkj : U → [0, 1], where

lA (x) =	kj
A

and Wkj (x) = |kj (x)∩A| such that k (x) is a j-near rough set in that contains x.
A	|kj (x)|	j
The following result is very interesting since it gives the relation between the rough j-membership functions and j-near rough membership functions. Moreover, it illustrates the importance of j-near rough membership functions.
Lemma  4.2. Let  ⟨U, 1, Cn⟩ be  a  5n – CAS,  and  A, B C U.  Then,  for  each j ∈ {r, l, i, u} and k ∈ {p, s, c}, the following is true in general:


Proof. (i) If l j (x) = 1, then Nj(x) C A,	∀x ∈ U. Thus x ∈ 1j(A) and this implies
x ∈ 1k(A)  which  is  a  j-near  rough  set  contained  in  A.  Accordingly,
lkj (x) = 1,	∀x ∈ U.

If l j (x) = 0, then Nj(x) ∩ A = Ø,	∀x ∈ U. But Nj(x) is a j-near rough set that contains x. h

A	A
lkj (x) = 0,	∀x ∈ U.
Remark 4.2.
According to the above results, we can prove that lkj is more accurate than
A
l j, this means that:
(1) If x ∈ A ⇒ l j (x) 6 lkj (x).	(2) If x R A ⇒ lkj (x) 6 l j (x).

The converse of Lemma 4.2 is not true in general. The following example illustrates Remarks 4.2.
Example 4.3. Let ⟨U, 1, Cn⟩ be a 5n – CAS, where U = {a, b, c, d} and
1= {(a, a), (a, b), (b, a), (b, b), (c, a), (c, b), (c, c), (c, d), (d, d)}.
We will show the above result in case of j = r and k = s the other cases similarly as follows:
First we have Nr(a) = {a, b} = Nr(b), Nr(c) = U, Nr(d) = {d}. Thus we can get. The	family	of	all	r-semi	rough	sets	is:
Sr(U) = {U, Ø, {a}, {d}, {a, b}, {a, d}, {a, c}, {c, d}, {a, b, c}, {a, b, d}, {a, c, d}}.
Now consider the subset A = {a, c}, then the r-rough membership functions of
A, x ∈ U are


But the r-semi rough membership functions of A, x ∈ U are
Wsr (a) =  |{a}∩ A| = 1, |{a, b}∩ A| = 1 , .. .  ⇒ lsr (a) = 1.


Wsr (b) =  |{a, b}∩ A| = 1 ,

Wsr (c) =  |{a, c}∩ A| = 1,
|{c, d}∩ A| = 1 , .. .  ⇒ lsr (c) = 1.

Wsr (d) =  |{d}∩ A| = 0, |{a, d}∩ A| = 1 , .. .  ⇒ lsr (a) = 0.
The j-near rough membership functions lkj allow us to define twelve different types of fuzzy sets in 5n – CAS as the following definition illustrates.
Definition  4.3. Let  ⟨U, 1, Cn⟩ be  a  5n – CAS,  and  A C U.  Then  for  each
j ∈ {r, l, i, u} and k ∈ {p, s, c}, the j-near fuzzy set in U is a set of ordered pairs:
k	kj
Aj = {(x, lA (x))|x ∈ U}.
Example 4.4. According to Example 4.3, the r-semi fuzzy set of a subset
A = {a, c} is
Aes =  (a, 1),  b, 1 , (c, 1), (d, 0) .
But the r-fuzzy set of a subset A = {a, c} is Aer = (a, 1), ÿb, 1 , ÿc, 2 , (d, 0)}.

Illustrative examples

The main goal of this section is to introduce two practical examples in order to illustrate the importance of applying near concept in rough context. In the first example we use an equivalence relation that induced from an information system and hence we compare between our approaches and Pawlak approach. In the sec- ond example, we apply our approaches in a multi-valued information system (MVIS) [14]. This type of information system is generalization to information sys- tem which uses an arbitrary binary relation and thus Pawlak approach does not fit in this type. Lin [10] introduced general rough membership function depending on an arbitrary binary relation, these rough membership function coincide with our j- rough membership function in the case of j = r only. But, the other types j of our j- rough membership functions are more accurate than j = r, so we can see that our approaches are the appropriate tools for these types and very useful in information analysis. Finally, in the second example we introduce a comparison between our approaches and Lin method.

Example 5.1. Consider the following information system as in Table 5.1 that represents the data about 6 students, as shown below.
From Table 5.1, we have.
The set of universe: U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6},




The	set	of	attributes:	AT = {Analysis, Algebra, Statistics} =
C ∪ {Decision} = D,
The	sets	of	values:	VAnalysis = {Bad, Good}, VAlgebra = {Bad, Good},
VStatistics = {Bad, Medium, Good} and VDecision = {Accept, Reject}.
But we take the set of condition attributes, C = {Analysis, Algebra, Statistics}.
Thus we have: U/C = {{1}, {2, 5}, {3}, {4}, {6}} and the set of r-pre rough set
is
Pr(U) = 9(U) (set of all subsets in U).
Suppose that X(Decision : Accept) = {1, 2, 3, 6}. Thus we compute the rough membership function with respect to Pawlak [13,14] and with respect to our approaches as follows:
Pawlak Definition [13,14] (rough membership function):


Our Definition (r-pre rough membership function):
Wpr (1) =  |{1}∩ A| = 1, |{1, 2}∩ A| = 1, .. .  ⇒ lpr (1) = 1,
Wpr (2) =  |{2}∩ A| = 1, |{2, 6}∩ A| = 1, .. .  ⇒ lpr (2) = 1,
Wpr (3) =  |{3}∩ A| = 1, |{3, 5}∩ A| = 1 , .. .  ⇒ lpr (3) = 1 and



Wpr (6) =  |{6}∩ A| = 1, |{6, 5}∩ A| = 1 , .. .  ⇒ lpr (6) = 1.
Moreover, for some elements that has decision (Reject) such that 5 we get:
In  Pawlak:  lC(5) = |{2,5}∩X| = 1,  that  is  5  may  be  belongs  to  the  set


X
X(Decision : Accept),
|{2,5}|	2

X = {1, 2, 3, 6} and this contradicts to Table 5.1.
But	in	our	definition:	we	have

Wpr (5)= n|{5}∩A| = 0,
|{5,6}∩A| = 1 , .. .o ⇒ lpr (5) = 0.

This means that 5 does not belongs to the set X(Decision : Accept) = {1, 2, 3, 6} which is coincide with Table 5.1. Hence, our approaches are more accurate than Pawlak definition.

Example 5.2. Consider the following multi-valued information system (MVIS) as in Table 5.2. Suppose we are given data about 5 persons, as shown below.
Where	11 = Languages = {English, German, Arabic},	12 = Sports =
{Handball, Basketball, Tennis}	and	13 = Skills =
{Swimming, Running, Fishing} such that x1ny, ∀n = 1, 2, 3.
We will use the case of j = r and k = c as follows:
a11 = {a, b},	b11 = {b},	c11 = {b, c, d},	d11 = {d},	e11 = {d, e},
a12 = {a, b, c},	b12 = {a, b, c},	c12 = {c},	d12 = {c, d},	e12 = {e} and

a13 = {a, b},	b13 = {a, b},	c13 = {c, d},	d13 = {d},	e13 = {d, e}.
In order to represent the set of all condition attributes, we generate the following

relation from all above relations as follows: x1=	3
a1= {a, b}, b1= {b}, c1= {c, d}, d1= {d}, e1= {e}.
x1n. Thus we get

Clearly, this relation is symmetry relation (reflexive and symmetric) but is not
transitive and thus it is not equivalence relation. Hence, Pawlak approach does not fit in this case, so we use Lin definition and our approaches as follows:




Suppose that X(Decision : Accept) = {a, c, d}. Thus.
Lin Definition [10] (rough membership function):


Our approaches (5n – CAS):
First, the relation 1 is 1= {(a, a), (a, b), (b, b), (c, c), (c, d), (d, d), (e, e)}.
Thus we get.
The  r-neighborhoods  of  all  elements  are:  Nr(a) = {a, b},  Nr(b) = {b},
Nr(c) = {c, d}, Nr(d) = {d}, Nr(e) = {e}.
The  l-neighborhoods  of  all  elements  are:  Nl(a) = {a},  Nl(b) = {a, b},
Nl(c) = {c}, Nl(d) = {c, d}, Nl(e) = {e}.
The i-neighborhoods of all elements are: Ni(a) = {a}, Ni(b) = {b}, Ni(c) = {c},
Ni(d) = {d}, Ni(e) = {e}.


It is clear that Lin rough membership function is the same as r-rough member- ship function. Moreover, our approaches l-rough (resp. i-rough) membership function is more accurate than r-rough membership function and Lin rough mem- bership function. Finally, we can also apply j-near rough membership function as in Example 5.1.



Conclusions and future works

In this work, we introduced one of an important topological application that named ‘‘near concepts’’ in rough context. Accordingly, different types of approx- imations (resp. rough membership relations and functions) were provided to be easy mathematical tools to classify the sets and help for measuring exactness and roughness of sets. These tools are more accurate than other types that were defined by others authors. Consequently, our approaches are very interesting in decision making. We believe that these structures are useful in the applications and thus these techniques open the way for more topological applications in rough context and help in formalizing many applications from real-life data. In our future works, we will apply the suggested methods in this paper in real life appli- cations and problems.
