Millions of Muslims come to Makkah in Saudi Arabia annually to perform Hajj, an Islamic pilgrimage ritual. Many government, private companies, and individuals provide various services and facilities to overcome difficulties that may be encountered by pilgrims. Currently, technology has gained increasing attention as a major means to provide services. In particular, mobile applications (apps) are contempo- rary technologies used provide various services. Several organizations and individuals developed a num- ber of Islamic apps that can be used on smart mobile devices to assist pilgrims to comfortably perform their Islamic rituals. This paper presents an analytical study of Hajj-related mobile apps offered by Google Play. The collected apps are analyzed using four main criteria, namely, services offered, languages supported, installation rates, and repetition of services and names of the app. The ‘‘Hajj ritual” service is found in 68.7% of the target apps, with English as the main language (51.7%). Apps supporting live video services are the most downloaded, with frequency exceeding one million times. Results also reveal a number of repetitive apps in terms of application names and services; for example, 12 apps use the same label ‘‘Hajj Guide,” and 11 application versions issued by the same publisher are found. Finally, a case study is performed to rate the quality of 10 apps selected based on five basic criteria, namely, engage- ment, functionality, aesthetics, information, and subjective quality. ‘‘Mutawef” and ‘‘Manasikana” apps have achieved the highest average scores, with 2.69 and 2.62 out of 3 acceptance rates, respectively.

Introduction

In Islam, all Muslims worldwide are requested to perform Hajj once in their lifetime as long as they have the capability to do so. Hajj is a ritual journey to Makkah and considered the fifth essential pillar in Islam. This ritual is conducted on the 12th month of the lunar Islamic calendar, namely, ‘‘Dhul Hijjah.” Hajj includes many rites, which must be performed according to the sequence of events. The rituals start by making intentions and wearing Ihram at Miqats before arriving in Makkah. Pilgrims then wait for the eighth day of Dhul Hijjah to move to Mina. On the ninth day of Dhul Hijjah, all pilgrims proceed to Arafat and stay until sunset before moving to Muzdalifah. Throwing of stones is performed in Al-Jamarat the 10th to 13th days of Dhul Hijjah. Finally, Hajj ends by performing farewell circling (Tawaf al-Wadaa) around the holy house (Ka’bah) and leaving Makkah. During this holy journey, many rituals must be performed in different places at a specific time. Fig. 1 shows a map of places where the Hajj rituals should be performed.
Many pilgrims also aim to visit Al-Madinah (the city of the pro- phet Mohammed, peace be upon him) before or after performing Hajj. The Umrah, another ritual related to Hajj, can be performed anytime through the year; however, many pilgrims perform this ritual directly before Hajj.
Many services, such as guidance, awareness, transportation, and accommodation, are required during Hajj and Umrah seasons because of the huge number of pilgrims and the diversity of rituals that they have to perform. Government and private agencies and individuals compete to provide services in different ways. Every year, new services are developed by exploiting advances in tech- nologies and service industries.
One of the modern technologies evolving is software applica- tions, commonly known as ‘‘apps,” for mobile devices. Hundreds of apps are available online on iPhone and Android platforms to help people who are planning to perform Hajj or Umrah. These apps should be studied and evaluated using specific criteria to maximize their benefits. However, different criteria of Islamic apps



have been rarely investigated and are thus the focus of the present research.
This paper is organized into two major parts. In the first part, all apps designed for Hajj and Umrah services and published by ‘‘Goo- gle Play,” are surveyed and analyzed. In the second part, the criteria of 10 apps selected are evaluated using a recently developed method, namely, mobile app rating scale (MARS) [15].
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 dis- cusses previous related works. Section 3 presents the proposed methodology. Section 4 provides an analysis and comparison of apps dedicated for Hajj and Umrah. Section 5 displays the results of the assessment of the apps. Section 6 concludes the paper.


Literature review

Scholars have designed and evaluated a number of mobile applications. Delikostidis et al [26] study the usability of mobile applications in virtual environments according to some criteria, such as efficiency and effectiveness of task completion, number of errors made by the users, and satisfaction while using the appli- cation. Moumane et al [27] performed an empirical study using a set of measures to evaluate the usability of mobile applications running on different mobile operating systems. A previous study by Harleen et al [28] elucidated key characteristics that define mobile applications to facilitate the delivery of exceptional, valu- able, and user-friendly mobile apps that satisfy the requirements of users.
A systematic literature review was conducted by Méndez et al
[30] to identify and accumulate evidence regarding automated testing of mobile applications. Usability is measured in terms of three attributes, namely, effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction; as such, other attributes, such as cognitive load, may be disre- garded. To address the limitations of existing usability models when applied to mobile devices, Rachel et al [31] proposed a usability model, namely, people at the center of mobile application development.

Scholars also reviewed mobile applications for a specific field. Various mobile applications have been developed for health ser- vices, such as cardiology [24], heart failure symptoms [25], and diabetes [35]. Another study conducted by Boudreaux et al [29] where seven strategies for evaluating and selecting health- related applications are proposed.
Mobile applications are also used in education, particularly in language learning [38,39], m-learning [41,42], and use of smart- phone applications by undergraduate students [40]. These applica- tions are also used to support children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders to enhance their abilities to understand, inter- act, and communicate with other people by using the Arabic lan- guage [34].
Studies investigated mobile applications for tourism [32,33] and for religious and spiritual services [36,37]. However, no study has reviewed mobile applications for pilgrimage.
Some researchers developed mobile applications for different Hajj and Umrah services. A number of master theses were con- ducted to build mobile applications to guide Malaysian pilgrims [1,11–14]. In another MSc thesis by Mayada [9], augmented reality was proposed to guide pilgrims. Ahmed et al [2,3] developed a mobile applications to help pilgrims read Hajj and Umrah prayers and understand their meanings by translating them into the lan- guage of the pilgrims. Akhlaq et al [4] proposed a framework that serves as a crowd-sourcing platform to define the requirements of pilgrims for services. The proposed framework uses mobile sensory data to define the context of the users. This framework was used to develop a mobile application for many spatio-temporal services. Also, a mobile application was proposed in [5] to serve as a dic- tionary for pilgrims who speak the Malay language. This applica- tion can translate among languages, namely, Malay, Arabic, and English.
In another study, Aladdein and Qasem [6] proposed the use of a mobile phone as a tracking device. This strategy can be used by the guide (Mutawwif) of a group of pilgrims to recognize their
movements and determine their location. Fathi and Christian [7] developed a dynamic signage system implemented as a mobile application to inform pilgrims about the crowd status around the Holy Ka’bah. This system can also be used as an automatic counter for the number of Tawaf rounds. Hasimah [8] proposed another mobile application that can be used to guide pilgrims when per- forming Hajj and Umrah services. The application also functions as location tracker and Tawaf counter. Location identification service for Hajj was proposed by Mohamed et al [10]. This mobile application service was developed to collect information about the location of pilgrims to identify and track them.
A recent study by Abdelazeez and Shaout [21] developed a mobile translation application to facilitate the communications between pilgrimages. This application is available in many lan- guages and employs text and voice recognition technologies to assist pilgrims in finding and displaying the translation of the tar- get words. Shaout and Khan [22] introduced the ‘‘Al-Hajj” mobile application to allow pilgrims to understand Hajj-related activities. The supported application exhibits four interactive features, namely, checklist, map, contact list, and motivational messages. The possibility of using smartphone apps to conduct surveys is studied by Alqahtani et al [23]. The study focused on collecting rel- evant data and information during mass gatherings, which play an important role in improving public health by reinforcing knowl- edge associated with disease prevention.
Based on this literature review, no study has evaluated and ana- lyzed mobile applications for Hajj and Umrah services. Hence, this study is of considerable importance.

Methodology

The research methodology used in this study consists of two parts as illustrated in Fig. 2. The first part presents a review of the properties of the Google Play apps. This part starts by review- ing the literature about the apps that are directed to Hajj and

Umrah rituals. Then, the apps that include the word ‘‘Hajj” in the title or description of the apps are studied during the period September 9–30, 2016. Afterward, data collection is built based on the app features where each app has its own record, including access date, app names, supported services and languages, pub- lisher name, the frequency of installation, and the reference that offered the apps. After the data collection, a statistical analysis is performed on four main criteria, namely, services provided, lan- guages supported, installation rates, and repetition cases. Finally, an analysis study of the collected app records is performed, and the results are reported.
The second part presents a case study for ten apps selected according to particular criteria. A questionnaire based on mobile app rating scale [16] evaluation criteria is prepared and sent to a number of contributors. The contributors who participated in this study have different experiences, backgrounds, and educational levels, thus enriching this evaluation study. Then, the question- naire data are collected to perform a statistical analysis. Finally, the achieved results are reported.

Hajj and Umrah mobile apps

A survey was conducted, during Hajj season (2016), for all apps supported by Google Play during the period September 9–30, 2016. The number of apps covered in this survey was 246, and the observed apps reached 51 services. Table 1 displays the various services provided by the apps targeted in this study and the num- ber of apps that share the same service.

Offered mobile application services

The results show that the ‘‘Hajj ritual” service has the largest portion compared with other services provided by the apps where the ‘‘Hajj ritual” service is found in 68.7% of targeted apps, followed by ‘‘Umrah ritual” and ‘‘supplications” with 47.5% and 32.5%, respectively. Moreover, ‘‘funeral provisions,” ‘‘Hajj portal,” ‘‘statis- tics,” and ‘‘crowd status” have the lowest portion of 0.4% for each. Each mobile application can contain one or more services, up to 23 services as found in the ‘‘Mutawef” apps. Fig. 3 shows the relation- ship between the numbers of apps that share a specific service.
Languages supported by mobile applications

The studied apps support 24 languages in total, covering the languages used by most of the Muslims around the world. In Fig. 4, more than 51.7% of the apps support the English language. Most of the apps support a single language. The results show that 87.4% of apps support only one language, 7.3% of apps support two languages, and 5.3% of apps support three to sixteen languages. The observed apps, the number of services supported, and languages supported are indicated in Appendix A, Table A.1. (Note that the keyword ‘‘multi” in the languages column means supporting more than two languages.)


Installation rates of mobile applications

A good indicator of the usability of a mobile application is the number of downloads, which is mainly due to providing a variety of services and languages. Fig. 5 shows the number of apps catego- rized by the number of downloads. This figure shows that most apps were downloaded between 10,000 and 50,000 times. We found that the least downloaded apps are non-free apps, such as the ‘‘Hajj player I URDU-INDIA” app.
Moreover, the results show that apps supporting live video ser- vices are the most preferred by users. The application ‘‘Watch Live Makkah 24 Hours HD,” which supports live video services, has been downloaded for over one million times. Furthermore, apps supporting images and wallpaper services are widely used and downloaded by over 100,000 times.


Repetitive apps

The results show that a number of apps that provide the same services and emerge from the same publisher are presented in Table 2. In addition, some apps have the same name (i.e., exact names) as depicted in Fig. 6. The phrase ‘‘Hajj Guide” is the most frequent application name used, reaching 12 times with different publishers and supported services. We consider that the matched phrases, such as ‘‘Hajj and Umrah,” ‘‘Hajj o Umrah,” and ‘‘Hajj & Umrah,” are different phrases.

Observation notes

In preparing this study for the apps offered in the Google store, we found a number of apps that are no longer available in the store during Hajj season 2016 (Table 3) despite some of these apps, such as ‘‘Mecca Hajj live wallpaper” app, having a high application
download frequency. We found that some of the missed apps con- tain special and interesting modern services, such as ‘‘augmented reality.” ‘‘Augmented reality” is not available in all studied apps. Moreover, the study relived a weakness in presenting interactive features, such as virtual communicating system (e.g., fatwa chat- ting), pilgrim crowd management, and real-time map updating.

Another important missed service is that no app can offer services to blind or low-vision users.

Case study: assessment of Hajj mobile apps

This section is directed to study and to evaluate some of the sur- veyed apps. A questionnaire is prepared to collect data from users for the selected apps. The criteria for selecting particular apps are discussed in the following subsection.

Mobile application selection criteria

Ten apps were selected as the case study. We selected the apps that fit the two criteria as follows:

Providing at least two services,
Published by governmental or private organizations; i.e., we exclude apps published by individuals and non-organizational agencies.

The selected apps and their relative information are presented in Table 4. As can be seen in the table, four out of ten apps pub- lished their last updated versions after starting Hajj activities in Hajj season 2016, and two apps published their last updated ver- sions during Hajj season 2015. The apps discussed in this study do not mean that they are the best among other offered apps.

Questionnaire design and data collection

After we determined the target apps, we prepared a survey to evaluate the quality of the selected apps. A number of methods are designed to evaluate different special purpose apps.


Table 3
Missed apps during Hajj season 2016.





Table 4




One of the useful methods used to assess apps is the MARS pro- posed by Stoyanov et al. [15]. The criteria defined in the MARS evaluation method can cover the main dimensions of the app qual- ity in our study. However, the MARS method is originally designed to rate the quality of mobile health apps and has been used in many recent studies [17–20].
The MARS method contains four categories, namely, engage- ment, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality, for assess- ing the quality of apps. Rating the apps according to these categories will provide better app evaluation compared with the user ratings in the app store. The subjective quality of each cate- gory contains a number of items as shown in Table 5.
The study is regarding the accuracy of the evaluation apps; therefore, the sample of this study is nominated according to their prior knowledge and experience in using different apps in general and for Islamic apps in particular.
Two groups of expert users were involved in evaluating the selected apps. Group A comprises of 10 specialists working as the custodians of the Two Holy Mosques Institute for Hajj and Umrah Research, whereas Group B consists of 11 specialists working in the Information Technology Center of the General Presidency of the Affairs of the Holy Mosque and the Prophet’s Mosque. The partici- pants of the questionnaire hold different academic degrees and practical experiences in their fields.

In this paper, we conducted a survey for the available Islamic apps related to Hajj and Umrah. The paper provided a detailed study of all features and services of the surveyed apps.
The behavior trends of the mobile application providers and users are studied. The results showed that most of the app provi- ders focused on developing Hajj and Umrah ritual services in a basic and non-interactive manner, whereas the attitudes of the

The result demonstrated that the most downloaded mobile application is for the live video service application, namely, ‘‘Watch Live Makkah 24 Hours HD,” with more than one million download times. Furthermore, the results for the popular downloaded apps
(apps that were downloaded more than 100,000 times) showed that

Analysis and discussion

We averaged the scores of the collected application surveys according to the MARS categories. Each MARS item uses a three- point scale, a score for each category is calculated as the mean of all belonging items, and the overall score is calculated as an aver- age across the categories.
Fig. 7 illustrates the total average score of each MARS category (engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information) for the selected app. The results demonstrate that the ‘‘Mutawef” app has the highest rank MARS scores with 2.73, and then ‘‘Mana- sikana” and ‘‘Salam” apps with 2.66 and 2.42, respectively. More- over, the results show that the ‘‘Smart Hajj” app has the lowest rank among others (1.02) because of disabling all its functions dur- ing the period of this study.
Fig. 8 depicts the average score of the ‘‘subjective quality” MARS score; the highest average is observed for ‘‘Mutawef” app with 2.55, then ‘‘Manasikana,” ‘‘Tarwiah,” and ‘‘Salam,” which reflects the overall satisfaction and acceptance of a user while using the app. The results also show that the average score of 4 out of 10 apps is below 1.5, indicating that the users are not feeling enjoy- able while using the app features.
apps supporting images and wallpaper services are the most widely used apps and are preferred by users. Furthermore, the least down- loaded apps are the non-free apps, such as ‘‘Hajj player I URDU- INDIA” app. Also, more than 87% of studied apps support only one language even though some of them include interesting features such as ‘‘Mutawef” and ‘‘Virtual Hajj & Umrah Guide 3D” apps.
This study also performed a case study for some apps selected according to specific criteria. The results showed that the ‘‘Mutawef” mobile application had the best average MARS score among the other apps with 2.73 out of 3, followed by ‘‘Mana- sikana” mobile application with 2.66 average MARS score. In addi- tion, the observed results revealed important issues regarding the overall satisfaction of the users in using the selected apps, where the average subjective quality score for some of the studied apps does not reach the mid-average score (1.5), which should be con- sidered in improving the provided services and functions in the future.
Finally, we expect that this study can provide good directions to researchers and application developers in improving the services provided for Muslim pilgrims and visitors and consider the most desirable features targeted and desired by users.
