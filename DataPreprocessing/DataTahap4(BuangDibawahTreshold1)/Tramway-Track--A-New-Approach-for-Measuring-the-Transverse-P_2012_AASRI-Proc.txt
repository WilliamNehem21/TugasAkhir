Then we detected some uncertainty areas along the point edges where the profile in the eight directions marked a rough variation or, in any case, a skip over a precise threshold level, localized by three constants [Ti, To, Ts]. Such constants are automatically determined by the algorithm in relation to the maximum, minimum and mean deviation values of the two profiles. In these areas, for each iterative step t the pixel values fill in the matrixes {Si} and {Gi}, well distinct from the matrixes {S} and {G} which instead are almost certainly background and rail. Therefore, at the iterative step t we have:
