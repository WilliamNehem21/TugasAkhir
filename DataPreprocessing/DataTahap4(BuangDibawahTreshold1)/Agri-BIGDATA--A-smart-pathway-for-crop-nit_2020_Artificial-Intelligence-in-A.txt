Big data provide a pathway to lower crop nitrogen inputs from genetic breeding to field production. Moreover, multidisciplinary efforts from plant health sensing, deep machine learning and cloud computing can integrate multi-source data to form information and knowledge. So big data analysis as a prospective optimal method, will make leaps towards addressing future issues of sustainable agriculture.

data service, a national agricultural science and education cloud plat- form has also been promoted and developed in China (http://njtg. nercita.org.cn/, n.d.). This platform has gathered various agricultural data and information resources to provide online learning, interactive communication and service docking for farmers. For nitrogen manage- ment, a scientific fertilizer prescription for strong or weak gluten wheat can be determined according to big data of crop gluten- associated phenotyping, meteorological, soil and farmland resources with while considering the optimization of fertilizer and water operations.

In addition, online social media (e.g., Twitter, Wechat, and Google Search) as an important source of big data, for example, to learn fertiliz- ing operation, collect fertilizer and grain market information. On the one hand, more and more users are timely sharing agriculture-related infor- mation (e.g., nutritional diagnosis, fertilization prescriptions, yield and quality, food consumption, profit information etc.). On the other hand, advanced production experience, consumer interests and food market- ing trends can be retrieved from social media platforms, which are valu- able references for farmers.
