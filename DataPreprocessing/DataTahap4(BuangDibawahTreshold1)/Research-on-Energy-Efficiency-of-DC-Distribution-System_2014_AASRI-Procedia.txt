Energy efficiency of DC distribution systems is researched in this paper. Efficiency calculation models of feeders and loads are established, efficiencies of AC/DC, DC/DC and DC/AC are analyzed. Moreover, energy efficiencies of an AC system and two DC systems, monopole and bipolar, are calculated and compared. The efficiency improvement of office building supplied by DC power system compared to supply by AC power system is demonstrated. From analysis, it is showed that the energy efficiency is higher in DC distribution system than AC distribution system.

Energy efficiency index of power feeder mainly include that active power loss, transmission efficiency, energy loss and loss rate of feeder. The calculation models of AC feeder, monopole DC feeder and bipolar DC feeder are compared as follows. The operating mode of DC feeder is metal loop operating mode.

In calculating, it is assumption that the losses of feeders in the building are neglected. On the basis of calculating models of loads and loads daily curves, the energy loss of building and main loads on one day can be calculated, the results are presented by Tab.3.

Compared to AC feeder and monopole DC feeder, bipolar DC feeder has the highest efficiency through calculating the models. And the efficiency of office building is higher when supplied by DC power than supplied by AC power. The efficiency of office building has ascended about 14.90%. Furthermore, the theoretical basis that DC supply system replaces AC supply system in office building is provided.
