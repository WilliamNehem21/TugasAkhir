Also multi-objective optimization has been put up for many years, the application of multi-objective optimization to solve engineering problems never decay. The most important thing in solving multi-objective optimization engineering problems is find the Pareto-optimal solutions. On many occasions, there are no Pareto- optimal solutions [1-3]. So it is imminent to find a good way to solve multi-objective optimization problems. In recent decades, there appeared many algorithms, such as ant colony, genetic, particle swarm, artificial fish- swarm, and the corresponding improved algorithms etc.

The goal of multi-objective optimization is to find the optimize value. While the game theory, is to find each game party's own maximum profit. They have the same similarity: finding the Pareto solution. Game theory is used to solve multi-objective optimization problems, especially in engineering fields. Based on the game party's behavior, game theory can be divided into cooperative, selfish and non-cooperative game.
