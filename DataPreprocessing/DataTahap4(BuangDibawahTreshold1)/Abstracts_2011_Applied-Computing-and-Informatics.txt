Abstract: This paper addresses the adaptation of Arabic speech recognition sys- tems to foreign accented speakers. This adaptation is accomplished by using the adaptation techniques; namely, the Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR), the Maximum a posteriori (MAP), and the combination of MLLR and MAP. The LDC-WestPoint Modern Standard Arabic corpus and HTK toolkit were used throughout all experiments. The systems were evaluated using both word and phoneme levels. Results show that particular Arabic Phonemes such as pharyngeal and emphatic consonants, that are hard to pronounce for non-native speakers, benefit from the adaptation process using MLLR and MAP combination. An overall improvement of 7.37% has been obtained.

Abstract: The outlook for e-commerce and e-government depends not only on individuasl acceptance of Internet technologies as viable transaction means, but also on the recognition of the Web as a reliable milieu. In light of this, a comprehensive model describing the factors that drive individuals to accept on-line transactions over the Web was developed and tested. This study attempts to integrate the well-established technology acceptance model (TAM) with three constructs; namely trust, credibility and risk, which are of paramount impor- tance in predicting individual acceptance of on-line transactions.
