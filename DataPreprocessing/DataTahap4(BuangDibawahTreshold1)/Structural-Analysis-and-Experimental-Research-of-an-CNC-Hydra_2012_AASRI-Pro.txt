The frame's underside is full-constrained based on the actual situation. Two reference points, whose degrees of freedom are constrained only to rotate around the X axis in local coordinate system, are established at the centers of left and right plate of tool carrier and coupled with two holes separately. In order to remove rigid displacement of the tool carrier, translation constraint of y, z directions are applied to the contact point between the cylinders and tool carrier in the global coordinate system[7]. The frame bed-body is meshed with tetrahedral element, while the beams and tool carrier are meshed with hexahedral element.

15 points are arranged along the static tool apron and coupled with the underside and front of the static tool apron. Shearing force and shear thrust are respectively applied and divided into 16 load steps. The inheritance between forces are abolished by setting in the load manager to make the forces taking effects in their single steps[8].

When the shearing force and horizontal thrust haven't been applied in step-1, the minimum stress occurring at the throat fillet is 71.71MPa, while the minimum displacement occurring at the top place in the front vertical plate of the frame is 0.1634mm.

Informations can be drawn from the comparison that the results of analysis and test have value gaps around 20% because of taking the environmental influences from test site into account. Such as the shearing force is calculated based on traditional empirical formula, whose value is bigger than actual value and leads to greater shear stress in later finite element analysis. The overall data are within the allowed range except individual testing points. The conclusion can be drawn that the forgoing finite element method[9] is reliable and the calculation results of maximum stress of throat fillet are also accords with the actual working mode.
