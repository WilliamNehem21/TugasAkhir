Biomass energy constitute a major role in global energy supply from renewable source as it contributes 67.86% of the current energy levels. [Rogner et.al.,2000]. Tar content in producer gas is undesirable which makes pavement for serious problems in the the IC engine applications. [Parikh et.al.,1995]. Numerous works

have been reported in the view to reduce the wear of the engine[Kuapp et.al.,1984]. The magnitude of tar and particulate content in the producer gas was postulated as less than 100 mg/Nm3 and less than 50 mg/Nm3 respectively for IC engine applications.[Bhatacharya S.C et.al.,1999].

However, to the author's knowledge design and development of a compact Bio-filter system without pre- heating has not been addressed do far. Moreover, increasing the efficiency beyond 90 % is also a difficult task. In this work, an effort has been made to develop a new compact Bio-filter system, which has a better efficiency.

The bio materials used in the compact Bio-filter system for three different layers are wet scrubber, wet charcoal and dry coconut coir with different dimensions. In the first section, the raw producer gas is collected, and cooled by the counter water flow which removes most of the dust particles and limited quantity of tar. Then the gas is expanded and its velocity is reduced to remove the tar which is settled in filter bed of the second section. The last section is used for condensing the moisture content of gas and removing the tar left behind.
