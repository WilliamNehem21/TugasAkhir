The analysis, design and implementation of a zero voltage switched multi output push-pull topology is presented in this paper. To double the secondary output a voltage doubler circuit is introduced in each secondary winding of the multi output transformer. The voltage doubler introduced also helps in obtaining ZVS in the passive switches at the secondary of the transformer. To further add on the advantage of increased power packing density UC3825 an analog controller is deployed in the hardware prototype to regulate the output voltage against supply and load disturbances
