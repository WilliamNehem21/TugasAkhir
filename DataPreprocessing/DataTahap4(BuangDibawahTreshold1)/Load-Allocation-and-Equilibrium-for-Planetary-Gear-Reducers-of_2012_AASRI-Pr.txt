Here, T1 is the torque produced by the soil shear force. T2 is the shear torque generated by the cutting heads cutting the soil. T3 is the frictional resistance torque produced by the cutter-head driving the sediment seal. T4 and T5 are the torque generated by the axial and radial load, respectively. T6 is the torque done by the stirring bar agitating the soil. K is safety coefficient. T is the needed torque driving the cutter-head. The concrete
