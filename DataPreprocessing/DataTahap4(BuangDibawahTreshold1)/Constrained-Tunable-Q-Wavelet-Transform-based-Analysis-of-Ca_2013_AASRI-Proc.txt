The cardiac sound signals contain a lot of information about the functioning of heart valves and hemodynamics. Detection of heart valve disorders either by visual scanning of cardiac sound signal or auscultation needs thorough skills and long term experience. The presence of murmurs is often associated with pathology of the heart valves [1]. Thus, detection of murmurs in the cardiac sound signals is an important part for the diagnosis of heart valve disorders.

Where n is the range of signal amplitude, pn is the probability of the signal having amplitude an. In this study, the probability density function of the reconstructed murmurs is estimated over the discrete values of an by using histogram technique. For the signal samples, say N, the amplitude range of signal is linearly divided into m bins such that the ratio m/N remains constant. In this study, the ratio m/N is kept at 0.01.
