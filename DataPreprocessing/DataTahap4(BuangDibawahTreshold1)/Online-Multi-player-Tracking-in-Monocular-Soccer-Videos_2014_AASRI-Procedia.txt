In principle, our approach is similar, but we use soccer-specific knowledge to automatically detect players without an exhaustive sliding-window approach. Our observation model is partially based on the ideas of ASPOGAMO [6], but incorporates more universal features, such as the HOG detector, and does not need any human-guided initialization. It is similar to the method proposed by [7], which is, however, a stand-alone player detection and does not incorporate tracking information over time.

Unsupervised generation of color templates. According to the FIFA rules [10], the colors of the jerseys have to be chosen so that the players from different teams, the referees, and the goal keepers are all pairwise distinguishable. We make use of this fact by initially determining color templates for each type of outfit, based on color histograms.

current position and determine the position with the highest confidence value. If this value is higher than the value at the current position, the iteration continues, starting at the best position. Otherwise, the iteration stops with the current position as the result. Usually, our efficient greedy approach stops after 2-3 iterations and shows, however, satisfactory results.

We perform multi-target tracking by applying a single-target Kalman filter [1] for each tracked bounding box. A new measurement is generated by an optimization step with respect to the confidence map using the Kalman prediction as the starting position. The detection of new and lost targets is performed with the help of deterministic heuristics, which are guided by the confidence map.
