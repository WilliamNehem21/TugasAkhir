2D writing process recurring is used to demonstrate writing process by 2D animation method. It is helpful for learner to master the right stroke order. In tradition way, showing the writing process is often given by teacher face to face. The shortcoming of traditional way is that the writing process demonstrated by teacher cannot cover all the characters in calligraphic class and if someone wants to see the demonstration more times it will make teacher boring.

Copying writing is a traditional method to learn how to use tip of a writing brush to write different shape at the start point, at the corner or at the end of a stroke. The evaluation rule of copying writing is that more similar with the original image is better. As writing brush is made of soft material and it can easily change shape and stroke thickness with different direction and pressure during the writing process. But in our App it is difficult to achieve as iPad screen is without pressure sensor. To simulate stroke thickness change, we use the writing speed as an import factor which will affect stroke thickness. An assumption is made that the writing speed and stroke width have an inverse relationship. The following formula presents the detail between stroke width and writing speed:
