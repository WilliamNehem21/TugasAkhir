The current use of fossil fuels is rapidly depleting the natural reserves. The natural formation of coal and oil however, it is a very slow process which takes ages. Therefore, a lot of research efforts are put into finding renewable fuels nowadays to replace fossil fuels. Renewable fuels are in balance with the environment and contribute to a far lesser extent to the greenhouse effect.

Biogas is a renewable fuel and an energy source that can be applied in many different settings. It is defined as a combustible gas mixture produced by the anaerobic fermentation of biomass by bacteria and takes several days to form. In nature, the fermentation process occurs in places where biological material is fermented in an oxygen deprived environment such as swamps.

The main sources of biogas from human activities are domestic garbage landfills, fermentation of manure and raw sewage. The advantage of processing these waste products anaerobically, compared with aerobically, is the larger decrease in volume of wastes. For this reason, the industry nowadays prefers anaerobic fermentation to process waste streams.

The integrated scenario start by introducing the flow of raw gas, and its quality regarding CH4, CO2 and H2S content, this is the first step. The second step is the role of SBDS to make all calculations regarding the four different levels to obtain the PBT and the CO2 avoided emissions. Those four levels are: biogas treatment, treated biogas valorization, energy generated and finally the energy delivery. Normally we can have two kinds of energy recovered from biogas valorization: heat and power, Technical document, 2006. But we can add a fourth level which is the kind of energy delivered into the natural gas network called bio-methane. The final step is the data output and their graphical representations.
