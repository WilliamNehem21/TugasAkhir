system. It can produce neuronal circuits of self-excitation sustained behavior, such as walking, breathing, chew, etc. And it is the center control unit of the rhythmic motion[1]. Spinal cord interneurons play an important role in the body motion control and sensory processing. They provide not only the plasticity for the restructuring of the spinal cord loop but also play a vital role in recovery of spinal cord injured (SCI) patients. Theoretically, if we exert direct stimulation at some points or sensory input in the uninjured spinal cord CPG loop, rhythmic motion under damaged parts can be restored [2],[3]. We think that the diverse positions of the excitatory neurons in the spinal cord result in the diversity of potential distribution on spinal cord surface. In return, if we know the relationship between the location of the excitatory neuron and the regularity of potential distribution on spinal cord surface, then we can locate the excitatory neuron in the spinal cord through regularity of potential distribution on spinal cord surface we obtained before.

After the three-dimensional model of the spinal cord was built we set electrical conductivity properties of tissues. Because the resistance effect of nerve fiber is much greater than the capacitance effect of spinal cord, so the latter can be neglected. The conductivity of gray matter is 0.23 S/m and the conductivity of white matter is 0.60S/m (vertical), 0.083 S/m (horizontal).
