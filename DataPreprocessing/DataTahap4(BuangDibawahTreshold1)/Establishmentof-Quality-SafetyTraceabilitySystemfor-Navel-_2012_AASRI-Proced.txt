Traceability system has been an import means in food quality and safetymanagement. Governments in many countries are putting increasing emphasis onestablishment of food traceability systems. According to production, processing, storage and distribution of the featureagricultural products----navel orange in the central mountain area of China,this article proposes the technology line and the main result of the research of traceability forqualitysafetyof navel orange.

Navel orange is a kind of feature agricultural products in the central mountain area of China. It mainly distributes in the Gannan area of Jiangxiprovince. Gannan navel orange is the most special product in Jiangxi citrus production and has been an import means in increasing income of peasants. But, the quality safety incidents of navel orange in recent years have dealt a blow to navel orange's reputation and cause great

Quality and safety of Orange tracking and tracing technology decompose the overall architecture from three levels of the information collection, information processingand information services. In the information collection layer, through sorting out process from planting to harvesting and the process of production of the navel orange product, we investigate their business processes, analysis hazards, explore and determine factors which affects the quality and safety of navel orange, and get product processing, quality inspection, logistics and marketing and other aspects of quality and safety information which basedon processing and production of enterprises, build traceability data center of navel orange, and provide data support to achieve the ultimate traceability. In the information processing layer, using HACCP(1)and other quality management methods and tools toanalyze and determine key factors of the quality and safety indicators of navel orange. Using the encoding information technology, information exchange, management and hardware R & D of digital

Based on place of origin code, EAN / UCC standards, a quality tracking and tracing of Orange coding system, combined with internal production processes, has beenstudied and designed. This includes raw materials, origin code, the batch production at the core of all aspects of code orange, and final product quality and safety traceability code.Itprovides the basis support with forming a complete retrospective navel oranges.
