Various relevant channel selection methods proposed in the literature are reviewed. In (Lei et al., 2009), the CSP filter bank is constructed through the division of recording channels and common spatial pattern ensemble (CSPE) classifier is applied to improve classifier performance. A filter approach using mutual information (MI) maximization for EEG channel selection has been proposed in (Lan et al., 2005), to rank the EEG channels so that the MI between the selected sensors and class labels is maximized. In (Ramoser et al., 2000), the EEG trials are weighted for each subject, where very low weights indicate those trials as artifacts or

The common spatial pattern is used as spatial filters in BCI. CSP filters are good at detecting the range of sensorimotor rhythms and discerning the mental states. The spatial filters are designed to maximize the variance of signals of one class and at the same time reduce the variance of signals of the other class. The main idea is to use a linear transform to project the multichannel EEG data into low dimensional spatial subspace. Each row of the projection matrix consists of weights for the channels. CSP is based on simultaneous diagonalization of the covariance matrices of two classes. The diagonalization process leads
