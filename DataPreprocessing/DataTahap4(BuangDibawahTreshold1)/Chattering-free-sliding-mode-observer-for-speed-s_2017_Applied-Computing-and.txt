obtained using expert engineering knowledge in the navigation field and satisfying the above-mentioned stability and reaching conditions. The FLS output is calculated based on singleton fuzzification strategy, center-average defuzzification and pro- duct inference. At each input values the FLC gives an output signal corresponds to the increase or decrease in sliding func- tion (Fs) to satisfy the dynamic stability of the observer.

the core loss, copper loss and mechanical frictions. As a result, the stator winding resistances increase. The main purpose of this test was to examine the robustness of the proposed obser- ver in case of doubling the motor resistance. This test was done by connecting 1 X resistor in series with the stator winding, and a speed step reference from 400 rpm to 4000 rpm.
