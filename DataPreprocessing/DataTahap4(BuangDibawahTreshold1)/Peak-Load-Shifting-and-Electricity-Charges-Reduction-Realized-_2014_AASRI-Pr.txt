Vehicle to Grid (V2G) and Vehicle to House (V2H) produce the mutual benefit to the power grid operators and EV owners. The power grid operators can utilize available surplus electric power of EV, and EV owners can use EV battery as household battery [2]. Discharging EV batteries in case of high power demand is very efficient to reduce power supply from the grid [3]. The power grid operators must add extra power plant to meet the peak power demands when EVs are widespread and connected at the same time. Therefore, the charge/discharge control scheme of EVs have been studied to satisfy the power demands of EVs, and to supply from EVs to grid when the power demand is high. Further, as a method for reducing the peak demand, the real time pricing (RTP) that electric power price varies corresponding to the amount of power demand is studied [4]. Therefore, EV owners will sell electric power from the EV at high prices during peak electricity demand. Discharge to the grid from EV aggressively is expected to reduce the energy cost of home.

We apply Just Generation Gap Real-coded Ensemble Crossover Algorithm (JGG-REX algorithm) [6] to control deposited power to minimize home electricity charges. JGG-REX is one of the genetic algorithms, and has powerful search capability at high speed and ability to cope with large-scale. To use JGG-REX, objective function and constraints are described by Java language. In JGG-REX algorithm, generating individuals is
