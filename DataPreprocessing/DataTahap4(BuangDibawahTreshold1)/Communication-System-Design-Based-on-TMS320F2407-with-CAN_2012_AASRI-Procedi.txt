The definitions of man-machine interaction are extensive. Simply stated, it is a very important technology All The Controller Area Network (CAN) is a serial communications protocol which efficiently supports distributed realtime control with a very high level of security. Its domain of application ranges from high speed networks to low cost multiplex wiring. In automotive electronics, engine control units, sensors, anti- skid-systems, etc. are connected using CAN with bitrates up to 1Mbit/s. At the same time it is cost effective to

With the rapid development of the robot, robot applied in security is increasing. Security robot applies in some large security meetings and related units, responsible for important occasions security work. A kind of security robots has travel mechanism with wheel structure, the movement of the drive wheels was driven by two sets of servo motor, while Communication Design of the drive wheels control system is CAN bus. There are two nodes in CAN bus, Connected to a motor drive respectively. Motor drive connected servo motor
