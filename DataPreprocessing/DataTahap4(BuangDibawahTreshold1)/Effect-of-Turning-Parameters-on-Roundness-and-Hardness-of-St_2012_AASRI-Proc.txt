study. Lei Zhang et al.[8] analyzed hardness layer depth of alloy steel by grinding process. Fu X.L. et al.[9] investigated surface hardening for aluminum alloy in high speed milling. Therefore, turning of stainless steel:JIS SUS 303 was interesting. The study of factors that affected to the quality of turning was important. Thus, the propose of this research was to investigate the factors that affected to roundness and hardness of turning a stainless steel :JIS SUS 303

The actual experiment was randomly run with two replicates. The machined specimens were measured for roundness that using average value and for hardness with Rockwell scale B as responses. The measuring was done by three positions on machined surface. Data were analysed by statistical methods to finding the effect of factor on roundness and hardness.

The appropriate levels of experiment, initial setting factors, were determined. The results were tested by the normality test. The result of normality test was showed that significantly normal. It means that the experimental factors have been appropriate levels. The mainly outcome of this experiment was main factors and factor interactions that affected to roundness and hardness, as following below.

This research was to study the turning parameters that affected to roundness and hardness of turning stainless steel SUS 303. As the result of the experiment, it could be conclude that cooling was mainly affected to the roundness. Non-cooling cutting or dry-cutting would cause of worse quality for roundness. It means that cooling on turning was the better process for quality of roundness.

Moreover, hardness of surface after turning was studied. It was found that hardness was not influenced by cutting speed, feed rate and cooling or non-cooling. The hardness of stainless steel SUS 303 specimen between raw surface and machined surface was not significantly difference.
