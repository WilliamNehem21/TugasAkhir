Multigraphs may be of two types: undirected multigraphs and directed multigraphs. In an undirected multigraph the edge (i, j) and the edge (j, i), if exist, are obviously identical unlike in the case of directed multigraph. For a latest algebraic study on the theory of multigraphs, the work [14] and also [4, 11, 13] may be seen.

For a given node u, if Iu  and at least one member of Iu is non-null at a given time, then the node u is called a communicable node for that instant of time. If u does not have any neighbor node then Iu = , and in that case it is trivial that further communication is never possible. However, if Iu  and all the members of Iu are null vectors at a point of time, then it signifies that further communication is not possible temporarily.
