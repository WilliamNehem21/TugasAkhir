This paper addresses the problems, connected with calculation of the electric field and analysis of surface flashover of node tank SF6 circuit breaker. Namely, the gap between the grounded tank unit, a filter system and a conductive system is receiving input power. The paper also provides the recommendations for change SF6 circuit breaker design.

SF6 circuit breaker insulation system design can be of two kinds with gas gap or along the surfaces of solid dielectrics. The discharge conditions of along the surfaces of solid dielectrics differ significantly from the discharge conditions in the gas gap and it can be the main factor in determining the circuit breaker geometric dimensions. In operation, the insulation system must withstand the normalized AC voltage and normalized overvoltages.

The results obtained indicate insufficient dielectric strength design, even for a gap in the unpolluted particles and decomposition products in SF6. The gas gap dielectric strength a-b is slightly greater than the withstand test voltage. Discharge voltage along the surface of the solid dielectric d-e is 0.77 of the withstand test voltage. Possible discharge path c-d-e-f is represented of electric line of force in the investigated gap, however, as shown in [5] the discharge gap along the surface of the dielectric may have another way.

In this paper, based on the discharge streamer inception criterion of tank circuit breaker electric strength is calculated. The results obtained indicate insufficient dielectric strength of this design. The theoretical results obtained during the lightning impulse test of breaker insulation are confirmed experimentally. At the moment, dielectric strength by varying the gap from 82 to 100 mm is increased.
