Ta, D.-N. et al. propose an SURF based method to track the object in video[8], and SURF descriptor is used to optimize similarity search of interest points. The experimental result shows that the algorithm of SURF features extracting has smaller calculation and faster than SIFT.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, SURF features matching algorithm is introduced. We describe our hardware design for tracking system In Section 3. In Section 4, experiments are presented and we conclude the paper in Section 5.

The steps of SURF algorithm contain three sections: interest points detecting, interest points describing and interest points matching. Interest points detecting uses a detector based on Hessian matrix, its stability and repeatability outperforms the existing state-of-the-art, e.g. a detector based on Harris. Interest points describing uses Haar wavelet[9] to reduce the computational cost and enhance the robustness. The Block filtering to generate the second order Gaussian filtering approximately and the integral image to accelerate convolution, reduce the computational complexity and increases speed.

According to SURF algorithm, interest points are detected at different scales, expecially for the reason that similarity searching often depends on their comparison in images where they are detected at different scales[6].Generally, scale spaces are usually implemented as an image pyramid. In SRUF, block filters are used to approximate the Gaussian kernel, and the computational cost is independent of its size, which is critical for speed.

In this paper, we proposed a SURE based object tracking algorithm, in which interest points in the defined object are matched between consecutive frames by calculating the Euclidean distance between their descriptor vectors. We calculate the barycenter of the interest points as the candidate match displacement, which increase the detector's repeatability. We implement the proposed algorithm on an embedded platform with TI's DM6446 high performance processor. The experimental results show our system implements a real-time tracking with robustness against appearance variations, scale change, and cluttered scenes
