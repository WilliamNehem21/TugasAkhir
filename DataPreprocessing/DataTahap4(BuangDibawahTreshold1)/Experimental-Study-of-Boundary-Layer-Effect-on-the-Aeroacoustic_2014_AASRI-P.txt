Oscillation caused by flow over Cavity can increase the drag greatly and even lead to structural vibration and fatigue damage. To identify the oscillation from noise generation mechanism accurately is essential and urgent. For the study of the flow in cavity, since the 1950s, many foreign experimental studies have been carried out. Since the 1980s, numerical simulation is more used in studies related to the mechanism of cavity flow and noise analysis. In China, the study for cavity flow starts only in recent years, and works mainly in the field of numerical simulation for small scale cavity. The aerodynamic center carried on experimental corresponding study of flow characteristics and acoustic characteristics for subsonic and supersonic cavity. Certain research results[1-7] show that the cavity geometric parameters such as length to depth ratio L / D, the aspect ratio W / D, and flow parameters such as Mach number Ma or other effects of the cavity shear layer instability, thereby affecting the flow types and noise spectral characteristics.

When the low speed turbulent flow pass through the rectangular cavity, the flow inside the cavity is very complex, and the pressure spectrum produced by the cavity contains both broad band noise and pure tones. The cavity experimental platform was built in a low-turbulence wind tunnel; conducted experiments to measure the cavity flow noise and to provide validate data for numerical simulation. This article focuses on the effect of changing boundary layer profiles in the cavity inlet on the aeroacoustic characteristics of cavity flow. With the measurement method of wall pressure sensors, microphones and hotwire, based on the open cavity of length-to depth ratio 2 and 4, the inlet boundary layer profile was changed through different block installation methods. The acoustic properties of cavity in different inlet boundary layer flow state were obtained, providing a basis for cavity flow noise suppression research.
