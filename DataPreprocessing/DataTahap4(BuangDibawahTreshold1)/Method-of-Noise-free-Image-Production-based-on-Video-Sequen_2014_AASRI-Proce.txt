Let us consider this algorithm functioning in details. Suppose, we have two black and white (monochromic) images, ImageRef and ImageCurrent. Each image is represented as HxW elements matrix. It is necessary to find a transformation of ImageCurrent matrix into ImageRef matrix which would minimize the luminance difference of the images (with minimal luminance difference of the images).
