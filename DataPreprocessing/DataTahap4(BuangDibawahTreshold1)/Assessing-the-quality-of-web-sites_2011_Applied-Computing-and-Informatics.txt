Abstract This paper reviewed the most recent evaluation criteria methods which were used in different e-business services. Furthermore, it proposes general criteria for evaluating the quality of any website regardless of the type of service that it offers. The dimensions of the criteria are content quality, design quality, organization quality, and user-friendly quality. These dimensions together with their comprehensive indicators and check list can be used by web designers and developers to create quality websites to improve the electronic service and then the image of any organization on the Internet.

driving the global economics but also transforming societies into knowledge-based economics all over the world. In the last few years, the Internet has shown a rapid growth in terms of commercial trade volume, which led to a new definition of almost all aspects of business. The deployment of recent information and commu- nication technologies enabled firms to provide higher quality services, lower prices for customers, and increase the profit margins for business. Also, the new technol- ogy created new trends in business and produced new era in business, finance, and economics (Sui and Rejeski, 2002; UNCTAD/WTO and JEDCO, 2001).

The Internet created a new business environment, far different from anything that has come before, enabling any company to conduct its entire set of business processes and practices online (Vlosky and Westbrook, 2001). E-business is any business process performed via an Internet-based, computer-mediated network (Moodle et al., 2000). There are many categories of e-business; for example Busi- ness to Business (B2B), Business to Consumer (B2C), Consumer to Business (C2B), and Consumer to Consumer (C2C). E-business and e-commerce tend to be used interchangeably leading to policy incoherence.

In the last decade, numerous studies have focused on the designs of websites for general information seeking purposes and for electronic commerce purposes (Zhang and Dran, 2001). The design and commercial development of websites are very critical to e-commerce success (Barnes and Vidgen, 2002). Numerous practitioner reports and reviews have been published seeking to identify the good and bad features of websites. Site reviews range from theoretical and scientific opinions to surveys of successful sites and features to existing successful e-busi- ness. Although, there has been a significant research on supporting electronic com- merce, most of the existing empirical research focusing on success factors of websites is mainly exploratory in nature (Liu and Arnett, 2000). Up to our knowl- edge, there is no standard framework or benchmark defining website effectiveness (Basu, 2002).

This paper reviewed the most recent evaluation criteria methods which were used in different websites, and proposes a general comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of any web service regardless of the type of service that it offers. The remaining of the paper is as follows. Section 2 gives a brief review of the previous work. Section 3 discusses and analyzes the proposed framework. Section 4 defines the dimensions of the proposed framework and its indicators. Section 5 concludes the paper and suggests some future work.

As the dependency on web services increases, the need to assess characteristics with website quality and success increases. Websites characteristics are important; they have been a constant concern of research in different domains and they were widely studied in the e-commerce literature (Hasan and Abuelrub, 2006). Although there has been a significant research on supporting e-commerce, many existing empirical studies focusing on the quality of websites is mainly exploratory in nature. Most of the current studies are either dealing with a limited number of quality factors or directed toward a specific web service. Thus, while there should be a considerable number and variety of factors associated with web site success, little research exists about the combination of these factors and services. Recently, research and studies are accumulating including different models and/or frame- works to evaluate the quality and performance of websites. We categorized the previous studies that investigated the quality dimensions of websites according to the type of service that the website offers; for example business and commercial, educational, banking, governmental, and others. This section briefly reviews the previous studies according to the website service.

Educational websites were also studied from many different perspectives. Zhang and Dran (2001) developed a theoretical framework for evaluating web- site quality from a user satisfaction perspective. Others concentrated on some specific features of websites. For example Lautenbach et al. (2006) developed a framework to measure usability of websites, while Yoo and Jin (2004) inves- tigated and evaluated the design of university websites. Other researchers, while assessing the university websites took in consideration other features. Osborne and Rinalducci (2002) designed the criteria to evaluate web resources for utilization within the context of scholarly research within the discipline of the art history. Singh and Sook (2002) attempted to find solutions to user prob- lems and involved evaluating South African university websites on certain factors.

Governmental websites were studied from different perspectives. Zhang and Dran (2001) developed a theoretical framework for evaluating website quality from a user satisfaction perspective through theoretical and empirical investiga- tions. While Krauss (2003) identified seventeen comprehensive quality dimensions that can be used to rate website quality features that are important to e-govern- ment websites, other researchers concentrated on other features. For example Kokkinaki et al. (2005) presented a framework for evaluating existing e-govern- ment initiatives in Cyprus. It includes content characteristics, design characteris- tics, and common features of e-government websites. Choudrie et al. (2004) described the issues related to the accessibility, quality, and privacy of government

web using a common set of performance metrics and web diagnostic tools which are WebXact, Ntmechanic, and Vizcheck. Ma and Zaphiris (2003) studied the usability and content accessibility of UK e-government websites and investigated whether they are ranked high in terms of accessibility. The usability and accessi- bility of fifty selected UK e-government websites were measured using two auto- matic evaluation tools, Bobby and LIFT. Abanumy et al. (2005) investigated the issue that makes a website accessible and explored the importance placed on web accessibility with respect to e-government websites.

Other researchers addressed other kinds of web services from different perspec- tives. Lin and Joyce (2004) studied different e-commerce models of online auction websites. Six critical success factors for a successful online auction website were identified. They include design and content, consumer education, security, cus- tomer support, online community, and market positioning. Barnes and Vidgen (2001) deployed WEBQUAL in the domain of Internet auctions and identified three quality dimensions; information, interaction, and site design. Lim (2002) evaluated the impact of four relevant factors to e-shopping; usefulness, ease of use, enjoyment, and security. Results showed that perceived ease of use and use- fulness of the e-shopping website have a significant direct impact on the success of the site.

The objective of this research is to develop a theoretical, comprehensive, and mea- surable framework for assessing the quality of websites in order to provide straight forward criteria to encourage improvements of website design and its implemen- tation. Furthermore, we aim to develop a framework that is capable of reliable applications across a broad range of websites regardless of the service they pro- vide. A multi-phase approach was adopted that included a wide range of literature review, review of leading sites, identification of success factors from research and industry literature, comparison of factors with published industry scoring studies, and using our own experience in the field. Our process overlaid industry and aca- demic research to identify quality factors in order to meet the objectives of this research.

Common dimensions that were used to assess the quality of educational web- sites were concentrated on currency, accuracy and comprehensibility of informa- tion, ease of use, clear layout of websites, and an attractive design (Lautenbach et al., 2006; Osborne and Rinalducci, 2002; Singh and Sook, 2002; Yoo and Jin, 2004; Zhang and Dran, 2001). Common dimensions that were used to assess the quality of banking websites focused on ease of use, customization, internal search function, security of transactions, aesthetic effects, and useful interaction between users and websites in order to get instant feedback from website to user (Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Awamleh and Fernandes, 2005; Diniz et al., 2005; Guru et al., 2001; Paynter and Chung, 2002; Vijayan and Shanmugam, 2003; Wenham and Zaphiris, 2003; Zhang and Dran, 2001). Common dimensions that were used to assess the quality of governmental websites are quick response time, up-to-date, accurate information, effective search tool, easy to understand, and secure trans- actions (Abanumy et al., 2005; Choudrie et al., 2004; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Krauss, 2003; Ma and Zaphiris, 2003; Zhang and Dran, 2001). Common dimen- sions that were used to assess the quality of auctions and e-shopping websites are design, content, security, support, and ease of use (Barnes and Vidgen, 2001; Lim, 2002; Lin and Joyce, 2004).

The proposed framework attempts to integrate knowledge and experience from disparate sources, a range of reference disciplines and empirical practices. The objective is to identify measurable features and indicators that currently comprise a successful web site. A set of features are developed that comprise a current rep- resentation of a perfect website. The proposed framework can be used to compare between the quality of websites, to identify a path for improvement of a website, and to provide a guideline for designers and developers when creating new websites.

It has an emotional appeal which makes the user happy, pleasant, enjoyable, and cheerful when visiting the website (Barnes and Vidgen, 2001, 2002; Basu, 2002; Cao and Zhang, 2002; Fitzpatrick, 2000; Krauss, 2003; Lim, 2002; Liu and Arnett, 2000; Singh and Sook, 2002; Zhang and Dran, 2001).

within the website (Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Basu, 2002; Chanaron, 2005; Heimlich, 1999; Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Krauss, 2003; Lautenbach et al., 2006; Mich et al., 2003; Osborne and Rinalducci, 2002; Paynter and Chung, 2002; Singh and Sook, 2002; Singh and Fisher, 1999; Tan and Tung, 2003). Few number of image/sound/video should be used and size of image/sound/video should be small since large size of image/sound/video per page will slow downloading the page which is not pre- ferred by users (Signore, 2005; Yoo and Jin, 2004). Alternative text should be used for all non-text elements (Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Ma and Zaphiris, 2003; Signore, 2005).

(Basu, 2002; Chanaron, 2005; Lautenbach et al., 2006; Singh and Fisher, 1999; Tan and Tung, 2003). There should be consistency in text, pages should use one font size except for titles (Yoo and Jin, 2004). Text font should be cho- sen among the most readable ones (Abanumy et al., 2005; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Signore, 2005) with relative size (Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Signore, 2005). Pages should not use all capital letters unless in titles or headings since they are hard to read and are space wasting (Signore, 2005; Yoo and Jin, 2004). Pages should use white space or breathing space between page elements to avoid crowded pages (Lin and Joyce, 2004; Yoo and Jin, 2004). Different or multiple headings, such as titles, sub titles, sub sub titles are preferred as

appropriate (Yoo and Jin, 2004). If pages use scrolling text, it should not hide a large amount of information (Yoo and Jin, 2004). Pages should show the text first then the image(s) to see text while downloading image(s) (Yoo and Jin, 2004).

page to facilitate navigating the website (Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Chanaron, 2005; Fitzpatrick, 2000; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2004; Paynter and Chung, 2002; Signore, 2005). A user can know the current page that he/she is in while browsing from the navigation title (Chanaron, 2005; Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Ma and Zaphiris, 2003).

Nearly all previous studies included this dimension or at least one of its indicators in their criteria model because of its importance. It concerns with many issues that help any user regardless of his/her education or experience to find the needed information within a reasonable time (Lautenbach et al., 2006), the capability of the website to maintain specific level of performance when used (Gledec, 2005), and interactivity or connectivity which emphasize the existence of interaction be- tween user and website using different tools.

Fisher,  1999;  Srivihok,  2000;  Tan  and  Tung,  2003;  Wenham and Zaphiris, 2003; Zhang and Dran, 2001). It is easy to find the website using external websites (Basu, 2002; Heimlich, 1999; Mich et al., 2003; Srivihok, 2000), and it is clear to the user that new information is added to the website.

needs and performances of specific users (Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Awamleh and Fernandes, 2005; Barnes and Vidgen, 2001, 2002; Basu, 2002; Delone and Mclean, 2004; Diniz et al., 2005; Fogg et al., 2001; Guru et al., 2001; Madeja and Schoder, 2003; Mich et al., 2003; Singh and Sook, 2002; Webpartner, 2005).

This paper reviewed the most recent evaluation methods which were used in evaluating the quality of different websites, and proposes a comprehensive frame- work for assessing the quality of any website regardless of the type of service that it offers. The dimensions of the framework along with their indicators and check list are summarized in the Appendix below. Furthermore, our framework is capa- ble of reliable applications across a broad range of websites regardless of the ser- vice they provide. These dimensions with their indicators, after being given certain

weights, could be operationalized and converted into a questionnaire. The ques- tionnaire could be applied to different website domains, such as business, educa- tion, banking, commerce, government, and others. Results from the analysis of the questionnaire will help in evaluating these dimensions and their indicators and make the needed update on them.
