Network reliability analysis problem is the center of many scientific productions. It consists of evaluating the all-terminal reliability of networks. Two classes have emerged; exact and approximate methods. The aim of this paper is to present an efficient exact method for enumerating minimal cuts (MCS) of R-networks. The algorithm proceeds by determining minimal paths set (MPS) and from which minimal cuts are generated by managing binary decision diagrams. The manipulation process consists of a series of transformations, reductions and filtering operations. The approach succeeds in the reduction of computation time and memory space and was applied for evaluating the reliability of a national radio communication network.

Generally, reliability engineers model the physical connectivity of system components using a network. Mathematically, a network is a graph G(U , E) in which the edges E represent the components (e.g. devices, computers, routers, etc.) and the nodes U represent the interconnections.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents some related preliminaries. Section 3 details the principle of BDD manipulations. Section 4 and section 5 give respectively the algorithm for generating MCS from ROBDD and its computational efficiency illustrated using some benchmark networks. In section 6, a

OBDD can be reduced to a ROBDD by repeatedly eliminating, any instances of duplicate and redundant nodes using a bottom-up graph traversing procedure. If two nodes are duplicates, one of them is removed and all of its incoming pointers are redirected to its duplicate. If a node is redundant, it is removed and all incoming pointers are redirected to its just one child.
