Altogether 30 publicly available datasets were used for model evalu- ation and were downloaded from PyCoMFA website [32]. These datasets were used by PyCoMFA program which is a python version of CoMFA model and in each dataset, all molecules were pre-aligned. To make sure models are not affected by the initial rotation and translation, all the molecular structures in each dataset went through a standardization process. The origin of the coordinate system were first moved to the ge- ometric center of the whole conformation set and then rotated to align with the principal axes of the conformation set. The orientation vector
