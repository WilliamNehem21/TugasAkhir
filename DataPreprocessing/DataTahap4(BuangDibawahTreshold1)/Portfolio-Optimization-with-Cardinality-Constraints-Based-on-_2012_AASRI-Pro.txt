A portfolio optimal model with cardinality constraints is researched, in which the minimum of Value-at-Risk is taken as the objective function. We give a hybrid differential evolution algorithm to solve the model and make the case study with sixteen alternative stocks from Shanghai and Shenzhen stock market. The numerical results show that the given model is reasonable and the given algorithm is effective.

Since 1970s, financial risk has emerged increasingly due to the economic globalization, the rapid development of the modern information technology and financial system innovation. How to control financial risks effectively becomes the focus to financial regulators and investors. Therefore, how to measure risk has been a very important research subject.

We apply differential evolution algorithm to solve the problem in order to obtain reasonable results which ensured the feasibility of our solution. The numerical results show that the model is reasonable and the given hybrid algorithm is effective. That is to say, this paper provides an effective method for the portfolio optimization model with cardinality constraints.

Step8. If the amount of the nonzero elements of trial is not between k1 and k2 , we can produce a new trail according to Step 3 and Step 4. If elements of trial are between l and u , break; else, return step 7 and go on.

0.018 to 0.026. With the increasing of return threshold, the value of risk is increasing, this also meet high-risk and high-income principle. In this progress, if investment tends to focus on several stocks, it goes against dispersive risk, so the corresponding risk loss will increase in value.
