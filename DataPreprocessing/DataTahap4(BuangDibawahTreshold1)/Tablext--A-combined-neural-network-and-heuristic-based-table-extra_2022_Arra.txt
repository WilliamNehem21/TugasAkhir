so nearby inferred line groups are redundant. If there are no real lines near an inferred line group, the quality scores of the inferred lines are used to determine which line in the group is the best line to split the cells. A Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the quality scores, looking both forwards and backwards two pixels, is calculated for each group. Lines that do not have a valid inferred line are given a zero quality score. Using an SMA helps reduce the impact of noise in the image, while also fixing corner cases where a single pixel thick inferred line might sneak between characters in a piece of data.

The proposed CNN outputs the chance that these two cells are merged and if one or both of the cells are empty. By using a neural network to compute this information, the effect of imperfections in the image can be greatly reduced. It is important to know which cells are empty to avoid running OCR on those cells. This increases performance, as the OCR is the most time consuming step. The following sections talk about the implementation details of the CNN, the training data, and the post CNN concatenation.

The exclusive purpose of this branch is to identify an improper splitting of the cells. Intuitively, the pixels where the cells are merged and the surrounding pixels contain the most crucial information regarding whether the cells should be merged. More complex neural network layers are used in this branch due to the importance of the information and the limited amount of inputs. Five convolutions layers, each with

nodes signify if the two cells contain data and the third node is high when two cells should be merged. The first dropout layers help guide the network away from relying purely on a single branch. Additionally, all of the dropout layers help avoid overfitting that would otherwise be present due to the limited amount of training data.
