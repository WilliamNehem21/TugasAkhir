The root bark of tree peonies has been used as medicine for more than 2000 years in China. It has been included in over 1000 Chinese prescriptions as one of the main raw materials. The effective chemical components have been used extensively in cosmetics and healthy food. There is a growing demand for high quality root bark of tree peonies in the market [1-4].

The Chinese medicinal tree peony cultivars which were bred through long-term artificial selections are planted on large scale in the production areas. In China, there are four important areas (Anhui, Hunan and Shandong provinces, and Chongqing manicipality) producing tree peony root bark. There are particular medicinal cultivars of tree peonies in each production area.
