Data Access facilities (Data Access Facility, DAF) is one of the main contents of IEC61970, in order to improve the EMS application and other systems, and application of collaborative work ability as the goal, which accesses CIM public data for different suppliers to provide a public use application program interface (API) and public service mechanism [4]. The design concept of the DAF is to provide a simple application easy API. DAF is one of the most basic CIS interface standard, including DAFDescriptions, DAFIdentifiers, DAFQuery, DAFEvents module, the core of the module is corresponding interface. For the external system of internal system CIM data acquisition system, DAF provides enough interface in the function [5]. This paper only uses DAFDescriptions. Idl, DAFQuery. Idl and DAFIdentifiers. Idl .

DAF makes use of resources, properties, and values to inquiry the formulation results. A resource is anything of an unmistakable identity. Typically, That a unified resource identifier (URI) pluses an optional fragment identifier may label any resource. But, in the DAF inquires and the search results, a more compact ResourceID of URI should be used. A property is the aspect a resource may describe. When appearing in inquires, nature expresses through the type PropertyID, and nature itself is a resource, so PropertyID is defined as a ResourceID. A property has a domain (resource collection) and a range (value collection). The relationship between the resources through some properties is created, and the nature of the domain and range is also a collection of resource.
