The main problem of using such CNs in DCS is probability of changing of their parameters (such as computing power, network bandwidth and so on) any moment if their owners perform some actions (for example run some application or begin downloading some file). Another problem is the variety of CNs of different owners. Within one DCS may coexist many different CNs, and this makes it much more difficult to solve the task of effective distributing of tasks.

The project SETI@home (setiathome.berkeley.edu) can be example of such attempt. This project uses the CNs of volunteers to perform filtering of the signals from radio telescopes to look for extraterrestrial intelligence. However, analysis show that SETI@home allow to use private computing resources because it is created to solve only easily decomposing tasks, that can be divided into non-coherent pieces. Therefore, non- coherent tasks simplifies implementation of load balancing and time to solve task is not critical, that means that characteristics of the individual CNs can be dynamically varying. That makes systems like SETI@home very limited in usage. That is why it is urgent to develop new methods and algorithms to allow using personal CNs in DCS.

Steps above let the agents of DCS form a communities to solve incoming coherent tasks in time. The set of agents in the community depends on their actual performance. This ability make the community to adapt computing process to the dynamical variations of parameters of CNs.

The main target of research is the practical proof of efficiency of proposed algorithms, but also we wanted to evaluate of the relative loss of processor time on CNs due to dispatching of the decentralized computing. That is why we had to carry out several series of experiments with different parameters of CNs and computer networks. While researching on the proposed algorithms, we used some types of real tasks we work with in Southern Federal University [18].
