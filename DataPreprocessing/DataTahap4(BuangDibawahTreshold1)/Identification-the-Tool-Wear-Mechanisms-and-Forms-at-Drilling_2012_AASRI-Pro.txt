The study of metal cutting can be accessed in several ways. When analyzing the theoretical foundations of cutting metals to describe these regularities and phenomena: regularities and processes of formation of particles on surfaces cut, regularities wear process of cutting tools, regularities drive the cutting process, cutting zone phenomena Davim, 2008 and Jurko, 2009. The current development in the theory of knowledge is characterized by cutting the fact that the study area are the cutting zone, which are in the close proximity to transformation of layer of material removal to chip. This approach is not correct. Since the that formed during cutting complex dynamic phenomena, the field should in theory be extended to the cutting technological properties of machine-tool-object-fixture, and in particular the continuity properties of the elements with the rules of the system mentioned above. The main models orientated on the quality surface of parts is:

The foundation of the cutting process rests in the complete plastic deformation of the separated material (in the form of chips) at T<i>W, for defined conditions and a defined technological system M-F. With respect to economics, the application of progressive cutting tools should bring the following: a faster return on investment (e.g. cost of a new machine), increasing the machine performance (e.g. if we use a technically older machine) and increase of the productivity of operator work. Currently, one of the cost items that has an effect on production costs for 1 component piece is: cutting tool cost. Every company includes a different percentage of cost of the cutting tool for their total costs of producing one component piece, Nakazawa, 1989. Although cost of the cutting tool make up only part of the total costs for producing one component piece (5 % to 10 %), they have a significant impact particularly on the following:
