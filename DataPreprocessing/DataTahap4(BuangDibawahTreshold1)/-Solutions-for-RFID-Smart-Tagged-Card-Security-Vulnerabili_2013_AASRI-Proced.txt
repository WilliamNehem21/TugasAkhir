RFID tag goes in the communication zone of the reader, the reader tells the tag to send the data that is stored on it. After the reader collects the data from the tag, it sends the data to the RFID controller by a network connection (Ethernet, Mobile IP, etc.). The controller will take the information and use it depending on the type of data it has received. The data can be stored in a database or moved as an object in inventory.

Cryptographic algorithms are more costly to implement but can provide better security and privacy, including Hash Based Access Control, Minimalist, Re-encryption scheme and universal re-encryption, and Advanced Semi-Randomized Access Control (A-SRAC) (Shamaili, Yeun, & Zemerly, 2010). Hash Based Access Control uses hash-enabled tags that have a segment of memory set aside for a temporary metaID. This allows the tag to function in a locked or unlocked status (Shih, Lin, & Lin, 2005). A hash algorithm is utilized to generate an indiscriminate key for the metaID, the reader checks the local database for the corresponding hash key to be sent to the tag, the tag receives the hash key and checks it against the metaID and if it corresponds, the tag unlocks and allows full data retrieval to the readers (Shamaili, Yeun, & Zemerly, 2010). The Minimalist method uses a list of pseudonyms that is unique to the keys stored in the RFID tag (Juels A. , 2004). The reader is validated after it has been authenticated by the tag and the tag is validated by the reader by sending an authentication key. Once the validation process is complete, the RFID tag releases its data to
