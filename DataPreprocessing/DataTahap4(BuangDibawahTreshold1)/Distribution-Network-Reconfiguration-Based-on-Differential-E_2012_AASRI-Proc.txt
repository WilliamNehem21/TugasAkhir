As a result of the reconstruction method in this paper to generate all feasible solutions, run the breadth-first search over the network before load flow calculation. On the one hand, the method solved recoding problem, on the other hand, the method will be layered network in the search process, generate Branch-Level matrix B and Node-Level matrix N. Combined with the above information, it should be easy to calculate the load flow by using forward and backward substitution method.
