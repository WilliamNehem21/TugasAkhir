the decision maker to obtain knowledge missed by current AC algorithms. The primary motivation of this paper is to deal with the problem of generating multi-label rules via AC from single label data sets. In other words, we intend to discover all class labels associated with the attribute values bringing up novel and useful knowledge normally missed by current algorithms.

The AC problem, its related basic concepts and relevant literature are given in Section 2. Section 3 surveys common approaches in the literature and the pro- posed algorithm is presented in Section 4. Experimentations and result analysis are demonstrated in Section 5, and lastly conclusions are given in Section 6.

Let T denote the domain of the training cases and C be a list of classes. Each case t e T may be given a class c1, c2, .. ., ck for ci e C, and is represented as a pair (t, (ck)) where ck is a class from C associated with the case t in the training data.

Finally, a common data transformation method used in image classification that derives a single label binary classifier for every class in the class set is called Binary Relevance (BR) (Boutell et al., 2003). It transforms the original multi-label data set into |L| data sets which contain all the cases. This method gives a positive indicator for a class if it is associated with a case in the training data set and a

The majority of existing AC mining algorithms use rules learnt from the training data set for constructing a single label classifier which in turn is utilised for predict- ing test data. Thus, there are limited numbers of research articles related to multi- label rules in AC. Hereunder, we shed the light on two approaches and other techniques related to traditional multi-label classification in data mining. It is worth to note that the traditional classification algorithms surveyed in this section are related to multi-label data sets and they assume each training example to be associated with more than one class. This is unlike the proposed algorithm that assumes each training example to be linked with a single class but produces multi-label rules.

In image classification, pictures may belong to multi-labels, i.e. different objects within a view. This problem is called class overlapping where a scene may contain multiple labels. A scene classification method called cross training was developed in (Boutell et al., 2003). This method trains on each available label in an image in turn during the training step in order to consider all available labels. The results produced reveal that the developed scene classification algorithm performs well with respect to classification accuracy.

The proposed algorithm fires the first sorted rule in the classifier applicable to the test case and assigns its class to the test case. The rules attribute values must be contained in the test case in order to be chosen for classifying the test case class. When there is no rule fully applicable to the test case then we take on the first rule that partly matches the test case attribute value. Unlike the majority of current prediction procedures in AC mining that takes on the default class when no rules are applicable to the test case our prediction procedure minimises the utilisation of the default rule in class assignment process of test cases which normally improves upon the resulting classifier performance. This is since default rule has been cre- ated with high error from the remaining unclassified training data cases while

In all experiments, tenfold cross validation testing method has been employed for fair evaluation of the classifiers derived by the algorithms considered and to reduce overfitting. Furthermore, six dissimilar classification algorithms which utilise a variety of rule learning methodologies have been considered for contrasting pur- poses with the eMCAC. These algorithms are MMAC (Thabtah et al., 2004), CBA (Liu et al., 1998), PART (Frank and Witten, 1998), MCAR (Thabtah et al., 2005), RIPPER (Cohen, 1995) and C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993).

The experiments were conducted on an I3 machine with 2.3 Ghz. The experi- ments of C4.5, PART and RIPPER were carried out in Weka software (Witten and Frank, 2002). For AC algorithms, we have selected CBA, and MCAR for sin- gle label classifier comparison and MMAC for multi-label classifier. CBA and MMAC source code has been obtained from their prospective authors and the proposed algorithm and MCAR were implemented in Java.

Finally, we have set the MinSupp and MinConf thresholds for the AC algo- rithms (CBA, MCAR, MMAC, eMCAC) to 2% and 50% respectively for all experiments. The main reason for giving the MinSupp 2% is that previous research works, e.g. (Thabtah et al., 2005), have suggested that MinSupp values ranging between 2% and 5% may balance between the number of rules generated and the predictive accuracy of the classifier. On the other hand and for the MinConf parameter, it has been set to 40% since it has minor effect on the performance of the classifiers.

Phishing features can be extracted in a number of ways one of which is manual extraction where users derive features and judge their legitimacy. In this method, users have to spend a lot of time studying the up-to-date phishing collection tech- niques which is an infeasible approach for the majority of the users. The second method employed in extracting phishing features is the automatic extraction. This is accomplished by examining the webpage and extracting a set of patterns related to phishing and legitimate type web pages. This involves examining the webpage properties and all its features. Webpage properties are typically derived from HTML tags, URL address and Javascript source code.

In this paper, a new multi-label rule-based classification algorithm based on AC mining called eMCAC has been proposed. The originality of the proposed algo- rithm is its ability to generate rules with multiple class labels from single data sets and without recursive learning in current AC methods like MMAC. Experimental results against crucial applications named website phishing have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in classifying websites. The measures of evaluation are label-weight, any-label, accuracy and number of

rules and the contrasted algorithms are CBA, MCAR, MMAC, PART, C4.5 and RIPPER. The results of the experiments showed that the proposed algorithm out- performed the considered algorithms on the real world phishing data with respect to accuracy. Further, the label-weight and any-label results of the proposed algo- rithm are better than those of the MMAC algorithm for the same data. The eMCAC algorithm was able to produce multi-label rules from the phishing data where each training example is associated with one class. We have identified a smaller effective feature set for detecting the type of the website after applying Chi-square feature selection method. The results of all considered algorithms other than eMCAC have been consistent in detecting the phishing website. In the near future, we intend to apply the eMCAC algorithm on unstructured data related to text categorisation.
