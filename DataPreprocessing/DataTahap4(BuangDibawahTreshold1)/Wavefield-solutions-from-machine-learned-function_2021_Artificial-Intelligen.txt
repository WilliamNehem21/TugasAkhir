Thus, a larger network can provide more accurate wavefields, but for applications in gradient calculation for velocity model update, a perfect scattered wavefield is not necessary. The cost of training the 12-layer network is 50% higher than the 10-layer one in spite that the number of network model parameters increased by 4. Meanwhile, the cost of the training the 8-layer network is two-third the cost of training the 10-layer network, while the number of network parameters is one-fourth of that of the 10-layer network. So, in summary, using this network architecture, the cost of the training will increase by about 50% with the addition of two layers of double the size of the first (largest) layer, and we end up with a higher resolution wavefield.
