Results showed that the system was able to successfully classify microcalcifications from all types. During our tests no false positives were detected by the system. Also, in every test image all microcalcifications were detected, despite the addition of noise on these images. Each image took on average approximately 2.7 s to be processed and no drawbacks were found in executing the system on the Altera DE2-115 board, thus providing an option to create a CAD system that is cheaper, smaller [16] and more energy efficient [16-17] than if it was developed to be executed on regular computers.
