Granular computing theories in the field of computer are introduced into the statistical analysis of qualitative data, based on the traditional qualitative data analysis methods. Multidimensional qualitative data by use of information system are described, and the mathematical model of qualitative data cluster model based on granular computing is given. The feasibility and the superiority are verified by treating massive data. This method may provide a new train of thought for analysis of large and complex qualitative data.

From the perspective of the information theory, the information content can be used to measure the size of granular, the relationship between granolas represent the degree of dependence similarity or contain (Luo, 2007). Task of cluster analysis is to find the optimal subset and then realize the cluster of observation object. According to this idea, change of importance degree of cluster variable subset can be used to judge the end of cluster process. The mathematical model of qualitative data cluster model is given based on granular computing, the purpose of classification for massive qualitative data is realized, and the feasibility and the superiority are verified by treating massive data (Pu, 2002).

Qualitative data are described by using information system, a mathematical model of qualitative data cluster is given based on granular computing, and a new method of determine best cluster variable subset upon the basis of analyzing variable subset is proposed. This cluster method not only fits cluster which has one important classification structure data, but also fits cluster which has multiple important classification structure data. Examples show that this model is highly effective in the face of massive data, and provides a new idea for analysis of huge and complex qualitative data.
