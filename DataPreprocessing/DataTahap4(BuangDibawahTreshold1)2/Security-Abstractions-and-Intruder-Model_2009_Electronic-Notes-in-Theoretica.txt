The network view of a message depends on the transmission mode: it coincides with the payload in plain outputs, while it is a fresh tuple of names in each authentic and/or secret output. The correspondence between message formats is established by the following translation of high-level principals H into their network level coun- terparts [H]. We only give the clauses for the communication forms (the remaining clauses are defined homomorphically). As discussed in [5], in a cryptographic im- plementation, the chosen format may be realized by means of a time-dependent signature, in an authentic message, and by a randomized encryption in a secret output.

The index i attached to the cached copy is associated univocally with the intercept that created the copy, as shown in the (Intercept) rule. Notice, in the same rule, that the bindings created depend on the structure and, more specifically, on the secrecy of the intercepted message, as explained earlier on. As for the remaining reductions, (Comm) is the usual synchronization rule, while (Forward) and (Reply) formalize the semantics of the adversarial form !i. Notice in particular that a non- authentic message is replicated, while an authentic one is not (the cached copy is erased).
