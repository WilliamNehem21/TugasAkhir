In previous work, the authors have developed several extensions to the model- based testing environment Spec Explorer [3] to foster its application for GUI testing and address some of the above issues: techniques and helper libraries for modelling GUIs in Spec [1]; a GUI Mapping Tool to automate the mapping between the GUI model and the implementation [12]; and a tool to avoid test case explosion taking into account the hierarchical structure of GUIs [13]. Further details can be found in [14]. The results achieved have received significant interest from modellers and testers.

We  are  currently  extending  the  model-based  testing  tools  devel- oped in previous work to support the techniques described in this pa- per.   The prototype under development is able to manipulate UML models represented in the XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) format (http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/xmi.htm).
