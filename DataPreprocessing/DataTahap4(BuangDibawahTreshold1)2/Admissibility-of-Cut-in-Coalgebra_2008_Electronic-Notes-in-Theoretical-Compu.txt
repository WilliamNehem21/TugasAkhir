As already hinted at above, the system GR absorbs the structural rules of weak- ening and contraction. The following two propositions are devoted to a syntactic proof of this fact. We will later return to this point and present an alternative argument via semantic completeness. Weakening comes first:

Our second observation pertains to our proof of cut-free completeness, which is heavily based on semantical notions. While we strongly believe that this theorem could also have been obtained purely syntactically, i.e. by comparison of different proof systems, we are as of yet unsure whether these methods extend beyond rank
