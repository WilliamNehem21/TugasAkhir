Relational numerical abstract domains do not scale up. To ensure a linear cost of abstract domains, abstract interpretation-based tools analyzing large programs generally split the set of variables into independent smaller sets, sometimes sharing some non-relational information. We present a way to gain precision by keeping fully expressive relations between the subsets of variables, whilst retaining a linear complexity ensuring scalability.

This idea has already been applied in Astree [1,5] and in C Global Surveyor [17], both analyzing large avionic and aerospace C programs. The set of variables is divided into several subsets called packs on which operators of the octagon domain are applied independently. However only non-relational information (i.e., intervals) are shared between packs.

Let us choose arbitrarily a root in the pack tree and direct this tree such that arcs are directed from the root to the leaves. Suppose that the root is P1 and that if there is an arc from Pi to Pj then i < j. Let father(i) denote the pack father of Pi in this directed tree (undefined for P1).

Widenings of the underlying domain can be applied to each pack independently. Convergence of increasing chains in finite time is immediately ensured. However so formed values can be uncoherent or incomplete. But trying to make them coherent or complete can jeopardize converge [13]. Indeed widening relaxes constraints towards
