estimated [18]. On the other hand, Salem created a few methods for the estimation of SHAM utilizing atomic absorption spec- trophotometry (AAS) and spectrophotometry methods. The AAS technique depends on precipitating the [Cu (NH3)4]2+-SHAM complex with the aid of excess of [Cu(NH3)4]2+ to SHAM solution. The Cu2+ ion in the supernatant layer was determined by AAS. The spectrophotometric technique is relies on upon measuring the green color produced by adding [Cu (NH3)4]2+ to SHAM solu- tion consisted of 50% dioxane: water solution [19].

filter paper. The filtrate was diluted to obtain the desired concen- tration within the linearity range studied. The absorbance of sam- ple solutions was measured and the amount of salicylhydroxamic acid was determined using the calibration curve. In the same way, the raw materials were also prepared by transferring 100 mg each and transferred to 500 mL volumetric flask. After that, the same procedure in the preparation of capsules was followed.

The assay of salicylhydroxamic acid was validated taking into consideration linearity, LOD and LOQ, precision, accuracy, robust- ness, ruggedness and specificity. Validation of the parameters was carried in the light of the International Conference on Harmo- nization (ICH) guidelines Q2 (R1) (ICH, 2005) [22]. Below are the parameters that have been investigated.

A simple, reliable, accurate and reproducible spectrophotomet- ric method for the determination of salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) in capsules and raw materials was successfully developed as per the ICH guidelines. The good analytical performance with regards to validation parameters was achieved. All the validated data attained are in agreement with the ICH guidelines Q2 (R1) (ICH, 2005) [22]. Once compared with the reported spectrophoto-
