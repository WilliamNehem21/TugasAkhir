Several recent works focus on the use of finite automata based models to address Web services composition problems. In [18,17], the authors propose a model where Web services compositions expressed in BPEL are formally defined by state transi- tion systems with communicating and internal (unobservable) actions. In [17], this model was enriched using a knowledge base, and in [9] using a theory. These ap- proaches were applied to practical applications in [24,12,11]. In [1,21], Web services are defined by PWL-S documents and modelled by guarded finite automata. A sim- ilar approach is investigated in [16] where Web services are defined in BPEL. In [14], the authors model by Input/Output automata Web services interfaces described in BPEL, OWLS and WSDL.
