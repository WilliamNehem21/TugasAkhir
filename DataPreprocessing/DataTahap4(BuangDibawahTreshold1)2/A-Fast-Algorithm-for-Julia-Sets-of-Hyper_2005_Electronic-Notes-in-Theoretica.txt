In this section we will give some basic notions and notations on Julia sets. Many of the results presented in this section are from the book [2] where many more details on Julia sets of rational functions can be found. Other valuable sources are [3], [5], [1], [8] and [7].

As usually we denote the n-th iterate and the derivative of a function f by fn and f ', respectively. A complex number z is called a fixed point of a function f iff f (z) = z. z is called periodic point of f iff z is a fixed point of some iterate of f . A fixed point z is called repelling, attracting or indifferent iff f '(z) > 1, f '(z) < 1 or f '(z) = 1, respectively. Similarly, periodic points are classified (where f have to be replaced by a sufficient iterate). We call z a critical point of f iff f '(z) = 0.

i.e. the preimages of z0, the preimages of the preimages of z0 and so on. At the same time we try to find a set A of open balls B(z) of points z in these preimages and an index n so that a) z	U (z), b) for each U (z)  A

A few comments on this procedure are in order: As we can compute the sets mentioned above only up to finite precision, the properties a) to d) are meant to be guaranteed by the algorithm. Lemma 5.1 gives enough space to do this by appropriate approximations. Another problem are the roots of q.

constant c'' not depending on k. Thus by Corollary 1 we can use first the algorithm Reduce([log2 N (k)|) and decide the reduced problem afterwards by the exponentially time bounded algorithm Reduce(2). This leads to a polynomially time bounded algorithm, as the length of the reduced input is O(log2 N (k)) = O(log2 k), compared to the original input length O(k). Us- ing Reduce( log2 N (k) ) and this polynomially time bounded algorithm then gives the following result.
