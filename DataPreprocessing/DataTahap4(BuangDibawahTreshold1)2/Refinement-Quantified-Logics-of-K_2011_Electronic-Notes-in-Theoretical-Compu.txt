Balbiani et al. [2] then explored arbitrary public announcement logic, an exten- sion of public announcement logic which provides an operator for quantifying over arbitrary public announcements. van Ditmarsch and French [5] later proved that arbitrary public announcement logic was undecidable in the multi-agent setting, and so similar logics for action models may also be undecidable.
