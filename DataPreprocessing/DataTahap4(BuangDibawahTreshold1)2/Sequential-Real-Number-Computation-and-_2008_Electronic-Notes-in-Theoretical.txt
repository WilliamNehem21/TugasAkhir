p. The idea is to allow for reduction of a let term when a partial value is known within precision p. We call this reduction strategy call-by-partial-value. The corre- sponding denotational semantics employs several ideas familiar to domain theorists, including measurement as defined by Martin in [12] and a monadic treatment of the distinction between value and computation as in Moggi [14]. Furthermore, because we are interested in relations, say, on product types, we also extend the language to have explicit products of ground types.
