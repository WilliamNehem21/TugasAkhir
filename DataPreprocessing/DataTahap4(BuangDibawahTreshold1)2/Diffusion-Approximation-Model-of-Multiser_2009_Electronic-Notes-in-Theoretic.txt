We use the diffusion approximation to study a classical queueing model of the type G/G/N/N , known in its Markovian and steady-state version since the times of Erlang. The use of diffusion approximation allows us to include general interarrival times, general service times and to solve the model also for transient states. This approach is then applied to model a sliding window mechanism and to study the performance of a call centre.

3 extends it to the case of piecewise-constant diffusion parameters depending on the value of the diffusion process. The main concept is to introduce fictive barriers between subintervals within which the diffusion has constant parameters. We used already such barriers to manipulate the probability flows representing jumps of diffusion process related to the sending various size optical packets in a model of an electronic-optical node [3] and to represent space-heterogeneous failures in hop-by- hop transmission in sensor networks [4]. Here, in the optics of G/G/N/N model, the subintervals separated by barriers have unitary length and correspond to a fixed number of busy service channels: the interval (0, 1] corresponds to one busy channel, the interval (1, 2] corresponds to two busy channels, and so on. In case of G/G/N/N + m model, the last interval has the length of m + 1 units.
