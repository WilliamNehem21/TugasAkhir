being provable. The first of these would need an intermediate condition that mentions (t and) either x or a, so A1 would have to contain x or a. But c2 modifies both of these variables, so the side condition on the parallel rule would fail.

As usual, soundness of the inference rules follows from the property that the rules preserve validity: For all well-formed instances of each inference rule, if the premisses are valid and the side conditions hold, then the conclusion is valid. The proof is a rule-by-rule case analysis, mostly as in [3] but augmented with the use and manipulation of rely sets. We summarize the main steps in showing soundness of the Parallel rule, and the rule dealing with local resources.
