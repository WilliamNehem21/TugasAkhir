error rate, several copies of the same signal must be created. This gives the data more chances to reach the receiving antenna unaf- fected by fading. Additionally, limits any interference from the already existing bands very sharply within the UWB spectrum, such as 5G sub-6 GHz, WLAN band, and satellite downlink band by applying a novel parasitic decoupling structure.

The idea behind multiplicity is to send the same signals in mul- tiple paths to receivers. It significantly lowers signal loss and enhances link performance. This is accomplished by time diversity, in which the same message is broadcast at various periods. Even so, designing a MIMO antenna without any degradation of single- element performance is challenging. The multi-radiating elements closely arranged together cause an increase in the mutual coupling and high correlation in the channel, which lessens the performance of MIMO systems. The mutual coupling degrades the signal-to- interference noise ratio (SINR) of the MIMO elements. This decreases the performance of the MIMO antenna [35]. To encoun- ter this issue, researchers have used different techniques such as parasitic elements [22], decoupling networks [26], defected ground structure [27], neutralization lines [28], metamaterials [32], and
