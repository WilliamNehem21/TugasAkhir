The first problem arises from the notion of applicative bisimulation, introduced in [1] in the untyped setting and later studied in the typed setting [3]. Applicative bisimilarity was shown to be a congruence by an ingenious method [5]. This method works in both the deterministic and the erratically nondeterministic setting, but as explained in [8], it does not work in the presence of amb. So it has remained open whether applicative bisimilarity, in the presence of amb, is a congruence.
