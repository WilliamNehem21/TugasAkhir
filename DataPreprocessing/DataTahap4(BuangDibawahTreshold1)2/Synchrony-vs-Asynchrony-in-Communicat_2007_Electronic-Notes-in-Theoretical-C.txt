In this paper, we study the synchronous/asynchronous versions of the prim- itives arising by the possible combinations of three features: arity (monadic vs. polyadic data), communication medium (channels vs. shared dataspaces) and pattern-matching. As a result, we have a family of sixteen languages, denoted as

Of course, it is easy to have interferences between the auxiliary data introduced by the encoding of different processes, but this does not create any problem since such data only depend on the length of the translated actions. Consider, e.g., the

Finally, monadic and dataspace-based communications are too weak to ensure any reasonable encoding: the problem is that there is no way to associate a datum with the process that emitted it. The latter fact entails that those languages that exploit such primitives (e.g., Ambient [7] or CCS [15]) cannot freely interchange their synchronous and asynchronous versions, though the latter ones are still Turing powerful [7,4].

source language input/output of arity k is translated in a (k + 2)-ary input/output), an analogous of Theorem A.6 cannot hold. This makes the proof of full abstraction slightly more complex; on the contrary, divergence freedom is proved exactly in the same way (thus, we shall not mention it anymore).
