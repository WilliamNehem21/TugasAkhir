We shall characterize the theorems of corresponding systems semantically. (For syntactic characterizations see the cited papers.) A Boolean 3-frame K shall here be a pair < K, R >, where K is a set (of states) and R is a 3-place relation on K. 6 Let K be a Boolean 3-frame, and let L be one of our languages above. Let
