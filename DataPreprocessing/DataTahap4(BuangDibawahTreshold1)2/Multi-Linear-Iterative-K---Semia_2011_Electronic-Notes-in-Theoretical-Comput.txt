In [14], it is shown that all commutative rings are proper. More generally, let us call a (commutative) semiring Noetherian, if for every finitely generated K- semimodule M , every subsemimodule of M is finitely generated. It is shown in [14] that if K is Noetherian, or every finitely generated subsemiring of K is contained in a Noetherian subsemiring, then K is proper. In particular, every locally finite 3 (commutative) semiring and thus every bounded distributive lattice is proper. There
