In [4], we proposed the notion of F-context where F is a finite-subsets-family structure on the attribute set of a formal context. We discussed the implication rule systems induced from consistent F-contexts. The results demonstrate that the concept hierarchy of a consistent F-context is just in correspondence with a special kind of subset family inherent in the induced implication rules system. Based on this result, we introduced the notion of formal implication rule system which

We first introduce the notion of information state of finitely derived information systems. We also investigate the order-theoretic properties of the poset of infor- mation states with respect to set inclusion. As is shown, every such poset is an algebraic domain. Moreover, we study the correspondence between appropximable mappings (between the given finitely derived information systems) and Scott con- tinuous functions (between the induced algebraic domains).
