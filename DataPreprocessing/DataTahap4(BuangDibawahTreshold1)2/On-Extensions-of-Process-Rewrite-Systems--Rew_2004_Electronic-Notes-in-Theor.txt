Some basic definitions and properties of PRS (taken from[13]) and fcPRS ([22]) are recalled in Sections 2 and 3. We introduce PRS with weak unit (wPRS) and mention state-extended PRS in Section 4. Some relationships between the respective new classes and the already existing ones as well as the (combined) hierarchy of PRS and (relevant classes of) extended PRSs are shown in Section 5.

Proof. Observe that the application of a PAD rewrite rule can only modify one ready parallel component. Hence there is no way how to deadlock more than one live ready parallel component by one application of a PAD rewrite rule.	 

The state (q, tt) (corresponding to the state q) has a ready parallel compo- nent able to perform an action c. This action cannot be disabled by any action performed by another ready parallel component. Hence there is just one ready parallel component able to perform both c and d. For the same reason this
