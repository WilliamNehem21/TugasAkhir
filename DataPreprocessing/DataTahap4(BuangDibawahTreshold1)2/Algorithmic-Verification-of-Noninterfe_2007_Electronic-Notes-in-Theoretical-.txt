Note that an agent may make the same observation several times in a row, without an intervening action by that agent. This indicates that another agent has acted. To eliminate this timing-based reasoning, in order to make the definition compatible with the assumption of asynchrony, we apply the function Cond in this definition.

labelled transition systems [18,19]. In [19] McCullough mentions both definitions and concludes that the one on labelled transition systems is stronger. Here we follow the latter definition. This is close to the notion of unwinding relation which is a way of facilitating proofs of traditional noninterference on deterministic systems [25].

We now turn to the main interest of this paper: verification methods and complexity results for the security properties introduced in the previous section. None of these properties is directly expressible in the traditional safety-liveness framework [1], as they express not a constraint on single system execution, but rather a constraint on the set of all possible executions. We therefore need to develop new techniques for their verification.
