example, an element of A4 is a record (x1, x2, x3, x4) of four elements of A. In computer science, this can be a good solution, for example a byte is usually implemented as a record (b7, b6, b5, b4, b3, b2, b1, b0) of bits. But, in general, the main drawback of this approach is its lack of genericity.

What has been done is easily understood. The first line introduces the variables A, f, n and, v in the environment and then asks for an induction on the variable v. The second line solves the base case providing the unique inhabitant of A 0. The third line solves the induction step. It builds the image of a vector Vcons A n e v, using the image by map f of e and the value IHv built by induction. For that, it applies the constructor Vcons A n to f e

A solution always looks nice for its creator, but on that matter the best critics remains the users. An important community of Coq users contributes to improve continuously the system. A lot of pertinent questions are published on the forum Coq club.

Vid is a function defined by cases on the dimension n. If n = 0, and v: vector 0 then Vid v is the null vector. If n > 0, Vid v is built using V cons on the first component of v and on the rest of v, in fact on (V head v) and (V tail v). Actually V id is a recursive definition of the identity function, let us prove it:
