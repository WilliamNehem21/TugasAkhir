Flows through nonparallel walls gain importance in early 19th century after the pioneering works of Jeffery [7] and Hamel [8]. Since then, there are many studies available that discussed the different practical and industrial applications of these flows and reported that flow characteristics vary by changing the angle between two channels [9e11]. Flows through rivers and channels, different biological flows such as flow through arteries and veins are some practical applica- tions of these types of flows. Due to nonlinearity of the
