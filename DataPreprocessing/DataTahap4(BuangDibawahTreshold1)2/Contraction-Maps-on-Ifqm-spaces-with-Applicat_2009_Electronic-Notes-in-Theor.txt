In the last years some authors have studied several kinds of contraction maps and fixed point theorems in (inuitionistic) fuzzy metric and fuzzy quasi-metric spaces (see, for instance, [1], [16], [12], [18], [19], etc.). Next we present some new results in this setting which will be useful later on.
