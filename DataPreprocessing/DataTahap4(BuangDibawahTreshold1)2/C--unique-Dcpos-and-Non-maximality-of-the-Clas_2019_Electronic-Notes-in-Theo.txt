We call a T0 space X C-unique if for any T0 space Y , X is homeomorphic to Y whenever the closed set lattice of X is isomorphic to that of Y . A T0 space is C-unique iff it is sober and TD (see [1,12,17]). Our aim here is to investigate the analogous objects in the context of directed complete posets. A dcpo P is called
