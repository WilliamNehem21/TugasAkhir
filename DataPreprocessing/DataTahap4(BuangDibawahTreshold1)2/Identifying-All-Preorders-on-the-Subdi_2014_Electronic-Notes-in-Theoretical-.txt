Simulations between coalgebras are defined coalgebraically by using relational lift- ings of coalgebra functors. In this section, we focus on simulations between Markov chains (i.e. D-coalgebras). We focus on the relational liftings of D that are constructed from preorders on D by the method in [5,7]. For a given preorder
