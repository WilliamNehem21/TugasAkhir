The results in Section 4 can only be applied to semantics defined by preorders coarser than the ready simulation and included in I. This excludes both finer semantics (such as possible [10] and impossible futures [11]), but also other coarser preorders not included in I, such as the trace and complete trace preorders. In order to also cover these cases we will use results on general constrained simulations that we have developed in [12].

Certainly, our results on the semantics coarser than ready simulation presented in Section 4 are just a particular case of the general Theorem 5.7, simply taking I as the constraint C. Let us now consider the case of trace semantics. The classic trace preorder defined by trace inclusion can be axiomatized with the following axioms
