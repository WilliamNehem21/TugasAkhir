Respiratory system diseases such as Pneumonia and Coron- avirus (COVID-19) are common, infectious, and deadly. The results of radiography are the main factor in the accurate diagnosis of such diseases. Consolidation is a radiological expression that explains the increased lung density within the air spaces. There are different types of lung opacity in a chest radiograph, which radiologists may find due to a pathologic operation that fills in the alveoli with blood, fluid, pus, protein, or cells [1]. Consolidation can help us in detecting many diseases, and specifically, Pneumonia and COVID-

sub-folders for every image class (Normal, Pneumonia, COVID- 19). There are 7512 chest X-ray images with the extension (JPEG) divided into three classes of COVID-19 (1323), Pneumonia (4240 images), and Normal (1949 images). We applied A filtering process to the dataset that excluded 33 chest X-ray images from the Pneu- monia folder, which is included in the train folder. This exclusion is
