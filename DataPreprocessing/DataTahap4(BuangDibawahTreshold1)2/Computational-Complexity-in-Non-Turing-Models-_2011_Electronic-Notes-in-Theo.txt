We now outline an analogue system that factorizes natural numbers. The descrip- tion given here is brief; for full details, see [4]. (The interested reader should also see [7], the pending US patent, of which the system is the subject, applied for by IBM and with the author as sole inventor, and [6], which describes a modified and in some senses improved version of the system. Finally, the system is used, as here, as a motivating example in [3].)

Just as with traditional algorithms, there is a practical limit to the size of num- bers that the system can factorize; in contrast with traditional algorithms, however, the system suffers no increase in calculation time as the input number approaches this limit. Crucially for present purposes, the limit is not imposed by considerations (of run-time, memory space, etc.) made in traditional complexity theory, but rather by the increasing precision demanded of the user of the system. 6

First, we advocate consideration of more diverse selections of resources; for exam- ple, we see above that not only traditional, algorithmic measures such as time and space, but also more physical measures such as precision, should be considered. See Sect. 3.1.

In order to improve such bounds, it is desired to consider as large a set as is pos- sible of solution methods for a problem. Each set so considered in practice, however, is likely to be of solution methods taken from a single model of computation (often that of the Turing machine). This is a necessary evil of our inability meaningfully to compare the complexity of instances of different computation models.
