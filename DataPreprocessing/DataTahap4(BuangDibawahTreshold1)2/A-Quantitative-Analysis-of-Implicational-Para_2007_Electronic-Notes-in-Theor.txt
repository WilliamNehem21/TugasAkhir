The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a very simple introduction to implicational paradoxes in CML and the mention of the strong relevance. Section 3 gives how to analyze and analysis. Some concluding remarks are given in Section 4.

The number of elements of Fk can be calculated as follows. T i denotes the kinds of trunks of rooted trees in Fk while the number of leaves of the all trees are i and the degree of nested implications is k. Let Pi be the kinds of permutations of pattern variables put on leaves of a certain rooted tree as labels while the number of the leaves is i. Then the number of elements of Fk is can be calculated from T i
