Synchronization and arbitration components can comprise a n important part of the latency involved in communication paths in a GALS system. Calculating the performance of these components is not necessarily straight forward, and the ef- fect of noise is to make the computation paths non-deterministic. Noise increases as dimensions reduce, so non-determinism also increases making probabilistic esti- mations of performance necessary Until recently tools to enable the simulation of reliability in the second half of the clock cycle have not been available. This has re- sulted in the poor design of some synchronizer library elements which have a longer metastability time constant in the second half of the clock cycle as compared with the first half. Taking this together with the additional delay involved in the hand over of metastability from master to slave, the reliability may be a several orders of magnitude worse than expected
