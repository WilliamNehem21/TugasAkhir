The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, the PSO algorithm is described. In Sections 3 and 4 PSWV algorithm and its convergence study are exposed. Test func- tions and test conditions are presented in Section 5. In Section 6, optimization test experiments are illustrated. In Section 7, experimental results are reported, and are discussed in Section

This paper has proposed a new particle swarm- inspired opti- mization algorithm (PSWV). In this algorithm the new posi- tion of each particle is calculating directly from the combination of its own best position and the global best posi- tion. The implementation of this idea is simple, based on stor- ing the previous positions. The PSWV algorithm outperforms
