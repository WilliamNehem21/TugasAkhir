Boolean automata networks (BANs) are discrete interaction networks that are now well established models for biological regulation systems such as neural net- works [9,10] or gene regulation networks [12,23]. To this extent, locally monotonic BANs have been widely studied, both on the applied side [8,15] and on the theo- retical side [11,14,17,19,20]. However, recent works have brought new interests in local non monotonicity [18].

On the theoretical side, it has been noticed [16,19] that non local monotonicity is often involved when it comes to singular behaviours in BANs. For example it has been shown that the smallest network that is not robust to the addition of synchronism (i.e. allowing some automata to update simultaneously) is a locally non-monotonic BAN [16,19].

A BAN is defined as a set of Boolean automata that interact with each other. The size of a network corresponds to the number of automata in it. For a network N of size n we denote V = {1,..., n} the corresponding set of automata.
