not a bifinite partial order on the finite set An. Hence X \ Pbif is a union of basic open sets and thus open, showing that Pbif is a closed subset of X. Hence (Pbif , d) is again a complete metric space. If follows from general results that (Pbif , d) is homeomorphic to the Cantor set.

This is a closed subset of X. Now follow the previous argument, replacing Pbif by PScott; for the corresponding density claim of Lemma 5.2 apply the construction given in the proof of Theorem 4.5. It follows that in the metric space (PScott, d), the subset
