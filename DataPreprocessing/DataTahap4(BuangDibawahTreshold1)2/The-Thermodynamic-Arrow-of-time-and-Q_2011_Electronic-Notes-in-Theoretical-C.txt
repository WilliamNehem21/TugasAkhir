I give an explanation of the thermodynamic arrow-of-time (namely entropy increases with time) within a quantum mechanical framework. This entails giving a solution to the Loschmidt paradox, i.e. showing how an irreversible macro-dynamics can arise from a reversible micro-dynamics. I argue that, in accordance to the reversible dynamics, both entropy-increasing and entropy-decreasing transformations take place, but entropy-decreasing transformations cannot leave any information of their having happened. This is indistinguishable from their not having happened at all. The second law of thermodynamics is then reduced to a tautology: the only transformations that can be seen are those where entropy does not decrease. However, typicality arguments seem to prevent this argument to be used as a complete solution to the arrow-of-time dilemma: it might still be necessary to postulate a low entropy initial state for the system under consideration.

3 One may object that the ignorant observer is ignorant also of the true value of the entropy. However, there is no operative way that any observer can exclude that any box is correlated with some unknown system, unless the state of the whole universe is known. Hence, any observer must by necessity assume that no correlations exist, unless it is known otherwise. An alternative definition of thermodynamic entropy that tests for all possible correlations with all other systems of the universe would be quite useless in practice!
