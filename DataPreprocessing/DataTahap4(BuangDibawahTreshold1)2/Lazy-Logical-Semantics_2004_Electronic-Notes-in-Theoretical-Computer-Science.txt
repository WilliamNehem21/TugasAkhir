Both models turned out to be correct but not complete with respect to the operational semantics they want to model.  Let us recall that a model is correct when the denotational semantics implies the operational one, it is complete if the inverse implication holds. Moreover a model is fully abstract with respect to an operational semantics if and only if it is both correct and complete with respect to it. It has been proved, respectively in [8] and [2], that there is not a topological model which is fully abstract with respect to the lazy operational semantics, both in the call-by-value and call-by-name case. Both proofs are inspired to the incompleteness result proved in [10]. In
