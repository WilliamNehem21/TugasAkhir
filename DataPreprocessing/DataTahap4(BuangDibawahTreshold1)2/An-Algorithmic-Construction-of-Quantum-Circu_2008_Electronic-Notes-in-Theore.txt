In [3], we find a discussion, among other things, of the programmability of universal quantum Turing machines. In this paper, we expand on this discussion and consider algorithmic and complexity issues around the effective construction of quantum circuits. Many beautiful papers have been written on this subject and many open problems still remain to be addressed. We shall consider an algorithmic version of a converse of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. (A proof of this theorem can be found in Appendix 3 of the book [7].)

Hence, in this model, a quantum computation is a hybrid of classical and prob- abilistic algorithms coupled with quantum evolutions of prepared quantum states. In order to discuss programmability in this context, we recall the notion of instruction sets. (For more on this idea, see, for example the book [7] and [1].) An

Suppose U and V are two unitary operators on the same state space with U the target unitary operator that we wish to implement and V = V1V2 ... Vk is the unitary operator that is actually implemented from an instruction set as above. Let M be a positive operator valued measure (POVM) element associated with the measurement and let PU (or PV ) be the probability of obtaining the corresponding, measurement outcome if the operation U (or V ) was performed with a starting state

Many authors state that the Solovay-Kitaev approximation can be done in an effective and efficient manner. This must be read with some care! We call a unitary operation recursive with respect to the chosen measurement basis if all its matrix entries relative to this basis are recursive complex numbers. Recall that a complex number is a recursive complex number provided both its real and imaginary parts are recursive real numbers. A real number x is recursive if there is an algorithmic
