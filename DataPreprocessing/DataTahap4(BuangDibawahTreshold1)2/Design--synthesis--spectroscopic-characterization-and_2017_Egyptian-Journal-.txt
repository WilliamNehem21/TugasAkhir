The purpose of the study is to design, synthesise and assess the antipsychotic activity of a set of the novel (5-(10-(3-N, N-Dimethylamino) propyl)-10H-phenothiazine-3-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazo-2-yl) Azodye/Schiff base/Chalcone derivatives. The newly synthesised compound structure was characterised by FT-IR, 1H NMR, Mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Each compound has been shown an excellent anti- psychotic activity in a haloperidol-induced catalepsy metallic bar test. The results found are firmly sim- ilar to docking study. Among the synthesised derivatives, compound 2-Amino-6-(3-hydroxy-4-methyl phenyl) pyrimidine-4-yl) (7-chloro-10-(3-(N, N-dimethylamino) propyl)-10H-phenothiazine-3-yl) methanone (GC8) exhibiting high potency of catalepsy induction. Therefore, the derivative of GC8 has been considered that a potent anti-psychotic agent among the synthesised compounds.

4-Chlorobenzene amine (0.01 mol, 1.27 g), p-chloroacetophe- none (0.01 mol, 1.54 g), potassium carbonate (0.01 mol, 1.38 g) and 0.63 g of copper wire were dissolved in 30 ml of DMF con- tained round bottom flask of about 250 ml capacity. The mixture

To a solution of 1-(4-(4(Chlorobenzeneamino) phenyl) etha- none (0.01 mol, 2.45 g) in rectified spirit, sulphur (0.01 mol, 0.3 g) and iodine (0.01 mol, 1.26 g) were placed in a two-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser. The mixture was subjected to reflux on a water bath around 3 h with occasional shaking. The separated 1-(7-Chloro-10H-Phenothiazine-3-yl) ethanone was filtered, washed with distilled water, dried and crystallized from acetone [17].

animal ethics committee at GIET School of pharmacy, Rajah- mundry, India (GSP/PY/04/2015). Each group maintained six ani- mals under standard lab conditions. Haloperidol was administered 1 mg/kg, IP route to induce catalepsy in standard group of animals. Synthesised compounds (7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg) were also given simultaneously to test group of animals. The animal front paws had been placed on a metallic bar, which elevated at 10 cm above the base of the cage. If the animal main- tained abnormal posture more than 30 s called as catalepsy. The response observed at the various intervals like 0, 30, 60, 120,

dimethylamino) propyl)-10H-phenothiazin-3-yl) methanone (GC8) induced the highest catalepsy period at the various time intervals such as 60, 120, 180 and 240 min. Compound GC8 (7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg) significantly reduces the level of normal dopamine and generated catalepsy as similar to that of haloperidol treated animals with the percentage of 17.3%,41.6%,37.0%,35.8% and 39.5%, 57.1%, 54.0%, 51.8% respectively at various time interval

performing an interaction between 5-(10-(3-(N,N-Dimethylamino) propyl-10H-phenothiazine-3-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-amine,  sodium nitrite, Con. HCl and the different coupling reagents. The Schiff base derivatives were prepared by condensation of 5-(10- (3-(N,N-Dimethylamino) propyl-10H-phenothiazine-3-yl)-1,3,4-th iadiazole-2-amine and different aromatic aldehydes. The deriva- tives of Chalcone were prepared from Claisen-Schmidt condensa- tion reaction between 1-(7-Chloro-10-(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)- 10H-Phenothiazine-3-yl) ethanone, different aldehyde and quani- dine. The FT-IR and 1H NMR spectrum of synthetic analogues were shown peaks due to different groups present in the analogues. In FT-IR spectrum, strong bands at the region of 704, 735, 623, 612,
