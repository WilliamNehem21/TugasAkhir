We add quantitative structure to both Markov processes and Aumann algebras. We prove an extended version of the representation theorem for metrized Markov processes versus metrized Aumann algebras. This theorem states that starting from an arbitrary metrized Markov process, we can extend the Aumann algebra constructed in the previous section to a metrized Aumann algebra that preserves the pseudometric and conversely. In other words the natural isomorphisms that arise in the duality of [15] will turn out to be isometries.

The main impact of this work is to put quantitative reasoning about Markov processes on a firmer footing. It has been over a decade since metric analogues of bisimulation were developed, but they have not had the impact that they might have had. One reason is that with ordinary logical reasoning, one has a clear understanding of what completeness means, thus users of these logics have a good understanding of the power of the principles they are using. What does completeness mean for metric reasoning and approximate reasoning in general? The standard Stone-type duality theorem captures the concept of completeness; it is our hope that the present work will pave the way towards a similar understanding of approximate reasoning principles. There is much to be done, however. In a previous paper [17] we began investigating the relationship between the logic and metrics on Markov processes. The results of the present paper could perhaps strengthen and deepen these preliminary results.
