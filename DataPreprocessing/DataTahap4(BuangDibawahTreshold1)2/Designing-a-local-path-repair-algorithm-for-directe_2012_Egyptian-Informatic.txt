An interest can be viewed as a query or an interrogation that specifies what the inquirer wants. A gradient can be thought of as a reply link pointing toward the neighboring node from which the interest is received. The data message is the event description. Path reinforcement process is the process in which the sink can use multiple paths it established during the gradient setup phase to higher quality events by increasing its data rate [11].

	Lifetime: the time (measured in seconds) from the net- work deployment until the network partitioning, i.e., the time at which the sink no longer receives data due to cutting of all paths to the sub-monitored area, cutting of all paths to the sources in this sub-area, or the death of these sources themselves.

Average end-to-end delay the average of the ripening time of each information at the sink in each timestamp, i.e., the average time of the arrival of the third source reading for each data sample of an object averaged all over the sensed objects through network lifetime, and this time is computed by subtracting the sample time- stamp from the arrival time of the last source reading maximized to three readings if the sink received three or more different readings about the object in this timestamp.
