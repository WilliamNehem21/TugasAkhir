The risk of computers that store most of our essential data get- ting infected by malware has increased exponentially [2]. The cause of these infections occurs due to files downloaded from the vast world of the internet. It takes just seconds for our systems to get compromised. Moreover, these hackers can intrude into

Over the past few years, the risk of financial fraud using tech- nology has been rising and due to their large numbers some orga- nizations and security-providing companies are forced to use automated or semi-automated analysis [5]. These are mainly ana- lyzing the trends of fraud to develop an efficient detection system. But the time for any kind of defense system is very uncertain in the current situation which eventually harms the user.

A classic case of a specific type of malware attack is called ran- somware. As the name suggests this is a type of malware attack where these swindlers hold data hostage until a ransom amount is paid [10]. After the payment of the amount also it is unsure whether the data is going to be returned or not or whether the data has been sold to some other party.

Standard and signature-based ways to detect malware are get- ting more compound as all the modern malware are disposed to various covers to maintain their anonymity. This malware also improves itself periodically to escape from anti-malware systems. Over the last ten years, machine learning has seen a massive engagement in many areas, including cyber security [11] [12]. Cyber security experts firmly believe that using ML-driven anti- malware software will boost the detection of new-age malware. This will also help in the betterment of existing scanning engines. All this is evident from the past research papers on malware detec-

Today, most of the critical data is stored on different types of electronic devices. The risk of these devices getting infected by malware has increased significantly. To be specific there has been a 74% increase in the spread of malware in the year 2022. The most common cause of these intrusions is through the files downloaded from the internet. Detecting malware on a system can be difficult, especially when downloaded along with a file from the internet. Researchers have highlighted that these malware attacks can be associated with social, economic, cultural, or political conflicts. Malware can wreak havoc on a system. Hackers can use it to steal passwords and files and render computers inoperable. A large number of breaches are reported every year. These breaches have affected almost all industries, from government operations to small and large businesses. For instance, in the year 2021, around

ious files. The model obtained is then used for checking a given file and determining whether the file is malicious or not. In the case of URLs, a Logistic Regression Model has been trained on appropriate datasets. To perform feature extraction on the URLs, a tokenizer has been used by the regression model. The regression model is then trained on these values. After training, the model predicts whether the URL is shielded to visit or not. All these modules are combined to obtain the final application. This application will be used to protect the entire system against malicious software.

The research by N Udayakumar et al. [21] aims to understand different types of malware and how Machine Learning can detect and classify them. Several parameters have been used for the col- lection of data about various malware. These parameters are Debug Size, Export Size, Image Version, Resource Size, and Number of Sec- tions. For the classification of malware, three Machine Learning Algorithms have been used. These are Decision Trees, Multilayer Perceptron, and Multi SVM (Support Vector Machine). In the case of the Multi SVM Algorithm, several binary SVMs have been used to ensure proper multi-class classification. Finally, the experiment has concluded that the neural networks model has shown the best performance. This model has an accuracy of about 98% on the training dataset and 99% on the test dataset. Another interpreta- tion that has been made is that Debug Size is the essential feature and is also found to have the highest correlation.

Only a limited number of machine learning models have been used in the previous works. In this research, a large number of machine-learning models have been trained and tested. This enables increasing the number of options that are available for classifying the downloaded files.

In the previous works, the types of malware that are being detected are limited only to a very small amount. The machine learning models in this paper can detect a much larger number of malware. These include Adware, Trojan, Backdoors, Unknown, Multidrop, Rbot, Spam, and Ransomware.

There are several machine learning models that can be used for classification. These models can be broadly divided into two types: Supervised and Unsupervised. Some of the supervised machine- learning models include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Ran- dom Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). On the other hand, some of the unsupervised machine-learning models include K- Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis.

Logistic regression is a type of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm. This is a statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. This is one of the most com- monly used methods in cases when the target or the dependent variable is categorical.

Random Forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm. This classifier contains a specific number of Decision Trees on different subsets of the provided dataset. The overall average of the results of the individual decision trees is used to improve the accuracy of the prediction. This concept is known as Ensemble Learning.

Support Vector Machine is a very popular Supervised Machine Learning Technique. This algorithm can be used for classification as well as regression. The main aim of this method is to form the best decision boundary or line. This line is used to divide n- dimensional space into different classes. This allows for assigning the new data point to the correct category.

For this work, a large number of different types of datasets that are related to malicious and benign files have been explored from different parts of the internet. These datasets from various sources have been combined to obtain the final dataset. This final dataset consists only of the most relevant or essential features related to the nature of a file. The dataset has about 130000 rows (data points) and 57 columns (features).

This step involved getting utterly familiar with the dataset. Var- ious aspects of the dataset have been studied. During this process, all the essential features or attributes present in the dataset were identified [36]. At the same time, all the irrelevant features were dropped from the dataset. Further exploration of the selected fea- tures was conducted to identify trends or patterns.

The results that have been observed in the case of supervised machine learning models are much better as compared to those obtained in the case of unsupervised machine learning models. Among supervised machine learning models, the Random Forest Model is the most accurate. On the other hand, in the case of unsu- pervised machine learning models, Principal Component Analysis has been observed to achieve the highest accuracy.

Balanced Bagging Classifier: This classifier is the same as any standard classifier, but it supports additional balancing. This technique is another step for balancing the training set during the fitting data phase. After implementing this method, an accu- racy of 99.96% was achieved with the Decision Tree Classifier, in the case of the Training Dataset. In the case of the Test Dataset, an accuracy of 99.44% was achieved with the Decision Tree Classifier. Whereas with Random Forest Classifier, accuracies of 99.91% and 99.50% were observed for the Training and Test Dataset respectively.

Three different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier) have been trained on the initially obtained dataset. The Decision Tree Classi- fier and Random Forest Classifier were found to have accuracies of 99.14% and 98.28% respectively. However, the initial dataset was

found to be highly imbalanced. In the given dataset, the number of Benign files is almost double that of Malware files. Several differ- ent techniques have been used to obtain a balanced dataset. Some of these include Oversampling, Undersampling, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and Balanced Bagging Classi- fier. Around 5 supervised and 2 unsupervised machine learning models have been trained on this balanced dataset.

The results of five of these models have been compared with those obtained in the previous research. These include the Decision Tree Classifier (99.57% accuracy), Random Forest Classifier (99.99% accuracy), Gradient Boosting Model (99.09% accuracy), XGBoost Model (99.68% accuracy), and AdaBoost Model (98.87% accuracy). Four out of five of these models have been found to have accuracies greater than those obtained in previous research works.

The obtained dataset had a lot of issues associated with it like a lack of uniform data formatting across a specific column, and rows with null values for various attributes. These were resolved by using several Data Preprocessing Techniques men- tioned in the Section 5.1.

In the beginning, the predictions made by the trained models were not very accurate. This problem was tackled by making several changes in the dataset and hyperparameter tuning of the models. All of this enabled us in improving the accuracies of the models by a very large amount.

The dataset was found to be imbalanced right in the middle of the project. As a result of this, the trained models were making predictions in favor of one class as compared to the other. This was resolved by using various dataset-balancing techniques like oversampling, undersampling, Synthetic Minority Oversam- pling Technique (SMOTE), and Balanced Bagging Classifier. The outcomes of these techniques have been mentioned in Section 5.2.4.

For this project, the obtained dataset was used for training sev- eral different supervised and unsupervised machine learning mod- els. Some of the main supervised machine learning models that were used include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Model. On the other hand, Principle Component Analysis and K-Means clustering are some of the unsupervised machine learning models that were used for this project. Several dataset balancing operations were also performed on the obtained dataset. Some of these techniques include Oversampling, Undersampling, SMOTE, and Balanced Bagging Classifier.

In the case of our project, a large number of ideas can be implemented both soon and over the long term. In the immedi- ate future, the primary goal will be to keep trying different Machine Learning Models and determine the best model per the needs. At the same time, there is also a need to improve the prediction accuracy of each model tried. There is also a need to take care of several things like avoiding multicollinearity and

The latest malware issues cannot be tackled with the help of traditional protection methods used by anti-virus. Machine Learning methods can be used efficiently in cybersecurity to protect against advanced malicious software. Polymeric malware is a type of malware that is difficult to detect with the help of typical signature-based methods. Behavior-based patterns of these kinds of malware can be obtained using static or dynamic analysis.
