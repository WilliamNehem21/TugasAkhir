The proof proceeds by induction on the complexity of the Cut inferences. Below, we present the principal cases of the cut elimination transforma- tion: the cases where a cut on a complex cut formula is replaced by a cut on its subformula, thus decreasing the complexity. The other cases follow the same ideas.

In (7) and (8), isotone cuts (C1; C3) on the complex formula A0 are re- placed by antitone cuts (C4; C2). Similarly for cuts on 0A. (We use double lines for the instantiation of the premise that makes a logical rule applica- ble.)

From this comparison the following conclusions can be drawn: (i) there could be contexts where both PPI and API are felicitous (e.g. conditionals and modal operators); (ii) there could be non-veridical operators which do not license polarity items (eg. in Italian FCI are not allowed in condi- tionals), (iii) there can be other sorts of polarity items sensitive to these and to other kinds of non-veridical expressions.
