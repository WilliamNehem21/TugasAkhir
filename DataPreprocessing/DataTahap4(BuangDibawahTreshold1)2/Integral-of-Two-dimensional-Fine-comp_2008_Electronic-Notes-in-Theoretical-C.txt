J(x, n) satisfies the axioms of the effective uniformity (cf. [10]). We call the topology generated by I(n, k) the Fine topology and put prefix Fine- to such notions. We put no prefix to notions which are defined by means of Euclidean topology.

In the proof of Proposition 3.1 in [6], the crucial properties are those of Lemma 2.1, whose two-dimensional version is Lemma 3.2, and the fact that the complement of a finite (disjoint) union of fundamental dyadic intervals can be represented as a finite disjoint union of fundamental dyadic intervals. A similar fact also holds for fundamental dyadic rectangles. So, we can prove the following proposition.
