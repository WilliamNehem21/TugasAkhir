photomicrograph of the prostate showing extensive shrinkage of glandular tissue whereas glandular hyperplasia occurred in the negative control. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) level significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the treated groups compared to negative control. Treatment with the extract/fi- nasteride caused significant decrease in testosterone to a level comparable to normal. The BPH induced rats treated with S. afzelii/finasteride recorded marked increase in the levels of antioxidant enzymes com- pared to the negative control. S. afzelii effectively ameliorated prostatic hyperplasia exogenously induced by causing extensive shrinkage of glands and stroma. It also exhibited antioxidant properties and showed to be a good prophylaxis.

The term benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) denotes non cancerous enlargement of prostate gland. It is more discretely defined as a non malignant enlargement of prostate gland charac- terized by proliferation of the cellular elements such as its epithe- lial and stromal cells into a discrete mass or nodules [1]. An enlarged prostate means the gland has grown bigger and as the gland grows, it can press on the urethra causing difficulty in urina- tion. The discomfort presented by this condition during urination makes its occurrence worrisome. BPH is considered a normal part of the aging process in men which becomes apparent histological in about 40% of men in their fifties and nearly 90% of men in their eighties [2]. Although the actual cause of BPH remains incom-

Alternative therapy such as herbal medicine has been popular since the ancient time for the treatment of BPH [11]. Their popular- ity is based on the assumption that they are of natural source and therefore not harmful. More importantly is the fact that they are readily assessable, cheap and can be acquired without medical pre- scription. The phytotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of BPH could be recipes from a single plant source or could be extracts from two or more plant sources.

was significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the activities of CAT, SOD and GSH. In the extract/finasteride treated, there was marked recovery in the enzymes level with the extract treated exhibiting dose dependent increase compared to the untreated. The improvement in the activity of the enzymes was more marked in the extract trea- ted compared to the control drug treated. In the simultaneously induced with BPH and treatment with the extract, the level of the enzymes were within the normal range except that the SOD showed higher activity. The TBAR evaluation showed increase in peroxidative activity in the untreated groups. In the extract/finas- teride treated, the peroxidative activity showed marked decrease compared to the untreated with the level comparable to the normal.

The inhibitory activity of S. afzelii on experimentally induced prostatic hyperplasia was evaluated on male Wister rats. The BPH animals induced with testosterone and estradiol exhibited body weight loss while showing significant increase (p < 0.05) in prostate weight compared to the normal control (un-induced rats). Prostatic weight increase is considered as one of the important biomarkers of BPH enlargement [23]. The enlargement of the organ

is seen as more of histological diagnosis characterized by prolifer- ation of the cellular elements of the prostate which involves the stromal and epithelial components [1]. In this study, the histopathology of the negative control showed glandular prolifera- tion with extensive stroma and unremarkable fibro-muscular matrix. A contrast was however observed after thirty days of treat- ment with S. afzelii/finasteride where extensive shrinkage of glands with marked increase in density of the fibro-muscular matrix was observed. The extract therefore, seems to have effectively attenu- ated the prostatic hyperplasia. It was also apparent that treatment with the extract/finasteride boosted appetite that was otherwise suppressed during BPH induction.

The study showed S. afzelii to have effectively ameliorated pro- static hyperplasia exogenously induced by causing extensive shrinkage of glands and stroma. It also exhibited antioxidant prop- erties and showed to be a good prophylaxis. These findings support its therapeutic use by the herbalists in treating BPH.
