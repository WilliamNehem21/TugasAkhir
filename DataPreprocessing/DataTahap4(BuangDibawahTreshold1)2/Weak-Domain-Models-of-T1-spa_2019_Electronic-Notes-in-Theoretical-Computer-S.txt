A poset model of a topological space X is a poset P such that Max(P ), the set of maximal elements of P , with the relative Scott topology, is homeomorphic to X [5]. Every space having a poset model must be T1. In [6], Martin proved that if a space is homeomorphic to the maximal point space of a continuous dcpo, then the space is Choquet complete. Thus not every T1 space has a domain model.

In [9], it was proved that every T1 space X has a local quasicontinuous domain model, denoted by Zh(X). An important property is that X is sober iff Zh(X) is sober. So if X is not sober, then Zh(X) cannot be quasicontinuous. Hence, there exists a local quasicontinuous domain which is not quasicontinuous.
