The usefulness of a logic depends on the available connectives in its language: thus, as we have pointed out in the introduction, for talking about paracompleteness we need a negation and a disjunction satisfying particular conditions. However, we are going to complete the language with an appropriate conjunction and an appro- priate implication. In Definition 2.3 we establish some conditions on connectives so they can be considered as conjunction, disjunction, and implication.

Observe that conditions of neoclassicality of Definition 2.9 are more restrictive than those on Definition 2.3. Specifically, we have that items (ii) and (iii) on Defini- tion 2.9 imply items (ii) and (iii) on Definition 2.3. Moreover, item (i) on Definition

In this paper we introduce the notion of genuine paracomplete logic, which are logics rejecting the dual principles that define genuine paraconsistent logic. On the one hand, in a similar way to the analysis done in [3], we develop a study among three- valued logics in order to find all connectives defining genuine paracomplete logics. We found two unary connectives that can serve as negation. By fixing one of these
