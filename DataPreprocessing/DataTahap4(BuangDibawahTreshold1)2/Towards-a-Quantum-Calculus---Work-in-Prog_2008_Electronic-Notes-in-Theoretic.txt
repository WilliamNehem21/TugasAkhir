In the quantum gate array model, the computational part of a quantum information processing task is performed by unitary transformations. In the one-way quantum computer [9], computations rely upon one-qubit projective measurements followed by unitary Pauli corrections. The measurement calculus [3] has been introduced as a formal model for one-way quantum computation. The aim of this paper is to intro- duce a unified and generalized model of quantum computation, the quantum calcu- lus: unified because both unitary transformations and one-qubit measurements (i.e. the main ingredients of one-way quantum computations) are allowed, and general- ized in terms of quantum operations and in terms of classical control. The quantum calculus allows any admissible transformation or general measurement (including

The denotational semantics [. ] defined in this section is a pure denotational semantics because the semantic domain is based on valuations over pure quantum states, as opposed to the semantics defined in section 3.2 which is based on density matrices.
