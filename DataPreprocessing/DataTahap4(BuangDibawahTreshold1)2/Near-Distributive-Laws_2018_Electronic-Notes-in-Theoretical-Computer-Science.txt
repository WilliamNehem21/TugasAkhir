We know of no nontrivial monad which admits a distributive law with every monad. This places some constraint on the use of distributive laws in programming. We consider instead monads which admit near distributive laws with every monad, calling these amenable and provide examples.

We next introduce an approach to bands which uses only the list data type. This illustrates our claim that, by relaxing axioms, we can sometimes describe what we need using readily available data types. We shall see in Theorem 6.2 below how this result leads to a simplification in specifying near distributive laws. In effect, we have gotten around the work to solve the word problem for free bands by simply not needing it!
