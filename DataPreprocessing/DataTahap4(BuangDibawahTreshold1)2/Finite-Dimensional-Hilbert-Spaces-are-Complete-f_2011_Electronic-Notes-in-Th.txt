Before attempting to prove Theorem 2.2, we reduce the statement to something simpler. By arguments analogous to those of Hasegawa, Hofmann, and Plotkin [2], it suffices without loss of generality to consider terms M, N that satisfy some additional conditions. The additional conditions are:

{A1, A2, A4}. Define [B]]M to be a 2-dimensional Hilbert space with orthonormal basis {B3, B5}. Note that the names of the basis vectors have been chosen to suggest a correspondence between basis vectors of [A]]M and wires labeled A in the diagram M , and similarly for [B]]M .
