Price discrimination is an economic term for describing that a seller offers the same (or almost the same) product or service at a price dependent on some charac- teristics, or negotiation with, the buyer. Commonly agreed economic understanding states that this has advantages both for seller and buyer [5]. A direct implication of this thinking is that the seller needs to acquire information about the prospective buyer in order to distinguish customers and set the optimal price. Hence, the ra- tional seller will drive to use efficient methods of collection and access to personal data that can be used to distinguish the buyers.

The exact phrasing of the questionnaire questions is of course of utter impor- tance to the respondents correct and non-ambiguous understanding. A preliminary questionnaire was made and tested on about ten students at our university, in order to provide feedback and advice on the interpretation and response of the question formulation. Some questions are measured with nominals (e.g. Yes/No), others with a range of ordinals (e.g. on a scale from 1 to 5).

It seemed interesting to probe for a difference in the reluctance to release per- sonal data in name (nonymous) as opposed to anonymous. Intuitively, the privacy negotiability is probably dependent on this. The idea was that this could make it interesting to price discriminate anonymously, like child/adult bus ticket.
