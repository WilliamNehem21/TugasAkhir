This paper is a study of the denotational semantics of freshly generated names in a continuation-passing style (CPS) setting. Freshly generated names are a key ele- ment of many computational effects, and are also intrinsically interesting; they may be used to represent secrets such as cryptographic keys, for example. The behaviour of names in a functional setting is rather subtle, and has been studied, via proto- typical calculi such as the nu-calculus [7], using both operational and denotational techniques.
