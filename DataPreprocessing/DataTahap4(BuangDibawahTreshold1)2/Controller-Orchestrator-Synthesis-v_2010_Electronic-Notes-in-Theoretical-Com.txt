We have considered the decision problems (SC) and (SO) of controller/orchestra- tor synthesis. Deterministic algorithms that check in exponential-time whether a controller/orchestrator exists have been proposed. An interesting (and still open) question is to evaluate the exact complexity of (SC) and (SO). Let us remark that the following decision problem is known to be EXPTIME -hard: given a finite set PG of program variables, deterministic finite frames F = (W, R), F1 = (W 1, R1),
