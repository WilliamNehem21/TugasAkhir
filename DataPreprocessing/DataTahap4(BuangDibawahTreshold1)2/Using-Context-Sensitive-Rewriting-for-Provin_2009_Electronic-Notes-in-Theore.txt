We have implemented the techniques described in the previous sections as part of the termination tool mu-term [1,22]. In order to evaluate the techniques which are reported in this paper we have made some benchmarks. We have considered the examples in the 2007 Termination Problem Data Base (TPDB, version 4.0) available through the URL:

Therefore, it seems that using Corollary 4.3 to prove innermost termination of rewriting is not as good idea (at least with the considered set of examples) since we lose some examples due to a too restrictive new replacement map, and the average time is the same. Regarding the application of these ideas to cycles, we obtain better results but no essential improvement since we also lose some examples.
