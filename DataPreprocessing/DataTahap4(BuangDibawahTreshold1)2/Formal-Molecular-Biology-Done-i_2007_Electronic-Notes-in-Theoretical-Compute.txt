What some consider a revolution in biology has started a few years ago. New measurement technologies, such as DNA micro-arrays, are now producing huge amounts of data at the molecular level. For the first time in biology, a top-down ap- proach, complementing the usual bottom-up one, is shown to be possible [10]. These genome-wide snapshots could be immensely valuable in the process of reconstruc- tion and validation of the cell molecular mechanisms. But, with this new possibility comes also the very basic question of how what one wants to reconstruct should be represented in the first place. In which language should the dense networks of interacting processes the cell is made of be described, simulated and analyzed?

One observes that (back) which is undoing a communication is also a communica- tion. It is the exact inverse to (com). To keep the system consistent one is allowed to roll-back if and only if the other former partner in communication is willing to. We will use sometimes irreversible or unbacktrackable actions, written a. For such actions communication is simply not memorized, and one uses the simplified

So we do this differently by letting processes be guarded by multisets of actions, or multi-actions. The ordinary case is when these multisets are just singletons. Multi- actions can be performed and backtracked in any order. Multi-actions are given by: 6

A variant of CCS comparable to CCS-R was never considered before as far as we know. This is perhaps for want of any motivation. Trying to fit some biological trait in a formal picture is indeed a great source of inspiration. Once this is done one may perhaps forget the original motivation, at least for a moment and look for other kinds of applications. In our own case, the representation of decentralized transactional mechanisms comes to mind, but work is needed here to see if something interesting can be done and we leave this for further investigation.
