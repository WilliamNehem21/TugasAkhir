Interactive theorem proving today permits the verification of sophisticated theo- rems and complex algorithms, although the process remains cumbersome and time- consuming. We believe that in many instances, access to other tools such as Com- puter Algebra Systems (CAS) can accelerate this process. Whilst there have been significant advances in combining provers with external tools, as described in pre- vious work [6], the increased complexity of current proof developments places new demands and challenges on tool integrations.
