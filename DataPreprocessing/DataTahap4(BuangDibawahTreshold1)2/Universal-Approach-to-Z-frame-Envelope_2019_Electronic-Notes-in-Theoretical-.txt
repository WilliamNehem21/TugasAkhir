In [1], Gehrke and Van Gool developed a universal construction which associates to arbitrary lattice two distributive lattice envelopes with a Galois connection between them. With such a construction, they establish a topological duality for bounded lattice. Of course, some of the results about this construction can be regarded as finitary versions of the results on injective hull of semilattices of Burns and Lakser [2]. The key notion to these constructions are both admissibility, one is finitely
