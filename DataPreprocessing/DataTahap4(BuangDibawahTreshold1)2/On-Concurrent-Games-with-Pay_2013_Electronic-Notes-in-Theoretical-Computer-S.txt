The paper considers an extension of concurrent games with a payoff, i.e. a numerical value resulting from the interaction of two players. We extend a recent determinacy result on concurrent games [5] to a value theorem, i.e. a value that both players can get arbitrarily close to, whatever the behaviour of their opponent. This value is not reached in general, i.e. there is not always an optimal strategy for one of the players (there is for finite games). However when they exist, we show that optimal strategies are closed under composition,

Games are a well-established tool in mathematics, economics, logic, and of course computer science: in the latter, two-player games in particular are very widely used to model situations where an agent (e.g. a program) interacts with its environment (e.g. the user, the operating system). For instance, researchers in game semantics

Simple parallel composition. Let A and B be event structures with polarity. The operation A  B simply juxtaposes disjoint copies of A and B, maintaining their causal dependency and specifying a finite subset of events as consistent if it restricts to consistent subsets of A and B. Polarities are unchanged.

In this section, we prove the value theorem on concurrent games. The proof proceeds in two steps. First, we exhibit key constructions on strategies and the study the results of their interactions. This analysis will allow us to characterize the values of all positions of the game. Exploiting well-foundedness of the game, we will deduce the sought-for value theorem.
