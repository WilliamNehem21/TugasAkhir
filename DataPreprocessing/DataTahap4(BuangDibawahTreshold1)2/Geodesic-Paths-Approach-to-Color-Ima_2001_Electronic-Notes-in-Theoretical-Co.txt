New filter class for multichannel image processing is introduced and analyzed. The new technique of image enhancement is capable of reducing impulsive and Gaussian noise and it significantly outperforms the standard methods of noise reduction. In the paper a smoothing operator, based on a random walk model and a fuzzy similarity measure between pixels connected by a digital geodesic path is introduced. The efficiency of the proposed method was tested on the standard color images using the objective image quality measures. Obtained results show that the new method not only outperforms standard noise reduction algorithms, but has some interesting features useful for segmentation of noisy color images.

The best known order statistics filter is the so called Vector Median Filter (VMF). The definition of the multichannel median is a direct extension of the ordinary single-channel median definition [1]. VMF uses the L1 or L2 norm to order vectors according to their relative magnitude differences.

Another efficient rank-ordered technique called Hybrid Directional Filter was presented in [4]. This filter operates on the directional and the magni- tude of the color vectors independently and then combines them to produce a unique final output. Another more complex hybrid filter, which involves the utilization of an Arithmetic Mean Filter (AMF), has also been proposed [4]. The reduction of image noise without major degradation of the image structure is one of the most important problems of the low-level image pro- cessing. A whole variety of algorithms has been developed, however none of them can be seen as a final solution of the noise problem and therefore a new
