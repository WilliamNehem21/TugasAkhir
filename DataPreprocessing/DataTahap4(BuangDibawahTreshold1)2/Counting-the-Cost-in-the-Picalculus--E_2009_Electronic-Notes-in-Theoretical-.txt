We envisage two immediate applications for these ideas. The first is web ser- vices, [2]. In [17,6] a basic theory of contracts for web services is introduced, based on a variation of CCS, [19]. Our use of cost environments could immediately be applied here, and indeed we intend to pursue this line of work in future publications. The second is in the development of a more realistic theory of networked processes. Communication across a network is not instantaneous; by introducing some repre- sentation of routers into the process description language, we can associate as the cost of a communication the number of routers through which the message has to travel. This is pursued in [10].
