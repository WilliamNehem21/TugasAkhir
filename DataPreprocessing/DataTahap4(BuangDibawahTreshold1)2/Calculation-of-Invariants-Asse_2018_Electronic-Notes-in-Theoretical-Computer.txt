Questions (i) and (ii) are answered by using Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.3 for loops with a potentially non-deterministic body, but which behaves deterministically on the variables that occur in the loop guard. Questions (iii) and (iv) are answered using a technique based on mathematical induction, but only for loops of form

Proof. Because this is a theorem about a formula whose instances are formulas, then a system of formal derivation of predicates will be used to ensure a correct result. The reader should understand the following demonstration as a family of demonstrations (one for each instance of predicates inv, NBG, and domBG), which results from applying each of the following derivations in the order they are pre- sented. The rules of inference that are used in this work are those of the calculative logic (original of [31]) presented in the book of Gries [32].
