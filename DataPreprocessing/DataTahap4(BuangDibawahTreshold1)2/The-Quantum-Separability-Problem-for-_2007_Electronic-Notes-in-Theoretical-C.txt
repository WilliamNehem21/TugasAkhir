Recently, the role of entanglement became important and often necessary in many different contexts like quantum algorithms, quantum communication proto- cols, quantum cryptography, etc. (see e.g. [2]). So, the problem of deciding whether a given quantum state is separable or entangled has become of uppermost impor- tance. This can be called the Quantum Separability Problem (QSP). Essentially, it represents an instance of a combinatorial optimization problems called the Weak Membership Problem [3].

One can show that m is indeed the mean and V is the correlation matrix. These define the Gaussian state uniquely. In what follows, we simply consider the case m = 0, because m can be easily removed by some local displacement and thus has no influence on the separability or inseparability of the state.

Notice, however, that for multipartite systems besides separability (resp. insepara- bility) there can be the possibility of partial separability (resp. partial inseparabil- ity), e.g. separability of a subsystem with respect to the others which in turns are entangled [9]. Hence QSP becomes much more subtle and even for Gaussian states it is not completely understood.
