Proof. Finite intersections leading again to compact saturated subsets, we can assume the collection to be filtered. By well-filteredness, an open cover of the intersection will contain an element of the filter base already. This being compact, a finite subcover will suffice.	 

The reader is correct in suspecting that the passage to the co-compact topology is an involution for stably compact spaces. This will follow easily from Theorem 2.12 and is recorded as Corollary 2.13 below. For the moment we consider the following proposition which is reminiscent of the well-known

Although theorems 2.5 and 2.12 suggest that we can switch freely between compact ordered and stably compact spaces, a difference between the two standpoints does become apparent when one considers the corresponding mor- phisms: neither is a continuous map between stably compact spaces patch continuous, nor is every patch continuous function continuous with respect to the original topologies. Indeed, it is the fact that T0-continuous maps arise in applications to Denotational Semantics which motivates our interest in stably

More interestingly, let LSC(X) denote the set of lower continuous func- tions on (X, C) into the extended non-negative reals. A number of authors, [10,17,26,6], have given definitions (of increasing generality) of an integral for lower semicontinuous functions with respect to continuous valuations. The definitions by Tix and Heckmann are directly applicable to stably compact spaces, and give the same result, [6, page 197] (see also [3, Section 6.3]). Thus
