Minghui Wang et al. [17] design a new model called Malsite- Deep for prediction malonylation sites that protein occurs in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPD). At the first stage apply seven feature extraction methods to protein to extract feature informa- tion from it. Second stage handle imbalance data by applying the under-sampling NearMiss-2 and sellect best feature subset. Last stage these data go to Deep Neural Networks predict sites of malonylation. Evaluation of model by 10-fold cross model perfor- mance is evaluated by 10-fold validation and independent test sets shows that the AUC value on the training dataset reaches 0.99. The AUC values on the four independent test datasets all reach above

Given a Graph Data set represent (graph of double helix DNA Structure) that continue huge number of four element,(A, T, C, G) connected from one side of DNA strand to another side. Connection element is not arbitrary it done in legal form: (A with T) and (C with G). These elements connected in one strand by three components (phosphate, sugar and base itself). Frist algorithm begin by take one strand of DNA by separate it from

double helix and work with it. Then convert these structures of DNA into Messenger RNA (mRNA) this step can be done by replacing every Thymine (T) element by Uracil (U) element and stay Cytosine (C) and Guanine (G) without change for all structures of mRNA. After this step all graph (mRNA Strand) must cut into multiple sub-graph dataset then enter to RD- FSM algorithm to find different Sub-graph possible for given minimum supported threshold. Example bellow can show how process will done.
