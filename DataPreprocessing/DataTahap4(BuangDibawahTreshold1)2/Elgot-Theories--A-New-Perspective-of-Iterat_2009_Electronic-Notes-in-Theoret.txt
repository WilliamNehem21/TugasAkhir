The next step is to prove that these morphisms mA form a natural trans- formation m : RH    zS,which is a monad morphism and, in fact, a morphism of Elgot monads. The proof is quite involved making use of the axioms of Elgot monads for RH and the way the dagger operation of RH is defined in several steps, see [7] and [2]. Due to space constraints we have to omit the details.
