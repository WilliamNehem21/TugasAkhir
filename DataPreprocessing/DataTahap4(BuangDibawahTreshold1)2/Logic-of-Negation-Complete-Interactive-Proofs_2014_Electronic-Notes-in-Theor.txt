The subject matter of this paper is classical normal modal logic of non-monotonic interactive proofs, i.e., a novel modal logic of negation-complete and thus disjunctive interactive proofs (LDiiP) and an existing modal logic of non-disjunctive and thus negation-incomplete interactive proofs (LiiP) (cf. [20] and [19]). (We abbreviate interactivity-related adjectives with lower-case letters.)

Our immediate motivation for LDiiP is first the theoretical concept and second the practical application of a negation-complete variant of our interactive proofs [20,19,17]. The overarching motivation for LDiiP is to serve in an intuitionistic foundation of interactive computation. See [17] for a programmatic motivation.

Our technical contributions are the following. First, we provide a standard but also oracle-computational and set-theoretically constructive Kripke-semantics for LDiiP (cf. Section 2.2). Like in [20,19], we endow the proof modality with a standard Kripke-semantics [1], but whose accessibility relation MRa we first define constructively in terms of elementary set-theoretic constructions, 5 namely as MRa,

Proof. Like in [17]. That a Hilbert-style proof system can be viewed as induced by a compact closure operator is well-known (e.g., see [12]); that Cl is indeed such an operator can be verified by inspection of the inductive definition of Cl; and substitution invariance follows from our definitional use of axiom schemas. 6	2
