The subscripts of nominal terms control sorting and we tend to omit them when they are clear from the context or immaterial. We call [a]t an abstraction. We have not introduced any means to introduce pairs of terms, as we only use product sorts to give a sort to transition relations (see Section 3).

fa(t) is the set of atoms a in A(t) that have an occurrence in t that is not within the scope of an abstraction [a]tj, for some term tj. We call fa(t) the set of free atoms of t. For example, fa(f ([a]g(a, b))) = {b} and also fa(g(f ([a]a), a)= {a}.

We say that a nominal term is closed if it contains no variables. It is called open otherwise. For example, a and [a]f (b) are closed terms, but x and [a]y are open terms. Note that neither a nor [a]f (b) is binding-closed.

The reader should notice that this definition is the very basic formulation of open bisimilarity, which does not involve distinctions, see [29] and [28]. In Definition 5.2, it is important to note that the ranging over all the substitutions is performed at each step of the bisimulation game.
