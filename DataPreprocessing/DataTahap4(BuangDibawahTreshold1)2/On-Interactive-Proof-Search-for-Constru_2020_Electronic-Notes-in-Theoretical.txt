Modal logics play an important role in several areas of Computer Science and Phi- losophy. For instance, various type systems for concurrent and distributed compu- tations [12,15] employ modalities and a modal lambda calculus has been proposed to model information flow in computer networks [4]. In Artificial Intelligence (AI) they are useful to model knowledge structures among agents, ontologies or the behaviour of computer systems. These and other applications oblige to design effective and simple to use procedures for proof search in modal logics. However, the existing processes are quite sophisticated, for instance [17,1], and machine-oriented in the sense that their inference rules deviate from the natural human reasoning, for they
