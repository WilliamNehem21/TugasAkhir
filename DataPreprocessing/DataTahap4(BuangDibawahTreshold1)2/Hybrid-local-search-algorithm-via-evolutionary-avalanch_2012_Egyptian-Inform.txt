Considering these capabilities, many optimization problems can be solved using such distributed facility [2]. However, like many other heuristic methods, the rate of convergence of find- ing ground states is low when the problem dimension grows [5]. More specifically, this is reported to be a challenging aspect of the more conventional approaches such as the SA as re- ported earlier in [5,6].
