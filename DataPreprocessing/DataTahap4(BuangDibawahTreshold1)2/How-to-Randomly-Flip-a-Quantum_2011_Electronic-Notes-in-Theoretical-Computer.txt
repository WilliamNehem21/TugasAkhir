We show that an important class of quantum channels, the convex closure of the spin channels, can be algebraically represented by classical channels that have four inputs and four outputs. This result is used to develop an experimentally realizable scheme for randomly flipping qubits whose basis of preparation is unknown. This scheme can be used to interrupt, but not necessarily eradicate, any form of hidden communication based on quantum information. It can also be used to remove steganographic information embedded in quantum data.

The ability to randomly flip classical bits is a fundamental operation with many uses. It can be used to interrupt undesirable communication [2], for instance, or to remove steganographic information hidden in data [3]. Each of these help to ensure the security of systems. The scheme for randomly flipping classical bits is as follows: given a bit, we toss a coin, and then based on the result of this coin toss, either flip the bit or leave it alone. This scheme eliminates any and all correlation between the information sent and the information received. As a result, transmitting information with bits that have been randomly flipped is impossible.

bits. Ideally, one hopes to see these properties also reflected in the case of qubits, since each choice of basis defines a classical channel, as we will see in the next section. Though it seems a bit naive at first glance, we nevertheless now restrict our attention to entropy increasing channels on qubits.

In the last section, we obtained a nontrivial factorization of zero and did so without doing any quantum mechanics. In fact, all we had to do was work with (4, 4) classical channels. On the surface, this seems very encouraging. However, this
