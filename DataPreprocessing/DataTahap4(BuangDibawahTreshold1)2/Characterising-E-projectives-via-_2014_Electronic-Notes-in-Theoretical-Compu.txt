Example 3.7 It is quite straightforward to check that the comonads UZ = FZGZ (induced by the adjunction FZ E GZ) and UZ = FZGZ (induced by the adjunction FZ E GZ) are KZ-comonads, following the respective definitions of the functors and the co-multiplications explicitly given earlier in Example 2.8(2) and (3).
