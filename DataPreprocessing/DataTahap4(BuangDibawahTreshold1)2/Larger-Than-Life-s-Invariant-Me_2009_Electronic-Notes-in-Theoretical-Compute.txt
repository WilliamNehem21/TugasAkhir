come up with even one such rule? It is necessary to check that for such a candidate rule, any seed started on a background of 0's either shrinks and eventually dies, or grows forever, covering Z2 with all 1's or some pattern, with density less than 1, of 1's. We have discovered several rules which appear through empirical data to have these properties. However, we are not yet convinced that the rules are indeed examples.
