Coalgebras for an endofunctor provide a uniform framework for the study of reactive systems. In this article, we will study coalgebras for functors on the category Meas of measurables spaces and maps. The subprobability functor S will play a role similar to the powerset functor in that it allows us to treat stochastic aspects instead of non-deterministic ones.

We will introduce two technical conditions on sets of predicate liftings: separability and admissibility. Our notion of separable predicate liftings is a specialization of the one used in coalgebraic logic over Set, cf. [11]. It was first introduced in [6] for sets of unary predicate liftings.
