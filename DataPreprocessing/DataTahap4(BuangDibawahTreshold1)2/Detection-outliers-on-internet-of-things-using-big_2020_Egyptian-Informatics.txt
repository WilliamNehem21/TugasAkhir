Resilient distributed datasets (RDDs) processes a large amount of data by making use of the RAM, by allowing its actions and transformations to use the cache memory to reduce the computa- tional cost and to make the computations more faster. Cordova and Moh [11] have presented a new algorithm called RDD-DBSCAN to overcome the drawbacks of MapReduce with DBSCAN and to be processed in parallel and in a distributed way using RDDs. Cordova and Moh used apache spark which considered to be an implemen- tation of RDDs to implement RDD-DBSCAN.

was constructed by adding elevation information to a 2D road net- work in North Jutland, Denmark [30] with 434,874 instances and four attributes, while the second experiment has been made by using a synthetic dataset of one million entries, two features, three centers and cluster standard deviation of 0.4, finally the third experiment has been made by using synthetic dataset of one mil- lion entries, 25 features, three centers and cluster standard devia- tion of 0.4.
