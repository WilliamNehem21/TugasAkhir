The first author was instrumental in developing so-called Nominal techniques, including Nominal Logic [22,14]. These have similar applications to a-logic and they have a freshness predicate #. However they are inconsistent with the axiom of choice; for example Nominal Logic is inconsistent with a unary term-former f such that (f s)#s always. It seems that we can axiomatise such an f in a-logic, as

In the semantics, predicates are sets of (tuples of) elements of the domain. at is a unary predicate. Atoms are simply a subset of the underlying domain; those in [[at ] which is the interpretation of at in the domain. Elements of [at ] are special; they cannot be in the image of the interpretation of any term-formers.
