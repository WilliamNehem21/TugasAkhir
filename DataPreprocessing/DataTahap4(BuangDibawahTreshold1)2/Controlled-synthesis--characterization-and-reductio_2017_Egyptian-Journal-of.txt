For a typical synthesis of graphite oxide, a mixture of 96 ml of concentrated H2SO4 and 10.7 ml of concentrated H3PO4 (9:1 vol- ume ratio) was prepared. The mixture of these acids was poured slowly into the mixture of 0.6 g graphite powder and 4.8 g potas- sium permanganate (1:8) in a beaker under stirring with glass

The epoxy groups of GO can be easily attacked by nucleophilic regents, resulting in a nucleophilic substitution reaction to open the epoxy rings [17]. It is supposed that ascorbic acid donates proton and electron to graphene oxide. It opens the epoxide rings and converts to easily leaving group (OH) and finally dehydrates, leaving a graphene sheet. To remove the OH group it is believed that ascorbic acid donates one proton to the OH group and finally dehydrates.

the oxidation level of GO. However, the intensity at around 300 nm for GO4 is relatively low as compared to GOC3. This seems to indi- cate that more potassium permanganate will over oxidize graphite. To study the effect of reaction temperature on the degree of oxidation two samples (GO4 and GO5) were taken. There ratio of graphite powder to KMnO4 was 1:8 and temperatures were fixed
