The complete proof of Theorem 3.8 can be found in the Coq formalization. We sketch some of the compatibility proofs to show how proofs are done in our frame- work, in particular the crucial case of app, where we need the distinction between active and passive tests. We compare ourselves to the proof technique of [10], which would do an induction on the definition of the closure using Definition 3.1. We do not need an induction on the number of evaluation steps for our small-step defini- tion, but a nested induction proof for a big-step relation would exhibit the same issues. The strong up-to techniques lam, refl, and red are easy to deal with; we detail the proof for lam.
