Many of theses definitions apply at the same time to a set S and its closure S, so we will restrict ourselves to compact (i.e. bounded and closed) sets. Here a representation using grids of points with a decreasing Hausdorff distance to the represented set is of interest.

Berg et.al. [2] consider a constructive version of the (plain) Jordan curve theorem, which unfortunately is not enough for our considerations: A point x outside of the curve and another point y inside of the curve can be constructed from the curve, and that additionally, for every point z not on the curve, there is a polygonal path not touching the curve that either connects x and z or y and z.

The first two of the following representations are immediate from the definition of Jordan domains in [6,12,14]. The third is essentially a restriction of a representation of compact sets using a grid of points from [16](143ff). Some properties of this approach (concerning computational complexity) can be found in own paper [17]. In [4] a comparison of several representation of compact sets can be found.
