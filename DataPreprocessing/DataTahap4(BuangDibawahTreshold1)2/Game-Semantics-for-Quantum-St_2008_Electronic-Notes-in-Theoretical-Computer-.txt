data. In this paper we use a different strategy: quantum data is represented by the classical interactions used to manipulate quantum states and extract information from them with measurements. More precisely, a quantum state is represented as a strategy which makes someone chose the actions according to the laws of quantum mechanics. Our proposed model is built with ideas from game semantics augmented with a new game in which plays describe the behavior of quantum stores.

In this picture, the quantum counterpart of dereferencing, which classically returns the value stored, is quantum measurement. The counterpart of assignment is state preparation. Note that, while classically it is possible to assign a value to a store multiple times, this is not the case with quantum stores, as a quantum state cannot be destroyed. Instead, preparation expands a given state with a new known quan-

Proof. By induction on the construction of M . By the second and third clauses of the definition of computability, we can assume that M is constructed out of semi- closed terms. We explain the most interesting part of the proof, leaving out the cases which are standard classical cases.

We did not explore fully the categorical properties of the quantum store are- nas. For example, one could consider the subcategory of the category of arenas and probabilistic strategies that consist of quantum store arenas and the quantum strategies between them. This category is very different from the other categories which were studied to understand quantum information flow since the qstore arena does not have a fixed dimension while the objects in these other categories are finite dimensional Hilbert space.
