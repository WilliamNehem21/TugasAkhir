The notion of proof nets has been introduced in [Gir87]. The proof nets are a "complete" representation of the notion of proofs of Linear Logic, which means that any proof of Linear Logic has the corresponding proof net and any proof net the corresponding proofs of Linear Logic. Proof nets also has a clean operational semantics based on graph rewriting reduction. In the mul- tiplicative exponential fragment of proof nets, the graph rewriting reduction is strong normalizing [Gir87] and con uent [Laf95]. Proof nets can thus be a computational system.

De nition 2.2 (polarized formulas) An IIMELL formula is a pair hA; pli where A is a MELL formula and pl is an element of f+; g. + and  are called Danos-Regnier polarity. A formula hA; pli can be written as Apl. An IIMELL formula is called polarized formula. A formula with + (resp. ) polarity is called +-formula or positive formula (resp. -formula or negative formula).

De nition 3.2 (depth) For a link L in a proof net  , the depth of L in d (L) is the number of !-boxes that include L in  . The depth of  d( ) is the maximum of d (L) for any link L in  . The co-depth co-d (L) is d( )  d (L).

(d) Let 01 and 02 be an imperial sub-proof-net of 1 and that of 2 respectively that have the same positive conclusion formula C+ whose position in 1 is the same as 2. The head-formula of the main path of 01 is discharged (resp. absorbed) i the head-formula of the main path of 02 is discharged (resp. absorbed). Moreover, if both head- formulas are discharged (resp. absorbed) in both 1 and 2, then both head-formulas must have the same discharged (resp. absorbed) point. (coincidence of discharge and absorption)
