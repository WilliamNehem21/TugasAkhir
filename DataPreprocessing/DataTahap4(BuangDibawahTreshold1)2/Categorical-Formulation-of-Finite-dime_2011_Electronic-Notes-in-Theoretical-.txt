It is expected that these results will have interesting ramifications for informa- tion theory. C*-algebraic techniques are often useful for exploring the properties of quantum information; a good example of this is the CBH theorem [3]. The descrip- tion of C*-algebras given in this paper gives a new, more abstract way to approach this subject.

These results also suggest a new, more abstract route into investigations of physical applications of C*-algebras. The most immediate application, which we do not discuss in this paper, is to the study of unitary topological quantum field theories. We also note that the special unitary Frobenius monoids that we are concerned with in this paper have already been shown to give rise to conformal field theories [9]; the results of this paper then suggest that such theories should be thought of as generalised C*-algebras.

the monoid into the ring of operators on V is therefore involution-preserving, as it maps one involution into another. We shall see that the mapping is injective and preserves the multiplication and unit of (V, m, u), so in fact we have a fully-fledged involution-preserving monoid embedding as described by lemmas 3.19 and 3.20.

Proof. By lemma 3.19 the embedding must be a morphism of monoids. Note that we do not need to specify whether we are using the left or right involution of End(A), since by lemma 3.18 they are both the identity. We must show that this embedding

Proof. First, we point out that the norm of property 1 is not directly related to the inner products of properties 2 or 3, in the usual way by which a norm can be obtained from an inner product, and sometimes vice-versa. In fact, the norm of a C*-algebra will usually not satisfy the parallelogram identity, and so cannot arise directly from any inner product.
