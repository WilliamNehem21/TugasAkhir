Since all other modalities preserve arbitrary meets the same result holds for them and for all other right Galois adjoints. In an intuitionistic context where one might take M to be a frame (i.e. a (complete) Heyting algebra with sup-homomorphisms) we can internalize the partial order using the defining property of a Heyting algebra so we obtain
