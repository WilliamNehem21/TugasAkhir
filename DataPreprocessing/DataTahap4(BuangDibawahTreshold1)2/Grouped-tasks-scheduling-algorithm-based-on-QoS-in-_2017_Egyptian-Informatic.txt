Improved cost-based scheduling algorithm is used in cloud computing to achieve minimum make span and cost and also to improve the computation/communication ratio [4]. This algorithm calculates priorities of tasks based on resources cost and profit. Then tasks are distributed into three groups (low, medium, and high) depending on their priorities and use job grouping algorithm to execute tasks in each group.

The main idea of GTS algorithm is to divide all tasks into categories/classes based on its attributes. The attributes of tasks are used as explained in TS algorithm. Each category will have tasks with similar attributes. These categories will be ordered to schedule based on weights that are given to attri- butes of tasks in TS algorithm. In this case the categories are subject to the scheduling, while tasks are not. The first sched- uled category will have tasks with high value of attributes/high priority than other categories. Then in the chosen category the task with minimum execution time will be scheduled first.

The objective of this paper was to define an algorithm used in cloud computing which gets minimum execution time to all tasks with low latency to tasks with high priority. GTS algo- rithm was proposed to schedule tasks into services with driven QoS. GTS algorithm combines many types of task attributes (user type, task priority, task size, latency of task) which are used to measure priority of tasks.

with 12% and 9% with 50 and 100 services respectively. GTS algorithm gets low latency to tasks with expected urgent prior- ity and its users are in urgent than both Min-Min and TS algo- rithms. GTS algorithm gets low latency to long tasks than Min-Min algorithm with 57% and 54% with 50 and 100 ser- vices respectively. GTS achieves load balancing almost the same as TS algorithm.
