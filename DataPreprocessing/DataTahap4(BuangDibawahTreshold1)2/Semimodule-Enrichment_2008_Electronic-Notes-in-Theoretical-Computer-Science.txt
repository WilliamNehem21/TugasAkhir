This section considers the situation arising from a monoidal V-category with finite biproducts. By the previous two sections, we know that such a category can be seen both as a cMon(V)-category and as an Act(V)-category. Using the correct distributivity we will show that it can in fact be seen as a category enriched over semimodules.

The following argument is due to Hilton and Eckmann ([4], but see also [15, Exer- cise II.5.5]), who proved it for C = Set. It states that when an object carries two monoid structures and the multiplication map of one is a monoid homomorphism with respect to the other, then the two monoid structures coincide and are in fact commutative.
