In [10], the reader will be able to find a survey of the different geometric approaches of concurrency. The model category of flows was introduced in [8] to model higher dimensional automata (HDA). It allows the study of HDA up to homotopy (cf. also [6,7]). A good notion of homotopy of flows must preserve the computer scientific properties of the HDA to be modeled like the initial and final states, the deadlocks and the unreachable states. In particular, it
