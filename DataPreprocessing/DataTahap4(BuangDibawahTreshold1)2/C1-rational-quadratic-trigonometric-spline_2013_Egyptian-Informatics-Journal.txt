Rational trigonometric interpolating splines with ten- sion(shape parameters) are preferred because these can inter- polate the same data in the form of straight line and curve. These tension parameters do not affect the order of continuity of spline. Moreover, the rational structure of these splines al- lows coping with singularities. Data gathered, whether, physi- cally or experimentally has at least one of the shape properties, positivity, monotonicity and convexity. The amount of rain- fall, gas discharge and exponential functions are a few positive data producing sources. The path inscribed by reboots arm

bers, so Rk (x), k = 0, 1, 2, 3 are non-negative. The simple summation establishes that  3 Rk x  1. It asserts con- vex hull property, i.e. the curve will always lie in the convex hull of control points.

Proof. Assume that the given set of positive data be {(x0, f0), (x1, f1), ..., (xn, fn)}, xi < xi+1, i = 0, 1, 2,.. . , n  1 and fi > 0, 6i. The curve produced by the interpolation of positive

[13] was C1 for uniform knot, [17] was C0. In [14,15] order of continuity was dependent on multiplicity of knot and shape parameters, in [19] C1-continuity was dependent on knot vec- tors and choice of derivatives, [20] restricted the derivatives to Di for tangent continuity. The data arising in most of the applications are non-uniform and does not restrict the deriva- tives; hence, these schemes are not applicable to a wide range of functions where derivative preservation is also mandatory. The order of continuity of rational quadratic trigonometric spline of this paper is independent of knot spacing, slope of se- cant line and shape parameters.
