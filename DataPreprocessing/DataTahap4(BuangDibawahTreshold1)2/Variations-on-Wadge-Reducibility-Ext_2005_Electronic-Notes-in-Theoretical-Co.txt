We will try to understand which properties (or their weaker versions) of the classical Wadge reducibility hold true in the other spaces. E.g., we dis- cuss when some substructures of the Wadge ordering are almost well ordered, which sets have a supremum (or a weak version of supremum) under Wadge reducibility, and consider relationship of the Wadge reducibility to hierarchies from [14] (see also earlier relevant papers [18,19,11,12]).

Another possible topic is the study of effective versions of the Wadge re- ducibility. In fact, this direction started already in the papers [9,10] which contain effective versions of some results of this paper. In [1] a general real- izability framework for the (joint) investigation of effective and non-effective topology was suggested. This framework might turn to be of use also in the developement of our topic.
