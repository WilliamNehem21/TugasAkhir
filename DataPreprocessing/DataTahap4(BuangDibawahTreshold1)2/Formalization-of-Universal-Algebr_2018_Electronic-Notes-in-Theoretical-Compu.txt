The definitions of subalgebras, quotients, and epimorphisms (surjective homo- morphisms) are related by the three isomorphism theorems. Although there is some small overhead by the coding of subalgebras, the proofs follow very close what one would do in paper. For proving these results we also defined the kernel and the homomorphic image of homomorphisms.

The concept of morphism between signatures is related with the interpretability of similarity types in universal algebra (cf. [13]), and has an extensive literature: Fuji- wara [12] introduced this notion as mappings between algebraic systems, Janssen [23], following the ADJ group, called it a polynomial derivor and Mossakowski et al. [26] referred to it as a derived signature morphism, a generalization of the more restricted signature morphisms in the theory of institutions [15].

A more interesting example of signature morphisms and reduct algebras is the definition of a compiler as presented in [33]. One defines a signature for the source language and another one for the target language; these languages are the term algebras over their respective signatures. A compiler is specified by a signature morphism from the source signature to the target signature: indeed the compiler is obtained as the unique homomorphism from the source algebra to the reduct algebra of the target algebra. Moreover, one can obtain a correct compiler by providing semantics of each language as algebras and a morphism between the source semantics and the reduct of the target semantics. 10
