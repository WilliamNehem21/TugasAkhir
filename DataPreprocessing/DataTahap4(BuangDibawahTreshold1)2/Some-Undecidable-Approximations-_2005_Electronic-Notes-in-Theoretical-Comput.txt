In this paper we study the decidability of reachability, normalisation, and neededness in n-shallow and n-growing TRSs. In an n-growing TRS, a variable that occurs both on the left- and right-hand side of a rewrite rule must be at depth n on the left-hand side and at depth greater than n on the right-hand side. In an n-shallow TRS, a variable that occurs both on the left- and right-hand side of a rewrite rule must be at depth n on both sides.

To explore the boundaries of the decidability of reachability, normalisation, and neededness we introduce in this paper n-growing and n-shallow TRSs. These TRSs are generalisations of the growing and shallow TRSs as intro- duced respectively by Jacquemard [4] and Comon [1]. Although reachability, normalisation, and (in the orthogonal case) neededness are decidable for grow- ing and shallow TRSs we show that this does not hold for our generalisations.

[2] prove that neededness is decidable for orthogonal growing TRSs. As each 1-growing TRS is growing, we also have decidability of reachability, normalisa- tion, and (in the orthogonal case) neededness for 1-growing TRSs. However, as we show next, these results do not generalise to n-growing TRSs with n > 1.

to the TRS from the proof of Theorem 4.3 does not change the fact that d is reachable from c if and only if n-PCP has a solution for P . However, by adding the rule, if d is reachable from c, then d becomes the only possible normal form of c. By this fact, and the fact that d is reachable from c if and only if n-PCP has a solution for P , we have that c has a normal form if and only if n-PCP has a solution for P .

prove that neededness is decidable for orthogonal shallow TRSs. As each 1-shallow TRS is shallow, we also have decidability of reachability, normalisa- tion, and (in the orthogonal case) neededness for 1-shallow TRSs. However, as we show next, these results do not generalise to n-shallow TRSs with n > 1.
