We now describe how we can represent the ODT problem as a single d-DNNF graph G'. Since the size of that graph impacts the efficiency of the ODT computation we will also show how we can reduce the size of G' by taking into account that we are only interested in the model counts for the test vectors, not in the actual observations. We will show that G' can be projected on its input variables only, if we compute the number of models before they get lost through the projection.

This subgraph GS is composed of a set of s-subgraphs and the question of which of those should be included in GS translates into the question of which children of an OR node should be included. The distinguishing ratio for such a node N with children N1,... Nj is defined as:

We evaluated our DNNF-based testing method on a model of an automotive engine test-bed [9], which consists of three major components: engine, pipe, and throttle. The goal is to find leaks in the pipe by assigning three to four controllable variables, and observing three to four measurable variables. The problem has been turned into sets of discrete instances of varying sizes by applying different abstractions to the original mixed discrete-continuous model, and using a direct encoding from CSP to SAT [12].
