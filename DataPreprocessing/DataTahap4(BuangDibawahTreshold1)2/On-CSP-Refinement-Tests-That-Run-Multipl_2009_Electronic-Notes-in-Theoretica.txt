i.e., where the right hand side of the refinement is simply P , and the left hand side of the refinement is independent of P . It is well known that these capture precisely satisfiable failures behavioural specifications [8, Section 3.3], i.e., satisfiable predicates of the form

Note  also  that  if  R(tr1,..., trn)  holds,  then  R((tr1, impossible1),..., (trn, impossiblen)), since R allows the refusal of impossible events, and so the non- deterministic choice is over a non-empty set, containing at least (impossible1,..., impossiblen).

The crucial point to observe is that for each CSP operator, each failure of the resulting process results from (at most) one failure of each component. Therefore, each failure of H(P ) results from (at most) one failure of each copy, i.e., a total of (at most) n failures of P . Therefore, the set of failures of H(P ) will be of the form

It is also interesting to note that most of the predicates (all except determinism) are the refinement closures of more basic properties. It seems that properties of the form considered in the previous paragraph naturally give rise to predicates that are not refinement-closed, and so one normally needs to consider the refinement closure. This question deserves further study. Calculating the refinement-closure of such predicates is not straightforward, so it would be useful to have some general techniques.
