It follows from Theorem 3.4 and Corollary 3.5 that the final LS-comodel is given by the set S of states with its canonical lookup and update structure. Corollary 3.5 enriches routinely, assuming one uses the evident definition of enriched (Loc,V )- array.

In this section, we calculate the tensor for two other examples: global state and monoid actions. As in the case of read-only state we are interested in combinations with other theories, by tensor, and with exceptions, by sum [4]. Our calculations again enrich without fuss.

In previous sections, we have considered comodels of three main theories: LS, Lr and LM . But one may have more than one of these acting at once, for instance employing triples (s, t, M ) consisting of a state s, a time t and a term M . So in this section, we consider a tensorial combination of comodels and its interaction with the tensor with models.
