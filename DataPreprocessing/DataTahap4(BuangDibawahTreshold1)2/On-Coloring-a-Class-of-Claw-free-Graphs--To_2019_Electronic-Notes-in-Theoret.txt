H4-free is known to be NP-complete or solvable in polynomial time, with three exceptions. One of the exceptions is the class of {claw, 4K1}-free graphs. The result of [9] shows that VERTEX COLORING is solvable in polynomial time for (claw, 4K1, K5 \ e)-free graphs. This class was further significant as it contains the 4K1-free line-graphs.

Given a graph G, the line-graph L(G) of G is defined to be the graph whose vertices are the edges of G, and two vertices of L(G) are adjacent if their correspond- ing edges in G are incident. Beineke [1] derived a characterization of line-graphs in terms of a set of nine forbidden induced subgraphs, two of which are the claw and K5 \ e. Thus given the connection of (claw, 4K1, K5 \ e)-free graphs to 4K1-free line-graphs, it is natural to ask about polynomial time solvability of vertex col- oring of graphs where K5 \ e is replaced by one of the other nine forbidden induced subgraphs. In fact we go further and pose the question for a more general class, which we introduce and call hole-twin. A hole is an induced cycle of length at least

In Section 2, we discuss the background results needed to prove our main theo- rem. In Section 3, we prove Theorem 1.1 along with necessary lemmas and ancillary results. And finally, in Section 4, we discuss the significance of our work, along with some open problems.

Let Yi denote the set of 4-vertices adjacent to hi, hi+1, hi+2, hi+3. Let Zi denote the sets of 4-vertices adjacent to hi, hi+1, hi+3, hi+4. It is easy to see that a 4-vertex must be of type Yi, or Zi.

In this paper, we prove that VERTEX COLORING can be solved in polynomial time for the class of (claw, 4K1, hole-twin)-free graphs. The problem is NP-hard for claw-free graphs [12], and for 4K1-free graphs [16]. The complexity of VERTEX COLORING is unknown for the class of {claw, 4K1}-free graphs. See [9] and [17] for the background of this problem. We pose this as an open problem to conclude our paper.
