The state space S is partitioned into the set of transient states ST and m sets of recurrent states SRi (recurrent classes). The sub-matrix T is the sub-stochastic DTMC of the transient states ST. Each rectangular sub-matrix Fi is the probability matrix of going into the i-th recurrent class from ST. Each square sub-matrix Ri is the DTMC of the i-th recurrent class.

We now consider the forward and backward stationary analysis for Markov Regener- ative Processes (MRP). MRPs are stochastic processes where firing times can have a general distribution (general events). Events with an exponentially distributed firing times are called exponential events. A renewal time is a point in time where the value of every random variable g that accounts for the age of the (enabled) gen-
