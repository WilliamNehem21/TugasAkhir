Domain theory or the more general theory of posets embodies the combination of an order and a topology. One of the basic and important results is that a poset is continuous if and only if the lattice of the Scott-closed sets above it is a completely distributive lattice. However, for a non-continuous poset, little is known about the order-theoretic properties of the Scott-closed set lattice. To study the Scott-closed set lattice on a general non-continuous poset, Ho and Zhao introduced the concept of a C-continuous poset in [4], and proved that the Scott-closed set lattice on a poset is a C-prealgebraic lattice, especially a C-continuous lattice. With the help of the C-continuity, they obtained some good results, such as: (i) a complete lattice L is isomorphic to the Scott-closed set lattice for a complete semilattice P if and only if L is weak-stably C-algebraic; (ii) for any two complete semilattices X and
