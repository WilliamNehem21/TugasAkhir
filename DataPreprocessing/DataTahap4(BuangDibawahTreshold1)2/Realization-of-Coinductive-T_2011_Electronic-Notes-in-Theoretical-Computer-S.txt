We give an explicit combinatorial construction of final coalgebras for a modest generalization of polynomial functors on Set. Type signatures are modeled as directed multigraphs instead of endofunctors. The final coalgebra for a type signature F involves the notion of Brzozowski derivative on sets of paths in F .

A type signature is a directed multigraph F along with a designation of each node of F as either existential or universal. The existential and universal nodes correspond respectively to coproduct and product constructors. The directed edges of the graph represent the corresponding destructors.
