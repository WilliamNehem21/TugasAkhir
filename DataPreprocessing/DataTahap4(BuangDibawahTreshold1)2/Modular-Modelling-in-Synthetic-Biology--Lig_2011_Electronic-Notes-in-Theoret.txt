from various backgrounds including biology, engineering, informatics, and so- cial science. The goal of these interdisciplinary teams is to design and con- struct novel synthetic biological systems, utilising modular DNA building blocks known as BioBrickTMparts, that extend the library of well-characterised modular parts for use in future projects (for further information, readers are directed to http://ung.igem.org).

Rule-based approaches are useful when modelling synthetic biology. They alle- viate the quantitative combinatorial explosion that results from molecular entities existing under multiple different conditions (for example, states of phosphorylation). They are inherently flexible in nature; the association of different independent rule sets implicitly generates different overall systems, thus allowing modular develop- ment of subsystems and their composition into a conjoined whole. They are also fully capable of accommodating complex regulatory structures and combinatorial networks, and of doing so without ever needing to fully enumerate the species that a set of rules might produce (thus greatly reducing computational complexity).

Green light emissions were based on the standard firefly (Photinus pyralis) lu- ciferase enzyme [13], and then underwent site-directed mutagenesis to create red light [3]. The blue light emission system was developed from a bacterial luciferase from Xenorhabdus luminescens [5]. The red light sensor was based on a bacterial phytochrome [11], the blue light sensor was based on a plant phototropin [14], and a novel fusion protein was designed as a green light sensor; the red and hypothetical green sensors were modified from two-component regulatory systems, whereas the blue light sensor was an allosteric hybrid protein with a simpler mechanism. For fur- ther information regarding the biological aspects of the paper, readers are directed to the documentation on the team wiki at http://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh. Each gene in the repressilating loop stimulates the production of light of a partic- ular wavelength; meanwhile, the light sensing pathways provide input to the central

repressilator to reinforce the response (activated green and blue sensors inhibit the repressilator explicitly, whilst the activated red sensor ceases promotion of the re- pressilator, hence inhibiting it implicitly). This reinforcement helps to overcome the greatest weakness of the Elowitz repressilator: the fact that without external regulation such as quorum sensing [6,9], the system oscillations are extremely im- precise. The ideal goal of the project was the development of a multi-cellular system capable of self-reinforcing collective synchronisation.

The Kappa model created during the course of the project was a representation of the system described above. It was composed of 145 rules detailing the function of sixteen BioBrick parts, not including those responsible for creation of the light sensors (assumed to be constitutively expressed) and the proteins associated with the various pathways. These rules could be decomposed into seven constituent modules: the core repressilator (itself a combination of three distinct devices), three light sensing pathways, and similarly three light emitting pathways. The modular nature of the model is described in greater detail in section 4 below.

manner, thus aiding comprehension of the underlying biology, and can be easily re-used both in different contexts within a model and across multiple different mod- els. The associated BioBrick modelling framework is well-suited to working with individual parts and this can only improve in the future with the development of dedicated support tools. The modularity of the approach also makes it easy to apply flexible iterative development methodologies to the problem, easing not only the complexity of the model but also the complexity of the modelling process as well.
