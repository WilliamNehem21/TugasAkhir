Selection of SNPs was made on the basis of their location in the 50 regulatory region, which commonly contains the promoter [23]. The g.49520870G > A-IRP-2 (rs17483548) single nucleotide poly- morphisms (SNPs) were analyzed through restriction fragment length polymorphism-PCR method (RFLP-PCR) method [24,25].
