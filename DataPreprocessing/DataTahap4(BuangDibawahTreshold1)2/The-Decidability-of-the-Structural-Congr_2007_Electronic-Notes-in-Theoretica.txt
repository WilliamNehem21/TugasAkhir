Beta-binders is a recent process algebra developed for modeling and simulating biological systems. As usual for process calculi, the semantic definition heavily relies on a structural congruence. The treatment of the structural congruence is essential for implementation. The proof of the decidability of this congruence, reported in this paper, is a first step towards implementations.
