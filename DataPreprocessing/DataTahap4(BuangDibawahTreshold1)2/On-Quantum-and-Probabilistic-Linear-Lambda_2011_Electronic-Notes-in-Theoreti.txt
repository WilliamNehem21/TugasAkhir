In this context, the semantics in CPM of a term M is a completely positive map from vectors of Cm to vectors of Cn for some natural numbers m and n. Note that a completely positive map in this setting is the same as a (partial) stochastic map from [0, 1]m to [0, 1]n. The result presented in [6] specializes to this case and the semantics is fully abstract.

The naive idea to develop a full and complete semantics for the probabilistic linear lambda-calculus is the following. Consider a category whose objects are polytopes and whose maps are CPM maps sending polytopes into polytopes. Then interpret the language in this category.
