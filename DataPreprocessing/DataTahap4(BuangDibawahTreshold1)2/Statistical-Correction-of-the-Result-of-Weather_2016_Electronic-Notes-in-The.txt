This work describes the simulation models calibration method called Model Output Calibration. In order to verify its effectiveness, presents the application of the MOC in weather forecast correction generated by the Eta 15Km model at CPTEC/INPE. Eta is a regional model for numerical weather prediction. The results of the statistical correction of Eta forecast were positive, with satisfactory improvements in the variables tested (temperature and relative humidity). The use of this approach shows the possibility of gains in the results of simulation models of crops and diseases that use as predictive variables the variables generated by weather forecast models.

lighting its features and operation. In Section 4, use of the MOC in the correction of forecast generate by Eta model is described and the results obtained with this correction are presented and discussed. Finally, in section 5, the conclusions of this research are presented and aspects of future works to be developed from the results already obtained are discussed.

Although forecast methods are becoming more sophisticated, with very accurate results, many of the variables provided by the models depend on variables that are susceptible to changes, such as those generated by actions of nature. According to Mao et al. [14], the temperature forecast models are known to have errors due to its coarse representation of the topographic model and a deficient physical model.

These differences are due to the fact that grid point model consider a single point by grid. Therefore, the model assumes that the climatic variables behave homogeneously within each grid. Although the simulation models will be improved, the weather models are far from perfect. However, in order to reduce these errors, besides the use of grid point mesoscale models in certain regions, some statistical methods have been developed for correcting (calibration) these errors.

The calibration data is the process of identifying possible problems in the forecast model and make adjustments in the calculations (codes). The process of calibration and validation are differentiated by the choice of parameters. Thus, the selection criteria used for data calibration may not be relevant to validate the model. There- fore, the selection of the parameters used for data calibration is a technical issue, where each statistical method is a own way. Among the major correction methods

Calibration Model Output (MOC): was developed by Mao et al. [14] in 1998. It is a method that performs the statistical correction based on multivariate linear regression, as well as MOS and PPM. The main difference in relation to the MOC and the MOS and PPM is their short training period (2-4 weeks) of forecast and observations necessary for performing the correction of the statistical model.

This section analyzes the results obtained by applying the MOC in the cor- rection of temperature and relative humidity generated by the regional model Eta 15km from December 2015. The locations covered in the analysis are part of a set of 36 Brazilian locations, members of a project between the PPGCA/UPF and CPTEC/INPE allocated to the Brazilian Electric System National Operator (ONS). This project aims to improve the quality of energy load forecasting process in Brazil through these corrections.

The locations covered in the project include meteorological stations located air- ports from capitals and in some cities in the interior of Sao Paulo State and in the South region from Brazil, regions where the demand for energy because of agricul- ture and irrigation process is more significant. The current computer system was developed for the Linux operating system, using Linux shell scripts and Fortran language. For the statistical analysis is used statistical language R [16].

On average, the errors of the forecast temperature of Eta model did not ex- ceed the magnitude of 2oC, but generally underestimated the observations, mainly during the morning. On the other hand, the relative humidity was generally overes- timated during the night period and underestimated during the day. The tendency to produce more saturated air during the night can be a result of underestimation of temperature forecasts at some stations. While the tendency to produce excessively dry air during the day seems to be derived from error in the estimate of specific humidity (amount of steam per total air volume) by the model. In stations in which prediction errors were considered relatively small, generally the correction scheme eventually produced an error.

The largest temperature errors occurred in stations where the model grid box used for comparison was far from the point of observation. Numerical forecasts of dynamic models always contain errors. The extracted information model grid represents the average inside that grid, and the average value of the time step of the integration model. The comparison of average information to the specific measure provided by observation is already an inconsistency and an error factor.
