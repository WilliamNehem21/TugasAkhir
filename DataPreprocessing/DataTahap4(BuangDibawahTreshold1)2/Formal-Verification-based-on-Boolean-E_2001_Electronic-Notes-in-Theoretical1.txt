Symbolic model checking is a technique for verifying temporal speci - cations of nite state machines. It is well known how nite state machines and the evaluation of the temporal speci cations can be expressed using Boolean formulae. We show how to do these manipulations using BEDs. We concentrate on examples which are hard for standard symbolic model checking methods.

Determining whether a formula is satis ability is a problem which occurs in veri cation of combinational circuits and in symbolic model checking. Often satis ability checking is associated with detecting errors. We examine how satis ability checking can be done using the BED data structure.

structure. Among other operations, we introduce an operator for computing minimal p-cuts in fault trees. A fault tree is a Boolean formula expressing whether a system fails based on the condition (\failure" or \working") of each of the components. A minimal p-cut is a representation of the most likely reasons for system failure. This method can be used to calculate approximately the probability of system failure given the failure probabilities of each of the components.
