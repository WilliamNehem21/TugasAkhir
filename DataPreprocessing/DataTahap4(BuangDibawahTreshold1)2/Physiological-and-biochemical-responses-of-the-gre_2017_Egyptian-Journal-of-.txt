Microalgae, a group of fast-growing unicellular or simple multi- cellular microorganisms, offer several advantages, including higher photosynthetic efficiency, compared to crop plants. They possess high CO2 fixation capacities and under optimal culture condition express growth rates several orders of magnitudes higher than con- ventional crop plants [1,2]. Microalgae can fix CO2 from different sources, which can be categorized as CO2 from the atmosphere, industrial exhaust gases, and fixed CO2 in the form of soluble car- bonates (NaHCO3 and Na2CO3). Salinization is one of the major environmental factors limiting global crop productivity, because it restricts crop yield particularly in the arid and semi-arid regions [3]. Salinization occurs not only in Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 the soil, but also in the surface water and groundwater mainly caused by high evaporation [4,5]. Chloride and carbonate salts, which are the main salts causing salinization, widely exist in aquatic environment.

algal biomass, biodiesel derived from oil as well as biohydrogen and bioethanol [18]. These cellular processes could be affected by abi- otic stresses such as sodicity. Where, there is information is avail- able about the effects of carbonate stress on algae, although it widely exists in and even dominates water bodies [6]. Therefore, this study was carried out to determine the different effects of car- bon sources (Na2CO3, NaHCO3) on the growth parameters, CO2 con- sumption rate, enzyme activity (LOX, SOD, CAT and Hup), intracellular lipid content, and fatty acid profiles of the green alga Pachycladella chodatii in batch culturing technique cultivation.

Superoxide dismutase. Superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 1.15.1.1) activity was assayed by following the autoxidation of epi- nephrine (adenochrome) as described by Misra and Fridovich [23], with some modifications. Activity was measured in a final volume of 2 ml of the reaction medium containing 50 mM of sodium car-

Determination of total antioxidant capacity. Total antioxi- dant activity of the methanol extracts was evaluated by the phos- phomolybdenum method [26]. Methanol (0.3 ml) in the place of extract was used as the blank. Ascorbic acid (AA) was used as standard.

The sum uptake activity of Hup (uptake hydrogenase) and the bidirectional hydrogenase assay mixture contained 1 ml algal cul- ture, 2.75 ml phosphate buffer (50 mM), 0.25 ml methyl blue (50 mM), 1 ml sodium dithionite (100 mM), flushed with nitrogen to remove oxygen followed by hydrogen, as conducted by Yu et al.

of P. chodatii treated with higher concentrations of Na2CO3 and NaHCO3. Gardner et al. [45] reported that, inorganic carbon sources mostly could be one of the chief factors that help improve the car- otenoids and lipids content in the algal cells by improving photo- synthetic efficiency and growth rate. Zheng et al. [46] demonstrated that, lipid yield of C. vulgaris reached its peak with the concentration increase of the inorganic carbon source after 10 days cultivation, but dropped again by further increase of the concentration. Inorganic carbon, in the form of bicarbonate (HCO-3

A systematic analysis of the fatty acid methyl ester composition is very important for species selection for biodiesel production. The most common fatty acids of microalgae are palmitic, stearic, lino- lenic acids [48]. Most algae have only small amounts of eicosapen- taenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid; however, in some species of particular genera these polyunsaturated fatty acids can accumu- late in appreciable quantities depending on cultivation conditions [49].

predominant fatty acids in C. mexicana, while oleic acid (41%) and a-linolenic acid (20%) were the major fraction found in S. obliquus [50]. The degree of membrane fatty acids is an important parame- ter in the algal adaptation to the environmental conditions [51].

Generally, the compositional profiles of fatty acid for the algal strains are influenced by the conditions of growth such as nutrient levels, light intensities and temperatures [52]. This makes it more difficult to define a single compositional profile for algal-based bio- diesel [53]. As well, clear changes in the carbon chain length and degree of unsaturation are important algal oil features for the bio- diesel production and may influence its properties and perfor- mance [54].
