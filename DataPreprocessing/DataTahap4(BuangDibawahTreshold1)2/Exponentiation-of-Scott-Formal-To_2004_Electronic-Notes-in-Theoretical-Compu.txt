Now, let us recall the notion of continuous relation between formal topolo- gies. It expresses a predicative counterpart of the notion of locale morphism. The definition of continuous relation is obtained from the definition of frame morphism expressed in terms of relation in [17] by taking the opposite relation.

The definition of continuous relation between formal topologies can be substantially simplified if we restrict our attention to the case of continuous relations from a unary formal topology to a generic one. This simplification is the key for the possibility to define the exponential topology of a unary formal topology over an inductively generated one (see sections 3.1 and 4.1).

Remark 4.4 The embedding of a formal topology into its unary image and the lifting of continuous relations to unary topologies are the counterparts of the fact that a topological space can be embedded into a Scott domain and that a continuous function can be lifted to an approximable map (see [19]). A lifting of this kind is the key point in [3] to prove that the category Top of topological spaces and continuous functions satisfies some weaken notions of exponentiation and hence it is possible to build a locally cartesian closed category out of it. Indeed, Top is not cartesian closed but in [3] it is proved that its exact completion turns out to be a locally cartesian closed category.
