In this paper, we introduce and study strongly semicontinuous lattices, a new class of complete lattices lying between the class of semicontinuous lattices and that of continuous lattices. It is shown that a complete lattice L is strongly semicontinuous iff L is semicontinuous and meet semicontinuous. Some versions of strong interpolation properties for the semiway-below relation in (strongly) semicontinuous lattices are established. Characterization theorems by some distributivity and approximate identities for strongly semicontinuous lattices are given, which reveals that strongly semicontinuous lattices indeed share similar properties with continuous lattices. A subtle counterexample is constructed to show that semicontinuous lattices need not be strongly semicontinuous lattices.

Replacing ideals with semiprime ideals posed by Rav [9], Zhao in [12] introduced the concept of semicontinuous lattices and showed that semicontinuous lattices have many properties similar to that of continuous lattices [10]. As generalizations of con- tinuous lattices, semicontinuous lattices enrich topics in domain theory [2]. So far, much work related to semicontinuous lattices has been done. Bi and Xu [1] intro- duced and studied the semi-Scott topology and the semi-Lawson topology on semi- continuous lattices. Li and Wu [8] investigated relationships between semicontinu- ous lattices and completely distributive lattices. Jiang [5] discussed pseudo-primes in semicontinuous lattices and gave some characterizations for semicontinuous lat- tices. Li in [7] introduced semiprime sets in dcpos and generalized semicontinuous lattices to semicontinuous dcpos. He and Xu in [3] explored relationships between
