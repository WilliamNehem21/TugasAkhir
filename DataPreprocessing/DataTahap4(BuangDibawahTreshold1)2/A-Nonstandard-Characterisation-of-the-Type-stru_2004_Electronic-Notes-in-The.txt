An alternative approach to this hierarchy is via algebraic domains with total- ity. The base domain will then be generated from the set of closed rational intervals. Normann [5,6] proved a density theorem for this hierarchy, and showed that it may be characterised in the Cartesian closed category of Ku- ratowski limit spaces.

In the proof of this claim, we are relying on the transfer principle. The argu- ment would have been unproblematic if c had been a genuine natural number. The transfer principle tells us that the argument then is unproblematic for hyperfinite c.
