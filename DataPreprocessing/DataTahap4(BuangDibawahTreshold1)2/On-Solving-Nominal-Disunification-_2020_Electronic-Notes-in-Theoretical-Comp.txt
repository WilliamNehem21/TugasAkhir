	We extend the notion of substitution with exceptions to solution pairs that consist of a freshness context and a substitution, with exceptions (Definition 3.5). In addition, a version of the Consistency Test Algorithm (Algorithm 1) to deal with pairs with exceptions is proposed.

as a generalized notion of instantiation and proves some results on the consistency of pairs with exceptions. Section 4 shows how to solve nominal constraint problems by reusing the nominal unification algorithm. Section 5 describes related work and Section 6 concludes the paper.

We will work on this type of issues in the remaining of this paper. First, we define precisely what we mean by a solution of nominal constraint problems. Keep in mind that our goal is the development of a nominal generalization for the already established notion of instantiation of solutions (Definition 2.8), but this needs to be done in such a way that instantiation closure still holds.
