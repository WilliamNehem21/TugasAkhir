The arrival of massive amount of expression data puts the emphasis on com- putational methods to overcome the difficulties of interpretation of experimental data. Instead of providing a clear explanation of biological systems, data reveals the difficulty for analyzing them. The variety of components and their interacting capabilities lead to cope with their complexity. This opens a field of modeling to investigate computational biological systems.

The paper is organized as follows: section 2 gives the basics of BRN. The core of the paper is in section 3 where we give a formal semantics for BRN. In section 4 we show on a small example how to use the tool HyTech [2] to analyze a BRN.

Another feature of the evolution of the state of a network is that the expression level of a gene x evolves step-by-step i.e. it cannot go from 1 to 3 in a single step, it must evolve by one unit from 1 to 2 and if some conditions are met 1 will go from 2 to 3. This is captured in the definition of an evolution operator :
