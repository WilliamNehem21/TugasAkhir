Categorial grammars have been studied in the domain of natural language processing, we focus here on classical (or basic) categorial grammars that were introduced in [1] and on Lambek categorial grammars [7] which are closely connected to linear logic introduced by Girard [3]. These gram- mars are lexicalized grammars that assign types (or categories) to the lexi- con; they are called k-valued, when each symbol in the lexicon is assigned to at most k types; they are also called rigid when 1-valued. Such k-valued grammars are of particular interest in recent works on learnability [6] [11]. In this context, it is important to acquire a good understanding of the properties of the class of grammars in question.

Classical categorial grammar. A classical categorial grammar over is a finite relation G between  and T p. If < c; A >2 G, we say that G assigns A to c, and we write G : c 7! A. We write SubT p(G) the set of subformulas of types that are assigned by G to some symbol in  .

We define G2D similarly, by exchanging the roles of all ui and vi. Proposition 3.7 G1D and G2D are both rigid injective PCP-grammars. Example 3.8 Let D1 =< (ab; abbb); (bb; b) > we get P rD1 = fa; b; 1; 2; t; #g

This paper has answered a decidability question concerning each class of k-valued classical categorial grammars, and each class of k-valued Lam- bek grammars : the emptiness of intersection of two langages is an unde- cidable problem for each class. The proof relies on a specific class intro- duced here as PCP-grammars, a subclass of unidirectional grammars, for which we establish several properties. In particular, the problem we have focused on is undecidable for this subclass (thus not trivial).
