Similarly one can apply the Riemann mapping to the construction in the proof of Theorem 2.2. Instead of altering the construction, however, we can simply add another oracle, say B, first, which allows to compute the Riemann mapping Q in linear time. Then we can literally use the construction given in the proof of Theorem
