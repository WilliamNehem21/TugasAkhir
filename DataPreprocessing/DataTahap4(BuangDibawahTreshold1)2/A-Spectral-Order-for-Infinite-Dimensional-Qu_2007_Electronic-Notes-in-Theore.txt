In 2002 Coecke and Martin created a Bayesian order for the finite dimensional spaces of classical states in physics and used this to define a similar order, the spectral order on the finite dimensional quantum states. These orders gave the spaces a structure similar to that of a domain. This allows for measuring information content of states and for determining which partial states are approximations of which pure states. In a previous paper the author extended the Bayesian order to infinite dimensional spaces of classical states. The order on infinite dimensional spaces retains many of the characteristics important to physics, but loses the domain theoretic structure. It becomes impossible to measure information content in the same way that it is done for the finite dimensional spaces, and the sense of approximation is lost. In this paper, we will use the Bayesian order to define a spectral order on the infinite dimensional spaces of quantum states.

In 2002 Coecke and Martin ([1]) defined the Bayesian order on finite dimensional spaces of classical states in physics. This order reflected the important physical properties of such states and, because the spaces with this order have a structure similar to that of domains, it also provided a method for measuring the information content of the states and for determining which partial states approximated which total states. They then used the Bayesian order to define a spectral order on the finite dimensional spaces of quantum states. This order gives the quantum states a structure with the same sort of properties enjoyed by the classical states under the Bayesian order. It also provides the ability to measure and to approximate. Recently the author was able to extend the Bayesian order to infinite dimensional spaces of
