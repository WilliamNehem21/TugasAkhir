Another approach is based on distance functions over processes (or, states). For instance, Giacalone et al. [5] and Desharnais et al. [3,4] define the pseudometrics on the states of probabilistic transition systems respectively. In the framework of LTS, van Breugel provides three avenues to define behavioural pseudometrics [2]. The behavioural pseudometric is a distance function between states, which is a quantitative analogue of bisimilarity. In the framework of quantitative transition system (QTS), de Alfaro et al. define the distance between traces and lift this trace distance to distances over states [1]. Furthermore, they provide the notion of branching distance, which generalizes the notion of bisimilarity.
