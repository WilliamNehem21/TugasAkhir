this preconditioner, known as the diagonal preconditioning or the Jacobi preconditioning [25]. The PCG algorithm has the following two parts, which are repeatedly executed until the convergence of PCG method is performed by checking the error criteria i.e. Euclidean norms of the residual vector should
