Proof. Suppose that Alice is the first to play and colors vertex r first (color 1 in the greedy game). Then Bob can color vertex t2 (color 1). With this, s and t cannot be colored 1 and then Bob can force t1 or t3 be colored with 4 by coloring one of the two black vertices (color 1) in his next turn.

Now suppose that Alice is the first to play and colors vertex s first (color 1). Thus no vertex in {r1, r2, r3, t1, t2, t3} can be colored 1 and then all black vertices will be colored 1 in the greedy game coloring. Therefore all vertices in {r1, r2, r3, t1, t2, t3} can be colored with 2 or 3 in the game. Moreover, Alice can color r and t in her second and third turns using the colors {2, 3} winning the game.

Finally suppose that Bob is the first to play. He can win the game by coloring vertex r2 first (color 1). In his next turn, he can color the black neighbor of r1 or r3 (color 1). With this, r1 or r3 will be colored 4, and Bob wins the game.	2

Proof. [Sketch] Alice only has to play in the same graph that Bob has played following her best strategy in this graph. If there is no uncolored vertex, Alice colors a vertex in the other graph (in this case, she considers that Bob passed his turn in this graph).	2
