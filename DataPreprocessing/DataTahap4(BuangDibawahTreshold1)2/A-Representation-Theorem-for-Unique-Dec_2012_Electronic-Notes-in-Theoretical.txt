By symmetric monoidal M-category, we mean an M-category with a symmetric monoidal structure on its underlying category. We do not assume that the sym- metric monoidal structure is compatible with the M-enrichment. For symmetric monoidal M-category C and D, a symmetric monoidal M-functor from C to D is an M-functor from C to D that is symmetric monoidal.

Proof. Since summations on hom-sets of B(A) are pointwise, the functor K pre- serves summations, i.e., K is an M-functor. K is fully faithful by the defini- tion. It remains to see that K is strong symmetric monoidal. Since the sym- metric monoidal structure of A is given by the finite biproducts (Proposition 5.1 and Proposition 4.8), we show that K preserves finite biproducts.  There are
