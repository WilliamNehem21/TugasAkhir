Probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs) have turned out to be of great importance in complexity theory. On the one hand side they provide a new characterization of the complexity class NP, on the other hand they show a deep connection to approximation results for combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper we study the notion of PCPs in the real number model of Blum, Shub, and Smale. The existence of transparent long proofs for the real number analogue NPR of NP is discussed.

Parallelizing structural complexity theory over finite alphabets and uni- fying existing approaches in algebraic complexity theory, Blum, Shub, and Smale in 1989 introduced a uniform real number model of computation, now called the BSS machine [6]. In the meanwhile, a lot of work has been done in the BSS model. The textbooks [7,5,4] shed an excellent light on problems considered in this framework.

3 Here, we do not have in mind approximation issues as treated in numerical analysis. Such a notion likely will lead to problems in the original BSS model unless analytic functions are introduced, see [8] and [10]. Therefore, a more combinatorial notion seems appropriate.

Verifiers now are used to define PCP- and PCPR-complexity classes. Since the latter are the newly introduced ones, here we only give the definition for the real classes. The PCP-classes in the Turing framework are defined similarly by replacing once again the obvious terms in the BSS setting through those in the Turing model.
