exclusively about full distributions and applies to potentially non-terminating pro- grams. Importantly, VPHL is itself formally verified in the Coq proof assistant [9]. As probabilistic Hoare logics are increasingly used to verify critical code (for exam- ple, in the Easycrypt project [2]), it is important that the logic itself should rest on the firmest foundations.

There has also been considerable work done in related formal systems, includ- ing Probabilistic Guarded Command Language [17] (formalized in HOL4 [13] and Isabelle/HOL [8]),, Dynamic Logic [11, 15] and Kleene Algebra with Tests [16]. We refer the reader to Vasquez et al. [22] for a comparison of Probabilistic Hoare Logic and pGCL and to the related work section of Chadha et al. [6] for a broader dis- cussion of the approaches to probabilistic verification.

VPHL is meant to provide the groundwork for the further study of probabilistic Hoare logics and for their application. It is extensible, meaning that we can add new rules without impacting the language. The new Hoare rules would fall into one of two categories: core rules and derived rules.

A derived rule is a rule that can be derived using existing rules from the logic. Though in the strictest sense these rules are redundant, they enable us to efficiently and intuitively reason about programs. Adding such rules to our logic could have a substantial impact on its usability.
