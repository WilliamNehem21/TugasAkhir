In this paper we describe a new tool called MLSolver. It provides a framework for satisfiability and validity checking for various 1 modal fixpoint logics. It can also be used as a model checker for these logics. However, it is not meant to be able to compete with state-of-the-art specialised model checkers for logics like CTL, LTL, etc.

The problem of solving a parity game is to compute for each node v, the player who has a strategy that allows him to win every play starting in v that complies with this strategy. It is well-known that this problem is well-defined, i.e. that for each such node exactly one of the players wins this node [31].

Another difficulty which is not exhibited by the benchmarks presented here is propositional reasoning. It is easy to construct formulas that model binary counters for example for which the construction of parity games essentially transforms them into exponentially larger disjunctive or conjunctive normal form. Deciding these formulas is then difficult purely because of the size of the games.
