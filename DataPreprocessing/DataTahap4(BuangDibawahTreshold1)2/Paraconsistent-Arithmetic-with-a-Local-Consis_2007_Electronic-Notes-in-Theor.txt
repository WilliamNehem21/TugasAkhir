In this paper we explore Provability Logic and Proof-Theory of the system of Para- consistent Arithmetic PRACI, based on the paraconsistent predicate calculus CI, which extends the propositional C-system Ci introduced by Carnielli et al. [7]. As already pointed out in [1] for the presentation of the theory PCA, we propose systems of Paraconsistent Arithmetic which are essentially new w.r.t. most of para- consistent arithmetical theories existing in the preceding relevant literature. In our thinking paraconsistent reasoning, intuitionistic reasoning and classical reasoning can be compared as different methods to investigate the same elementary math- ematical objects: that is, we introduce a paraconsitent reasoning about standard

for each natural number m we write m for the term S...S(0), with m occurences of S on the left. The terms of the form m are called numerals. We will briefly write 1, 2, ...,for numerals, each time no confusion arises.
