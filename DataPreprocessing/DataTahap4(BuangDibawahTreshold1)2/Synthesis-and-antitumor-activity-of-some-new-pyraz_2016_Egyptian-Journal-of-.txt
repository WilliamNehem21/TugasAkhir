A new series of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-3-carbonitrile and pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-3- carbonitrile derivatives was synthesized by the reaction of 5-amino-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazole- 3,4-dicarbonitrile as a key starting material with various electrophilic and nucleophilic reagents. All the newly synthesized compounds were structurally confirmed by various modern ana- lytical methods (IR, 1H NMR and MS). All the title compounds have been evaluated for their potential cytotoxicity against human laryngeal epidermoid carcinoma cells (Hep2). Among the screened compounds, 3 and 4 exhibited the highest significant effect.

To a cold solution of p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (0.05 mol, 9.3 g) in 50 ml ethanol, tetracyanoethylene (0.05 mol, 6.4 g) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 hour and then heated under reflux on a steam bath for 30 minutes. The mixture was then cooled and the white precipitate was collected and washed with ethanol.

To a stirred suspension of compound 2 (2 mmol, 0.57 g) in pyri- dine (20 ml), carbon disulfide (4 mmol, 0.3 ml) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was then heated on water bath for 12 hrs. The reaction mixture was cooled at room tempera- ture, then poured into ice cold water, and neutralized with hydrochloric acid. The precipitated product was filtered off, washed and recrystallized from EtOH-DMF mixture (1:1) to afford the corresponding product 3 as dark green crystals.

A mixture of pyrazole 2 (2 mmol, 0.57 g) and formamide (10 ml) in DMF (10 ml) was heated under reflux for 12 hrs. The reac- tion mixture was allowed to cool at room temperature and poured onto 200 ml ice-cooled water. The yellow precipitate that formed was filtered off, dried and recrystallized from EtOH to give 8 as a yellow powder.

To a mixture of triethyl orthoformate (5 mmol, 0.75 ml) and acetic anhydride (20 ml), the pyrazole 2 (5 mmol, 1.44 g) was added. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 5 hrs and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The separated solid was recrystallized from ethanol to afford 9 as a yellow powder.

To a solution of compound 9 (2 mmol, 0.68 g) in absolute ethanol (50 ml), hydrazine hydrate (4 mmol, 0.2 ml) was added. The re- action mixture was refluxed for 4 hrs, concentrated and cooled. The solid product that separated out was filtered off and re- crystallized from EtOH to yield 10 as a yellow powder.

A mixture of compound 2 (4 mmol, 1.36 g) and malononitrile (4 mmol, 0.27 g) in 15 ml DMF containing few drops of piperi- dine was refluxed for 12 hrs. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, diluted with cold water and then neutralized by few drops of dilute HCl. The resulting solid was filtered off, washed several times with cold water, dried and then recrystallized from EtOH:DMF mixture (1:1) to afford 13 as brown crystals.

A mixture of compound 2 (4 mmol, 1.36 g), potassium carbon- ate (6 mmol, 0.83 g) and ethyl acetoacetate (4 mmol, 0.52 ml) in 15 ml DMF was heated under reflux for 12 hrs. The reac- tion mixture was allowed to cool at room temperature, poured into ice-cooled water and then neutralized by drops of dilute

7.50 ppm for para-disubstituted benzene ring, and two singlet signals at NH at 11.22 and 13.69 ppm for two imine protons (NH). The reaction of pyrazole compound 2 with phenyl isothiocyanate proceeded by heating under reflux in di- methyl formamide to afford the corresponding 4-imino-5- phenyl-6-thioxo-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine derivative

2.35 ppm referring to three protons of methyl group (CH3), singlet signal at 6.40 ppm for two protons of amino group (NH2), two doublet signals at 7.25 and 7.65 ppm for para-disubstituted benzene ring, and a further singlet signal appear downfield at

2.35 and 2.50 ppm for six protons of two methyl groups (2CH3), singlet signal at 6.02 ppm referring to the (NH2) protons, two doublet signals at 7.35 and 7.75 ppm for para-disubstituted benzene ring protons, and singlet signal at 11.55 ppm corre-
