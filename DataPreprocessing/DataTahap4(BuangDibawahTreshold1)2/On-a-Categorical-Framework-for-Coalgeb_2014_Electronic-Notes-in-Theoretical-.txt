A category of one-step semantics is introduced to unify different approaches to coalgebraic logic parametric in a contravariant functor that assigns to the state space its collection of predicates with propositional connectives. Modular constructions of coalgebraic logic are identified as colimits, limits, and tensor products, extending known results for predicate liftings. Generalised predicate liftings as modalities are introduced. Under common assumptions, the logic of all predicate liftings together with a complete axiomatisation exists for any type of coalgebras, and it is one-step expressive for finitary functors. Colimits and compositions of one-step expressive coalgebraic logics are shown to remain one-step expressive.

Remark 2.12 In categories such as Set and the category VecK of vector spaces over a field K, every finitely generated algebra is free, so finitary functors are finitely based. Moreover, every finitary endofunctor of BA is naturally isomorphic to a finitely based functor on non-trivial Boolean algebras [20]. However, this coincidence does not hold in general, and a counterexample can be found in [29, Example 3.12].

6 The justification of this point-free formulation may be found in [6, Section 4.1.5] (it assumes the existence of a proper factorisation system). In the following we will simply assume that X is concrete though this does not necessarily imply the existence of kernel pairs.
