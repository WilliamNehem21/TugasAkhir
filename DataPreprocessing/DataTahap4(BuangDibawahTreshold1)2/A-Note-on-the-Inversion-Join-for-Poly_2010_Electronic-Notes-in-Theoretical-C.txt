We applied our implementation of the inversion join to a benchmark suite that was gathered in the context of the PIPS project [1] which pursued advanced opti- mizations and parallelization of Fortran code. The benchmarks [11] contain every 100th input to the convex hull algorithm of the analyser while analyzing the Per- fect Club and Spec 95 Fortran benchmarks. The data in the benchmark consist of pairs of polyhedra that were joined during the analysis. Thus, the benchmarks only contain few examples that are exponential as the analyzer would not have progressed after encountering a hard problem. Hence, there are no instance where our algorithm delivers a result while the exact convex hull algorithm times out. We
