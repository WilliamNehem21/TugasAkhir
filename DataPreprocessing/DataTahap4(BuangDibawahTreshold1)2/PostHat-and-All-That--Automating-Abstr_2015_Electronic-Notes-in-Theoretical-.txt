maintains both an under-approximation and an over-approximation of the desired answer. The advantage of a bilateral algorithm is that in case of a timeout, it is safe to return the over-approximation. At various stages of the algorithm, effort is expended on improving the over-approximation, and if the algorithm were given additional time, it might return a better answer. (Such an algorithm is called an

From such a reinterpretation of the TSL meta-language, which is extended auto- matically to TSL expressions and functions, TSL creates sound over-approximating transformers. Standard analysis algorithms can then use the transformers to ob- tain inductive A-invariants. However, there is generally some loss of precision with the reinterpretation approach, so the resulting analyses generally do not find best inductive A-invariants.
