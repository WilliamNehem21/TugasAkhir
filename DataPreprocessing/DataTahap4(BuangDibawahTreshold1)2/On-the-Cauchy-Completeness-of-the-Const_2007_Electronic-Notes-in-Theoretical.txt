Regarding the methodology, counter-examples are constructed in each case. These examples could be presented as either topological or Kripke mod- els. While certain relations among topological and Kripke models are known, it is not clear to the author that the natural models in the cases before us are really the same. While the family resemblance is unmistakable (compare

the definition of jmax, there is an open K containing sup J0 such that r is bounded by sup K. As r is bounded below by sup J0, r (again, rng(r\q0)) is contained within K. As (q0, K) H f(n) = m, r |= f(n) = m.	 

Proof. As far as the author is aware, symmetric submodels have been studied only in the context of classical set theory, not intuitionistic, and, moreover, the only topological models in the literature are full models, in which the terms of any given model are all possible terms built on the space in question, not submodels. Nonetheless, the same proof that the full model satisfies IZF (easily, IZFRef ) applies almost unchanged to the case at hand. To keep the
