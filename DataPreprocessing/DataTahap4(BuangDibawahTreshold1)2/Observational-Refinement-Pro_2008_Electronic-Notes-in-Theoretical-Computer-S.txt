The adjustment of the stepwise refinement process to this new perspective has been studied by several authors (cf. [17,14,3]). In all the above mentioned works, it is presumed the observational preservation of sorts between refine- ment steps, in the sense that, encapsulated data in one determined refinement step, are still encapsulated in the pursuing of the process. However, the change of non observable into observable sorts and vice-versa, can be useful in various
