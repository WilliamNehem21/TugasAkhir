The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we recall the notation and some basic results used throughout this paper. In Section 3 we show that extensions for default theories over monadic languages do not depend on the cardinality of the underlying infinite domain. Finally, in Section 4 we show that under the domain closure assumption, extensions for uniterm default theories do not depend on the cardinality of the underlying domain and, therefore, we may restrict ourselves to an explicitly defined finite domain.

The following definition of extensions for open default theories is a rela- tivization of Definition 2.2 to Herbrand b-interpretations with an infinite set of new constant symbols b. The reason for passing to a semantical definition is that, in general, it is impossible to describe a Herbrand universe by means of the standard proof theory. The only exception is the cases when the theory domain is explicitly finite ([5]), i.e., contains axiom (2).

This section deals with uniterm default theories introduced in [1], see Defini- tion 4.2 below. We show that under the domain closure assumption, when dealing with uniterm default theories we may restrict ourselves to finite bases. For the general case, it is known from [5] that under the domain closure assumption b-extensions for an open default theory (D, A) coincide with the
