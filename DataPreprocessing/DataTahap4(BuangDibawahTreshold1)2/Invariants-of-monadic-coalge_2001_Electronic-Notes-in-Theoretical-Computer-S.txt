structure of a monad is a way of coping with the need to compose simpler pro- grams into larger ones. Note that the carrier of a coalgebra is usually thought of as a set of internal states of the computation model under investigation. Following the idea of E. Moggi, in this paper we accept the other approach and think of it as the set of data.

The formal investigation of invariant properties of computations has started long time ago and has played an important role in the development of com- puter science ever since. In this paper, we consider invariants of computations described by monadic coalgebras. Invariants of arbitrary coalgebras were in- troduced in [4,3] as subsets of the carrier closed with respect to the coalgebraic structure. Inspired by the research presented in [8], we propose another con- cept: invariant co-relations.

We have seen in Section 4 that invariant co-relations need not characterise the coalgebra uniquely, and that they fail to do so in some rather irregular cases. We would, therefore, like to single out certain well-behaved representatives and show that every coalgebra can be somehow reduced to one of them. In our case, the well-behaved representatives are idempotent coalgebras.
