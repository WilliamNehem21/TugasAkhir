In this paper we work in a type theory with dependent types, natural numbers, inductive types and guarded recursion. The presentation of the paper will be in- formal, but the results of the paper can be formalised in gDTT as presented in [8]. We start by recalling the core of this type theory (as described in [6]), introducing further constructions later on as needed.

In the topos of trees model, the d modality is interpreted as dX(0) = 1 and dX(n + 1) = X(n), i.e., from the logical point of view, the d modality delays evaluation of a proposition by one time step. For example, if 0 is the constantly empty presheaf (corresponding to a false proposition), then dn0 is the proposition that appears true for the first n computation steps and is falsified after n + 1 steps.
