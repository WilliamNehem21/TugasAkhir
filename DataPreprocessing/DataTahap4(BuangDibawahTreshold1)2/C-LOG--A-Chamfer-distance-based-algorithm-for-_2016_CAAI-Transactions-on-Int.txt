Optimisation based methods have also been proposed for robot localisation in the literature. These methods predominantly focus on feature based maps rather than on occupancy grid maps. In [12] a genetic optimisation algorithm is used to localise a mobile robot on a map consisting of geometric beacons. Genetic algorithms are also used in [13] for localising on a satellite image geo-map of an outdoor environment using a laser range finder. Kwok et al. [14] proposes the use of evolutionary computing techniques which include genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimisation, and the ants system for feature based localisation and demonstrates their effectiveness and robustness to noise and dynamic environments. Localisation of nodes in a wireless sensor network is a prominent application which relies heavily on optimisation based methods. Mao et al. [15] explains how different techniques are applied to this unique problem and how optimisation based methods can solve the wireless sensor net- works localisation problem.

probabilistic likelihood methods [7,19]. In ICP, each laser endpoint in the query scan is associated with a point, line, or surface in the reference scan (or the map in case of localisation) using a distance metric such as Euclidean distance, after which a rigid body transformation [20] is used to compute the best alignment. A new set of data associations using the computed rigid body transformation is then used to repeat this process until convergence. In probabilistic scan matching methods, sensor error which is the difference between actual sensor measurement and the predicted sensor reading is used to update the likelihood of a given hypothesised robot pose. The predicted reading is estimated by algorithms such as ray-casting, which are computationally expensive, or likelihood fields [7] for which environment dependent tuning is essential, as it is an approximation to the ray-casting.

Distance function based maps are increasingly becoming utilised to capture geometries of environments [21e25]. The distance function not only encodes the occupied regions of the environment, but also provides a continuous measure of the distance, making it a much richer representation in comparison to an occupancy grid map. In KinectFusion, Newcombe et al.

In this paper, we propose distance functions as means of representing two-dimensional environments. We present a sensor model based on Chamfer distance [28] that can relate measurements from sensors such as laser range finders to a distance function based map.1 The proposed sensor model does not rely on feature extraction, data association or ray tracing operations. We use this sensor model in an optimisa- tion based strategy that minimises the Chamfer distance to provide efficient means to localise a mobile robot when the initial pose of the robot is approximately known.

including the resolution of quantisation. However, the algorithm proposed by Rosenfeld & Pfaltz [29] computes the distance transform efficiently by only two passes over any given two- dimensional environment. Furthermore, there are numerous al- gorithms, some of which rely on graphical processing units, that can compute distance transforms in real-time [30e33].

both binary edge images which can be obtained using an edge filter on the original images. The highest computational complexity in this context lies on the distance transform process to create the distance function from the reference edge image which should be done for every image frame. However, as discussed before, recent high-speed implementations of distance transform enable faster execution and have even made it possible to use Chamfer distance for people recogni- tion and tracking on surveillance footage in real-time [33]. It is important to note that when the distance function is used to represent a static environment map, its calculation is a one off process and therefore does not impact the computational cost

Robot localisation problem can be solved by finding the robot pose that minimise a cost function C, which is defined as a measure of mismatch between a set sensor reading z and the map m. The sensor model as described in Section 2.2 essentially defines such a cost function in the vicinity of the true pose. Robot localisation problem can therefore be expressed as,

Dataset 2 is a publicly available dataset from the Intel research laboratories, Seattle, USA. In this dataset the robot travels three loops in an office building. Map of the environ- ment and the ground truth are not available. Therefore, laser range scans gathered during the third loop is used with the GMapping [40] algorithm to generate the occupancy grid map for evaluation.

beam-based and likelihood-field sensor models of AMCL are shown. It can be seen that the AMCL with the beam based likelihood function takes the longest time due to the complexity of the ray-casting process. It should be noted that the code distributed with ROS may not be the most efficient implementation of AMCL.
