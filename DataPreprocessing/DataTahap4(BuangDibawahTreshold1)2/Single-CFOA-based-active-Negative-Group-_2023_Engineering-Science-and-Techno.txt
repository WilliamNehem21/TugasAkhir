In this article, we presented nine new second-order single Current Feedback Operation Amplifier (CFOA)-based NGD circuits, obtained by computer-aided design method [10], which may be useful for commu- nication or control applications. Section 2 introduces the NGD circuit theory, describes the CFOA, a literature review of active NGD topolo- gies, and presents the new circuits. Section 3 describes the circuit design method, while a non-ideal study of a selected NGD circuit is given in Section 4. Section 5 is focused on the simulation and experimental validations. Performance comparison with selected state- of-the-art solutions is shown in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes the study.
