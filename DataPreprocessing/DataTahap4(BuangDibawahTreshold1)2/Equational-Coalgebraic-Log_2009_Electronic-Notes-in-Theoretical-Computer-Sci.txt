Example 2.3 Coalgebras for the covariant power set functor are Kripke frames, also known as non-deterministic transitions systems [1]. Slight variations allow to add labels to transitions or states. Coalgebras for the finite multiset functor are directed graphs with N-weighted edges, often referred as multigraphs [30]. Coalge- bras for the finite distribution functor are finitely branching discrete time Markov chains [3]. QQ-coalgebras are known as neighborhood frames in modal logic [9].

The translations rely on some conditions on the type functor T and on the propositional logic being Boolean. Accordingly, in this section we always assume our logic is based on BA. If we would like to extend the results to DL, we should modify the notion of predicate lifting by working with endofunctors T over the category of ordered sets and replace the functor Q by the down-set functor. We do not pursue this issue here.

Remark 6.10 Finding a monotone set of predicate liftings is important in coalge- braic modal logic, as it opens the possibility of adding fix points operators. The previous proposition solves this problem in the case of weak-pullback preserving functors. As far as we know, the general problem for non-weak pullback preserving functors is still open.
