layers to fabricate (n)Bi2S3/(p)CuSCN heterojunction on fluo- rine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. They successfully employed the heterojunction as a Liquefied Pe- troleum Gas (LPG) sensor at room temperature. Rath et al. [48] reported the first solution-processed heterojunction solar cells based on p-type PbS quantum dots and n-type Bi2S3 nanocrystals. In this solar cell nanostructured n-type Bi2S3 was used as electron acceptor. They reported a power conversion

lution controls the rate of Bi2S3 formation. The rate of Bi3+ ions is controlled by TEA, which forms a complex Bi[(TEA)n]3+ with Bi3+. Ni-doped Bi2S3 films are prepared by adding 1.5 wt% of nickel nitrate Ni(NO3)2 to the following procedure and the re-

cluster. Agglomeration of small crystallites in the film is also evident from the photograph. Such agglomeration makes it dif- ficult to evaluate the grain size from SEM image. It is also clear from this image that there is a common characteristic of the grains in their spherical shape.

crease in temperature. With increasing temperature, the number of free charge carriers is also increased due to either their bond breaking or by the de-trapping mechanism [56]. As a result, the series resistance of the (p)Si/(n)Bi2S3 junction decreases with an increase in temperature.

In this paper, we investigated the temperature dependent elec- trical and photovoltaic properties of (p)Si/(n)Bi2S3 heterojunction fabricated by chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique. The rectifying nature of the junction shows the formation of barrier at the interface of the two semiconductors. The ideality factor and series resistance decreases, whereas the potential barrier height increases with increase in temperature. Photovoltaic con- version efficiency of the junction is found low with low value of fill factor due to the presence of the interfacial and barrier height inhomogeneity.
