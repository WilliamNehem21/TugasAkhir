The phylogenetic tree is obtained by the average cluster- ing or neighbor-joining method [5] and then reticulation events are predicted among the taxas to construct the phylogenetic network and to predict the interactions between the differ- ent species. These interactions may be of the Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT), Homoplasy, Hybridization, Genetic Crossover, Recombination type, etc. [14,15]. As an application, the method
