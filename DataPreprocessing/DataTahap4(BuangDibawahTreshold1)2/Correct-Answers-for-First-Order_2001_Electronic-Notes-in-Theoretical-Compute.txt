an independent mathematical meaning which agree each other in several ways. The problem is that operational expressiveness (intended as the capability of directing the flow of execution of a program) tends to obscure the declara- tive meaning. Research in logic programming strives to find a good balance between these opposite needs.

In this paper we have presented a new definition for correct answers and correct resultants which can be applied to the full first order logic (both classical and intuitionistic). Moreover, we have shown that a well known abstraction of logic program semantics, namely groundness, can be easily reintroduced inside our framework. This definitions are so general that they can be reused with only slight changes for every logic system with standard quantifier rules, such as linear logic or modal logic. We think that, w.r.t. [3], our new definitions of correct answers and groundness answers give us more intuitive and accurate results and a much cleaner theory.

We also need a way to reduce nondeterminism in abstract interpreters. This is a problem which has been tackled thoroughly in the field of automatic deduction. A standard solution is to use unification to reduce nondeterminism in the introductions of quantifiers [7,24]. We would like to treat unification in our framework, and we want to do this without any major modification. We are working in the direction of defining an abstraction of proof skeletons using extra-logical variables such that the corresponding optimal abstract operators automatically computes the semantics trough unification.
