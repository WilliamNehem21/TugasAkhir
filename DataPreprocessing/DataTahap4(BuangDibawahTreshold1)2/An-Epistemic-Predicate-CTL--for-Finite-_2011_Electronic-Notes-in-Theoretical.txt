This vocabulary may be inconvenient for immediate use, but with existential quantification and disjunction one can easily define predicates like, e.g., Z(n1, n2) for there exist a name y such that the current process term is of the form ... | n1(x).p(n2, x, y) | .. ..

is unrestricted. This can be realised by choosing P to range over the processes PM which simulate Turing machines M as above, and the property in question to be M terminates and E behaves as storage in the above way until M terminates. By restricting M to be deterministic, PM |E can be chosen to have just one run. For

We leave three main questions open for future investigation. First, we have not explored the practical implications of the closed system modelling approach suggested in this paper, and whether it can offer new approaches to specification and verification, for instance along the lines suggested by [3]. Second, the model checking algorithm presented here is non-elementary and needs to be improved in order to become practically useful. It remains to be seen if existing approaches to model checking of epistemic logics [10,15] can be extended. Third, it is of interest to extend the results presented here to capture also strategic ability, for instance along the lines of AFL [2].

Dimitar Guelev worked on the topic of this paper during a research visit to KTH in September, 2009, which was partially supported by the ACCESS Linnaeus Excel- lence Centre, funded by the Swedish National Research Council. The work was also partly supported by Bulgarian National Science Fund Grant ID-09-112. D. Guelev is grateful to Mark Ryan for some comments on a draft version of the paper.
