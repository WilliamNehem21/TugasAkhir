The question whether every separable Banach space has a basis was posed by Banach in 1932; forty years later, it was answered in the negative by Enflo [7]. Enflo in fact constructed a Banach space that lacks the approximation property (AP). A Banach space is said to have AP if the identity operator can be approximated uniformly on every compact subset by finite-rank operators (see [8, Definition 3.4.26, Theorem 3.4.32]). A Banach space with a basis necessarily has AP (see [8, Theorem 4.1.33]).
