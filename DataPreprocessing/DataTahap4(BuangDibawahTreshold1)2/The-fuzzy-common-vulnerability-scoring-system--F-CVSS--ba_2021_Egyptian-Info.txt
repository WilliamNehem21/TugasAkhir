Vulnerability is defined as an error or event that may directly or indirectly distort the integrity, practicality or privacy in a system, device or service. Many vulnerabilities are detected and declared every year. The administrators of organizations with the resources to terminate vulnerabilities in their systems first focus on the most critical vulnerabilities. The number of companies and systems assessing these risks is quite limited. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), based on the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) open platform, is a quantitative calcu- lation method transforming simple formulae into a value of the severity of vulnerabilities [1]. The availability of standard metrics allows an objective assessment to be performed to compare vul- nerabilities. Therefore, the use of CVSS is very beneficial. CVSS

scoring systems. Explaining vulnerability deficits through linguis- tic variables is easier than finding and calculating the basic CVSS scoring parameters [3]. This study aimed to model and estimate CVSS base scores based on a vulnerability description using Fuzzy Logistic Regression (FLR).

Regarding the logistic regression, fuzzy and indefinite observa- tions were disregarded in establishing a model, while a relation- ship was defined between the fuzzy variables in the fuzzy logistic regression. Classic logistic regression cannot be imple- mented due to the fuzziness of CVSS severity in the suggested method. In addition, a new field was used for the first time, which is different to the logistic regression model in a fuzzy environment. However, the suggested model can be expanded in cases where both explanatory variables and response variables are fuzzy. More- over, different parameter estimation or model assessment methods can be used to improve the model. In conclusion, with the use of linguistic terms to assess the common vulnerabilities, the expecta- tion is that it will assist the administrators of organizations on a
