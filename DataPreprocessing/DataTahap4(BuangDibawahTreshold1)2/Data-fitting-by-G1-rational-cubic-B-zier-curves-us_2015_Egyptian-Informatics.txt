(HMCR); pitch adjusting rate (PAR); and number of improvi- sation (NI), or stopping criterion. The harmony memory (HM) is a memory location where all the solution vectors (sets of decision variables) are stored. At this step, HM is similar to the genetic pool in the GA where all of the data had been stored [10].

All evolutionary algorithms, including HS, GA and PSO are stochastic population based search methods. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the optimal solution will be reached consistently. Therefore, in order to deny that there is a guaran- tee that HS can be used to have better approximation to the global optimal solution, a comparison on optimization prob- lem using such algorithm where a statistical analysis had been carried out. 30 sample data of total least-squares error of four outlines for methods HS, GA and PSO were being used with the time taken for all the data which were fixed.
