We introduce a probabilistic modal logic PPL extending the work of [13,12] by allowing arbitrary nesting of a path probabilistic operator and we prove its completeness. We prove that our logic is strictly more expressive than other logics such as the logics cited above. By considering a probabilistic extension of CTL we show that this additional expressive power is really needed in some applications.

During the 1990s various probabilistic temporal logics were studied, combining tem- poral logics with probabilities. A probabilistic extension of CTL was given in [16,3] where a number of results concerning the decidability of model checking were also proved. The definition given here is a minor variation on the one given in [6].

proof of soundness is relatively straightforward. To prove completeness we will show that an arbitrary consistent formula has a model, in fact the model we construct will have only finitely many worlds, and the number of worlds will be bound by an exponential function, in terms of the size of the formula. Some notation first. From definition 1.1 we see that every term is a linear sum of primitive terms. A term
