We assume the reader is familiar with standard category theory as can be found in [18]. In order to abstract away from the category Set we have had to employ certain constructions which some readers may not be completely familiar with. We give a short definition of these here; more details can be found in [18,3].

When we come to the dual of this construction in Sect. 5, a construction like the above will not be possible since one would be interested in the limit of co-chain, and there is no reason for an accessible endofunctor to preserve such limits. The effect is that the rank of the cofree comonad over an acces- sible endofunctor may increase. This change of rank underlies the technical difficulties which will arise in Sect. 5.

from which we can see Sn as defining the terms of depth at most n,e.g. S0(X) contains the variables X, and S1(X) contains the variables X, the canonical element of 1 representing the unit of the monoid and a pair of elements of S0(X) which can be thought of as the multiplication of these elements.

Recall that the heart of the categorical approach to universal algebra is ad- junction (4). The dualisation outlined in this section can be summed up as replacing the left adjoint to U with a right adjoint and the replacement of monads with comonads. As a result,the definition of a cosignature turns out to be formally the same as that of a signature.
