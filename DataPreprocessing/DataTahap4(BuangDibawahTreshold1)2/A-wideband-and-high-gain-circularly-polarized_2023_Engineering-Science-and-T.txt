modes when different SSP branches are excited. The array has an overlapped impedance bandwidth of 61.9 % (3.17 to 6.01 GHz) and an overlapped AR bandwidth of 40.2 % (4.01 to 6.03 GHz) in two CP states, and the peak gain is 11.68 dBic.

However, these technologies have limited bandwidth improvement for antennas and may increase the size. To further enhance the perfor- mance of the antenna, the proposed design in this paper incorporates spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) technology. SSPP have gener- ated significant interest in the microwave community. These are elec- tromagnetic (EM) excitations that propagate along corrugated metal

introducing two chamfered triangles, and one of which is connected to the remaining polygonal shape. The detailed parameters are as follows: l1 = 40 mm, d1 = 20 mm, d2 = 10.7 mm, d3 = 9.3 mm, d4 = 0.7 mm, h1 =

42.6 % (3.45 to 4.48 GHz, 4.68 to 5.57 GHz), and a peak gain of 11.68 dBic. The proposed antenna has potential applications in wideband and multi-polarization wireless platforms, increasing overall channel ca- pacity and mitigating polarization mismatch issues in complex channels.
