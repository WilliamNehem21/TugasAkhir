Data fields provide a flexible and highly general model for indexed collections of data. Data Field Haskell is a Haskell dialect that provides an instance of data fields. It can be used for very generic collection-oriented programming, with a special emphasis on multidimensional structures. We give a brief description of the data field model and its underlying theory. We then describe Data Field Haskell, and an implementation.
