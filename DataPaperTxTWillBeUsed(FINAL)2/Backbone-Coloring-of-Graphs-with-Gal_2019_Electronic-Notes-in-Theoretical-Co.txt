Abstract
A (proper) k-coloring of a graph G = (V, E) is a function c : V (G) → {1,..., k} such that c(u) /= c(v) for every uv ∈ E(G). Givena graph G and a subgraph H of G,a q-backbone k-coloring of (G, H) isa k-coloring c of G such that q ≤ |c(u) − c(v)| for every edge uv ∈ E(H). The q-backbone chromatic number of (G, H), denoted by BBCq (G, H), is the minimum integer k for which there exists a q-backbone k-coloring of (G, H). Similarly, a circular q-backbone k-coloring of (G, H) is a function c : V (G) → {1,..., k} such that, for every edge uv ∈ E(G), we have |c(u) − c(v)| ≥ 1 and, for every edge uv ∈ E(H), we have k − q ≥ |c(u) − c(v)| ≥ q. The circular q-backbone chromatic number of (G, H), denoted by CBCq (G, H), is the smallest integer k such that there exists such coloring c.
In this work, we first prove that if G is a 3-chromatic graph and F is a galaxy, then CBCq (G, F ) ≤ 2q + 2.
Then, we prove that CBC3(G, M ) ≤ 7 and CBCq(G, M ) ≤ 2q, for every q ≥ 4, whenever M is a matching of a planar graph G. Moreover, we argue that both bounds are tight. Such bounds partially answer open questions in the literature. We also prove that one can compute BBC2(G, M ) in polynomial time, whenever G is an outerplanar graph with a matching backbone M . Finally, we show a mistake in a proof that BBC2(G, M ) ≤ Δ(G) + 1, for any matching M of an arbitrary graph G [Miˇskuf et al., 2010] and we present how to fix it.

Introduction
For basic notions and undefined terminology we refer to [3]. Let G = (V, E) be a simple graph. Given a positive integer k, we denote the set {1, ··· , k} by [k]. A (proper) k-coloring of G is a function c : V (G) → [k] such that c(u) /= c(v) for every edge uv ∈ E(G). We say G is k-colorable if there exists a k-coloring of G. The chromatic number of G, denoted by χ(G), is the smallest k for which G is k-colorable. We say G is k-chromatic if χ(G) = k and that it is k-colorable if it admits a k-coloring.
Let G be a graph and H a subgraph of G. We say that (G, H) isa pair, where H is called backbone of G. Given two positive integers q and k,a q-backbone k-coloring of (G, H) isa k-coloring c of G for which |c(u) −c(v)|≥ q for every uv ∈ E(H). The q-backbone chromatic number of (G, H), denoted by BBCq(G, H), is the minimum k for which there exists a q-backbone k-coloring of (G, H). Problems regarding backbone colorings were first introduced by Broersma et al. [5], based on coloring problems related to frequency assignment.
Observe that if c is a proper k-coloring of G, then g defined by g(v)= q · c(v) − (q − 1) is a q-backbone (q · k − q + 1)-coloring of (G, H) for any spanning subgraph H of G. Hence
BBCq(G, H) ≤ q · χ(G) − q + 1.
We now consider special backbone k-colorings where the color space is circular,
i.e. it behaves as Z/k. To be precise, given a graph G, a subgraph H of G, and a positive integer q, a circular q-backbone k-coloring of (G, H) is a k-coloring c : V (G) → {1,..., k} such that q ≤ |c(u) − c(v)| ≤ k − q, for every uv ∈ E(H). The circular q-backbone chromatic number of (G, H), denoted by CBCq(G, H), is the smallest k for which there exists a circular q-backbone k-coloring of (G, H).
Note that any circular q-backbone k-coloring is a q-backbone k-coloring. Con- versely, a q-backbone k-coloring yields a circular q-backbone (k + q − 1)-coloring. Therefore we get
BBCq(G, H) ≤ CBCq(G, H) ≤ BBCq(G, H)+ q − 1, and also
q · χ(H) ≤ CBCq(G, H) ≤ q · χ(G).
Havet et al. [8] conjectured the following problem:
Conjecture 1.1 If G is a planar graph and F is a galaxy in G, then CBCq(G, F ) ≤
2q + 2.
Recall that a star on n vertices is a tree with n − 1 leaves and the remaining vertex is called the central vertex of the star (in the case which a star is only an edge, we choose one of its ends as central vertex.). A galaxy is a graph whose connected components are stars.
We prove that Conjecture 1.1 holds for 3-chromatic graphs, even for those which are not planar. Recall that for planar graphs, by Gr¨otzsch’s theorem, this includes triangle-free planar graphs. It is also known that there are linear-time algorithms to find 3-colorings of triangle-free planar graphs [9]. By combining such algorithms

with our result, we deduce that a q-backbone coloring with 2q + 2 colors can be obtained in linear time. We do not know whether our bound is tight when G is triangle-free. It is trivially tight when G is not triangle-free as it suffices to take a K4 with K1,3 as backbone. Therefore, we pose the question:
Problem 1.2 If G is a triangle-free 3-chromatic graph and F a galaxy in G, then
CBCq(G, F ) ≤ 2q + 1?
With respect to matching backbones, Havet et al. [8] asked the following ques- tion:
Problem 1.3 If G is a planar graph, M is a matching in G, and q is a positive integer, q ≥ 3, is it true that CBCq(G, M ) ≤ 2q + 1?
In the same article, they prove that it is NP -complete to decide whether CBC2(G, M ) ≤ k for k ∈ {4, 5} when M is a matching in a planar graph G. This is why the problem above does not consider q = 2. In fact, they show that if G is a pla- nar graph with girth at least 5 and M is a matching in G, then CBCq(G, M ) ≤ 2q+1. This is why they propose to investigate the following relaxation of Problem 1.3.
Problem 1.4 If G is a planar graph with girth at least 4 and M is a matching in
G, is it true that CBCq(G, M ) ≤ 2q + 1?
We prove a stronger version of Problem 1.3, namely we prove that the bound 2q +1 holds for q = 3, and that for q ≥ 4, the bound can be improved to 2q. Observe that if M is non-empty, then 2q is the best possible, because, for every planar graph G, non-empty matching M and positive integer q, we have CBCq(G, M ) ≥ 2q.
Therefore, by our result there is always equality if q ≥ 4, and if q = 3 then CBCq(G, M ) equals either 6 or 7. We also give an example where the upper bound 7 can be attained. So, we pose the following question:
Problem 1.5 Given a planar graph G and a non-empty matching M, can one decide in polynomial time whether CBC3(G, M )= 6?
In [4], Broersma et al. proved that for q+1 ≤ χ(G) ≤ 2q, we have BBCq(G, M ) ≤ 2χ(G) − 2, where M is a matching of G. This and the fact that CBCq(G, H) ≤ BBCq(G, H)+ q − 1, gives us that CBC2(G, M ) ≤ 5, whenever G is a 3-chromatic graph and M is a matching of G. But since triangle-free planar graphs are 3- colorable by Gr¨otzsch’s Theorem, the case q = 2 of Problem 1.4 is known. The other cases follow from our result.
Using the same result and the fact that an outerplanar graph is 3-chromatic, we have that BBC2(G, M ) ≤ 4, whenever G is an outerplanar graph and M is a matching of G. In this work, we prove that one can compute BBC2(G, M ) in polynomial time, whenever G is an outerplanar graph with a matching backbone M .
Apart from Problem 1.5, the only remaining questions concerning q-backbone chromatic number of (G, M ) are for q = 2. Broersma et al. [5] proved that BBC2(G, M ) ≤ 6 and ask: 1) can this result be proved without using the Four

Color Theorem? and 2) Can this be improved to 5? Both questions are still open, although in [1] some partial answers are given. They hint for positive answers by proving that if G has no induced cycles of length 4 or 5, then CBC2(G, M ) ≤ 5, and that if G is diamond-free, then CBC2(G, M ) ≤ 6 (none of their proofs use the Four Color Theorem). Given that the original questions posed by Broersma et al.
[5] seem to be very hard, we ask the following simpler question that could be a good intermediate step for a definite answer for their questions.
Problem 1.6 Let G be a planar C4-free graph, and M be a matching in G. Is it true that CBC2(G, M ) ≤ 5?
Finally, with respect to general graphs, Miˇskuf et al. [10] presented a proof for a Brooks’ type theorem for BBC, i.e. for any graph G and any matching M in G, we have BBC2(G, M ) ≤ Δ(G) + 1. We found a mistake in their proof and we present here how to fix it.
Galaxy backbones
In this section, we want to prove that CBCq(G, F ) ≤ 2q +2 when F is a galaxy of a 3-chromatic graph.
Theorem 2.1 If G is a 3-chromatic graph and F is a galaxy, then
CBCq(G, F ) ≤ 2q + 2.

Proof. Let c : V (G) → [3] be a 3-coloring of G. Define Li = {v ∈ V (G) | c(v) = i and dF (v)= 1} and for each v ∈ Li, consider v the vertex such that vv ∈ E(F ). We now define a circular q-backbone coloring cj : V (G) → [2q + 2] as follows:
If v ∈ c—1(1), then cj(v)= 1.
If v ∈ c—1(2), then





If v ∈ c—1(3), then
⎧ q + 1, if v ∈ L2 and c(v)= 1;
cj(v)=	2q + 2, if v ∈ L2 and c(v)= 3;
⎪⎪⎩ q + 3, otherwise.

cj(v)= ⎧⎨ 2, if v ∈ L3 and c(v)= 2;
⎩ q + 2, otherwise.

First, we prove that cj is a proper coloring. In fact, C1, C2, C3 ⊂ V (G) be partitions of the 3-partition induced by c and consider Cj = {v ∈ V (G): cj(v)= 

i}, for each i ∈ {1, 2,q +1,q +2,q +3, 2q +2}. Observe that Cj
j
q+3
2q+2 ∈

C2, Cj	, Cj ∈ C3 and C1 = Cj .  Then, Cj
is a independent set, for all

q+2	2	1	i
i ∈ {1, 2,q + 1,q + 2,q + 3, 2q + 2}. This give us that cj must be a proper

coloring of G. Now, we prove that it is a circular backbone coloring. For this, we prove that, given a central vertex v, all of its neighbors in the backbone are colored with an appropriate color. First observe that v receives color 1, q +3 or q + 2. In the first case, the colors allowed for its neighbors in F are q +1 or q + 2. In the second case, all the its neighbors in F are colored with colors 1 or 2. Finally, in the last case, all the its neighbors in F are colored with colors 1 or 2q + 2. Hence cj is a circular q-backbone coloring of (G, F ).

Matching backbones
In this section our goal is to prove the upper bounds for planar graphs G with matching backbones M .
The proof of the upper bounds follow by contradiction as we suppose the ex- istence a minimal counter-example. Let us formally define this notion. Given a pair (G, H), a subpair (Gj,Hj) of (G, H) is a pair such that Hj ⊆ H and Gj ⊆ G. We say that (Gj,Hj) is a proper subpair of (G, H) if it is a subpair of (G, H) and Hj ⊂ H and Gj ⊂ G. A pair (G, H) is called (k, q)-minimal if CBCq(G, H) > k, but CBCq(Gj,Hj) ≤ k for every proper subpair (Gj,Hj) of (G, H).  Note that if CBCq(G, H) > k, then there exists a subpair (Gj,Hj) of (G, H) that is (k, q)- minimal.
Let Zk be a color space. A subset S ⊆ Zk, a positive integer q and i ∈ Zk, we say that the color i is q-bad for S if S ⊆ {i − q + 1, ··· ,i + q − 1}.
Given a plane graph G, we denote by F(G) the set of faces of G and by d(f ) the degree of a face f in G. Now, given a pair (G, H) and a vertex u ∈ V (G), the (k, q)-total degree of u in (G, H) is given by:


t
(G,H),k,q
(u) = dG(u)+ (2q − 2)dH (u).

If G, H, k, q are clear from context, we omit them in the notation.
Lemma 3.1 Let (G, H) be a (k, q)-minimal pair, with k ≥ 2q. If uv ∈ E(H), then
dt(u)+ dt(v) ≥ 2k + 2q − 2.
Sketch of the proof.
First, write dt(u)= k + l and dt(v)= k + lj. Then, we proved that dt(u) ≥ k, for every u ∈ V (G), so that l, lj ≥ 0.
Let f be a circular q-backbone k-coloring of (G − u − v, H − u − v). Note that af (u)= k − (k + l − 2q + 1) = 2q − (l + 1), and analogously af (v)= 2q − (lj + 1). By contradiction, suppose that dt(u)+ dt(v) ≤ 2k + 2q − 3. Then, we get:
k + l + k + lj ≤ 2k + 2q − 3 ⇔ l + lj ≤ 2q − 3.
Therefore, af (v) ≥ 2q − 1 − (2q − 3 −l)= l + 2. Then, we also proved that if S ⊆ Zk
has cardinality 2q −p, where p ≥ 0 and k ≥ 2q, there are at most p colors in Zk that

are q-bad for S. So we have that at most l+1 colors are q-bad for Af (u). Therefore, there exists a color c ∈ Af (v) that is not q-bad for Af (u), a contradiction.	2
The lemma below follows directly from Euler’s Formula.
Lemma 3.2 Let G be a plane graph, M be a matching of G, and q be a positive integer. Then,

Σ (dt(v) − 2q − 2) + Σ
(d(f ) − 4) ≤ −8.

v∈V (G)	f∈7 (G)
Theorem 3.3 Let G be a plane graph, M be a matching in G, and q be a positive integer. Then:
CBC3(G, M ) ≤ 7, and
CBCq(G, M ) ≤ 2q, if q ≥ 4.
Sketch of the proof.
First, we prove that it holds when M is a perfect matching and q ≥ 4. For this, suppose otherwise and let (G, H) be a minimal counter-example. We apply the discharging method. Start by giving charge dt(u) to every u ∈ V (G) and d(f ) − 4 to every f ∈ F(G). Let α = 2q + 2. By Lemma 3.1, for each uv ∈ M we have:
dt(u)+ dt(v) ≥ 2k + 2q − 2= 6q − 2= 2α + 2q − 6.

This tells us that the sum of the charges on each edge of the matching is enough to ensure that every vertex can end up with non-negative charge, with surplus of 2q − 6 ≥ 2 on each edge of the matching. Because M is a perfect matching, we get a surplus of at least n which is clearly bigger than the number of triangles, thus contradicting Lemma 3.2. One can verify that when q = 3 and k = 2q +1 we can apply a similar argument.
Now, suppose (G, M ) is a pair, and M is not a perfect matching. Then, we can add, for each vertex u that is not saturated by M , a pendant vertex uj to G and M in order to obtain a pair (Gj,Mj) containing (G, M ) and such that Mj is a perfect matching of Gj. The lemma follows by the previous paragraph and the fact that (G, M ) ⊆ (Gj,Mj).	2
Both upper bounds provided by Theorem 3.3 are tight, under the hypothesis that M /= ∅. For q ≥ 4, if M /= ∅, then we have CBCq(G, M ) ≥ 2q, for any graph
G. In [8], they present an example to show that there exists a planar graph G3 and a perfect matching M3 of G3 such that BBC2(G3, M3) = 5. The same example also satisfies CBC3(G3, M3)= 7.
Proposition 3.4 CBC3(G3, M3)= 7.
Proof. The upper bound is provided by Theorem 3.3. To prove the lower bound, suppose, by contradiction, that there exists a circular 3-backbone 6-coloring c of (G3, M3). Observe that, if uv is an edge of M3, then {c(u), c(v)} is either {1, 4} or



Fig. 1. CBC3(G3, M3)=7 
{2, 5} or {3, 6}. If the first case (resp. second, third) occurs, we say that uv is an 14-edge (resp. a 25-edge, a 36-edge).
One may assume, without loss of generality, that abj is a 14-edge. Since d is a neighbor of both a and bj, d has a different color, and without loss of generality, we may assume that ajd is a 25-edge. Then, since the only non-neighbor of c is cj, we deduce that cjd is a 36-edge. Consequently, since b is adjacent to aj, d, c, dj, then bcj must be a 14-edge. This is a contradiction, because a is adjacent to b and cj and c(a) ∈ {1, 4}.	2

Polynomial-time algorithm for outerplanar graphs
In this section, we give a polynomial algorithm that, given an outerplanar graph G and a matching M of G, decides whether BBC(G, M ) ≤ 3. Since BBC(G, M ) ≤ 2 if and only if G is bipartite and M is empty, and because BBC(G, M ) is always at most 4, this implies that one can compute BBC(G, M ) in polynomial time.
Theorem 4.1 Let G be a connected outerplanar graph on n vertices and m edges, and let M ⊆ E(G) be a matching in G. Then, deciding if BBC(G, M ) ≤ 3 can be done in time O(m + n).
Proof. A tree decomposition of a graph G is a pair D = (T, {Xt}t∈V (T )) such that: T is a rooted tree; for every vertex v ∈ V (G), there exists t ∈ V (T ) such that v ∈ Xt; for every edge uv ∈ E(G), there exists t ∈ V (T ) such that {u, v} ⊆ Xt; for every v ∈ V (G), the subset {t ∈ V (T ) | v ∈ Xt} induces a subtree of T . A tree decomposition is nice if the vertices of T can be classified as one of the following types.
leaf : t is a leaf in T ;
forget : t has exactly one child tj and there exists u ∈ V (G) such that Xt =
Xt′ \ {u};

introduce: t has exactly one child tj and there exists u ∈ V (G) such that
Xt = Xt′ ∪ {u}; and
join: t has exactly two children, t1 and t2, and Xt = Xt1 = Xt2 .
The width of a tree decomposition D is the maximum size of a subset Xt minus one. The treewidth of G is the minimum width of a tree decomposition of G and it is denoted by tw(G). It is known that if G is outerplanar, then tw(G) ≤ 2, and that a (nice) tree decomposition D = (T, {Xt}t∈V (T )) of width tw(G) such that
|V (T )| = O(n) can be computed in time O(n + m) [2,7]. Here, we use such a tree decomposition to solve our problem. For this, for each node t ∈ V (T ), denote by Tt the subtree of T rooted at t; by Vt the subset t′∈V (Tt) Xt′ ; by (Gt, Ht) the pair (G[Vt],H[Vt]); and for each coloring f : Xt → {1, 2, 3}, define the following:

⎧ 1 , if there is a 2-backbone 3-coloring fj of (Gt, Ht) such that f ⊆ fj; Bt(f )= 
⎩ 0 ,  otherwise.

Now, we present how to compute each Bt(f ), given that the values are computed in a post-order traversal of T . Hence, consider a node t and a 3-coloring f of G[Xt]. If t is a leaf, then Bt(f ) = 1 if and only if f is a 2-backbone 3-coloring of (G[Xt],H[Xt]), which can be tested in constant time, since |Xt| ≤ 3. So, suppose otherwise and consider that we know the values of Bt′ (f ) for each child tj of a node
t. We analyse all the possible cases according to the type of t:
t is forget: let tj be the child of t and u ∈ V (G) be such that Xt = Xt′ \ {u}. Observe that (Gt, Ht)= (Gt′ , Ht′ ). Thus, we get that there exists a 2-backbone 3-coloring fj of (Gt, Ht) that extends f if, and only if, fj is a 2-backbone 3- coloring of (Gt′ , Ht′ ) that contains f . Hence, if we define fi as f ∪ {(u, i)} for each i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, we get that:
Bt(f ) = 1 if, and only if, Bt′ (fi)=1 for some i ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
t is introduce: let tj be the child of t and u ∈ V (G) be such that Xt = Xt′ ∪{u}. Then, there exists a 2-backbone 3-coloring fj of (Gt, Ht) that extends f if, and only if, f is a 2-backbone 3-coloring of (G[Xt],H[Xt]) and there exists a 2- backbone 3-coloring fjj of (Gt′ , Ht′ ) that extends fj = fTX ′ (f restricted to Xt′ ). Hence, we get that:
Bt(f ) = 1 if, and only if, Bt′ (f )= 1.

t is join: let t1, t2 be the children of t. Because Xt separates Gt1 − Xt from Gt2 − Xt, we get that the union of two 2-backbone 3-colorings of Gt1 and Gt2 that agree on Xt is a 2-backbone 3-coloring of (Gt, Ht). Thus:
Bt(f ) = 1 if, and only if, Bt1 (f )= Bt2 (f )= 1.

Now, observe that each step can be done in constant time, because there are at most 33 possible colorings of each Xt. Since there are &(n) nodes in T , we get that, once we find the tree decomposition of G, one can compute all the values Bt(f ) in &(n) time. Once we arrive at the root r of T , the answer to whether BBC(G, M ) ≤ 3 is “yes” if and only if Br(f ) = 1, for some 2-backbone 3-coloring f of Xr.	2

We mention that, after the revision and acceptance of this extended abstract, we found an error in our previous proof. Nevertheless, the result is still true and we found a much simpler and general proof. Observe that the above proof can be generalized for any graph G with bounded treewidth, for any fixed k, and for any possible backbone H. This, combined with the fact that BBC(G, H) ≤ 2χ(G) — 1, which equals 5 when G is an outerplanar graph, means that the backbone color- ing problem on outerplanar graphs is polynomial-time solvable for every possible backbone H.

Brooks’ Type Theorem
This section is devoted to correcting a proof of a Brook’s Type Theorem demon- strated by Miˇskuf et al. in [10]:
Theorem 5.1 Let M be a matching in a graph G of maximum degree Δ(G). Then
BBC2(G, M ) ≤ Δ(G)+ 1.
For a better understanding of their proof, it is necessary to define a special structure. Let x, y be two non-adjacent neighbors of a vertex v in a connected graph G such G — x — y is connected. Then we say that (v; x, y) is a fork. That being said, the following lemma was required:
Lemma 5.2 Let G be a 2-connected graph with all the vertices of the same degree d ≥ 3 except a particular vertex v which is of degree < d. Then, G has a fork (w; x, y) such that v /= x and v /= y.
Assuming that G is neither an odd cycle nor a complete graph, they prove the Theorem 5.1 considering an order v1,..., vn of the vertices of G such that each vi (i < n) has a succeeding neighbor. So, they claim that G is a regular graph and M is a perfect matching. Otherwise, we may choose for vn a vertex that is of degree
< Δ or that it is not incident with an edge of M . In both cases, the procedure will color also the vertex vn. Finally, they use the Lemma 5.2 to conclude that G is 2-connected. So, since G is neither an odd cycle nor a complete graph, they use the Theorem 5.3 below to ensure the existence of a fork in G that give us an order to color the vertices of G using at most Δ(G) + 1 colors.
In contrast, we found out that Lemma 5.2 is not true. A simple counterexample is described in the following figure:



Observe that the above graph satisfies the hypotheses of the Lemma 5.2, but the only forks in this graph are (b; a, v), (b; c, v), (d; a, v) and (d; c, v), which contradicts the Lemma 5.2.
On the other hand, the theorem is still true and we find a way to fix the demon- stration made in [10]. Before presenting it and to better understand our proof, we recall some definitions and results on connectivity.
Theorem 5.3 (Bryant [6]) For a 2-connected graph the following three statements are equivalent:
G is a complete graph or a cycle;
the removal from G of any two non-adjacent vertices disconnects it;
the removal from G of any two vertices at distance 2 apart disconnects it.
Notice that the above theorem claims that each 2-connected graph distinct from a cycle and a complete graph contains a fork.
A block of a graph G is a maximal connected subgraph of G that has no cut- vertex. If G itself is connected and has no cut-vertex, then G is a block. The block-cutpoint graph of a connected graph G is the graph whose vertices are the blocks and the cut-vertices of G, with an cut-vertex v adjacent to an block B if and only if v ∈ V (B). Observe that a block-cutpoint graph of G is a tree and all its leaves are blocks of G. Each block of G which is a leaf of the block-cutpoint graph of G is called leaf block.
Given a leaf block B of G, we say that a vertex u ∈ V (B) is internal if it is not a cut-vertex. Also, if G is 1-connected and the block-cutpoint graph of G is a path, we say that G has a path structure.
Now, we can prove the following:
Theorem 5.4 Let M be a matching in a graph G of maximum degree Δ. Then
BBC2(G, M ) ≤ Δ+ 1.
Proof. The proof follows the same steps as Brooks’ theorem. We just need to be careful in the case G has cut-vertices, as we may not be able to combine backbone colorings of the blocks of G into a coloring of G.
Without loss of generality, we assume that G is connected. In case G is not regular, then one can create an order σ = v1,..., vn(G) over V (G) such that each vi

has at least one neighbor vj with j > i for every i ∈ {1,..., n—1} and dG(vn(G)) < Δ. By applying the greedy algorithm over this ordering of V (G), the obtained coloring uses at most Δ + 1 colors as each vertex vj has at most Δ — 1 colored neighbors and at most one edge of the backbone M has vj as endpoint. Thus, we assume that G is regular.
If G has a fork (z; x, y), then we can produce an order σ = (x, y, v3,..., vn—1, z) of V (G) such that each vi has at least one neighbor vj with j > i for every i ∈
{3,...,n — 1}, and z has two non-adjacent neighbors, namely x and y, such that when we use the greedy algorithm on G using the order σ the vertices x and y have the same color. Then, we can use this order to, given a matching M in G, construct a 2-backbone coloring of (G, M ) that uses at most Δ + 1 colors. Consequently, we also assume that G has no fork.
If G is a complete graph or a cycle, then the upper bound holds (see [10] for details). Thus, we consider that G is a k-regular graph with no forks and G is not a complete graph nor a cycle. Consequently, observe that k ≥ 3. Note also that G cannot be 2-connected, due to Theorem 5.3.
Let B be a leaf-block of G and u be the only cut-vertex of G belonging to V (B). Case 1: κ(B — u) = 1. In this case, we claim that G has a fork, contradicting our hypothesis. In fact, note that u has a neighbor in each leaf-block of B — u that is not a cut-point of B — u. If dB(u) ≥ 3, let x and y be neighbors of u in distinct leaf-blocks of B — u, and that are not cut-vertices of B — u. Observe that (u; x, y) is a fork of G. Otherwise, dB(u) = 2 and the block-cutpoint tree of B — u is a path. Since G is k ≥ 3 regular, note that each leaf block in B — u has at least 4 vertices. In case B — u has only two blocks B1 and B2, let the unique cutpoint of B — u be
z. Since those are the only blocks, note that z must have two neighbors y ∈ V (B1) and x ∈ V (B2) such that neither y nor x is a neighbor of u. Then, (z; x, y) is a fork of G. Finally, if B — u has at least three blocks, let B1 be a leaf-block, B2 be the only block sharing the cut-vertex z with B1. Once more, one may choose y ∈ NB1 (z) such that y is not a neighbor of u and any vertex x in B2 (even if B2 is a single edge) and then (z; x, y) is a fork of G.
Case 2: B — u is 2-connected. We shall prove that u has exactly two neighbors x and y in B and xy is the only edge that does not belong to B — u. In the sequel, we use such structure to build an ordering over V (G) such that the greedy algorithm uses at most Δ + 1 colors in a 2-backbone coloring of G. We claim that B — u has a fork (z; x, y). If not, by Theorem 5.3, B — u should be either a complete graph or a cycle. It is not possible as G is k-regular and u has neighbors in B — u and G — V (B). Moreover, Theorem 5.3 ensures that every two non-adjacent vertices form a fork. Since G has no fork, the only possibility to such fork exist in B — u is that x and y be the only neighbors of u in B — u. Thus, the leaf-block B has the structure we claimed: u has exactly two neighbors x and y in B and xy is the only edge that does not belong to B — u. Finally, one can construct and ordering over V (G) such that the two first vertices are the neighbors of u in B, then we have all vertices of V (B) \ u, x, y, in the sequel we place all vertices of V (G) \ V (B) in such a way that each vertex has a neighbor that appears latter in the sequence, and the

last vertex is u. Observe that each vertex on such sequence either has one neighbor that appears latter in the sequence, or is a neighbor of x and y which will be colored with the same color. Thus, the greedy algorithm uses at most Δ + 1 colors to build a 2-backbone coloring of (G, M ).
