Abstract
This paper proposes a basic relevant logic B+

with intensional conjunction H and disjunction H, which

are more primitive than those defined by A ○ B =df ч(A → чB) and A + B =df чA → B. B+
is a

conservative extension of the basic relevant logic B+. Stronger logics can be obtained by adding axioms or

rules to B+ . Kripke style semantics for B+
is given. Three ternary relations R, S1, S2 are used to deal

with →, H, and H, respectively. We also consider negation-extensions of B+ . The ‘∗’ operator is used to
model negation.
Keywords: Relevant logics, Intensional conjunction, Intensional disjunction


Introduction
In the literature on relevant logics, two binary connectives, fusion ◦ and fission +, can be defined by A◦B =df ¬(A → ¬B) and A+B =df ¬A → B, respectively. They are also called intensional conjunction and disjunction, and share many features classically attributed to extensional analogues, ∧ and ∨. The connective ◦ can be introduced by way of the rule A ◦ B → C ⇔ A → (B → C), having implication as its residual, which makes it important to algebraic treatment and proof theory of relevant logics. Defined by the above methods, ◦ and + are highly related with

implication. However, two more primitive connectives can be defined: H and H, which we call intensional conjunction and disjunction also, since further schemes can be added to make them share features of ◦ and +.
Our idea is inspired by the work of establishing a non-normal conjunction rule in [3] (Chapter 8) for systems denying the law of identity. The rule is as following: I(A.B, a) = 1 iff for some b, c ∈ W , b g c ≤ a and I(A, b) = 1 = I(B, c), where ‘.’ represents the non-normal conjunction, W is the set of worlds, a, b and c are members of W , I is the assignment function, and g is a two-place operation on W . If we use the expression S1bca to represent the inequality b g c ≤ a, where S1 is a ternary relation, then this evaluation rule is very similar to that for ◦ in relational semantics of relevant logics. So, it seems that some intensional conjunction can be defined independent of implication. Parallel to the above work in [3], we design a non-normal disjunction rule, and start our work from these two rules.

In this paper, we propose a base system B+
, obtained by adding intenstional

conjunction and disjunction, denoted by H and H respectively, to the minimal pos-
itive relevant logic B+. B+ is a conservative extension of B+. Stronger logics can

be obtained by adding axiom or rule schemes to B+
. As to semantics, we use the

ternary relation R to model implication →. S1 and S2 are the other two ternary relations in our semantics. The former is used to deal with H, and the latter is for H. To construct a suitable canonical model, we define dualtheory and anti-dualtheory, and prove priming lemma for dualtheories. In addition, the basic negative system

BMHH is obtained by adding contraposition and De Morgan Laws to B+
with

negation modeled by the Routley ∗-operation.
We concentrate in this paper on the semantics of the basic systems with H and
H. Extensions will be considered in a subsequent draft.
The Basic System B+
An Axiom System for B+
+ is expressed in a language L, which has the two-place connectives →, Λ, V, H
and H, parentheses ( and ), and a stock of propositional variables p, q, r, ... Formulas are defined recursively in the usual manner. Some scope conventions are in force, that is, two-place connectives are ranked H, H, Λ, V, → in order of increasing scope (i.e. H binds more strongly than H, H than Λ, etc.), and otherwise association is to the left. A, B, C, ... will be used to range over arbitrary formulas.
To define B+ , let us give an axiom system for B+ first, which has the following
axioms and rules 3 :
Axioms
A1	A → A
A2	A → A V B, B → A V B
A3	A Λ B → A, A Λ B → B

3 Note that this axiom system is as same as that in [4] and [5] except that disjunctive forms of rules are not given distinctivly.

A4	A Λ (B V C) → (A Λ B) V C
A5	(A → B) Λ (A → C) → (A → B Λ C)
A6	(A → C) Λ (B → C) → (A V B → C)
Rules
R1	A, A → B ⇒ B	(Modus Ponens)
R2	A, B ⇒ A Λ B	(Ajunction)
R3	A → B, C → D ⇒ (B → C) → (A → D)	(Affixing).
Thus, B+ is obtained by adding the following axioms and rules to B+:
A7	(A V B) H C — (A H C) V (B H C),
C H (A V B) — (C H A) V (C H B)
A8	(A H C) Λ (B H C) — (A Λ B) H C,
(C H A) Λ (C H B) — C H (A Λ B) R4	A → B, C → D ⇒ A H C → B H D R5	A → B, C → D ⇒ A H C → B H D.
It can be noted that the special cases of R3 are:
A → B ⇒ (C → A) → (C → B)  (Prefixing) A → B ⇒ (B → C) → (A → C)  (Suffixing) A → B, B → C ⇒ A → C   (Transitivity).
And the special cases of R4 and R5 are, respectively:
A → B ⇒ C H A → C H B A → B ⇒ A H C → B H C A → B ⇒ C H A → C H B
A → B ⇒ A H C → B H C.
We note that this axiomatisation contains slight redundancies. R4 and R5, together with axioms and rules of B+, suffice to prove each of A7 and A8 in one direction.


Semantics for B+
Now we define interpretations for B+

. The semantics is an extension of semantics

for B+ in [6].
+ -frame (or model structure) is a 6-tuple < g, O, W, R, S1, S2 >, where W
is a set (of worlds); g ∈ W (the base world); O is a unary relation on W ; and R, S1, and S2 are ternary relations on W , such that the following definitions apply and postulates hold for all a, b, c, d ∈ W .
d1. a ≤ b =df Ex(Ox and Rxab);
p1. Og;
p2. a ≤ a;
p3. if Rdbc and a ≤ d then Rabc;
p4. if S1abd and d ≤ c then S1abc;

p5. if S2abd and c ≤ d then S2abc.
+ -model (or interpretation) is a 7-tuple < g, O, W, R, S1, S2,I >, where

< g, O, W, R, S1, S2 > is a B+
-frame, and I is a function which assigns to each

pair of propositional parameter, p, and world, a, a truth value I(p, a) ∈ {1, 0}, satisfying the Atomic Hereditary Condition. Truth values of all formulas at worlds are assigned by the following evaluation rules.
Atomic Hereditary Condition. For a propositional variable p, if I(p, a)=1 and
a ≤ a', then I(p, a')= 1.
Evaluation Rules.
I(A Λ B, a)=1 iff I(A, a)= 1 and I(B, a)= 1;
I(A V B, a)=1 iff I(A, a)= 1 or I(B, a)= 1;
I(A H B, a)=1 iff Eb, c ∈ W , S1bca, I(A, b)=1 and I(B, c)= 1;
I(A H B, a)=1 iff 6b, c ∈ W , if S2bca then I(A, b)=1 or I(B, c)= 1;
I(A → B, a)= 1 iff 6b, c ∈ W , if Rabc and I(A, b)= 1 then I(B, c)= 1.
+ -model is indeed an extension of a B+-model in [6] by adding S1, S2, and

evaluation rules for H, H.
We give the following definitions, with B+
-frame(s) and B+
-model(s) short-

ened as frame(s) and model(s), respectively. A is valid on a model if I(A, g) = 1; A implies B on a model if for all a ∈ W : if I(A, a) = 1 then I(B, a) = 1; A is valid on a frame if A is valid on all models based on this frame; A implies B on

a frame if A implies B on all models based on this frame. At last, A is B+
-valid

if A is valid on all frames; A B+
-implies B if A implies B on all frames. For any

extension of B+
, similar definitions can also be given.

The following lemmas will simplify the proof for soundness.
Lemma 2.1 (Hereditary Condition) For an arbitrary formula A, if I(A, a)= 1
and a ≤ a', then I(A, a')= 1.
Proof. The proof is by an induction on the length of A with Atomic Hereditary Condition as induction basis. Here we give proofs for H and H.
H. A is of the form B H C. Suppose I(B H C, a) = 1 and a ≤ a', to show I(B H C, a') = 1. For some b, c ∈ W , S1bca, and I(B, b) = 1 = I(C, c). By p4, S1bca'. So, I(B H C, a') = 1 as required.
H. A is of the form B H C. Suppose I(B H C, a) = 1 and a ≤ a', to show I(B H C, a') = 1. Suppose further b, c ∈ W and S2bca', to show I(B, b) = 1 or I(C, c)= 1. By p5, S2bca. So, I(B, b)=1 or I(C, c) = 1 as required.	 


Lemma 2.2 (Verification Lemma) • If A implies B on a B+
-model, then

A → B is valid on this model.
If A implies B on a B+
-frame, then A → B is valid on this frame.

A B+
-implies B iff A → B is B+
-valid.

Proof. For details of proof, please consult [6] (pp. 302-303).	 

Soundness
The soundness of the semantics is demonstrated in this section.

Theorem 2.3 If A is a theorem of B+
then A is B+
-valid.

Proof. The proof is by a simple induction over the length of proofs. It suffices to

prove that all axioms are B+
-valid and all rules preserve validity. We give proofs

for one of A8 (in one direction) and R4.
For A8, suppose for an arbitrary model, a ∈ W and I((A Λ B) H C, a) /= 1. Hence for some b, c ∈ W , S2bca, I(A Λ B, b) /=1 and I(C, c) /= 1. So, I(A, b) /=1 or I(B, b) /= 1. Hence, I(AHC, a) /=1 or I(BHC, a) /= 1, i.e. I((AHC)Λ(BHC), a) /= 1.

By Lemma 2.2, (A H C) Λ (B H C) → (A Λ B) H C is B+
-valid.

For R4, suppose A → B and C → D are B+
-valid, to show that AHC → B HD

is B+
-valid. Suppose further for an arbitrary model, a ∈ W and I(A H C, a)= 1.

Hence for some b, c ∈ W , S1bca and I(A, b)= 1 = I(C, c). By Lemma 2.2, I(B, b)= 1= I(D, c). So, I(B H D, a) = 1. Then, the result follows by Lemma 2.2. 

Key Notions for Completeness
Completeness is established by the usual way. For any non-theorem A, we design a canonical interpretation which refutes A. Most of techniques come from [6] (Chapter 4) and [3] (Chapter 8). In this section, we give some notions for any logic L in this paper.
First, where V and U are sets of formulas:
(1) ▶L A iff A is a theorem of L.
U is L-derivable from V , written V ▶L U , iff for some A1, ..., An in V and some B1, ..., Bm in U , ▶L A1 Λ ... Λ An → B1 V ... V Bm.
An L-derivation of A from V , written V ▶L A, is a finite sequence of formulas
A1, ..., An, with An = A such that each member of the sequence either belongs to
V or is obtained from predecessors in the sequence by adjunction or a provable
L-implication (i.e. in the latter case Ai is obtained from Aj since ▶L Aj → Ai).
An L-derivation of U from V is an L-derivation of some disjunction B1 V
... V Bm of formulas B1, ..., Bm of U from V . Hence, U is L-derivable from V iff there is an L-derivation of U from V .
If Σ is the set of all formulas of the language L, < V, U > is an L-maximal pair iff:
V ∪ U = Σ;
V bL U .
Please note that if < V, U > is an L-maximal pair, then V ∩ U = ∅.
Next, it can be noted that if a is a set of formulas, and b = Σ — a, where Σ is the set of all formulas of the language L, then a satisfies the following a1, a2, a3 separately iff b satisfies b1, b2, b3 separately.
a1. If ▶L A → B, then if A ∈ a then B ∈ a;
a2. if A ∈ a and B ∈ a then A Λ B ∈ a;

a3. if A V B ∈ a then A ∈ a or B ∈ a;
b1. if ▶L A → B, then if B ∈ b then A ∈ b;
b2. if A Λ B ∈ b then A ∈ b or B ∈ b;
b3. if A ∈ b and B ∈ b then A V B ∈ b.
Then we define, for arbitrary sets of formulas a, b:
a is an L-theory iff it satisfies a1 and a2;
an L-theory a is prime iff it satisfies a3;
an L-theory a is regular iff whenever ▶L A, A ∈ a;
a is an L-anti-dualtheory iff it satisfies a1 and a3;
an L-anti-dualtheory a is prime iff it satisfies a2;
b is an L-dualtheory iff it satisfies b1 and b3;
an L-dualtheory b is prime iff it satisfies b2.
So, let a be a set of formulas and b =Σ — a, then: a is a prime L-theory iff a is a prime L-anti-dualtheory iff b is a prime L-dualtheory; a is an L-anti-dualtheory iff b is an L-dualtheory.
In following text, if system L is obvious, then the subscript ‘L’ and the prefix ‘L-’ will simply be omitted.
Now, we define four operations as follows. For arbitrary sets of formulas a, b:
a ⊕ b = {B : EA ∈ b, A → B ∈ a};
a g b = {C : EA ∈ a, EB ∈ b, ▶L A H B → C};
a  b =Σ — {C : EA ∈/ a, EB ∈/ b, ▶L C → A H B}.
Based on the above definitions, we define three ternary relations R, S1, S2 on any set of sets of formulas:
Rabc iff a ⊕ b ⊆ c, i.e., for all A, B, if A → B ∈ a and A ∈ b, then B ∈ c;
S1abc iff a g b ⊆ c, i.e., for all A, B, if A ∈ a, B ∈ b, and ▶L A H B → C, then
C ∈ c;
S2abc iff c ⊆ a  b, i.e., for all A, B, if A ∈/ a, B ∈/ b, and ▶L C → A H B, then
C ∈/ c.

Lemmas about Prime Theories
Our results are based on some lemmas in [6]. First, we list several lemmas, which are proved in [6] (pp. 307-308), or easy to get.
Lemma 2.4 If < V, U > is an L-maximal pair, then V is a prime L-theory, and
U is a prime L-dualtheory.
Lemma 2.5 (Extension Lemma) Let V and U be sets of formulas such that
V bL U. Then there is an L-maximal pair < V ',U ' > with V ⊆ V ' and U ⊆ U '.
Lemma 2.6 (Priming Lemma 1) Let V be an L-theory, U be closed under dis- junction, and V ∩ U = ∅. Then there is an L-theory V ' such that (1) V ⊆ V '; (2) V ' ∩ U = ∅; and (3) V ' is prime.

Similar to the Priming Lemma 1, we have the Priming Lemma 2.
Lemma 2.7 (Priming Lemma 2) Let V be closed under conjunction, U be an L-dualtheory, and V ∩ U = ∅. Then there is an L-dualtheory U ' such that (1) U ⊆ U '; (2) V ∩ U ' = ∅; and (3) U ' is prime.
Proof. First, V bL U . Otherwise there would be A1, ..., An ∈ V such that A1 Λ
... Λ An ∈ V ∩ U , since U is an L-dualtheory. By Lemma 2.5, there are V ' ⊇ V
and U ' ⊇ U such that < V ',U ' > is an L-maximal pair. So, the result follows by Lemma 2.4.	 
The following corollary is proved in [6] (pp. 309).
Corollary 2.8 (Corollaries of Priming Lemma 1) 1. If A is a non-theorem of L then, there is a prime regular L-theory c such that A ∈/ c.
2. For all L-theories a, b', c' if Rab'c' and C ∈/ c' then, there are prime L-theories
b, c such that Rabc, b' ⊆ b and C ∈/ c.
Corollary 2.9 (Corollaries of Priming Lemma 1) 1. For all L-theories a',b and prime L-theory c, if S1a'bc then, there is a prime L-theory a such that a' ⊆ a and S1abc.
2. For all L-theories a, b' and prime L-theory c, if S1ab'c then, there is a prime
L-theory b such that b' ⊆ b and S1abc.
Proof. We only give proof for 1. The proof for 2 is similar.
Set U = {A : EB ∈ b, EC ∈/ c, ▶L A H B → C}. Then:
U is closed under disjunction;
a' is disjoint from U .
For (1), suppose A1, A2 ∈ U , then EB1, B2 ∈ b, and EC1, C2 ∈/ c, ▶L A1HB1 → C1
and ▶L A2 HB2 → C2. Since ▶L B1 ΛB2 → B1, by R4, ▶L A1 H(B1 ΛB2) → A1 HB1.
Then by R3, ▶L A1 H (B1 Λ B2) → C1. Similarly, ▶L A2 H (B1 Λ B2) → C2. So,
▶L (A1 H(B1 Λ B2))V (A2 H(B1 Λ B2)) → C1 V C2. Then, by A7, ▶L (A1 V A2)H(B1 Λ
B2) → (A1 H (B1 Λ B2)) V (A2 H (B1 Λ B2)). So, ▶L (A1 V A2) H (B1 Λ B2) → C1 V C2.
Since c is prime, C1VC2 ∈/ c. Since b is an L-theory, B1ΛB2 ∈ b. Hence, A1VA2 ∈ U ,
i.e. U is closed under disjunction.
For (2), suppose otherwise A ∈ U and A ∈ a'. Then for some B ∈ b, C ∈/ c,
▶L A H B → C. But S1a'bc, whence C ∈ c, giving a contradiction.
Hence by (1) and (2), Lemma 2.6 applies to provide a prime L-theory a disjoint from U with a' ⊆ a. Next, we prove S1abc. Suppose A ∈ a, B ∈ b and ▶L AHB → C. Since a is disjoint from U , C ∈ c, i.e., whenever A ∈ a, B ∈ b and ▶L A H B → C, then C ∈ c. Hence S1abc.	 
Corollary 2.10 (Corollaries of Priming Lemma 2) 1.  For all L-anti- dualtheories a',b and prime L-anti-dualtheory c, if S2a'bc then, there is a prime L-anti-dualtheory a such that a ⊆ a' and S2abc.
For all L-anti-dualtheories a, b' and prime L-anti-dualtheory c, if S2ab'c then, there is a prime L-anti-dualtheory b such that b ⊆ b' and S2abc.

Proof. We only give proof for 1. The proof for 2 is similar.
1. Set V = {A : EB ∈/ b, EC ∈ c, ▶L C → A H B}. Then:
V is closed under conjunction;
Σ — a' is disjoint from V .
For (1), suppose A1, A2 ∈ V , then EB1, B2 ∈/ b, and EC1, C2 ∈ c, ▶L C1 → A1HB1
and ▶L C2 → A2 HB2. Since ▶L B1 → B1 VB2, by R5, ▶L A1 HB1 → A1 H(B1 VB2).
Then by R3, ▶L C1 → A1 H (B1 V B2). Similarly, ▶L C2 → A2 H (B1 V B2). So,
▶L C1 ΛC2 → (A1 H(B1 VB2))Λ(A2 H(B1 VB2)). Then, by A8, ▶L (A1 H(B1 VB2))Λ
(A2 H (B1 V B2)) → (A1 Λ A2) H (B1 V B2). So, ▶L C1 Λ C2 → (A1 Λ A2) H (B1 V B2).
Since c is a prime L-anti-dualtheory, C1 Λ C2 ∈ c. Since b is an L-anti-dualtheory,
B1 V B2 ∈/ b. Hence, A1 Λ A2 ∈ V , i.e. V is closed under conjunction.
For (2), suppose otherwise A ∈ V and A ∈ Σ — a', i.e. A ∈/ a'. Then for some
B ∈/ b, C ∈ c, ▶L C → A H B. But S2a'bc, whence C ∈/ c, giving a contradiction.
Since a' is an L-anti-dualtheory, Σ — a' is an L-dualtheory. Hence by (1) and (2), Lemma 2.7 applies to provide a prime L-dualtheory a'' disjoint from V with Σ — a' ⊆ a''. Let a = Σ — a'', then a ⊆ a'. Since a'' is a prime L-dualtheory, a is a prime L-theory, i.e. prime L-anti-dualtheory. Next, we prove S2abc. Suppose A ∈/ a, i.e A ∈ a'', B ∈/ b and ▶L C → A H B. Since a'' is disjoint from V , C ∈/ c, i.e., whenever A ∈/ a, B ∈/ b and ▶L C → A H B, then C ∈/ c. Hence S2abc. 


Completeness
For any non-theorem A of B+

, by 1 of Corollary 2.8, there is a a prime reg-

ular B+
-theory gc such that A ∈/
gc.	Design a canonical model for B+ ,

< gc, Oc, Wc, R, S1, S2,I >, where Wc is the class of all prime theories, i.e. the class of all prime anti-dualtheories; Oc is defined as the subset of Wc such that a ∈ Oc if a is regular; R, S1 and S2 are defined as the above; for every prime theory a in Wc and propositional parameter p, I(p, a)=1 iff p ∈ a.
Theorem 2.11 If A is B+ -valid, then A is a theorem of B+ .
Proof. We prove the contrapositive. Given a non-theorem A, there is a canonical

model < gc, Oc, Wc, R, S1, S2,I > for B+
. We show it is really a B+
-model. It

suffices to show that p1-5 hold, and I satisfies the Atomic Hereditary Condition.
Now, p1 and Atomic Hereditary Condition are immediate by definitions. By the same proof in [6] (pp. 312), it can be proved a ≤ b iff a ⊆ b. So, we get p2. And, p3-5 are established by definitions of R, S1 and S2. Hence, the canonical model is
+ -model.
Next, we show that for every world a and formula A, I(A, a) = 1 iff A ∈ a. It follows that A is not valid on < gc, Oc, Wc, R, S1, S2,I >, and hence that A is not
+ -valid. The proof is by induction on the complexity of the formulas. The cases
for Λ and V are proved by definitions of theory and prime theory. Here, we give proofs for →, H and H.
→. Suppose A → B ∈ a, to show I(A → B, a) = 1. Using the induction hypothesis and the definition of R, it follows that for all b, c ∈ Wc, if Rabc and

I(A, b)= 1 then I(B, c) = 1. Hence, I(A → B, a) = 1 by the evaluation rule for →.
For the converse, suppose A → B ∈/ a, to show I(A → B, a) /= 1. By the
induction hypothesis and the evaluation rule for →, it suffices to find b, c ∈ Wc such that Rabc, A ∈ b and B ∈/ c. Define b' = {C :▶ A → C} and c' = {D : EC ∈ b',C → D ∈ a}. Then b' is a theory by R1, R2, R3, and A5. To show c' is a theory, suppose ▶ D → E and D ∈ c'. So, ▶ (C → D) → (C → E). Since C → D ∈ a, C → E ∈ a. Hence, E ∈ c'. Suppose further D1, D2 ∈ c', i.e. for some C1, C2 ∈ b', C1 → D1, C2 → D2 ∈ a. Since ▶ A → C1 and ▶ A → C2, using R3 it follows that A → D1,A → D2 ∈ a. So A → D1 Λ D2 ∈ a by A5, i.e. D1 Λ D2 ∈ c'. It follows
that c' is a theory. By the definition of R, Rab'c'. Further A ∈ b', but B ∈/ c'.
Suppose otherwise, B ∈ c', then for some C ∈ b', i.e. ▶ A → C, C → B ∈ a. Hence
▶ (C → B) → (A → B). So, A → B ∈ a, contradicting assumptions. Applying Corollary 2.8, there are prime theories b, c such that Rabc, A ∈ b' ⊆ b and B ∈/ c.
H. Suppose A H B ∈ a, to show I(A H B, a) = 1, i.e. for some b, c ∈ Wc, S1bca, I(A, b)= 1 = I(B, c). By the induction hypothesis, it suffices to find b, c ∈ Wc such that bgc ⊆ a, A ∈ b and B ∈ c. Define b' = {C :▶ A → C} and c' = {D :▶ B → D}. Then b' and c' are theories by R1, R2, R3, and A5. It is immediate that A ∈ b' and B ∈ c'. To show b' g c' ⊆ a, suppose E ∈ b' g c', then for some C ∈ b' and D ∈ c', ▶ C H D → E. Since ▶ A → C and ▶ B → D, by R4, ▶ A H B → C H D. By R3, ▶ A H B → E. Since A H B ∈ a, E ∈ a. Accordingly, b' g c' ⊆ a, i.e. S1b'c'a. So, by Corollary 2.9, b' can be primed to b with b' ⊆ b, and c' can be primed to c with c' ⊆ c such that S1bca.
For the converse, suppose I(A H B, a) = 1, i.e. for some b, c ∈ Wc, S1bca, I(A, b) = 1 = I(B, c). Then using the induction hypothesis, it follows that A ∈ b and B ∈ c. By A1, and the definition of g, A H B ∈ b g c. Hence A H B ∈ a.
H. Suppose I(A H B, a) /= 1, i.e. for some b, c ∈ Wc, S2bca, I(A, b) /= 1 and I(B, c) /= 1. Then using the induction hypothesis, it follows that A ∈/ b and B ∈/ c. By A1, and the definition of  , A H B ∈/ b  c. Hence, A H B ∈/ a.
For the converse, suppose A H B ∈/ a, to show I(A H B, a) /= 1, i.e. for some
b, c ∈ Wc, S2bca, I(A, b) /= 1 and I(B, c) /= 1.  By the induction hypothesis,
it suffices to find b, c ∈ Wc such that a ⊆ b  c, A ∈/ b and B ∈/ c.	Define
b' = Σ — {C :▶ C → A} and c' = Σ — {D :▶ D → B}. Then {C :▶ C → A} and
{D :▶ D → B} are dualtheories by R1, R2, R3, and A6. So, b' and c' are anti- dualtheories. It is immediate that A ∈/ b' and B ∈/ c'. To show a ⊆ b'  c', suppose F ∈/ b'  c', then for some C ∈/ b', D ∈/ c', ▶ F → C H D. Since C ∈/ b', ▶ C → A, and since D ∈/ c', ▶ D → B. By R5, ▶ C H D → A H B. Since ▶ F → C H D, by R3, ▶ F → A H B. A H B ∈/ a, so F ∈/ a as required. Hence, a ⊆ b'  c', i.e. S2b'c'a. So, by Corollary 2.10, b' can be primed to b with b ⊆ b', and c' can be primed to c with c ⊆ c' such that S2bca.	 
Now, we can see that B+ is a conservative extension of B+, in the sense that it
is an extension by adding new notations (H,H), axioms (A7,A8) and rules (R4,R5), which has the following feature: let A be a formula in the notation of B+; then if A
is provable in B+ , then A is also provable in B+ [1], since every B+ -valid formula
A involving only connectives →, Λ and V is also B+-valid.

Actually, further features of H and H such as commutativity and associativity

can be obtained by adding axiom or rule schemes to B+
. Also, we can introduce

A ◦ B → C e A → (B → C), which makes → a residual of H, such that S1 collapses to R. We leave this topic for further discussion.




Negation


For basic negation-extension of B+ A9	ч(A Λ B) — чA V чB
A10	чA Λ чB — ч(A V B)
R6	A → B ⇒ чB → чA.
, we add De Morgan Laws and contraposition:

We call this system BMHH. Please note that A9 and A10 also contain redundan- cies. By contraposition and positive axioms, we can prove each of A9 and A10 in one direction.
A BMHH-frame is a 7-tuple < g, O, W, R, S1, S2, ∗ >, where ∗ is a one-place function from W to W , and the other elements are as before, such that postulate p6 holds for all a, b ∈ W :
p6. If a ≤ b then b∗ ≤ a∗,
which is necessary for the Hereditary Condition.
A  BMHH-model  is  a  8-tuple  <  g, O, W, R, S1, S2, ∗,I  >,  where  < g, O, W, R, S1, S2, ∗ > is a BMHH-frame, and I is as before, with the following evaluation rule for negation:
I(чA, a)=1 iff I(A, a∗) /= 1.
BMHH is sound with respect to the evaluation rule. For completeness, define ∗ on a set of formulas a as: a∗ = {A|чA ∈/ a}. Given a non-theorem A, the canonical interpretation for BMHH is now < gc, Oc, Wc, R, S1, S2, ∗,I >. By De Morgan Laws and contraposition, it can be shown that: if a is an anti-dualtheory, then a∗ is a theory; if a is a theory, then a∗ is an anti-dualtheory. (For details of proof, please consult [4].) Hence, if a is a prime theory, so is a∗, i.e. ∗ is well-defined. Also, by the definition of a∗, p6 is easy to verify.
The system BHH is obtained by adding Double Negation, A — ччA to BMHH. A BHH-model is a BMHH-model satisfying: for all a ∈ W , a∗∗ = a.
¿From the definitions of BMHH-model and BHH-model, we can see that BMHH
is a conservative extension of BM, and BHH is a conservative extension of B.
If A → (B → C) ⇒ (B → чAHC) and B → AHC ⇒ чA → (B → C) are added to BHH, we can get that S2 is dependent on R. Further, A H B — ч(A → чB) and A H B — (чA → B) can be established with some further axiom or rule schemes added.

Concluding Remarks
This paper considered a basic relevant logic B+

with intensional conjunction H and

disjunction H , and some of its negation-extensions. Kripke style semantics were given for these systems. Our semantics extend the traditional relational semantics for relevant logics in [6] by introducing ternary relations S1 and S2.
In fact, a wealth of stronger systems can be obtained by adding axioms or rules to these basic systems in this paper. We will consider a range of axiom and rule schemes, and give the corresponding semantical postulates for these schemes in another draft.
