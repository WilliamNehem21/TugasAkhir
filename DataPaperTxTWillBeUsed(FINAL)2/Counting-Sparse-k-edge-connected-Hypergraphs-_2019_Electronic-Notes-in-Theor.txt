Introduction
Finding closed formulæ for the number of combinatorial structures with some de- sired properties is a fundamental problem in Combinatorics. It has a long history of interesting results and a great variety of techniques has been applied to it. For example, the problem of counting graphs with some desired property (e.g. connect- edness) has been approached with generating functions, algebraic tools, probabilistic methods, among others (see [9,6,8,7]).
Probabilistic methods have been used with great success to obtain asymptotic formulæ since many enumeration problems are related to computing probabilities in a suitable random model. For example, the problem of counting some classes graphs has been investigated by a number of authors using probabilistic methods [14,15,11]. Pittel and Wormald [14] studied the problem of counting graphs with minimum degree at least k with given number of vertices and edges. In the random model they used, when the degree sequences restricted to a set of “relevant” degree sequences, the graphs had high probability of being k-connected for k ≥ 3. This can be used to show that the formula obtained was also an asymptotic formula for the number of k-connected graphs with given number of vertices and edges. Interestingly, for k = 2, this was not the case since in a sparse regimen even with all degrees at least 2, the random graph has isolated cycles asymptotically almost surely (which we abbreviate by a.a.s. from now on). This case has been addressed in a paper by the fourth author with Kemkes and Wormald [10].
It is then quite natural to address the same enumeration problems for hyper- graphs. Intuitively, one would expect that the problems would get much more difficult as this is the case with many graphs problems when generalized to hyper- graphs. It is certainly the case for the problem of finding an asymptotic formula for the number of connected r-uniform hypergraphs with given number of vertices and edges (see [5,1,4,3]).
In this paper, we investigate the problem of counting k-edge-connected r-uniform hypergraphs with given number of vertices and edges where k ≥ 2 and r ≥ 3 are fixed constants. We will also include the proofs of the case r = 2 and k ≥ 3 for completeness. We use similar techniques used by Pittel and Wormald [14] and L- uczak [12]. We make use of many facts proved by Pittel and Wormald [14].

Results
An r-uniform hypergraph is a pair H = (V, E), where V is a finite set and E ⊆ "V 
(where "V  is the set of subsets of V of size r).

An r-uniform hypergraph H = (V, E) is connected if there is no proper nonempty S ⊂ V with no edge intersecting both S and V \ S. We say that H is k-edge- connected if there is no set F ⊂ E with |F | < k such that (V, E\F ) is not connected. Let Cr,k(n, m) denote the number of k-edge-connected r-uniform hypergraphs with vertex-set [n]= {1,..., n} and m edges. The main contribution of this paper is an asymptotic formula for Cr,k(n, m) in the range as follows.

Let H(d) be the random multi-hypergraph with degree sequence d presented in Section 2. The degree of a vertex v is the number of edges containing v. A crucial

step in our proof is to show that H(d) is k-edge-connected a.a.s., for d ∈ Dj
(n, m),

where Dj  (n, m) is defined in (6).
Theorem 1.2 Let r ≥ 2 and k ≥ 2 be constants such that k ≥ 3 if r = 2. Uniformly
for d ∈ Dj  (n, m), we have that H(d) is k-edge-connected a.a.s.
We only consider the range m = O(n log n) since above this range random
r-uniform hypergraphs generated uniformly at random with m edges are k-edge-

connected a.a.s. and so an asymptotic formula would simply be all r-uniform hypergraphs with vertex-set [n] and m edges.

Organization of the paper
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the random model used in the proof and show some of its properties. In Section 3, we present

an outline with the main steps of the proof of Theorem 1.1. In Section 4, we present an overview of the proof of Theorem 1.2.

Random model
In this section, we introduce the random model for r-uniform hypergraphs that we will use throughout the paper.
Definition 2.1 Let Dr,k(n, m) = {d ∈ Nn : di ≥ k ∀i  i di = rm}. Let d ∈ Dr,k(n, m) and let H(d) denote the random multi-hypergraph obtained from the following procedure.
Step 1: Let V1, V2,..., Vn be disjoint sets such that |Vi| = di for every i ∈ [n]. Let V =  i∈[n] Vi. The sets V1,..., Vn are called vertex-bins. The elements in V are called points.
Step 2: Let E1,..., Em be disjoint sets (also disjoint from V) each of size r. Let E = j∈[m] Ej. The sets E1,..., Em are called edge-bins. The elements in E are also called points.
Step 3: Let M be a perfect matching obtained uniformly at random from the perfect matchings in the bipartite graph with classes (V, E ).
Step 4: Let H(d) denote the multi-hypergraph with vertex-set [n] such that, for each Ej, we include an edge ej so that for each uw with u ∈ Ej and w ∈ Vi, we include i ∈ ej (with multiplicities).

Remark: The model above can generate hypergraphs with loops (edges containing the same vertex more than once) and multiple edges (repeated edges), which is why we use the term multi-hypergraph. But our interest in this paper is restricted to simple hypergraphs.

This model is a simple extension of the configuration model (also known as pair- ing model) for generating multigraphs with a given degree sequence. One important property of H(d) is that simple hypergraphs are generated by the same number of matchings.
Proposition 2.2 Let H be a simple hypergraph with degree sequence d, there are
exactly m!r!m  n	di! choices for matchings in Step 3 that generate H in Step 4.
This implies that by conditioning H(d) to simple hypergraphs we obtain a uniform probability space on the r-uniform hypergraphs with degree sequence d.
It is then important to have an estimate for the probability of obtaining a simple
hypergraph. We define Dj  (n, m) in (6) so that we can easily apply the following
result by Blinovsky and Greenhill [2] for hypergraphs and by McKay [13] for graphs,
which we re-state in terms of probabilities (instead of the original enumeration statements).

Let η(d)= (1/m) Σn
"di .


Theorem 2.3 (Blinovsky and Greenhill [2]) Let r	3 be a ﬁxed integer. Sup- pose that d ∈ Nn is such that Σi di = rm for m ∈ N, 2 ≤ maxi di = o(m1/3) and

m → ∞. Then
P[H(d) is simple ] ∼ exp
 − (r − 1)η(d)

Theorem 2.4 (McKay [13]) Suppose that d ∈ Nn is such that	i di = 2m for
m ∈ N, 2 ≤ maxi di = o(m1/4) and m → ∞. Then

Outline of the proof
As we mentioned in the introduction, our approach is similar to Pittel and Wormald [14]’s approach to obtain an asymptotic formula for the number of graphs with minimum degree at least k. First they compute the probability that a graph generated by the configuration model is simple for a restricted set of degree sequences. Here we use Dr,k(n, m) to denote such set and we call is the set of critical degree sequences (in
the sense, that we will be able to ignore the degree sequences not in Dj  (n, m)).
Pittel and Wormald use the truncated Poisson distribution Poisson(λ, k) defined
by

where

Let Y = (Y1,..., Yn) be such that Y1,..., Yn are independent random variables

with distribution Poisson(λ, k). Note that, given d ∈ Dr,k(n, m),


	λdi

λrm

 

	 

which has the term   n	di! in common with the number of matchings generating
a single hypergraph in Proposition 2.2.
Let Σ denote the event that ΣY1,...,Ym Yi = rm. Let
fk(λ)n
Qr,k(n, m)=	λrm  P[Σ].
Then, similarly as in Pittel and Wormald [14, Equation (13)], let U (d) denote the probability that H(d) is k-edge-connected and simple. We have that
Σ		(rm)!	

Cr,k(n, m)=

P[Y = d | Σ] U (d)

= r!m Qr,k(n, m)E [U (Y) | Σ] .
Hence, in order to obtain an asymptotic formula for Cr,k(n, m) it suffices to precisely estimate E[U (Y) | Σ] and P[Σ]. This simple “trick” allows us to ignore some degree sequences that would be very rare when considering the distribution of Y since they
would have negligible effect on the expectation. We defined Dj  (n, m) so that the
degree sequences outside it are those rare degree sequences.
Note that Equation (4) works for any λ > 0, but we choose λ so that it maximizes
P[Σ]. Also note that if Y has distribution Poisson(λ, k), then
EY = λfk—1(λ) .
fk(λ)
Let c = rm/n and define λc as the root for the equation
λfk—1(λ) = c. fk(λ)
Its existence and many properties have been proved by Pittel and Wormald [14]. Let
η = λcfk—2(λc) .	(5)
c	fk—1(λc)

Recall that η(d) = (1/m) Σn	"di . It is not hard to show that E[η(Y )] = ηc.
We can then define Dj  (n, m) so that η(Y ) ∼ ηc very sharply. For ε ∈ (0, 1/2),

define

Dr,k


(n, m)= d ∈ Dr,k(n, m): max di ≤ 6C log n, |η(d) − ηc|≤ n—1/2+ε .	(6)



Then it is not hard to show that

P[Y /∈ Dj (n, m)] ≤


exp( Θ(log n)3)
P[Σ]	.	(7)

Thus, for d ∈ Dj  (n, m), assuming Theorem 1.2, we have that U (d) ∼ exp(−(r −
1)ηc/r − 1r=2η2/4), where 1r=2 = 1 if r = 2, and 1r=2 = 0 otherwise. For d /∈
Dr,k(n, m), we use U (d) ≤ 1 since it is a probability. Thus,

To finish the proof, we use the following result by Pittel and Wormald that computes P[Σ] (stated in our scenario):

R → ∞, then



If R = O(n2/5), then

which gives the desired asymptotic formula by subbing in the values for P[Σ] (ob- tained in Theorem 3.1) in Qr,k(n, m).

Overview of the proof of Theorem 1.2
We will follow the same strategy used by L- uczak [12] for the graph case. We will show that, a.a.s., there is no set of edges of size k − 1 that disconnects the random multigraph. The two main lemmas are the following: the first one bounds the number of induced edges in small sets of vertices and the second one bounds the probability that a large set has less than k edges crossing to its complement.
Lemma 4.1 Let ε > 0 and let D > 0 be ﬁxed constants. A.a.s., there is no set
S ⊆ [n] of size r ≤ s ≤ D log n with at least (1 + ε)s/(r − 1) induced edges.
Lemma 4.2 Let Dj > 0 be a ﬁxed constant. A.a.s., there is no set S ⊆ [n] of size
Dj log n ≤ s ≤ n − Dj log n with less than k edges intersecting both S and [n] \ S.
Now we show how to prove Theorem 1.2. It suffices to show that, a.a.s., there is no nonempty proper subset S ⊆ [n] such that there exists a set of edges R of size
|R| < k such that R is a minimal edge-cut for S (that is, R is a minimal set such that by removing R the set S becomes disconnected from [n] \ S). Note that, for
|S| < r, this follows immediately from the fact that the minimum degree of a vertex is at least k. Thus, each edge with vertices in |S| has at least one vertex outside S and so there are at least k such edges.
If |S| > D log n, our claim follows immediately from Lemma 4.2. Note that, for the case r = 2 and |S| = 2, since the minimum degree is at least k, we have that there are at least 2k − 1 ≥ k edges in the edge-cut of S.
Now assume r ≤ |S| ≤ D log n for r ≥ 3 and assume r +1 ≤ |S| ≤ D log n for r = 2. Let S = S ∪  e∈R e. Suppose R is a minimal edge-cut for S. Then each edge in R must intersect both S and its complement [n]. Let T denote the number of points in R matched to points outside S. Then,
|R|≤ |T|≤ (r − 1)(k − 1)	and	|S |≤ |S| + |T |.	(8) The number of edges induced by Sj is then at least (k|S| + |T |)/r. It is straight-
forward, by computing derivatives, to prove that, for ε = 1/(5r),

k|S| + |T| r
(1 + ε) Sj
,	(9)
r − 1

which contradicts Lemma 4.1. Thus, there is no such R a.a.s., and so, Theorem 1.2 holds.
We present the proof for Lemma 4.1 and omit the proof of Lemma 4.2 since their proofs follow the same strategy.
Proof of Lemma 4.1
Let S ⊆ [n] with s := |S|. Let VS be the set of points in vertex-bins corresponding to vertices in S and recall that V is the set of all points in vertex-bins. Let PS = |VS| and P = |V|. Note that P ≥ kn since each vertex-bin has at least k points and PS ≤ Δs.

Using the union bound, the probability that it induces at least l = l(s) := (1 + ε)s/(r − 1) edges is at most


 m  PS  (rl)!(P − rl)!


	
 m r l—1 PS − i


	
 m  PS  rl


	
 m  Δs rl


	


where "m is the number of ways of choosing the induced edges, "PS is the number
of ways of choosing points in S to be matched to these induced edges, (rl)! is the number of matchings between these chosen points, (P − rl)! is the number of matchings between the remaining points and P ! is the total number of matchings; for the last inequality we use P = rm and PS ≤ Δs.
Summing this value over all subsets S with size between r and D log n, the probability that there is a set of size s inducing l(s) edges is at most
