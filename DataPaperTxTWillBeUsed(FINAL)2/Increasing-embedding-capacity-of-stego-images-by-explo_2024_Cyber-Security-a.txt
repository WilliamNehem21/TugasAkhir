In the field of data concealing, edge detection techniques are frequently employed, particularly for improving image quality and data security. These methods, however, have a lower embedding capacity. In order to take advantage of more edge pixels, many strategies are used nowadays. These schemes either combine the output from multiple edge detectors or enlarge the edges of an edge image by dilating. Even so, if the amount of data is vast, the techniques might not be able to conceal all of it. Therefore, a novel strategy for edge exploitation is still needed to regulate the effectiveness of edge detection-based data-hiding strategies. By using edge detectors in the prediction error space, we utilized more edge pixels in this study (PES). Applying a predictor on the cover image and then calculating the prediction errors, we prepared the PES. The edges in PES were then marked using the edge detector. The edge-error corresponding pixels received more information than the relevant pixels that

Additionally, we combined the results from different edge detectors to produce edge pixels and 𝑦 number of bits in non-edge pixels where 𝑥 > 𝑦. The simulation results show that the proposed
scheme outperforms its rivals on all performance-measuring criteria, including payload, stego image quality, and resistance to attack.





Introduction

Security is an essential part of data communications. There are many techniques in the literature that are currently being used for securing the data. The premier one is cryptography. A cryptography method encrypts the secret messages into an unintelligible format, known as ciphertext, to prevent intruders from realizing the meaning of it [1]. Such meaningless random content in a message, in fact, makes the in- truder curious and deeply attentive to look for some hidden meaning in it. Watermarking is another way of securing the message [2]. How- ever, that technique is mainly used for serving data integrity. Addition- ally, some watermarking methods remain their masks visible on the cover media. Due to those limitations, steganography has taken a firm stand in the field of secured communication. Steganography is a pro- cess of hiding data in a cover media, e.g., image, audio, video, text, bio-signals, DNA sequence, etc. [3]. Among these media, images are gaining popularity as a cover media for their higher degree of informa- tion redundancy and flexible size for communication over the Internet [4]. In steganography, an embedding technique implants secrets in a cover media. The modified media is called stego media. That stego me- dia is then sent to a destination. The destination end applies an exact de-

embedding algorithm to extract the secrets from it. Some de-embedding algorithms, additionally, generate the cover media from the stego one [5–17]. Therefore, all of these methods can be divided into reversible or irreversible depending on their ability to build cover media from stego one.
Intruders can even check if there is something secret in it. In that case, they deal with the possibility of changing cover contents. Such analyses are known as steganalysis techniques [18]. With these consid- erations in mind, the performance of steganography is evaluated with the ability to increase the data hiding rate, decrease the distortion rate of the carrier and resist attacks.
There are diverse techniques for hiding information in image con- tent. A major part of such algorithms applies edge detection methods [1,2,19–32], as a part of their embedding technique. These schemes find edge and non-edge pixels first and then embed more bits in edge pixels than non-edge ones; because the human visual system is less sensitive to changes in sharp areas of images compared to smooth areas. Such methodology is very useful in yielding both better stego quality and higher data security. However, the embedding capacity depends more on the number of identified edge pixels. The embedding capacity goes high when the number of edge pixels is large.

In 2016, Lee et al. [19] proposed a reversible data hiding method based on reduplicated exploiting modification, image interpolation, and canny edge detection. To enhance the image quality, Kumar et al.
[20] proposed a steganography system with fuzzy edge identification and least significant bit (LSB) substitution methods in 2018. S. Sun in 2015 showed another post-processing technique to improve the visual quality of stego images [21]. He applied Huffman encoding to Canny- detected edge pixels to measure the number of bits that could be im- planted in each pixel. The method next used a correction method for increasing the visual quality of their stego image. Vanmathi and Prabu in 2017 employed fuzzy logic edge detection method for detecting edge pixels. The authors applied a chaotic method for encrypting messages and the LSB substitution technique for implanting those in edge pix- els [22]. G. Swain in 2015 adopted a pixel value difference policy to enhance data security [23]. Uses of Canny, Sobel, and fuzzy as edge de- tection were compared in [24] in 2017 by Bai et al.. Setiadi in 2022
[25] increased the number of edge pixels by applying morphological operator dilation on edge image owing to improve the edge pixels and thus, the embedding capacity. The author also applied hybrid edge de- tectors for the same purpose. In addition to the edge detection tech- nique, Kusuuma et al. [26] in 2018 applied an encryption method for the secret message to strengthen the security of hidden data. Khan et al.
[27] in 2015 replaced four LSBs of detected edge pixels in their data hiding algorithm. That scheme, indeed, destroyed the image quality roughly. Again, Chen et al. [28] in 2010 combined the results of Canny and Fuzzy edge detectors to exploit more edge pixels. Tseng and Leng in 2014 [29] improved the distortion rate of [28] by working on im- age blocks rather than the whole image at a time. Link in [25], Gaurav and Ghanekar in 2018 [30] applied a dilation operator to increase the number of edge pixels. They implanted secret bits by applying bit-wise exclusive-OR (XOR) operation between the binaries of each edge pixel and a message chunk. Vishnu et al. in 2020 [31] also used the Canny edge detection method to identify the edge pixels. Next, they computed pixel value differences between each of the two consecutive edge pix- els reading in a sequential manner. That pixel value differences were used to implant secret bits in edge pixels. Sultana and Kamal in 2021
[32] employed multiple edge detectors and then measured the desired edge pixels for data hiding by doing a logical AND operation among the pixels of each of the same positions in edge images. That policy is ef- fective for getting better stego quality while the size of the demanded implantable message is small. Setiadi et al. in 2018 [32], combined the results of canny and sobel edge detectors to increase the number of edge pixels.
Studies in the state of the art reveal that edge detection-based em- bedding schemes suffer from less embedding capacity. Therefore, as the demand for data hiding increases, so does the challenge with the capa- bility of such schemes, because the number of edge pixels obtained in such a conventional way may be unable to conceive the demanded in- formation. Such good methods will then be ineffective. Our target is to
The key contributions of this research are as follows:
An image steganography approach has been proposed for eﬃcient data hiding on the edges of an image. We have applied edge detectors in prediction error space to increase the embedding capacity of the stego image which signifies the novelty of this research.
We have adapted the technique of combining the results of multiple edge detectors owing to increase the number of edge pixels, further. We have also made our scheme enable to concealment of a different number of bits in edge and non-edge pixels. Therefore, the proposed scheme increases both the embedding capacity and the visual quality of stego images. At the same time, it shows strong resistance against statistical attacks.
Throughout this manuscript, Section 2 discussed previous existing studies related to this manuscript. Section 3 presents the proposed method neatly. The simulated results of our scheme are demonstrated in Section 4. Section 4.6 is devoted to testing the robustness of the pro- posed scheme against attacks. Section 5 narrates the implications and limitations of our work. Finally, Section 6 draws a conclusion of the article.

Human visioning systems are sensitive to local changes. In the image, local changes are marked as edges. Edges in the image appear along ei- ther horizontal, vertical, or diagonal gradient directions. A filter, known as a kernel, is used to detect the edges in an image. Very commonly used edge detectors are Canny, Sobel, Log, Prewitt, Laplacian, and Fuzzy edge detectors. Now briefly describe those operators in the following:

Lawrence Roberts develops the Roberts edge detection (1965). It measures the 2-D spatial gradient of an image in a straightforward and quick manner.

This technique highlights areas of high spatial frequency, which fre- quently coincide with edges. The most common application of this approach is when both the input and the output are grayscale im- ages. The estimated full amplitude of the spatial gradient of the input image at each place in the output is represented by the pixel values at each location.

that the applied edge detector can detect more edge pixels. To get that, we applied a predictor on the image pixels. We have measured the pre- diction errors as well. In the prediction error space, we have applied the edge detector. That strategy noticeably increases the number of edge- forming errors in the error space. Corresponding positions of edge and non-edge errors in error space are noted. We have used that positional map to link to the image domain. That mapping is done to classify the image contents as edge and non-edge pixels. We then implant secrets in these pixels by embedding rules. That strategy boosts up the embedding capacity notably. Nevertheless, still, the scheme faces problems in hid- ing large volumes of data. We further try to increase the number of edge pixels by combining the edge images of multiple edge detectors. Exper- imental results deduce that the proposed method performs better than the other competing schemes, and shows a noticeable improvement in its capability of hiding more data.

LoG edge detection
A 2-D isotropic measurement of an image is the Laplacian of Gaus- sian. Laplacian, which is also utilized for edge detection, is the region of an image that is emphasized and experiences fast intensity vari- ations. To lessen the sensitivity of noise, the Laplacian is applied to an image that has been smoothed using a Gaussian smoothing filter. This operator creates a single grayscale image from a single grayscale image that is input. The input image is represented in Laplacian as a collection of discrete pixels. In order to approach the second deriva- tives in the definition, a discrete convolution kernel is discovered. The following are the top two kernels:

Generally, edge detectors are used in pattern recognition, image mor- phology, and feature extractions. In the field of image steganography, edge detectors are used to improve the security of hide data as well as to collect the data hiding features. These schemes first detect the edge and non-edge pixels in a cover image. Then these schemes either im- plant in edge pixels only or embed a different number of bits in edge and non-edge pixels. Bearing that in mind, we studied a good number of articles on that state of the art. Among those, we found the works of Junlan Baiet al. [24] and Setiadi D. R. I. M. [25] which were very close to our research objectives. As a result, we studied these two articles with deep attention and built the foundation of our proposed work on them. In 2017, Junlan Bai et al. [24] proposed a steganography approach based on the combination of edge detection and LSB substitution meth- ods. In their scheme, the authors first prove that if a few of the LSBs of image pixels are cleared and then an edge detector is applied on that

Thereafter, they formed stego image 𝐼𝑠 by implanting 𝑥-bits of information in detected edge pixels and 𝑦-bits of in- formation in non-edge pixels, where 𝑥 > 𝑦. At the extraction phase, their scheme again cleared 𝑛 bits of LSBs from stego pixels of 𝐼𝑠. That cleared image is, indeed, 𝐼𝑐 𝑙𝑟. Hence, the extraction phase feels no ambiguity to

The proposed work consists of three phases: pre-processing, data em- bedding, and data extracting. Our Initial phase of pre-processing is ex- plained in Section 3.1. Data embedding is present in Section 3.2 and

finally Section 3.3 goes over our extraction phase. Figs. 1 and 2 depict the overall proposed method.
Pre-processing phase

As our target is to implant more bits in edge pixels than the non- edges, both the data hider and the data extractor should detect and iden- tify the same set of edge pixels. To do that equally, a homogeneous field is required where both the data hider and data extractor can detect the same set of edge pixels. Previous works commonly applied their edge detectors in that homogeneous field. But, in that stage, our target is to apply a predictor on that homogeneous field and, thereafter, to compute the prediction errors. We would then want to compute edge pixels with the help of that prediction error space. These pre-processing tasks are shown in blocks of the first four levels of Fig. 1 Encoder.
Generating homogeneous field
Before starting that discussion, let the taken cover image is 𝐶 and an instance of it is 𝐼 . We first clear 𝑛-bits of LSBs from every pixel of
𝐼 . To explain the LSB clearing method, consider a pixel value at (𝑖, 𝑗)
location of 𝐼 , i.e., 𝐼 (𝑖, 𝑗), is 175. The binary conversion of that pixel
value is 01001011. Then, clearing 3 bits of LSBs from 01001011 will

𝐼 (𝑖, 𝑗) = 𝐼 (𝑖, 𝑗) − Ψ(𝐼 (𝑖, 𝑗), 2𝑛);	(9)
Thus, we compute all predicted values. Finally, the prediction errors and the absolute values of the prediction errors are calculated by Eqs. (13) and (14), respectively.
𝑝𝐸(𝑖, 𝑗) = 𝐼 (𝑖, 𝑗) − 𝑝(𝑖, 𝑗)	(13)

Edge image generation
We have applied 𝑚-number of ‘edge detection operators’, e.g., canny, sobel, fuzzy, Robert, Prewitt, log, etc., on 𝑝𝐸𝑎 to measure edge pixels,
separately. We have generated the edge image by Eq. (15).
𝑒𝐼 (𝑖) = 𝑓 (𝑝𝐸𝑎, Ω)	(15)
where Ω is one of the 𝑚 edge detection operators, i.e., Ω ∈ {𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑦,
𝑆𝑜𝑏𝑒𝑙, 𝐿𝑜𝑔,  𝐹 𝑢𝑧𝑧𝑦, 𝑅𝑜𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑡,  𝑃 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑖𝑡𝑡, 𝑒𝑡𝑐.},  1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑚  and  𝑓  returns  the edge image 𝑒𝐼 from 𝑝𝐸𝑎 for a specific edge detector Ω. Each edge image
is a binary image. For each pixel, the edge image holds a 0 or 1. A 1 in
image 𝑝𝐸𝑎 is in the detected edge. We consider that the edges in 𝑝𝐸𝑎 are edge image means the corresponding pixel (indeed, absolute error) of the edges of 𝐼 . The experiment reveals that the number of edge pixels in 𝑝𝐸𝑎 is more than that in 𝐼 for the same edge detector. Hence, the application of an edge detector in 𝑝𝐸𝑎 will provide us with more edge

edge detection-based scheme. Therefore, such an attempt will lead us
to our goal. To improve further, we have combined the detected edge results. To do that, we have applied logical OR operations among the
edge images. The OR image, i.e., resultant image 𝑟𝐼 (𝑖, 𝑗), is computed
by Eq. (16).
𝑟𝐼 (𝑖, 𝑗) = 𝑒𝐼 (1, 𝑖, 𝑗) ∨ 𝑒𝐼 (2, 𝑖, 𝑗) ∨…∨ 𝑒𝐼 (𝑚, 𝑖, 𝑗)	(16)

(15) we have computed edge image 𝑒𝐼 (𝑖) from 𝑝𝐸𝑎 for dif- ferent edge detectors Ω. Combining all edge images by Eq. (16), we form the resultant edge image 𝑟𝐼 . We have separated the edge pixels
𝑒𝑃 and their corresponding positions 𝑒𝑃 𝑃 in 𝐼 by Eq. (17). The same Eq. (17) helps us in finding non-edge pixels 𝑛𝑒𝑃 and their positions 𝑛𝑒𝑃 𝑃 in 𝐼 . Next from each of the edge-located pixels, i.e., from (𝑠, 𝑡), we have measured 𝑑𝑥, where 𝑑𝑥 = 𝑆(𝑠, 𝑡) − 𝐼 (𝑠, 𝑡). Similar way, from each of the non-edge located pixels, we have computed 𝑑𝑦 by 𝑑𝑦 = 𝑆(𝑢, 𝑣) − 𝐼 (𝑢, 𝑣). Here, 𝑠, 𝑡, 𝑢, 𝑣, 𝑖, and 𝑗 are defined in the immediate previous subsection.
Next, we have extracted the binaries of the secret by Eq. (19).

Result analysis

This Section is divided into several sub-sections. In Section 4.1 we go over the experimental setup with which our study is carried out. Section 4.4 discusses the mathematical representation of feature values. Later in Section 4.5 we analyze the complexity. Section 4.2 reveals our experimental results. Finally, Section 4.3 provides a clear discussion re- garding our findings.
We have investigated and compared the performance of the proposed scheme with the works of Bai et al. [24], Setiadi [25], Sultana et al.
[32] and Rasol et al. [34]. We first selected images for the experiment, set up our experiment, and then analyzed the results.

Experimental setup

We worked on MATLAB’s edition R(2017a) on Windows 7. The con- figuration of the laptop was comprised of an Intel (R) Core (TM) i5- 8500T CPU@ 2.10 GHz 2.11 GHz processor and RAM of 8.00 GB. We first collected 10 commonly used images, as shown in Fig. 3, as a stan- dard image dataset. We conducted all primary experiments on that stan- dard image dataset. To test our scheme in a large image dataset, we used the BOSS dataset [33]. The BOSS dataset consisted of 499 images. We
resized the images to 512 × 512 and converted the color to grayscale to
fit our program.
We developed two different programs for each of the proposed meth- ods, Bai et al., Setiadi D. R. I. M., Sultana et al. and Rasol et al. where one is for data implantation and the other is for retrieving the implanted
secrets from stegos. According to the algorithm, we cleared 𝑛 bits of LSBs

𝑆(𝑠, 𝑡) = 𝐼 (𝑠, 𝑡) + Φ(𝑏𝑥)

from the cover images. We then verified the schemes by implanting dif- ferent numbers of bits in edge and non-edge pixels, however, these are

That stego image 𝑆 is then sent to a receiver end. The receiver end next extracts the implanted secrets from 𝑆.

3.3. Extraction phase

The extraction phase undergoes necessary pre-processing tasks. The

ues. That prediction of pixel values is done by Eqs. (10) to (12). Again,
no more than 𝑛 bits in any way. The performance of the schemes is ver-
ified by several feature values, such as edge pixel generation capability,
embedding payload, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural simi- larity index matrix (SSIM), standard deviation, correlation coeﬃcient, entropy, cosine similarity, pixel difference histogram, and chi-square text, etc.

Experimental results

In order to distinguish between edge and non-edge pixels in the ex- periment, we initially employed Canny, Sobel, and Log edge detectors in one, three, and five LSBs cleared images. When given an input image, the Canny, Sobel, and Log-based edge detector functions of MATLAB return an edge image. Binary images are used for edges. Utilizing 10 input images as a starting point, Table 2 depicts the edge images that

Discussions on results

The primary objective of this research is to strengthen the data- hiding ability of our scheme in terms of implanted data amount. As we worked on edge detection-based data embedment arena and the pro- posed scheme implanted more bits in edge pixels than the non-edge ones, we gave emphasis to increasing the number of edge pixels. For this, we applied the edge detector algorithms in prediction error space. Experiments have shown that this method is quite effective. The results of Fig. 5 is a snap-shoot of our experiment that is done on Lena’s im- age. The figure is annotated with obtained edge pixels. Compared to

state-of-art, that number is about double in our scheme. For ten images of the standard dataset, the results are shown in detail in Fig. 5 and
Table 3. Table 3 states the results for 𝑛 = 5, where Fig. 5 depicts the
same for 𝑛 = 1, 𝑛 = 3 and 𝑛 = 5. Corresponding embedding capacities are
depicted in 6. The results of Figs. 5 and 6 and Table 3 confirm that all
edge detectors recognize more contents as edge contents in prediction error space.

Those results are summarised in Fig. 9 In all the im- ages, the proposed scheme provides dominating results over the other competing schemes. However, those depicted results were obtained for
(𝑥, 𝑦) = (4, 1) only. Table 4 represents the results for all combinations
of (𝑥, 𝑦), e.g., (𝑥, 𝑦) ∈ {(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}. Additionally,
this table also explains that the proposed scheme offers much more pay-
loads than the alternatives. That the proposed scheme considerably en- hances the embedding capacity is therefore validated.

𝑛𝑝𝑇 , respectively. Then the maximum achievable payload 𝑃 𝐿 is defined
by Eq. (20).
𝑃 𝐿 = 𝑒𝑝𝑇 × 𝑥 + 𝑛𝑝𝑇 × 𝑦	(20)
Sometimes, capacity is also measured to have a closer look at the per- formance of a scheme. Capacity means the number of implanted bits per
pixel. Embedding capacity, 𝐸𝐶, is measured by Eq. (21)
In Eq. (24), 𝜇𝑐 and 𝜎𝑐 are the mean and variance of pixel values in the cover image. Likewise cover, 𝜇𝑠 and 𝜎𝑠 are the same for the stego image. Again, 𝜎𝑐𝑠 is the co-variance between the cover and stego image. 𝐶1 and
𝐶2 are two constants. In experiment, we set 𝐶1 = 0.0001 and 𝐶2 = 0.0009
There are many methods of analyzing the security of a scheme. Very
simple but common ones are entropy measurement, analyzing correla- tion among the pixels, and checking the cosine similarity between the cover and stego image. The entropy is measured by Eq. (25).
𝐻 = −  𝑝𝑘 log2(𝑝𝑘)	(25)
𝑘
where, 𝑝𝑘 is the probability associated with gray value 𝑘 and 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 255.
In our experiment, we used the population correlation coeﬃcient.
Populations were measured from the pixel histogram. Population corre- lation is defined by Eq. (26).

While hiding data, maintaining image quality is a challenging issue. PSNR and SSIM are two commonly used image distortion measurement
where 𝜎𝑐 and 𝜎𝑠 are population standard deviations in cover 𝐶 and stego
𝑆. Again, 𝜎𝑐𝑠 is the co-variance between the cover and stego image.

When they are the same, the function 𝑓𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑆𝑖𝑚 provides the highest value, which is 1. 𝑓𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑆𝑖𝑚’s computed value depends on the tempering effect in image 𝑆. The more tempered in 𝑆, the smaller the value of

Analyzing the complexity

We compare the time complexity of different schemes by analyzing their execution time and compared with existing studies and result is shown in Table 4. In terms of completion time author Bai’s study outper- formed every other study. On average author’s proposed scheme require about 13.42 s [24]. Similar to Bai’s study, Sultana and Rasol’s proposed framework requires 13.43 and 13.52 s [32,34]. Setiadi’s study on the other hand requires 14.06 s [25]. On average, our suggested method consumes 14.67 s per image. Even though it ends up taking a little bit longer, it exceeds all previous research and yields significantly superior outcomes as a consequence. Thus this difference of 0.5–1 s can be over- looked.

Security analysis

We statistically analyzed our scheme to check its robustness against various attacks. We first measured the standard deviation of pixel values from their mean, separately, in cover and stego images. Let the standard
deviation in cover and stego image is 𝜎𝑐 and 𝜎𝑠. Next, we calculated
𝜌𝑆 𝐶 = 0 stands for no relationship between two images. Results of 𝜌𝑆 𝐶
are depicted in Fig. 11. Though the proposed method shows a lower
correlation value, its difference from others is insignificance. Rather, as
with others, it represents a higher correlation between cover and stego.
We measured the entropy values 𝐻 as well. We computed 𝐻 both
in cover and stego images. Next, we calculated their differences. That
difference value is zero for two identical images. Results are plotted in Fig. 12. The figure shows that none of the results are greater than 0.08, i.e., these are very small and close to zero. We also computed cosine similarities between cover and stego images. That value is 1 for two identical images and 0 for two fully mismatched images. The results are demonstrated in Fig. 13. The figure illustrates that all the values are greater than 0.999, which is very high. Besides, the values in all the schemes are very close to each other, where, the maximum variation is o.0008, i.e., 0.9998-0.999.
Thus, it can be deduced from the results of these experiments that our method is strong enough to protect against attacks on implanted data.
We used statistical tools of pixel difference histogram (PDH) to iden- tify the stego images. The PDH of the original images and corresponding stego images are shown in Figs. 14 and 15.
We also used another statistical tool of Chi-Square test for determin- ing the difference between stego and cover images. This test is used to find out whether a difference between two images is due to chance or a relationship between them. The experimental result of the Chi-square test is shown in Fig. 16.

Discussion

Using this research, it can secure both messages and communicating parties. No intruder can able to receive some beneficial information from the sending file during transmission. Besides Corporations government and law enforcement agencies can connect privately and communicate secretly.
Although this model has many advantages it also has some limi- tations. This model cannot work without edge detectors. This model consumes time when applying predictor and it is not a big matter. If a steganography approach generates someone to suspect the carrier medium, thus the model has been unsuccessful.

Conclusion

This research first time proposes the idea of grouping image pixels as edge and non-edge by applying an edge detector in its prediction er- ror space. The research first generates a prediction error space from a cover image and then applies a desired predictor in that created error space. The locations of detected edge errors are mapped in the cover image to classify edge and non-edge pixels. That strategy, significantly, increases the number of edge pixels. As the edge detection-based embed- ding schemes implant more bits in edge pixels than non-edge pixels, the same rules then well perform in the proposed method. The experimental results deduce that the scheme does not compromise the visual or struc- tural quality of the cover image more than the other competing schemes. Moreover, statistical analyses exhibit that the proposed scheme demon- strates stronger security against attacks. In the future, we hope to work on making the scheme reversible. At the same time, we would like to repeatedly embed an image with a back-and-forward strategy. In the back-and-forward strategy, we will increase the present values of pixels in the first cycle of data embedment and decrease the updated values in the second cycle of data embedment. Thus, we want to implant any length of the message in an image by managing its visual quality. In that case, managing the scheme’s reversibility is a pre-requisition. We also would like to work with other media such as audio, video, and text. We will apply this model for forensic or other security purposes.
