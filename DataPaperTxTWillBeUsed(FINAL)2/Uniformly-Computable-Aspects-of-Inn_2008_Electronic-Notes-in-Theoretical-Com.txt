Abstract
The theory of inner functions plays an important role in the study of bounded analytic functions. Inner functions are also very useful in applied mathematics. Two foundational results in this theory are Frostman’s Theorem and the Factorization Theorem. We give a uniformly computable version of Frostman’s Theorem. We then claim that the Factorization Theorem is not uniformly computably true. We then claim that for an inner function u, the Blaschke sum of u provides the exact amount of information necessary to compute the factorization of u. Along the way, we discuss some uniform computability results for Blaschke products. These results play a key role in the analysis of factorization. We also give some computability results concerning zeros and singularities of analytic functions. We use Type-Two Effectivity as our foundation.
Keywords: Computable analysis, complex analysis, bounded analytic functions.


Introduction
Let H∞(D) be the set of all bounded analytic functions from D into C. For f ∈
H∞(D), let
 f ∞= sup{|f (z)| : z ∈ D}.
A function u ∈ H∞(D) is inner if
lim |f (z)| = 1 
z→z0
for almost every z0 ∈ ∂D. It follows from the Factorization Theorem (Theorem 5.2) that if u is an inner function, then  u  ∞≤ 1.
A sequence {an}∞	of points in D − {0} is a Blaschke sequence if
∞
(1)	(1 − |an|) < ∞

The series in (1) is called the Blaschke sum of {an}∞ . The inequality in (1) is

called the Blaschke condition.
For every a ∈ D, let



ba(z) = 


|a| a − z
.

If A = {an}∞
, where an ∈ D − {0} for all n, then let

BA =	ban .

A Blaschke product is a product of the form zkBA(z). We let BA,k(z) = zkBA(z). If A is a Blaschke sequence, then the terms of A are precisely the zeros of BA, and the order of a zero is the number of times it is repeated in A. On the other hand, if A is not a Blaschke sequence, then BA is identically 0.
Let Dω be the set of all sequences {an}∞	such that an ∈ D for all n.
Two foundational results in the theory of inner functions are that inner functions can be estimated by Blaschke products (Frostman’s Theorem) and that every inner function can be written as a product of a Blaschke product and a singular function (the Factorization Theorem). Our chief results are that inner functions can be effectively estimated by Blaschke products, but that factorization of inner functions is not a computable operation. We use Type-Two Effectivity as developed in [12] as our foundation.
Once a function f has been shown to be non-computable, it is natural to ask which additional parameters are necessary for its computation. For example, in [13], it is shown that spectral decomposition of complex matrices is not computable, but that spectral decomposition is computable once the cardinality of the spectrum is given. We will also show that the Blaschke sum of an inner function, together with the order of the zero at zero (if there is any), provide the precise amount of information necessary to compute the factorization of the function. To make this more precise, we make some informal definitions. Suppose that f is a function that is not computable with respect to some selection of notations. We say that the parameter g(x) is sufficient for the computability of f if
(x, g(x)) '→ f (x)
is computable. If in addition,
(x, f (x)) '→ g(x)
is computable, then we say that the parameter g(x) is necessary for the computabil- ity of f .

Frostman’s Theorem
For a, z ∈ D with |a| < 1, let Ma(z) =  z−a . If u is an inner function, then Ma ◦ u
is called a Frostman shift of u.
For each closed K ⊆ D and each positive measure σ on K, let Uσ : D → D be

defined by the equation


Uσ(z) = 
K

log   1	 dσ(ζ).
|z − ζ|

Definition 2.1 Let F ⊆ D be closed. We say that F has zero capacity if for every positive measure on F , σ, with σ /= 0, Uσ is not bounded on any neighborhood of
F . Otherwise, we say that F has positive capacity. If U is an arbitrary subset of
D, then we say that U has positive capacity just in case it has a closed subset with positive capacity; otherwise, we say that it has zero capacity.
Every capacity zero set has measure zero. However, there are measure zero sets with positive capacity. For example, the Cantor middle-third set. See [11] or [5] for a thorough treatment of the topic of capacity.
We say that λf is a unit multiple of f if λ ∈ ∂D. 2 A proof of the following can
be found in [4]. It was originally proven in Otto Frostman’s dissertation [3].
Theorem 2.2 (Frostman’s Theorem) Let u be a non-constant inner function. Then, Ma ◦ u is a unit multiple of a Blaschke product for all a ∈ D except in a set of capacity zero.
The set of values of a for which Ma ◦ u is not a unit multiple of a Blaschke product is called the exception set of u. McLaughlin and Piranian have shown that a subset of D is an exception set for an inner function if and only if it is an Fσ set with capacity zero [8].
One easily verifies that

(2)
lim |z − Ma(z)| = 0.
a→0

We then obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 2.3 Let u be an inner function. Then, for each ϵ > 0 there is a unit multiple of a Blaschke product, λb, such that
 u − λb  ∞< ϵ.
For the sake of proving a uniformly computable version of Corollary 2.3, we will need a more explicit result than (2) which we derive now. Fix α, z ∈ D with |α| < 1. By a simple calculation, we obtain

z − Mα(z) = 
−αz2 + α
1 − αz  .

We now note that |1 − αz|≥ 1 − |α||z|. It then follows that
|z|2 +1 
|z − Mα(z)|≤ |α| 1 − |α||z|.
Fix ϵ > 0. It then follows from a simple calculation that
|z|2 +1	ϵ
|α| 1 − |α||z| < ϵ ⇔ |α| < |z|2 +1+ ϵ|z| .

2 In the literature on bounded analytic functions, it is customary to identify a Blaschke product with its unit multiples. However, as this potentially makes a difference in the information content, we can not afford this luxury.

The right side of the latter inequality is minimized on D when |z| = 1. It now follows that

(3)
|α| <	ϵ
2+ ϵ
⇒ |z − Mα
| < ϵ.

If u ∈ H∞(D), then for each r ∈ (0, 1) let

The following follows directly from Theorem II.2.4 of [4].
Theorem 2.4 Let u ∈ H∞(D), and suppose  u  ∞≤ 1. Then, the following are equivalent.
lim mu(r) = 0.
r→1
u is a unit multiple of a Blaschke product.
The following is a direct consequence of Corollary I.6.6 of [4].
Lemma 2.5 If u is an inner function, then mu is increasing.
We note that if u is an inner function, then

Denote the open disk with center α and radius r by Br(α).
We now state a uniformly computable version of Frostman’s Theorem. The proof will be given in a future paper.
Theorem 2.6 (Uniformly computable Frostman Theorem) There is a mul- tivalued function Ψ :⊆ H∞(D) × N → D that is ([ρ2 → ρ2], νN, ρ2)-computable and such that for every non-constant inner function u and every n ∈ N, Mα ◦u is a unit
multiple of a Blaschke product and  u − Mα ◦ u  ∞< 2−n for every α in the image of Ψ on u.
Some observations about zeros
If u ∈ H∞(D), and if {an}∞	is a sequence of points in D, then let us call {an}∞
a primary zero sequence of u if its terms are precisely the zeros of u and the number
of times each zero of u is repeated is its multiplicity. If {an}∞	contains precisely
the zeros of u that are not zero, and if the number of times each zero of u is repeated
is its multiplicity, then let us call {an}∞	a truncated zero sequence of u.
The following is a direct consequence of Theorem II.2.1 of [4].
Theorem 3.1 If u is an inner function with inﬁnitely many zeros, and if u is not identically zero, then its truncated zero sequences are Blaschke sequences.

Theorem 3.2 (Effective Removable Singularity Theorem) There is a ([ρ2 → ρ2]2, ρ2, [ρ2 → ρ2])-computable map E such that if f is an analytic function with domain D − {z0} for some z0 ∈ D, and if f has a removable singularity at z0, then E (f, z0) is the analytic function obtained from f by removing the singularity at z0.
Proof. Let fˆ be the function that results from f by removing the singularity at z0. We describe how to build a [ρ2 → ρ2]-name for fˆ from a [ρ2 → ρ2]-name of f , p0, and a ρ2-name of z0, p1. Given a ρ2-name of z ∈ D, begin reading down p and p0 simultaneously until w1 and w2 are found such that z, z0 ∈ I2(w2) or z0 ∈ I2(w1) and z ∈ I2(w2) and I2(w1)∩I2(w2) = ∅. In either case, z0 /∈ ∂I2(w2) and z ∈ I2(w2). Hence, by the Cauchy Integral Formula:

fˆ(z)=  1

=  1 
2πi



∂I2(w2)


∂I2(w2)
fˆ(α)
dα
α − z
 f (α)
dα
α − z

Since integration is a computable operator, it follows that we can compute a [ρ2 →
ρ2]-name of fˆ.	 
Lemma 3.3 There is a (θ<, ψ<, [ρ2]ω )-computable multivalued function Ψ such that if U ⊆ C is open, and if X ⊆ U is inﬁnite, discrete, and closed relative to U, then (U, X) ∈ dom(Ψ) and every sequence in the image of Ψ on (U, X) is a one-to-one enumeration of X.
Proof. This is basically shown in the proof of Lemma 3.3 of [7].	 
Let δ1 be as in Exercise 6.1.11 of [12].
Theorem 3.4 There is a (δ1, ψ<)-computable function F such that if f :⊆ C → C
is analytic (and hence has open domain), then F (f ) = f−1{0}.
Proof. This is essentially shown in the proof of Theorem 3.4 of [7].	 
Corollary 3.5 In Theorem 3.4, F is (δ1, ψ)-computable. Hence, if f :⊆ C → C is
δ1-computable and analytic, then its zero set is ψ-computable.
Proof. By reading down a δ1-name of f , we can determine which basic open sets are mapped into open sets which do not contain zero. Thus, F is (δ1, ψ>)-computable. 
The situation is quite different for continuous functions. See, for example, The- orem 6.3.2 of [12].
Theorem 3.6 There isa ([ρ2 → ρ2], [ρ2]ω )-computable multivalued function Ψ such that for every analytic function with domain D and with inﬁnitely many zeros (but not identically zero), u ∈ dom(Ψ) and every sequence in the image of Ψ on u is a primary zero sequence of u.

Proof. It follows from Lemma 3.3 and Theorem 3.4 that there is a ([ρ2 → ρ2], [ρ2]ω )- computable function Φ such that for every analytic f with domain D and with infinitely many zeros, the terms of Φ(f ) are precisely the zeros of f , and each zero appears exactly once in Φ(f ).

For each {bn}∞
∈ Dω, let Γ({bn}∞
) = b0. Thus, Γ is ([ρ2]ω, ρ2)-computable.

Now, let


where:
fˆ0 = f

Ψ(f ) = (Γ(Φ(fˆ0)), Γ(Φ(fˆ1)), Γ(Φ(fˆ2)),.. .)


fˆn+1

= E 
fˆn

z − Γ(Φ(fˆn))

, Γ(Φ(fˆn)) .

(Here, E is as in Theorem 3.2.) It follows that if f is analytic with domain D, and if f has infinitely many zeros (but is not identically zero), then each fˆn is defined and is analytic with domain D. It then follows that Ψ(f ) has the required properties. 

Uniform computability results for Blaschke products
The results of this section can be summarized as follows. Given a Blaschke sequence
A = {an}∞ , the following problems are computationally equivalent.
Computing BA.
Computing the Blaschke sum of A.
Computing BA(0).
That is, given A and any one of the above, we can compute the other two. Further-
more, from BA we can compute A. It follows that the data (A, Σ∞ (1 − |an|)) are
both necessary and sufficient to compute BA.
Theorem 4.1 The map


 {an}∞

is ([ρ2]ω, ρ, [ρ2 → ρ2])-computable. That is, there is a function Ψ ⊆: Dω × R →
H∞(D) that is ([ρ2]ω, ρ, [ρ2 → ρ2])-computable and such that if {an}∞	is a

Blaschke sequence, then

Ψ  {an}∞

ban .

Proof. This is essentially shown in the proof of Theorem 4.6 of [7].	 
We note that ban (0) = |an|. Hence, BA(0) is the product of the moduli of the terms of A.

Theorem 4.2 The map

is ([ρ2 → ρ2], [ρ2]ω, ρ)-computable. That is, there is a function Ψ ⊆: H∞(D) →

sequence, then

Proof. This follows from Theorem 3.6.	 
We note that Theorem 4.2 yields another way to prove Theorem 3.6 of [7].
Theorem 4.3 The map


 {an}∞


,
n=0


ban

(0)  '→
nΣ=0

(1 − |an|)

is ([ρ2]ω, ρ, ρ)-computable. That is, there is a computable function Ψ ⊆: Dω ×R → R
that is ([ρ2]ω, ρ, ρ)-computable and such that if {an}∞	is a Blaschke sequence, then


Ψ  {an}∞


,
n=0


ban

(0)  =
nΣ=0

(1 − |an|).

A proof will be given in a future paper.
Corollary 4.4 Suppose A = {an}∞	is a [ρ2]ω-computable Blaschke sequence.
Then, BA is [ρ2 → ρ2]-computable if and only if Σ∞ (1 − |an|) is a ρ-computable
real number.
Corollary 4.5 Suppose A = {an}∞	is a [ρ2]ω-computable Blaschke sequence.
Then, BA is [ρ2 → ρ2]-computable if and only if BA(0) is ρ-computable.
Corollary 4.6 Suppose A is a [ρ2]ω-computable Blaschke sequence. If BA maps ρ2-computable complex numbers to ρ2-computable complex numbers, then it is itself computable.
We note that the situation is quite different for power series. Namely, there is a power series with a computable sequence of coefficients that maps computable complex numbers to computable complex numbers yet is not computable (see, for example, [2]). (This answers a question posed by the referee of [7].)
Factorization
Definition 5.1 Let σ be a positive finite Borel measure on ∂D that is singular with respect to Lebesgue measure. For all z ∈ D, let


Q(z) = exp
⎧⎨−

π eiθ + z


iθ
dσ(θ)⎫⎬ .

e  − z
−π

The function Q : D → C is called a singular function.
Every singular function is an inner function. A singular function s has the following properties.
s(z) /= 0 for all z ∈ D.
|s(z)|≤ 1 for all z ∈ D.
s(0) is a positive real number.
The basic facts about singular functions may be found in [4] and [9]. Let σ be the measure on ∂D defined by the equation
σ(E) = ⎧ 1 if 1 ∈ E
⎩ 0 if 1 /∈ E

The resulting singular function is

z '→ exp  − 1+ z  .

We will use this function in the proof of Theorem 5.4.
The following is due to Smirnov [10].
Theorem 5.2 (Factorization Theorem) If u is an inner function, then there exist λ, b, s such that u = λbs, λ ∈ ∂D, b is a (possibly ﬁnite) Blaschke product, and s is a singular function.
See [4] or [9] for a proof. It follows that λ, b, s are unique. For, suppose u is an inner function and u has two such factorizations, λbs and λ0b0s0. Since these Blaschke products are completely determined by the zeros of u, it follows that b = b0. Hence, λs = λ0s0 except possibly at the zeros of u. However, since u is analytic, its zeros are isolated, and so by continuity we can conclude these functions are identical. Thus, λs(0) = λ0s0(0). Hence, |λ||s(0)| = |λ0||s0(0)|. But, |λ| = |λ0| = 1 and s(0), s0(0) > 0. It then follows that s(0) = s0(0). Hence, λ = λ0. Thus, s = s0.
We call b the Blaschke factor of u, and denote it by bu. We call s the singular factor of u, and denote it by su. We call λ the constant factor of u, and denote it by λu. If u is a unit multiple of a Blaschke product, then su ≡ 1. If u is a unit multiple of a singular function, then we define bu to be 1.
Throughout the rest of this section, the variable u ranges over inner functions that are not identically zero but have infinitely many zeros. Let us call the map u '→ (λu, bu, su) the factorization map. From now on, let us denote the Blaschke sum of a truncated zero sequence of u by Σu. (It clearly follows that all truncated zero sequences of such an inner function have the same Blaschke sum.) If u(0) = 0, then let ku denote the order of u’s zero at 0; otherwise, let ku = 0. Let us call the the operator u '→ Σu the Blaschke sum map.
Theorem 5.3 The map (u, Σu) '→ ku is ([ρ2 → ρ2], ρ, νN)-computable.
The proof will be given in a future paper.

Theorem 5.4 The factorization map is not ([ρ2 → ρ2], ρ2, [ρ2 → ρ2]2)-continuous and hence not ([ρ2 → ρ2], ρ2, [ρ2 → ρ2]2)-computable.
The proof will be given in a future paper.
The following theorem shows that the parameter Σu provides the exact amount of information necessary to make the factorization map computable.
Theorem 5.5	(i) The map
(u, Σu) '→ (λu, bu, su)
is ([ρ2 → ρ2], ρ, ρ2, [ρ2 → ρ2]2)-computable. That is, there is a map
Ψ :⊆ H∞(D) × ×R → D × H∞(D) × H∞(D)
such that Ψ is ([ρ2 → ρ2], ρ, ρ2, [ρ2 → ρ2]2)-computable, and if u is any inner function with inﬁnitely many zeros (but not identically zero), then (u, Σu) ∈ dom(Ψ) and Ψ(u, Σu) = (λu, bu, su).
(ii) The map
(λu, bu, su) '→ Σu
is (ρ2, [ρ2 → ρ2]2, ρ)-computable. That is, there is a map
Ψ :⊆ D × H∞(D) × H∞(D) → R
such that Ψ is (ρ2, [ρ2 → ρ2]2, ρ)-computable, and if u is any inner function with inﬁnitely many zeros (but not identically zero), then (λu, bu, su) ∈ dom(Ψ) and Ψ(λu, bu, su) = Σu.
The proof will be given in a future paper.
Corollary 5.6 The Blaschke sum map is not ([ρ2 → ρ2], νN, ρ)-continuous.
