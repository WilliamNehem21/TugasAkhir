Abstract
We endow the collection of ω-bifinite domains with the structure of a probability space, and we will show that in this space the collection of all universal domains has measure 1. For this, we present a probabilistic way to extend a finite partial order by one element. Applying this procedure iteratively, we obtain an infinite partial order. We show that, with probability 1, the cpo-completion of this infinite partial order is the universal homogeneous ω-bifinite domain. By alternating the probabilistic one-point extension with completion procedures we obtain almost surely the universal and homogeneous ω-algebraic lattice, ω-Scott domain, and ω-bifinite L-domain, respectively.
We also show that in the projective topology, the set of universal and homogeneous ω-bifinite domains is residual (i.e., comeagre), and we present an explicit number-theoretic construction of such a domain.
Keywords: domain theory, universal homogeneous domains, probabilistic systems, constructive mathematics, topological models


Introduction
In the theory of denotational semantics of programming languages, several authors established the existence of particular kinds of ’universal’ domains. Scott [23] pro- vided a universal domain for the class of all ω-algebraic lattices and showed that in this domain calculations can be handled by a calculus of retracts. Universal domains for the classes of all coherent, respectively bounded-complete, ω-algebraic domains were given by Plotkin [21] and Scott [24]. Gunter and Jung [15] and Droste and Go¨bel [7] described a systematic way of constructing universal - even saturated, or universal homogeneous - domains. Let us recall that a domain U of a class C of domains is called universal, if each other domain of C can be embedded (via an embedding-projection pair) into U , and U is homogeneous, if each isomorphism between two finite subdomains of U extends to an automorphism of U ; intuitively,

homogeneity means that U has the highest possible degree of structural symmetry. Such universal homogeneous domains are unique up to isomorphism.
For further results on various universal domains, see [16], [17], [15], [6], [9] and
[20].
In this paper, we will present a probabilistic construction of domains, and we will show that with probability 1 it will produce a universal homogeneous domain. More specifically, we will achieve this for four classes of domains: ω-algebraic lattices, ω- Scott domains (= bounded-complete ω-algebraic domains), ω-bifinite L-domains, and ω-bifinite domains.
Our construction of the universal and homogeneous ω-bifinite domain proceeds as follows. Note that any domain is uniquely determined by the structure of its subposet of compact elements. Since this set is countable, we can assume it to be the set N of natural numbers (with 1 below any element). We will then determine a partial order on N. For this, we proceed inductively. Assume we have obtained a partial order on the elements of {1, ..., n}, for some n ∈ N. In order to extend it to the set {1, ..., n + 1}, we only have to specify the order-relations between n +1 and i, for each element i ∈ {1, ..., n}. We will do this in a random way, subject only to few natural side-conditions that we stay inside our given class of domains and that {1, ..., n} becomes a subdomain of {1, ..., n + 1}. By induction, we thus obtain an order on N. Since each {1,... , n} will be a subdomain of the order on N, we can view our procedure as a construction of finite approximations of the order on N. Our main result states that its completion to a domain is, with probability 1, a universal and homogeneous bifinite domain.
To construct universal homogeneous domains in the classes of all ω-algebraic lat- tices, of all ω-Scott domains resp. of all ω-bifinite L-domains, we proceed in exactly the same way for extending the order structure from {1, ..., n} probabilistically to an order on {1, ..., n + 1}. However, in the next step we construct a completion of this poset to a lattice, Scott domain, resp. L-domain, in a deterministic way. This completion is finite, and now we apply again the probabilistic procedure to it to extend the order by one more element. By induction, we get our partial order on N, and we show that its cpo-completion is, with probability 1, a universal homogeneous algebraic lattice, Scott domain, resp. L-domain.
In fact, our probabilistic constructions will depend on a given sequence of pa- rameters. Our result shows that regardless of the choice of these parameters, with probability 1 we get the same universal homogeneous domain.
We will describe how to phrase our intuitively given construction more pre- cisely, i.e. how to construct the corresponding probability spaces. Our probabilistic extension of the order ≤n of {1, ..., n} to an order ≤n+1 on {1, ..., n + 1} essentially describes the conditional probability of obtaining ≤n+1 given ≤n. Hence we obtain in a natural way a projective system of finite discrete probability spaces, and its limit is the probability space of the constructed partial orders on N.
Scott [23] showed how to construct domains which embed, or which are even isomorphic to, their own function space; such domains give rise to weakly extensional (resp. extensional) models of the untyped λ-calculus, and the method is crucial

for constructing solutions of domain equations. As an immediate consequence of our results, it follows for each of the four classes of domains we consider that the collection of all those domains which embed their own function space has measure 1, whereas the collection of all domains which are isomorphic to their function space has measure 0.
In our second main result, we show that each of the four classes of ω-domains can be endowed with the structure of a complete metric space. There is a topological notion for a subset of such a space to be ”large” or to contain ”almost all” of the space. This is the notion of being residual, i.e. the complement of a meagre set. After describing the background, we show that in each of the four corresponding metric spaces, the subset of all universal homogeneous domains is residual, i.e. large in this topological sense.
Finally, we will present a simple inductive number-theoretic construction of the universal homogeneous bifinite domain. It will follow that our construction is ef- fective and that the order on each initial segment {1, ..., n} of N can be determined in time polynomial in n. In fact, this is the simplest construction of the universal homogeneous ω-bifinite domain known to us.
The investigation of universal structures dates back at least to Cantor [5] who showed that in the class of countable linear orders, the chain (Q, ≤) is universal. Clearly, (Q, ≤) is also homogeneous. Fra¨ıss´e [13] showed that the class of all count- able undirected graphs contains a universal homogeneous object (which is unique up to isomorphism). Erdo˝s and R´enyi [11] gave a probabilistic construction of countable graphs which, with probability 1, produces this universal homogeneous graph, therefore also called the random graph. This amazing result spurred much further research on such graphs and on probabilistic laws in finite model theory. In [8], the present authors gave a probabilistic construction of the universal homo- geneous countable partial order. For further results, see e.g. [2]. Recently, in [10] a probabilistic construction of universal homogeneous causal sets was given (these are partially ordered sets which have been proposed as a basic model for discrete space-time in quantum gravity). The present results show that also in the area of domain theory a probabilistic, hence intuitively ”chaotic”, construction leads to domains which are universal and carry maximal degree of symmetry.

Background
We first summarize our notation (which is mostly standard) for the convenience of the reader. Let (D, ≤) be a partially ordered set (a poset ). A non-empty subset A ⊆ D is called directed, if for any a, b ∈ A there exists c ∈ A with a ≤ c and b ≤ c. We say that (D, ≤) is a cpo, if it has a smallest element, denoted ⊥, and each directed subset of D has a supremum in D. An element x ∈ D is compact, if for any directed subset A of D for which sup A exists and x ≤ sup A there is a ∈ A with x ≤ a. The set of all compact elements of D is denoted by D0. Then (D, ≤) is algebraic, if for each d ∈ D the set {x ∈ D0 : x ≤ d} is directed and has supremum d. An algebraic cpo D will be called a domain. It is well-known that

any domain (D, ≤) is determined uniquely (up to isomorphism) by the structure of its subset of compact elements (D0, ≤). A domain (D, ≤) is called a Scott domain (L-domain), if each non-empty subset A of D which is bounded above in D has a supremum (an infimum) in D. Thus an algebraic lattice can be considered as a Scott domain containing a greatest element. We use the prefix ω− for a domain to denote that its set of compact elements is countable.
Let (D, ≤) again be a poset. For A ⊆ D and x ∈ D, we write A ≤ x to denote that a ≤ x for all a ∈ A. Let mub(A) denote the set of minimal upper bounds of A in D. A subset S of D is called bounded-complete in D, denoted S  D, if whenever A ⊆ S is a finite subset, x ∈ D and A ≤ x, then there exists s ∈ S such that A ≤ s ≤ x. Then (D, ≤) is called biﬁnite, if each finite subset A ⊆ D0 is contained in some finite bounded-complete subset S ⊆ D0.
Let (P, ≤), (Q, ≤) be two posets. A function f : P → Q is continuous, if it preserves suprema of directed subsets of P . Furthermore, f is a mub-embedding, if for any finite subset A of P , we have f (mub(A)) = mub(f (A)). Note that then, in particular, f is an order-embedding (i.e. a ≤ b iff f (a) ≤ f (b) for any a, b ∈ P ); moreover, provided that P, Q have smallest elements ⊥P , ⊥Q, respectively, we have f (⊥P ) = ⊥Q (let A = ∅ and observe that mub(∅) = {⊥P }). As usual, an order- embedding which is onto is called isomorphism.
Now, let f : P → Q, g : Q → P be continuous. Then (f, g) is called an embedding-projection pair (EPP) from (P, ≤) into (Q, ≤), if g ◦ f = idP and f ◦ g ≤ idQ. If f is an isomorphism, then g = f −1, and the EPP is also called an isomorphism. We denote an EPP (f, g) by ϕ. The composition of two EPPs (f, g): (P ≤) → (Q, ≤), (h, k) : (Q, ≤) → (R, ≤) is defined to be (h ◦ f, g ◦ k) and is again an EPP. We let ωBepp, ωBLepp, ωSepp, ωLatepp denote the categories of all ω-bifinite domains, ω-bifinite L-domains, ω-Scott domains, and ω-algebraic lattices, respectively, in each case with EPPs as morphisms. Embedding-projection pairs, mub-embeddings and bounded-complete subsets are closely related, as is well-known (cf., e.g., [9]).
Proposition 2.1 Let (D1, ≤), (D2, ≤) be two biﬁnite domains and f : D0 → D2
be a mapping. Then the following are equivalent:
There exists an EPP (f¯, g) from (D1, ≤) into (D2, ≤) such that f¯TD0 = f.
f is a mub-embedding and f (D0) ⊆ D0.
1	2
f is an order-embedding and f (D0)  D0.

Let C be one of the categories ωBepp, ωBLepp, ωSepp, or ωLatepp, and (U, ≤) ∈ C. Then (U, ≤) is called
universal in C, if for each domain (D, ≤) ∈ C there exists an EPP ϕ : (D, ≤) →
(U, ≤);
homogeneous, if for any finite domain (D, ≤) ∈ C and EPPs ϕi : (D, ≤) →(U, ≤) (i = 1, 2) there exists an isomorphism ψ : (U, ≤) → (U, ≤) such that ψ ◦ ϕ1 = ϕ2.
Moreover, we say that (U 0, ≤) realizes all one-point extensions of ﬁnite subdo-

mains, if for any two finite domains (A, ≤A) and (B, ≤B) in C with (A, ≤A) (U 0, ≤), (A, ≤A)  (B, ≤B) and B = A  {y} there exists z ∈ U 0 such that idA ∪ {(y, z)} : (B, ≤B) → (U 0, ≤) is a mub-embedding; equivalently, A ∪ {z}  (U 0, ≤) and idA ∪ {(y, z)} : (B, ≤B) → (A ∪ {z}, ≤) is an isomorphism.
As is well-known in model theory (cf. [14,4,18]), the properties of universality and homogeneity are intimately related with realizations of one-point extensions; in our setting such realizations of one-point extensions were already utilized in [15,7,9], and we have the following useful and essential characterization.
Proposition 2.2 ([9, Prop. 2.2]) Let (U, ≤) ∈ C where C is one of the categories
ωBepp, ωBLepp, ωSepp, or ωLatepp. Then the following are equivalent:
(U, ≤) is universal and homogeneous in C.
(U 0, ≤) realizes all one-point extensions of ﬁnite subdomains.
The main result of [7] is the following
Theorem 2.3 ([7]) Each of the categories ωBepp, ωBLepp, ωSepp, or ωLatepp con- tains a universal and homogeneous domain. This universal and homogeneous do- main is unique up to isomorphism.
To prove this result, [7] demonstrate that the class of finite domains in C has the amalgamation property. Then the result follows from a category-theoretic gen- eralization of Fra¨ıss´e’s theorem from model theory, cf. [7, Thm. 1.1].

The universal bifinite domain
For an introduction into our construction, we briefly recall the random construction of the universal homogeneous graph. In the following, a structure (V, R) is a graph, if V is a non-empty set and R ⊆ V × V is irreflexive and symmetric, i.e., graphs are loopless and undirected. Embeddings of graphs are one-to-one functions which both preserve and reflect the edge relation. A countable graph U is universal, if any countable graph can be embedded into it, and U is homogeneous, if each isomor- phism between two finite subgraphs of U extends to an automorphism. Fra¨ıss´e [13] showed that there exists a countable universal homogeneous graph U ; moreover, U is unique up to isomorphism with these properties.
Now, let us describe a probabilistic construction of this graph U . As underlying set, we take N, the natural numbers. Choose an enumeration of all 2-subsets Si =
{ai, bi} (i ∈ N) of N. Then toss a fair coin to decide whether ai and bi become connected by an edge or not. Since the choices are completely independent of each other, they can be made by following the enumeration, any other order, or even concurrently. Then, in any case, with probability 1 we obtain the universal homogeneous graph.
To phrase this heuristic construction more precisely, we describe the underlying probability space (cf. Erdo˝s and Spencer [12], Cameron [4]).
We assume that our graphs have N, the natural numbers, as underlying set. Let

Ω = {R ⊆ N × N | (N, R) is a graph} and Ωn = {R ⊆ A2
| (An, R) is a graph}

where An = {1, 2,... , n} (n ∈ N). For R ∈ Ωn, let (R, n)∼ = {S ∈ Ω | S ∩ A2 = R}. Let A denote the σ-algebra on Ω generated by the basic sets (R, n)∼ where R ∈ Ωn.
~	−(n)
Then there exists a unique probability measure μ on Ω satisfying μ((R, n) )= 2	2
for any R ∈ Ωn as above. The main statement above says that the set {R ∈ Ω |
(N, R) is a universal and homogeneous graph} has measure 1 in (Ω, A, μ).
Next, we wish to develop our probabilistic construction of bifinite domains. We will again first proceed heuristically and afterwards indicate the precise definition of the underlying probability space.
Note that any domain (D ≤) is determined uniquely up to isomorphism by the structure of its subposet (D0, ≤) of compact elements. Indeed, if (D, ≤) and (E, ≤) are domains and f : (D0, ≤) → (E0, ≤) is an isomorphism, then f extends uniquely to an isomorphism f¯ : (D, ≤) → (E, ≤) with f¯TD0 = f . Hence we may describe properties of the class of all domains (D, ≤) by corresponding properties for the sets
(D0, ≤). We will assume that our infinite domains (D, ≤) satisfy D0 = N, and that they are defined in a unique and uniform way (e.g., via the cpo-completion) over their poset (N, ≤) of compact elements.
Construction 3.1 We fix some discrete probability distribution ν : N → [0, 1] and, for each i ∈ N, some probability pi ∈ [0, 1]. We describe how to extend a finite partial order ≤n on An = {1, 2,... , n} probabilistically to a finite partial order
≤n+1 on An+1 = {1, 2,... ,n + 1} such that (An, ≤n)  (An+1, ≤n+1). For this, we only have to determine the order relations between n +1 and i for each i ∈ An. In order to achieve that (An, ≤n)  (An+1, ≤n+1), there will have to be a greatest element x in (An, ≤n) with x <n+1 n + 1.
We proceed as follows. We first choose some x ∈ A with probability ν(x) for x < n and with probability Σy≥n ν(y) for x = n. Next we define a binary relation R in {n + 1}× {a ∈ An | x <n a} as follows. Decide independently for each
a ∈ An with x <n a with probability pa that (n + 1, a) ∈ R, and with probability
1 − pa that (n + 1, a) ∈/ R. Then let ≤n+1 be the reflexive and transitive closure of ≤n ∪ {(x, n + 1)}∪ R on An+1. It is clear that ≤n+1 is a partial order on An+1. Since the new element n + 1 has a unique lower neighbor x in (An+1, ≤n+1), we obtain (An, ≤n)  (An+1, ≤n+1).
Construction 3.2 We apply the above construction iteratively yielding a sequence of finite partial orders (An, ≤n) with An = {1, 2,... , n} and
(A1, ≤1)  (A2, ≤2)  (A3, ≤3)  ... 
Then ≤ =  n≥1 ≤n is a partial order on N with minimal element 1. Clearly (An, ≤n) (N, ≤) for each n ∈ N and the cpo-completion of (N, ≤) is an ω-bifinite domain.
We now show that, under mild assumptions on the discrete probability distribu- tion ν and the sequence of probabilities (pi)i∈N, the cpo-completion of this partial order (N, ≤) is almost surely a universal and homogeneous ω-bifinite domain.
Theorem 3.3 Let ν : N → [0, 1] be a discrete probability distribution such that

ν(i) > 0 for all i ∈ N. Furthermore, for each i ∈ N, let p ∈ (0, 1) be some probability such that Σi∈N pi < ∞. Then, with probability 1, Construction 3.2 produces a partial order ≤ on N whose cpo-completion is a universal and homogeneous biﬁnite
domain.
Proof. By Prop. 2.2, it suffices to show that with probability 1, the resulting partial order (N, ≤) realizes all one-point extensions of finite subdomains. Note that there are, up to isomorphism, only countably many such one-point extensions (A ≤A)  (B, ≤B) with A ⊆ N. Since the intersection of countably many events of probability 1 again has probability 1, it suffices to consider an arbitrary fixed one-point extension (A, ≤A)  (B, ≤B) with A {y} = B and (A, ≤A)  (Am, ≤m) where m ∈ N. We claim that then with probability 1, there exists n ∈ N such that fn+1 = idA ∪ {(y, n + 1)}): (B, ≤B) → (An+1, ≤n+1) is a mub-embedding.
To this aim, consider any integer n ∈ {m, m + 1,... } such that (An, ≤n) is constructed. We wish to compute a lower bound for the probability of constructing
≤n+1 on An+1 such that fn+1 is a mub-embedding.
Let x ∈ A be the greatest element of (A, ≤) such that x <B y. The probability that in Construction 3.1 we choose this element x from An is at least ν(x) > 0. Now consider the relation R = {(n+1, a) | a ∈ A, y <B a}⊆ {n+1}×{a ∈ An | x ≤n a}. To estimate its probability, note that
  {1 − pa | a ∈ An,x <n a, y /<B a}≥  {1 − pi | i ∈ N} > 0
by a standard result of analysis on infinite products, since Σi∈N pi < ∞. Hence the probability of choosing in our construction of ≤n+1 the above relation R is at least
  {pa | a ∈ A, y <B a}·  {1 − pa | a ∈ An,x <n a, y /<B a}
≥  {pa | a ∈ A, y <B a}·  {1 − pi | i ∈ N}.

Evidently, there is a (small but) fixed r > 0 such that at least with probability r all these choices of x and R are done as described, and r depends only on (A, ≤A) and (B, ≤B) (but not on n).
Assume that R is constructed in this way and let ≤n+1 be the reflexive and transitive closure of ≤n ∪ {(x, n + 1)}∪ R. We demonstrate that then the mapping fn+1 = idA ∪ {(y, n + 1)} : (B, ≤B) → (A ∪ {n + 1}, ≤n+1) is an order-isomorphism. Let a ∈ A. By the choice of x, the fact that (A, ≤A) ⊆ (An, ≤n), and the definition of ≤n+1, we obtain a <B y iff a ≤B x iff a ≤A x iff a ≤n x iff a <n+1 n + 1. If y <B a, we have (n + 1, a) ∈ R by construction, hence n +1 <n+1 a. Conversely, let n +1 <n+1 a. Then there is a' ∈ A with (n + 1, a') ∈ R and a' ≤n a. Hence, by the definition of R, we have y <B a' implying y <B a. Hence fn+1 is an order- isomorphism as claimed.
To show that fn+1 is a mub-embedding into (An+1, ≤n+1), it remains to see that A {n + 1}  (An+1, ≤n+1). So let S ⊆ A ∪ {n + 1} and c ∈ An+1 \ S with S ≤n+1 c. If n +1 ∈/ S, then A  (Am, ≤m)  (An, ≤n)  (An+1, ≤n+1) implies the existence of b ∈ A with S ≤n+1 b ≤n+1 c. Now suppose n +1 ∈ S. Since n +1 <n+1 c, there

exists a' ∈ A with (n + 1, a') ∈ R and a' ≤n c (and therefore a' ≤n+1 c). As above, we find b ∈ A with (S \ {n + 1}) ∪ {a'} ≤n+1 b ≤n+1 c implying S ≤n+1 b ≤n+1 c since n +1 ≤n+1 a'.
Thus, the probability that fn+1 is a mub-embedding of (B, ≤B) into (An+1, ≤n+1) is at least r. Hence the probability that it is not such a mub-embedding is at most 1 − r. Consequently, the probability that for all n ∈ {m, m + 1,... }, the mapping fn+1 is not a mub-embedding is (1 − r)ω = 0. Hence, almost surely the one-point extension is realized after some number of steps and therefore the result follows. 

Our procedure in Construction 3.1 of extending a given finite partial order by one more element depends on the underlying probability distribution ν : N → [0, 1] and the sequence of probabilities (pi)i∈N. As seen, Theorem 3.3 holds quite generally for any choice of these parameters ν, (pi)i∈N satisfying the requirements stated in Theorem 3.3. However, we now show that a further slight generalization of this construction leads to totally different domains.
Clearly, we could formulate (and thereby generalize) Construction 3.1 by re- placing ν by a sequence of discrete probability distributions (νn)n∈N. Then when extending the order from An to An+1, we should proceed exactly as before, replacing ν by νn.
Now assume that the sequence (νn)n∈N satisfies Σn∈N νn(1) < ∞. That is,
we just prescribe that (νn(1))n∈N converges sufficiently quickly to 0. Then, when extending the order from An to An+1, the probability that we choose x = 1 to be the greatest element below n +1 equals 1 if n = 1 (i.e., 1 <2 2), and νn(1) if n ≥ 2. That is, if n ≥ 2, with probability 1 − νn(1) we obtain 1 <n+1 i <n+1 n +1 for some 2 ≤ i ≤ n. Consequently, with probability p =  n≥2(1 − νn(1)), for any n ≥ 2,
there is some i ≤ n with 1 <n+1 i <n+1 n + 1. In particular, with probability p,
we have 2 ≤ n +1 for all n ≥ 2, for otherwise we could choose the least natural number n ≥ 2 such that 2 /≤ n + 1, and then n + 1 would be minimal above 1 in (An+1, ≤n+1), a contradiction. Again we have p > 0 by the assumption that
n∈N νn(1) < ∞.
This sharply contrasts the situation for any universal and homogeneous bifinite domain (U, ≤). There, for any a ∈ U 0 with ⊥ < a there is some z ∈ U 0 satisfying
⊥ < z < a. For, consider the one-point extension (A, ≤A)  (B, ≤B) with A =
{⊥, a}, B = {⊥, y, a} and ⊥ <B y <B a and apply Prop. 2.2 to obtain our claim. Hence the above construction produces with positive probability a domain which is certainly not universal and homogeneous. A further analysis of the structure of the domains obtained in these more general situations seems to require intricate combinatorial arguments.
We now describe the probability space underlying Theorem 3.3 more formally. A biﬁnite partial order is a partial order ≤ on some initial segment A of the natural numbers such that, for any 1 ≤ n < |A|, we have {1, 2,... , n}  (A, ≤). For n ∈ N, let Bn denote the set of bifinite partial orders ≤ on {1, 2,... , n} and let B denote the set of bifinite partial orders ≤ on N.
We wish to define discrete probability distributions μn on each Bn (n ∈ N).

Let n ∈ N and assume that we have defined μn on Bn. Let ≤n ∈ Bn. In Con- struction 3.1, we extend ≤n to an order ≤n+1 ∈ Bn+1. Our probabilistic pro- cedure thus determines the intuitive conditional probability P (≤n+1|≤n) of con- structing ≤n+1 given its restriction ≤n to An. Putting μ1(≤1) = 1 and, inductively, μn+1(≤n+1) = P (≤n+1|≤n) · μn(≤n) for any ≤n+1 ∈ Bn+1 and ≤n = ≤n+1 ∩ A2 , we obtain a discrete distribution μn+1 on Bn+1 such that now P (≤n+1|≤n) be-
comes the exact conditional probability of ≤n+1 given ≤n+1 ∩ A2 = ≤n. Induc-
tively, for any ≤n+1 ∈ Bn+1 we obtain μn+1(≤n+1)=  1≤m≤n P (≤m+1|≤m) where
≤m = ≤n+1 ∩ A2 for 1 ≤ m ≤ n + 1.
Also note that there is a natural mapping gn : Bn+1 → Bn which maps ≤n+1
to its (uniquely determined) restriction ≤n+1 ∩ A2 on An. As is easily verified, for
any ≤n ∈ Bn we have Σ{P (≤n+1|≤n) | ≤n+1 ∈ Bn+1, ≤n+1 ∩ A2 = ≤n} = 1, and thus μn(≤n)= Σ{μn+1(≤n+1) | ≤n+1 ∈ Bn+1, gn(≤n+1)= ≤n}. Hence we obtain
a projective system (in the natural way) whose projective limit has the set B of all
bifinite partial orders on N as underlying set.
For each bifinite partial order ≤ on N and n ∈ N, let πn(≤) denote its restriction to the set An. Then the Borel σ-algebra A on the projective limit is generated by the collection {π−1(≤n) | n ∈ N, ≤n ∈ Bn}. A weak version of the Prokhorov extension theorem (cf. [1, Section 3.1] for a lucid short introduction into the background) asserts that there exists a unique probability measure μ on A satisfying μ(π−1(≤n
)) = μn(≤n) for all n ∈ N and ≤n ∈ Bn.
Note that, given n ∈ N and ≤n ∈ Bn, π−1(≤n) is the set of those bifinite orders on N to which ≤n can be extended; thus the probability of this generating set in A equals μn(≤n), the probability of having constructed ≤n on An (in finitely many steps), as is intuitively expected. Therefore the probability space (B, A, μ) is the space of all possible orders that we consider.
Now we assume that for each ≤∈ B we have a uniquely defined cpo-completion (D, ≤) of (N, ≤); then (D, ≤) is an ω-bifinite domain. Let B comprise all these cpo-completions of bifinite partial orders (N, ≤). Clearly, we can define a probabil- ity measure μ on B making (B, A, μ) naturally isomorphic to (B, A, μ). We regard (B, A, μ) as our probability space of ω-bifinite domains. Now the result of Theo- rem 3.3 means that in (B, A, μ), the set U = {(D, ≤) ∈ B | (D, ≤) is universal and homogeneous} has measure 1. We just note here that it can be shown (e.g. by Theorem 5.3 below) that U is measurable in B. Now we show:

Corollary 3.4 In the probability space (B, A, μ), almost any domain (D, ≤) embeds its own function space [D → D], but almost no domain (D, ≤) is isomorphic to [D → D].

Proof. Let U be the collection of universal homogeneous ω-bifinite domains in B. If (D, ≤) is any universal ω-bifinite domain, then [D → D] is again ω-bifinite, hence embeds into (D, ≤). Hence the set of domains in B which embed their own function space contains U which has probability 1 by Theorem 3.3. On the other hand, the set of domains in B isomorphic to their own function space is disjoint from U [9] and thus has measure 0.	 

We remark that the proof of Corollary 3.4 shows the following. Let P be a property of domains which is isomorphism closed, i.e. if (D, ≤), (D', ≤') are two isomorphic domains and (D, ≤) satisfies P , then so does (D', ≤'). Then either almost any domain in B has property P , or else almost no domain in B has prop- erty P ; the first alternative holds iff the universal homogeneous ω-bifinite domains satisfy P .

Further universal domains
In this section, we wish to construct universal homogeneous domains in the cate- gories ωLatepp, ωSepp and ωBLepp. First, we need a few order-theoretic preparations. A poset (Q, ≤) is complete if any of its subsets has a supremum. It is Dedekind- complete if any of its upper bounded non-empty subsets has a supremum; equiv- alently each non-empty lower bounded subset of Q has an infimum in Q. Finally, (Q, ≤) is L-complete if any of its upper bounded non-empty subsets has an infimum. Furthermore, let (C, ≤) be a complete poset and Q ⊆ C. Then Q is Dedekind-
closed in (C, ≤) if, for any X ⊆ Q and x ∈ Q with X ≤ x, we have sup(C,≤) X ∈ Q. Further, Q is L-closed in (C, ≤) if, for any X ⊆ Q and x ∈ Q with X ≤ x, we have inf(C,≤) X ∈ Q. Recall that the MacNeille-completion (C, ≤) of (P, ≤) isa complete lattice containing P such that the identity mapping idP : P → C preserves all suprema and infima existing in (P, ≤), cf. [3].
Definition 4.1 Let (P, ≤) be a poset and (C, ≤) its MacNeille-completion. Its Dedekind-completion (L-completion, resp.) is the smallest Dedekind-closed (L- closed) subset of (C, ≤) that contains P .
Note that the intersection of Dedekind-closed subsets of (C, ≤) exists and is Dedekind-closed, again. The same holds for L-closed subsets. Hence the Dedekind- and L-completions of a poset exist. It is easy to see that the Dedekind-completion of (P, ≤) consists of all elements sup(C,≤) X ∈ C where X ⊆ P has an upper bound in P . A similar characterization of the L-completion requires an iterative procedure of adding necessary infima (see proof below). Since the MacNeille-completion of a finite poset is finite, again, so are the Dedekind- and L-completions.
Lemma 4.2 Let (P, ≤) be a poset with smallest element, and let A  (P, ≤).
If (A, ≤) is complete, then (A, ≤) is bounded-complete in the MacNeille-com- pletion of (P, ≤).
If (A, ≤) is Dedekind-complete, then it is bounded-complete in the Dedekind- completion of (P, ≤).
If (A, ≤) is L-complete, then it is bounded-complete in the L-completion of
(P, ≤).
Proof. The proof is similar but more general than the argument used for [7, Prop. 3.6]. Let (C, ≤) be the MacNeille-completion of (P, ≤).
Assume that (A, ≤) is complete. Let X ⊆ A be finite and c ∈ C with X ≤ c.

By assumption, there exists s = sup(A,≤) X ∈ A. Then s = sup(P,≤) X by A (P, ≤), and thus also s = sup(C,≤) X since (C, ≤) is the MacNeille- completion of (P, ≤). Hence X ≤ s ≤ c proving A  (C, ≤).
Let (A, ≤) be Dedekind-complete and let (Q, ≤) be the Dedekind-completion of (P, ≤). Let X ⊆ A be finite and q ∈ Q with X ≤ q. The above characterization of the Dedekind-completion (Q, ≤) of (P, ≤) implies that there exists p ∈ P with q ≤ p. From A (P, ≤) we now obtain some a ∈ A with X ≤ a ≤ p. Since (A, ≤) is Dedekind-complete, there exists s = sup(A,≤) X ∈ A and, by A (P, ≤), we have s = sup(P,≤) X. Since (C, ≤) is the MacNeille-completion of (P, ≤), this implies s = sup(C,≤) X and therefore X ≤ s ≤ q, hence A  (Q, ≤).
Let (A, ≤) be L-complete and let (R, ≤) be the L-completion of (P, ≤). First, we assume that P is finite. Let n = |R|. We define an ascending chain of subsets R1 ⊆ R2 ⊆ ··· ⊆ Rn ⊆ R as follows. We put R1 = P . Now assume that 1 ≤ j < n and that Rj is already defined. Then let
Rj+1 = {y ∈ R | ∃S ⊆ Rj,z ∈ Rj : S ≤ z and y = inf(C,≤) S}.
Since R = |n|, it follows that Rn−1 = Rn is an L-closed subset of (C, ≤) that contains P . Because of the minimality of (R, ≤), it follows that Rn = R.
By assumption, we have A R1. Now let 1 ≤ j < n and assume that A Rj. We claim that A Rj+1. For this, let X ⊆ A and y ∈ Rj+1 with X ≤ y. Choose S ⊆ Rj and z ∈ Rj such that S ≤ z and y = inf(C,≤) S. For each s ∈ S, we have X ≤ y ≤ s, hence by A  Rj, there exists as ∈ A with X ≤ as ≤ s ≤ z. Again by A  Rj, we obtain {as | s ∈ S}≤ a' ≤ z for some a' ∈ A. Since (A, ≤) is L-complete, there exists x = inf(A,≤){as | s ∈ S} ∈ A. Then X ≤ x ≤ s for each s ∈ S, thus, X ≤ x ≤ y and our claim A Rj+1 follows. By induction, we obtain A  Rn = P as needed.
The case where P is infinite can be treated similarly as above by transfinite induction (cf. [7, proof of Prop. 3.6(d)]). But since only the finite case will be needed here, we leave the infinite case to the reader.

Now we wish to derive analogues of Constructions 3.1 and 3.2 for lattices, Scott- domains, and L-domains, respectively. This consists of Construction 3.1 followed by a suitable completion process, and then we iterate this procedure.
Construction 4.3 Let ν : N → [0, 1] be some discrete probability distribution and, for i ∈ N, let pi ∈ [0, 1]. We describe three ways to probabilistically extend a finite partial order (A, ≤) with A = {1, 2,... , k} into a finite partial order (C, ≤) that will eventually lead to the universal homogeneous (a) ω-algebraic lattice, (b) ω-Scott domain, and (c) ω-bifinite L-domain.
The first step is to apply Construction 3.1 to obtain probabilistically a partial order (B, ≤) with B = {1, 2,... ,k + 1}. Secondly, let (C, ≤) be the
MacNeille-completion
Dedekind-completion

L-completion
of (B, ≤), respectively. Recall that (A, ≤)  (B, ≤) as explained in Construction 3.1. If (A, ≤) is (a) a lattice, (b) a Scott domain, or (c) an L-domain, then Lemma 4.2 implies (A, ≤)  (C, ≤) for the respective completion (C, ≤) of (B, ≤). Moreover, since C is finite, we may assume (by some systematic renaming of the elements of C \ B) that C = {1,... , |C|}.
Construction 4.4 We apply this construction iteratively yielding a sequence of finite partial orders (An, ≤n) with An = {1, 2,... , kn} for some kn ∈ N with kn < kn+1 for all n and
(A1, ≤1)  (A2, ≤2)  (A3, ≤3)  ... 
Then ≤ =  n≥1 ≤n is a partial order on N with minimal element 1 and (An, ≤n) 
(N, ≤) for each n ∈ N. Furthermore, the cpo-completion of (N, ≤) is (a) a lattice,
(b) a Scott domain, or (c) an L-domain, respectively.
We now show that, under mild assumptions on the discrete probability distribu- tion ν and the sequence of probabilities (pi)i∈N, the cpo-completion of this partial order (N, ≤) is almost surely a universal and homogeneous ω-algebraic lattice, ω- Scott domain, ω-bifinite L-domain, respectively.
Theorem 4.5 Let ν : N → [0, 1] be a discrete probability distribution such that
ν(i) > 0 for all i ∈ N. Furthermore, for each i ∈ N, let p ∈ (0, 1) be some probability such that Σi∈N pi < ∞.
Then, with probability 1, Construction 4.4 produces a partial order ≤ on N whose
cpo-completion is a universal and homogeneous
ω-algebraic lattice,
ω-Scott domain,
ω-biﬁnite L-domain, respectively.
Proof. The proof is analogous for all these three statements and actually follows the line of the proof of Theorem 3.3. We only sketch the necessary changes.
Let (N, ≤) be any outcome of Construction 4.4. Then there are 1 = k1 < k2 < k3 < ... such that if An = {1, 2,... , kn} then one application of Construction 4.3 yields (An+1, ≤) from (An, ≤), and An  An+1  (N, ≤).
Let (A, ≤A) (B, ≤B) be a one-point extension in ωLatepp (ωSepp, ωBLepp, respectively) with B = A  {y} and (A, ≤A)  (Am, ≤m) where m ∈ N.  As in the proof of Theorem 3.3, it suffices to show that this one-point extension is realized with probability 1 in (N, ≤). As in the proof of Theorem 3.3, let n ∈ {m, m + 1,... } and consider (An, ≤n). Then there is some fixed r > 0 such that, with probability at least r, the first step of Construction 4.3 (i.e., Con- struction 3.1) results in a poset (An ∪ {kn + 1}, ≤' ) that embeds (B, ≤B) via the mub-embedding fn+1 = idA ∪ {(y, kn + 1)}. Then (An+1, ≤n+1) is the MacNeille- completion (Dedekind-completion, L-completion, respectively) of (An∪{kn+1}, ≤' ) and (An, ≤n) (An+1, ≤n+1). By Lemma 4.2, the mapping fn+1 is also a mub- embedding of (B, ≤B) into (An+1, ≤n). Hence, also with probability at least r,

Construction 4.3 yields a poset (An+1, ≤n+1) that realizes the one-point extension (A, ≤A)  (B, ≤B). The remaining arguments can be taken from the proof of The- orem 3.3.	 
To indicate the precise probability spaces underlying the above theorem, we can proceed similarly to the case of Theorem 3.3. We sketch the case of the universal homogeneous ω-Scott domain.
A Scott partial order is a partial order ≤ on some initial segment A of N such that there exist 1 = k1 < k2 < ··· < kn = |A| if A is finite or 1 = k1 < k2 < ... if A = N such that for any 1 ≤ i(< n)

{1, 2,... , ki}  ({1, 2,... , ki + 1}, ≤) and ({1, 2,... , ki+1}, ≤) is the
Dedekind-completion of ({1, 2,... , ki + 1}, ≤).
(∗)

If A is finite and kn = |A|, we call n the Dedekind-length of (A, ≤). For n ∈ N, let Sn denote the set of all finite Scott partial orders of Dedekind-length n, and let S be the set of all infinite Scott partial orders. Now the definition of the probability distributions on Sn and S follow the same line as those in Section 3 for Bn and B, and we define the probability space (S, A, μ) of ω-Scott domains again as isomorphic to the one on S.
The following corollary can be shown in the same way as we proved Cor. 3.4.

Corollary 4.6 In the probability space (S, A, μ), almost any ω-Scott domain (D, ≤) embeds its own function space [D → D], but almost no ω-Scott domain (D, ≤) is isomorphic to [D → D].
For the ω-algebraic lattices and ω-bifinite L-domains, we can proceed very simi- larly, replacing in (∗) above the Dedekind-completion by the MacNeille-completion and the L-completion, respectively.

Topological interpretation of ”almost”
In this section, we wish to endow the collection of all bifinite domains (D, ≤) with D0 = N with a metric, and we will show that in this metric space, the collection of all universal homogeneous bifinite domains forms a “large” subset in a topological sense. We first recall some basic notions from topology, cf. e.g. [19]. Let (X, d) be a complete metric space. A subset S of X is open if for each s ∈ S there is ε > 0 such that the ε-ball Bε(s)= {x ∈ X | d(s, x) < ε} of s is contained in S. The set S is dense if its closure equals X, i.e., S meets every non-empty open set. A subset R is residual if R contains the intersection of countably many open dense sets (in equivalent terminology, R is the complement of a meagre set).
Proposition 5.1 (Baire category theorem) A residual set in a complete metric space is dense.
Hence, if we can show that the collection of all universal homogeneous domains forms a residual subset of some complete metric space, it follows that there exists such a domain. In fact, a residual set R is considered as “large” containing “almost

all” of the space; also the intersection of countably many residual sets is again residual. We refer the reader to [4] for applications of this in algebra.
Now we construct a metric space (X, d) as follows. For each n ≥ 1, let again
An = {1, 2,... , n}. Let

X = {R | R ⊆ N2}
and set d(R1, R2)= 2−n where n = sup{m ∈ N | R1∩A2

= R2∩A2 } with 2−∞ = 0.

The topology on X is determined by the basic open sets {R ∈ X | R ∩ A2
= F }

for finite sets F ⊆ An and n ∈ N. Then it is well-known that (X, d) is a complete metric space, and the topology of X is compact.
As before, we will call a partial order ≤ on N biﬁnite if An  (N, ≤) for each n ≥ 1. Thus we have A1  A2  ··· (N, ≤). We note that this will not be an essential restriction since for any ω-bifinite domain (D, ≤), we can enumerate D0 =
{di | i ≥ 1} with d1 = min(D0, ≤) such that {di | 1 ≤ i ≤ n}  D0 for each n ≥ 1. Now let
Pbif = {≤ ∈ X |≤ is a bifinite partial order on N}.

For any R ∈ X, we have R ∈/
Pbif iff for some n ≥ 1, the restriction R ∩ A2 is

not a bifinite partial order on the finite set An. Hence X \ Pbif is a union of basic open sets and thus open, showing that Pbif is a closed subset of X. Hence (Pbif , d) is again a complete metric space. If follows from general results that (Pbif , d) is homeomorphic to the Cantor set.
If ≤ is a bifinite partial order on N, we let D(≤) denote the (up to isomorphism uniquely determined) bifinite domain with (D(≤)0, ≤) = (N, ≤). Now, for each one-point extension ((A, ≤A), (B, ≤B)) in ωBepp with A ⊆ N finite, we introduce a set SA,B ⊆ Pbif:
SA,B = {≤ ∈ Pbif | if A  (N, ≤), then there exists a mub-embedding
g : (B, ≤B) → (N, ≤) such that g TA= idA}.
Lemma 5.2 Let ((A, ≤A), (B, ≤B)) be a one-point extension in ωBepp with A ⊆ N
ﬁnite. Then SA,B is an open and dense subset of (Pbif , d).
Proof. First we show that SA,B is open. It is easily seen that SA,B is the union of the following open sets
{≤ ∈ Pbif | there is a mub-embedding g : (B, ≤B) → (An, ≤∩ A2 ) with gTA =
idA} where n ∈ N,
{≤ ∈ Pbif | not (A, ≤A)  (Am, ≤∩ A2 )} where m ∈ N is minimal with A ⊆ Am. Hence SA,B is a union of open sets and therefore open.
Second, we show that SA,B is dense, i.e., intersects any basic open set. So let
(C, ≤C ) be some finite partial order with C ⊆ N. Let V be the basic open set determined by ≤C. We claim that SA,B ∩ V /= ∅. If there is no bifinite partial order
≤ such that (A, ≤A), (C, ≤C )  (N, ≤), then V ⊆ SA,B. Otherwise, let ≤ ∈ Pbif be a bifinite partial order such that (A, ≤A), (C, ≤C )  (N, ≤).
Since A and C are finite, there exists n ∈ N with (A, ≤A), (C, ≤C ) (An, ≤n) where ≤n= ≤ ∩ A2 . It suffices to show that SA,B intersects the basic open set

determined by ≤n, i.e., that SA,B contains some bifinite partial order ≤' with (An, ≤n)  (N, ≤'). For this, let B = A ∪ {y} and let x be the greatest element

of (A, ≤A) with x <B y. Then define ≤n+1 ⊆ A2
as the reflexive and transitive

closure of
≤n ∪ {(x, n + 1)}∪ {(n + 1, a) | a ∈ A, y <B a}.
As in the proof of Theorem 3.3, (An, ≤n)  (An+1, ≤n+1) and the mapping g = idA ∪ {(y, n + 1)} : (B, ≤B) → (An+1, ≤n+1) is a mub-embedding. Now extend
≤n+1 to a bifinite partial order, denoted ≤', on N. Then g is a mub-embedding of (B, ≤B) into (N, ≤'), i.e., ≤'∈ SA,B and (A, ≤A)  (An+1, ≤n+1)  (N, ≤') as needed.	 
Theorem 5.3 In the metric space (Pbif , d), the subset
S = {≤ ∈ Pbif | D(≤) is universal and homogeneous}
is residual.
Proof. We claim that S contains the intersection of all sets SA,B where (A, ≤A) (B, ≤B) is a one-point extension in ωBepp. Indeed, if ≤ belongs to this intersection, (N, ≤) realizes all one-point extensions of finite subdomains, hence D(≤) is universal and homogeneous by Prop. 2.2. Clearly, there are just countably many such sets SA,B, proving that S is residual.	 
To derive a similar result for ω-algebraic lattices, ω-Scott domains, and ω-bifinite L-domains, one can proceed very similarly, combining it with arguments of Sec- tion 4. We only sketch the case of ω-Scott domains. Recall the definition of Scott partial orders from section 4. Let
PScott = {≤ ∈ X |≤ is a Scott partial order on N}.
This is a closed subset of X. Now follow the previous argument, replacing Pbif by PScott; for the corresponding density claim of Lemma 5.2 apply the construction given in the proof of Theorem 4.5. It follows that in the metric space (PScott, d), the subset
S = {≤ ∈ PScott | the cpo-completion of (N, ≤) is universal and homogeneous} is residual.
A number-theoretic representation
As is well-known [22], there is also an explicit number-theoretic representation of the universal homogeneous graph: as underlying set, take the natural numbers N. For i, j ∈ N, let i and j be connected by an edge iff 2i occurs in the unique expansion of j as a sum of distinct powers of 2. Then the graph obtained realizes all one-point extensions, hence is universal and homogeneous.

Now we wish to derive a similar representation for the compact elements of the universal and homogeneous ω-bifinite domain. Again, the situation is more complicated than for graphs since we have to stay inside the class of bifinite posets. We proceed inductively and similarly to the probabilistic construction.
For this, let again An = {1,... , n} (n ∈ N). Let n ∈ N and assume that (An, ≤n) is a domain with least element 1. We wish to define the order ≤n+1 on An+1 such that (An, ≤n)  (An+1, ≤n+1). We consider the unique ternary expansion of n +1 as a sum of distinct powers of 3 with coefficients in {0, 1, 2}. Choose the smallest number x ∈ An (in the natural order on N) such that 3x occurs in this expansion of n + 1 with coefficient 0. Also let R denote the set of pairs (n + 1, a) with a ∈ An, x <n a, and such that 3a occurs in the expansion of n + 1 with coefficient 2. Then let ≤n+1 be the reflexive and transitive closure of ≤n ∪ {(x, n + 1)}∪ R. Since x is the unique lower neighbor of n + 1, we have (An, ≤n)  (An+1, ≤n+1). Then we put
≤ =  n∈N ≤n. Then the cpo-completion (U, ≤) of (N, ≤) is a bifinite domain.
Theorem 6.1 The biﬁnite domain (U, ≤) is universal and homogeneous.
Proof. By Prop. 2.2, it suffices to show that (N, ≤) realizes all one-point exten- sions of finite subdomains. So let ((A, ≤A), (B, ≤B)) be a one-point extension with (A, ≤A) (N, ≤) finite and B = A  {y}. Let x ∈ A be the greatest element of (A, ≤A) with x <B y. Choose m, n ∈ N with A ⊆ Am−1 and


x−1
n +1 =	3i +
2 · 3a + 3m.

i=1	a∈A,y<Ba
Then A  Am−1  An. Observe that if a ∈ A and y <B a, then also x <B a and thus x <A a showing x <n a. Hence ≤n+1 is the reflexive and transitive closure of ≤n ∪ {(x, n + 1)} ∪ R with R = {(n + 1, a) | a ∈ A, y <B a}. The proof of Theorem 3.3 shows that the mapping fn+1 = idA ∪ {(y, n + 1)} is a mub-embedding of (B, ≤B) into (An+1, ≤n+1), and the result follows.
