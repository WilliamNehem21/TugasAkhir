Abstract
As a generalization of sober spaces, we introduce the concept of countably sober spaces and prove that some topological constructions preserve countable sobriety. In particularly, we prove that the category with countably sober spaces and continuous mappings is a complete category. We give some characterizations of countably sober spaces via countable filters and obtain the Hofmann-Mislove Theorem for countably sober spaces.

Introduction
Sobriety is between T0 and T2 in topological spaces, and being T1 and being sober are incomparable properties. Sober spaces have wonderful properties and play im- portant roles in domain theory (see, e.g., [1,3,6,8,9,10,11]). For instance, a sober space is a directed complete poset (dcpo, for short) with respect to its specialization order, two sober spaces are homeomorphic iff their lattices of open subsets are order isomorphic, and the celebrated Hofmann-Mislove Theorem shows that there is an order isomorphism between the poset of compact saturated subsets and the poset of Scott open filters of open subsets in a sober space. There are many generaliza- tions of sober spaces. In [10], the authors introduced the weaker notion of sobriety, which is called bounded sobriety, and proved that the subcategory of bounded sober spaces is reflective in the category of T0 spaces. D. Zhao and W. K. Ho generalized

bounded sober spaces to k-bounded sober spaces and obtained many interesting re- sults in [11]. In this paper, we intend to generalize sober spaces to countably sober spaces.
Recall the definition of sober spaces. A subset C of a topological space X is irreducible if it is nonempty and if C ⊆ A ∪ B, where A and B are closed, implies that C ⊆ A or C ⊆ B. A topological space X is sober if for every irreducible closed set C, there exists a unique x ∈ X such that C = cl({x}). Equivalently, a nonempty
Sn
set C is irreducible if for finite closed set B1, B2, ..., Bn in X, C ⊆	Bi implies that
i=1
C ⊆ Bi for some i ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}. Replacing finite closed sets in the definition of
irreducible sets by countable closed sets, we define the notion of countably irreducible sets and introduce the concept of countably sober spaces via countably irreducible sets.
Countably approximating poset is a successful generalization of continuous poset (see [5,4]). To characterize countably approximating posets, the authors [4] intro- duced σ-Scott topology on a poset. We show that a countably approximating poset with its σ-Scott topology is a countably sober space, and prove that the topology generated by the σ-Scott topology and the lower topology on a bounded complete and countably directed complete poset is Lindelo¨f.
We investigate the properties of countably sober space. We prove that some topological constructions preserve countable sobriety. In particularly, we prove that the category with countably sober spaces and continuous mappings is a complete category. We give some characterizations of countably sober spaces via countable filters and obtain the Hofmann-Mislove Theorem for countably sober spaces.
Preliminaries
In this section, we recall some basic definitions and notations needed in this paper; more details can be founded in [1,3]. For a set X, the family of all finite sets (resp., countable sets) in X is denoted by Fin X (resp., Count X). For a poset P , x ∈ P ,
and A ⊆ P , let ↓x = {y ∈ P : y ≤ x}, ↓A = S{↓x : x ∈ A}; ↑x and ↑A are defined
dually. A subset D of P is called countably directed if for any E ∈ CountD, there exists d ∈ D such that E ⊆ ↓d. P is said to be a countably directed complete poset if every countably directed subset of P has the least upper bound in P .
For a topological space X, let O(X) be the lattice of all open subsets in X. For x ∈ X, let N (x) and O(x) be the neighbourhood and open neighbourhood of point x in X, respectively. That is, N (x)= {U ⊆ X : there exists O ∈ O(X) such that x ∈ O ⊆ U}, and O(x)= {U ∈ O(X): x ∈ U}. For a T0 space (X, τ ), the specialization order ≤ on X is defined by x ≤ y if and only if x ∈ cl({y}). Unless otherwise stated, throughout the paper, whenever an order-theoretic concept is mentioned, it is to be interpreted with respect to the specialization order on X.
Definition 2.1 ([5,4]) Let P be a countably directed complete poset. A binary relation  c on P is defined as follows: x  c y iff for any countably directed set D ⊆ P , y ≤  D implies that x ≤ d for some d ∈ D. Let ↓cx = {y ∈ P : y  c x}. P

is called a countably approximating poset if for all x ∈ P , ↓ x is countably directed and x =  ↓cx.
Recall that the σ-Scott topology (see [4]) on a countably directed complete poset
P . Let σc(P ) be a family subsets of P and U ∈ σc(P ) iff U satisfies the following two conditions: (i) U = ↑U ; (ii) for any countably directed subset D of P ,  D ∈ U implies D ∩ U /= ∅. Then σc(P ) is a topology on P , and we call σc(P ) the σ-Scott topology on P . It is easy to show that the intersection of countable open sets in σc(P ) is still open.
Theorem 2.2 ([4,5]) Let P be a countably approximating poset.
The relation  c satisﬁes interpolation property, i.e., x  c z implies x  c
y  c z for some y ∈ P.
The family {↑cx : x ∈ P} form a basis for the topology σc(P ), where ↑cx =
{y ∈ P : x  c y}.
Countably sober spaces
In this section we define the notion of countably irreducible sets and introduce the concept of countably sober spaces via countably irreducible closed sets. Some basic properties of countably sober spaces are proved.
Definition 3.1 Let X be a topological space and C ⊆ X.
C is called countably irreducible if C is nonempty and if for any countable closed subsets {Bi : i ∈ Z+}, C ⊆ Si∈Z+ Bi implies that C ⊆ Bi for some i ∈ Z+.
X is called a countably sober space if for every countably irreducible closed set
C, there exists a unique x ∈ X such that C = cl({x}).
Note that countably irreducible closed sets are irreducible closed, sober spaces are countably sober spaces. If a space X has only finite closed subsets (especially, X is finite), then irreducible closed sets are countably irreducibly irreducible. Then X is sober if X is countably sober.
Proposition 3.2 Let X be a set that has more than one element. If X is endowed with the coﬁnite topology, then we have the following.
X is sober if and only if X is a ﬁnite set;
X is countably sober if and only if X is a countable set.
Remark 3.3 (1) If X is a countable infinite set endowed with the cofinite topology. It follows from Proposition 3.2, X is countably sober but not sober.
Let P be a finite poset with non-discrete partial order, then (P, σ(P )) is count- ably sober but not T1.
If an uncountable set X is endowed with the cofinite topology, then X is T1 but not countably sober.
Proposition 3.4 Let X be a space and C a nonempty closed set of X. The fol- lowing two conditions are equivalent:

C is countably irreducible;
For any family of countable open sets {Ui : i ∈ Z+} in X, if C ∩ Ui /= ∅ for every i ∈ Z+, then C ∩ ( i∈Z+ Ui) /= ∅.
Proposition 3.5 For a countably approximating poset P, (P, σc(P )) is a countably sober space.
Proof. Let P be a countably approximating poset and C a countably irreducible closed set in (P, σc(P )). Let
C∗ = {b ∈ C : there is an a ∈ C with b  c a} =  {↓ca : a ∈ C} = ↓cC.
We claim that C∗ is countably directed. Let {bi : i ∈ Z+}⊆ C∗. Then there exists ai ∈ C such that bi  c ai for every i ∈ Z+. Since C is a countably irreducible closed set and ↑cbi ∈ σc(P ) by Theorem 2.2, C ∩ ( i∈Z+ ↑cbi) /= ∅. Choose an
a ∈ C ∩ ( i∈Z+ ↑cbi). Note that  i∈Z+ ↑cbi ∈ σc(P ), it follows from Theorem 2.2
that there exists d ∈  i∈Z  ↑cbi such that a ∈ ↑cd ⊆  i∈Z  ↑cbi. Thus d ∈ C∗

and b
+
≤ d for all i ∈ Z
+	  C∗ exists.

Now we prove that C = clσ (P )({x}). Since C is closed in (P, σc(P )) and C∗ is

c
a countably directed subset of C, x =
C∗ ∈ C. Thus ↓x ⊆ C. Let y ∈ C,

then y = ↓cy since P is a countably approximating poset. But ↓cy ⊆ C∗ implies y = ↓cy ≤ C∗ = x. Thus C ⊆ ↓x. Note that (P, σc(P )) is T0, (P, σc(P )) is countably sober.	2
Definition 3.6 Let P be a countably directed complete poset. Then the common refinement σc(P ) ∨ ω(P ) of the σ-Scott topology and the lower topology is called the σ-Lawson topology and is denoted by λc(P ).
Theorem 3.7 For a bounded complete and countably directed complete poset P,
(P, λc(P )) is a Lindelo¨f space.
Proof. Assume {U ∈ σ (P ) : i ∈ I} and {P \ ↑y : j ∈ J} together form a cover of P , i.e., (Si∈I Ui) ∪ (Sj∈J P \ ↑yj) = (Si∈I Ui) ∪ (P \  j∈J ↑yj) = P . Then
  j∈J ↑yj ⊆ Si∈I Ui. We consider the following two cases.
Case 1  j∈J ↑yj = ∅.
We claim that there exists J0 ∈ CountJ such that	j∈J0 ↑yj = ∅. Suppose
that j∈J0 ↑yj /= ∅ for all J0 ∈ CountJ . Since P is bounded complete, j∈J0 yj exists. Note that { j∈J0 yj : J0 ∈ CountJ} is countably directed and P is a count- ably directed complete poset,  J0∈CountJ  j∈J0 yj exists and  J0∈CountJ  j∈J0 yj =
 j∈J yj. Thus  j∈J ↑yj = ↑ j∈J yj /= ∅. This is a contradiction. Thus there exists
J0 ∈ CountJ such that  j∈J0 ↑yj = ∅. Therefore Sj∈J0 (P \ ↑yj)= P .

Case 2  j∈J ↑yj /= ∅.
Since P is bounded complete,

 j∈J yj exists and

 j∈J ↑yj = ↑

j∈J yj. Thus

{ j∈J0 yj : J0 ∈ CountJ} is countably directed and  j∈J yj =  { j∈J0 yj : J0 ∈
CountJ} ∈ Ui0 , there exists J0 ∈ CountJ such that  j∈J0 yj ∈ Ui0 . Thus (P \
↑ j∈J0 yj) ∪ Ui0 = P , i.e., Ui0 ∪ (Sj∈J0 P \ ↑yj)= P .

To summarize what has been mentioned above, (P, λc(P )) is a Lindelo¨f space.2
Proposition 3.8 Let P be a countably approximating poset.
(P, λc(P )) is regular and Hausdorff.
(P, λc(P ), ≤) is a pospace, i.e., the relation ≤ is closed in the product space
(P × P, λc(P ) × λc(P )).
The proofs of the following four propositions are straightforward, and we omit.
Proposition 3.9 If f is a continuous map from topological space X to topological space Y and C is a countably irreducible closed subset of X, then cl(f (C)) is a countably irreducible closed subset of Y .
Proposition 3.10 A closed subspace of a countably sober space is countably sober.
Proposition 3.11 A saturated subspace of a countably sober space is countably sober.
Proposition 3.12 A retract of a countably sober space is countably sober.
Theorem 3.13 The product of countably sober spaces is countably sober.
Proof. The statement has been proved for sober spaces in [3, Theorem 8.4.8], and the same proof carries over to this setting.	2
Lemma 3.14 If f, g : X → Y are continuous, X is countably sober, and Y is T0, then the equalizer {x ∈ X : f (x)= g(x)} is countably sober.
Proof. Let Z = {x ∈ X : f (x) = g(x)}, and let C be a countably irreducible closed set in Z (as a subspace of X). The the closure cl(C) of C in X is countably irreducible closed in X, and C = cl(C) ∩ Z. Since X is countably sober, there is a unique x ∈ X such that cl(C) is the closure of x in X. We claim that f (x)= g(x). Otherwise, f (x) /= g(x). Since Y is T0, we assume that there is an open set U in Y such that f (x) ∈ U and g(x) ∈/ U without loss of generality. Since f (x) ∈ U , x ∈ f−1(U ). Since x is also in the closure of C in X, f−1(U ) ∩ C /= ∅. Let y be any point in f−1(U ) ∩C. Since y ∈ C ⊆ Z, g(y)= f (y) ∈ U . Since y ∈ C ⊆ cl(C)= ↓x, y ≤ x, whence g(y) ≤ g(x). Since g(y) ∈ U , g(x) ∈ U , a contradiction.	2
Let Top be the category of topological spaces and continuous maps. Recall that any limit can be obtained as an equalizer of two morphisms whose source and target objects are products. We can get the following.
Theorem 3.15 Any limit taken in Top of countably sober spaces is countably sober. The category of countably sober spaces and continuous maps is complete, and limits are computed as in Top.
Proposition 3.16 Let X be a topological space. If Y is countably sober, then the set Top(X, Y ) of all continuous functions f : X → Y equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence is countably sober.

Proof. For all x ∈ X , let px : Y X → Y be a projection. Let A be a countably irreducible closed subset of Top(X, Y ) with the topology induced by the product topology on Y X . Then clY X (A) is closed in Y X , where clY X (A) is the closure of A in Y X . Thus clY (px(clY X (A))) = clY (px(A)) is a countably irreducible closed set for each x ∈ X. As Y is supposed to be countably sober, there is a unique ax ∈ Y such that clY (px(clY X (A))) = clY (px(A)) = clY ({ax}). Define f : X → Y as f (x)= ax for every x ∈ X. We now show that f is continuous. Let x ∈ X and V ∈ O(f (x)), since f (x) = ax and ax ∈ clY (px(A)), px(A) ∩ V /= ∅. That is, there exists a ∈ A such that a(x) ∈ V . As a is continuous, there is U ∈ O(X) such that a(U ) ⊆ V . Since a(z) ∈ pz(A) ⊆ clY ({az}) for every z ∈ U , a(z) ≤ az. Note that az = f (z) and V = ↑V , f (z) ∈ V . We conclude that f (U ) ⊆ V . Thus f is continuous and A = clT op(X,Y )(A) = (clY X (A)) ∩ Top(X, Y ) = (clY X ({f})) ∩ Top(X, Y ) = clT op(X,Y )({f}).

Countable filters
In this section, we generalize filters to countable filters and give some characteriza- tions of countably sober spaces via countable filters.
Definition 4.1 Let L be a complete lattice and F ⊆ L.
F is called a countable ﬁlter if F = ↑F and  i∈Z+ xi ∈ F for all {xi : i ∈
Z+}⊆ F .
F is called a completely prime countable ﬁlter if F is a countable filter and for all S ⊆ L,  S ∈ F implies S ∩ F /= ∅.
It is obvious that countable filters are filters in a complete lattice. Let X be a set, F = {X \ C : C ∈ CountX}. Then F is a countable filter of the complete lattice P(X), where P(X) is the powerset lattice of X. Let X be a topological space, x ∈ X. Then N (x) isa filter of P(X), but in general N (x) is not a countable filter of P(X). In the real number space R, {(−1/n, 1/n) : n ∈ Z } ⊆ N (0), but
 i∈Z+ (−1/n, 1/n)= {0} ∈/ N (0). To our delight, the neighbourhood of each point in a P -space is a countable filter.
Definition 4.2 ([2,7]) A point p ∈ X is called a P -point if its filter of neighbour- hoods is closed under countable intersection. A space X is called a P -space if every point in X is a P -point.
Proposition 4.3 Let X be a topological space. The following conditions are equiv- alent:
X is a P-space;
For all x ∈ X, O(x) is a countable ﬁlter of O(X);
For all x ∈ X, N (x) is a countable ﬁlter of P(X);
The intersection of any countable open sets in X is an open set.

Proof. (3) ⇒ (4) ⇒ (1): Trivial.
⇒ (2): Let x ∈ X. Obviously, O(x) is an upper set in the lattice of open sets
O(X). If {Ui : i ∈ Z+}⊆ O(x), in order to show that  O(X){Ui : i ∈ Z+}∈ O(x),
Since X is a P -space,	i∈Z+ Ui ∈ N (y). Thus  i∈Z+ Ui ∈ O(X).
⇒ (3): Let x ∈ X. Obviously, N (x) is an upper set in P(X). If {Vi : i ∈ Z+}⊆ 
N (x), then there exists Ui ∈ O(X) such that x ∈ Ui ⊆ Vi for all i ∈ Z+. Thus
{Ui : i ∈ Z+}⊆ O(X). Since O(x) is a countable filter of O(X) by (2),  O(X){Ui : i ∈ Z+} = int( i∈Z+ Ui) ∈ O(x). Thus x ∈ int( i∈Z+ Ui) ⊆ i∈Z+ Ui ⊆ i∈Z+ Vi. Therefore,  i∈Z+ Vi ∈ N (x).	2
Example 4.4 (1) Recall that a topological space is called an Alexandroff-discrete space iff every intersection (even infinite) of opens is again open. All Alexandroff- discrete spaces are P -spaces.
(2) Let P be countably directed complete poset. Then (P, σc(P )) is a P -space.
Theorem 4.5 Let X be a topological space. Consider the following two conditions:
X is countably sober;
For all completely prime countable ﬁlter F of O(X), there is a unique x ∈ X
such that F = O(x).
Then (1) ⇒ (2); if X is a P-space, then (2) ⇒ (1), and (1) and (2) are equivalent.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Let F be a completely prime countable filter of O(X), and let
O = S{U ∈ O(X) : U ∈/ F}. Then O ∈ O(X) and O ∈/ F. Let C = X \ O. We
claim that C is a countably irreducible closed in X. Assume that {B : i ∈ Z } is a family closed sets in X with C ⊆ Si∈Z+ Bi. Then O = X\C = X\C∩(Si∈Z+ Bi)= X \ Si∈Z+ (C ∩ Bi) =  i∈Z+ (X \ (C ∩ Bi)) =  O(X){X \ (C ∩ Bi) : i ∈ Z+} and
 O(X){X \ (C ∩ Bi) : i ∈ Z+} ∈/ F. Since F is a countable filter of O(X), there
exists i ∈ Z+ such that X \ (C ∩ Bi) ∈/ F. Note that X \ (C ∩ Bi) ∈ O(X),
X \ (C ∩ Bi) ⊆ O. Thus C = X \ O ⊆ C ∩ Bi ⊆ Bi. Hence C is a countably irreducible closed in X. Since X is countably sober, there is a unique x ∈ X such
that C = cl({x}). We now prove that F = O(x). For all V ∈ O(x), if V ∈/ F, then
x ∈ V ⊆ O = X \ C. Thus x ∈/ C, a contradiction. On the other hand, for all
V ∈ F, if x ∈/ V , then V ∩ cl({x})= V ∩C = ∅. Thus V ⊆ X \C = O, hence O ∈ F. This is a contradiction. Together, F = O(x) and the uniqueness of x follow.
⇒ (1): Let C be a countably irreducible closed set in X, and let F = {U ∈ O(X): U ∩ C /= ∅}. We show F is a completely prime countable filter of O(X).
If U ∈ F, V ∈ O(X) with U ⊆ V , then V ∈ F;
If {Ui : i ∈ Z+} ⊆ F, then Ui ∩ C /= ∅ for all i ∈ Z+. Since C is countably irreducible closed, ( i∈Z+ Ui) ∩ C /= ∅ by Proposition 4.3. Since X is a P -space,
i∈Z+ Ui ∈ O(X) by Proposition 4.3. Hence	O(X){Ui : i ∈ Z+} =	i∈Z+ Ui ∈ F.
For any {Ui : i ∈ I} ⊆ O(X), if	i∈I Ui ∈ F, then ( i∈I Ui) ∩ C /= ∅. Thus
Ui ∩ C /= ∅ for some i ∈ I. Hence Ui ∈ F.
By precondition (2), there exists a unique x ∈ X such that F = O(x). We now prove C = cl({x}). For all V ∈ O(x)= F, V ∩C /= ∅. Hence x ∈ cl(C)= C. On the

other hand, for all y ∈ C, if U ∈ O(y), then y ∈ U ∩ C /= ∅. Thus U ∈F = O(x). So x ∈ U and y ∈ cl({x}). Thus C ⊆ cl({x}). Therefore C = cl({x}) and the uniqueness of x is obvious.	2

Theorem 4.6 Let X be a topological space. Consider the following conditions:
X is countably sober;
For all Scott open countable ﬁlter F of O(X) and U ∈ O(X),  F ⊆ U implies
U ∈ F;
For all completely prime countable ﬁlter F of O(X) and U ∈ O(X),  F ⊆ U
implies U ∈ F.
Then (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3); if X is a P-space, and (3) ⇒ (1), thus all three conditions are equivalent.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Let F be a Scott open countable filter F of O(X) and U ∈ O(X) with  F ⊆ U . Assume U ∈/ F. Let A = O(X) \F, then U ∈ A. Since F is a Scott open set of O(X), (A, ⊆) is a dcpo. Thus there exists a maximal element O in A such that U ⊆ O. Let C = X \ O. We now prove that C is countably irreducible.
Let {Bi : i ∈ Z+} be a family of closed sets in X with C ⊆ Si∈Z+ Bi. Then
O = X\C = X\Si∈Z+ (C∩Bi)=  i∈Z+ X\(C∩Bi)=  O(X){X\(C∩Bi): i ∈ Z+}.
Since O ∈/ F and F is a countable filter of O(X), there exists some i ∈ Z+ such that
X\(C∩Bi)= (X\C)∪(X\Bi)= O∪(X\Bi) ∈/ F. Then O∪(X\Bi) ∈ A. It follows from the maximality of O that X \ Bi ⊆ O ∪ (X \ Bi)= O. Then C = X \ O ⊆ Bi. Hence C is a countably irreducible closed set in X. Since X is countably sober, there is a unique x ∈ X such that C = cl({x}). Since U ⊆ O = X \ cl({x}), x ∈/ U . Since  F ⊆ U , x ∈/  F. Then there exists V ∈F such that x ∈/ V . Thus
V ⊆ X \ cl({x}) = O. Since V ∈ F, O ∈ F. But O ∈ A = O(X) \ F. This is a contradiction. Therefore U ∈ F.
⇒ (3): Trivial.
⇒ (1): Let C be a countably irreducible closed set in X, and let F = {U ∈ O(X) : U ∩ C /= ∅}. Since X is a P -space, F is a completely prime countable filter of O(X). We claim that (  F) ∩ C /= ∅. In fact, if (  F) ∩ C = ∅, then
 F ⊆ X \ C. By precondition (3), X \ C ∈ F, a contradiction. Let x ∈ (  F) ∩ C, then cl({x}) ⊆ C. On the other hand, if C ¢ cl({x}), then C ∩ (X \ cl({x})) /= ∅. Thus X \ cl({x}) ∈ F and x ∈  F ⊆ X \ cl({x}). This is a contradiction. Hence C ⊆ cl({x}). Therefore C = cl({x}).	2

For a topological space X, the poset of all Scott open countable filters of O(X) is denoted by OCFilt(O(X)), and the poset of compact saturated subsets of X with the order reverse to containment is denoted by Q(X). For all F ∈ OCFilt(O(X)), it follows from Theorem 4.6 that  F ∈ Q(X). For all K ∈ Q(X), Let U (K) = 
{O ∈ O(X) : K ⊆ O}. Then by Proposition 4.3, U (K) ∈ OCFilt(O(X)) if X is a P -space. We now get the following theorem, which we call the Hofmann-Mislove Theorem for countably sober spaces.

Theorem 4.7 If X is both a countably sober space and a P-space, then the mapping
Φ: Q(X) → OCFilt(O(X)), Φ(K)= U (K)
is an order isomorphism between Q(X) and OCFilt(O(X)), and the inverse of Φ
is:
Ψ: OCFilt(O(X)) → Q(X), Ψ(F)=   F.
