Abstract
In this paper, we construct a new way below relation from any given T0 space by making use of the cut operator, and introduce the concepts of SI2-continuous spaces and SI2-quasicontinuous spaces. The main results are: (1) a space (X, τ ) is SI2-continuous iff the set X equipped with the SI2-topology τSI2 is a
C-space; (2) a space (X, τ ) is SI2-quasicontinuous iff (X, τSI2 ) is a locally hypercompact space; (3) a space is SI2-continuous iff it is a meet SI2-continuous and SI2-quasicontinuous space.
Keywords: SI2-continuous space, SI2-quasicontinuous space, meet SI2-continuous space, irreducible set


Introduction
The theory of continuous domains, due to its strong background in computer science, general topology and logic, has been extensively studied by people from various areas (see [1,7,8]). An important direction in the study of continuous domains is to extend the theory of continuous domains to that of posets as much as possible, and a lot of work has been done in this area (see [10,11,12,13,14,16]), but it is still rather restrictive, taking into consideration only the case of existing a join.

[4,6], Erne´ introduced s2-continuous posets and precontinuous posets respectively by making use of the cut operator instead of joins. The notions of s2-continuity and precontinuity generalize the important characterizations of continuity from dcpos to arbitrary posets and have the advantage that not even the existence of directed joins is required. Recently, based on Ern´e’s work, many interesting continuity of posets were investigated (see [17,21,22,23,24,25]).
As we all known, the non-empty irreducible subsets of a poset with respect to the Alexandroff topology are exactly the directed sets, and the Scott topology σ(P ) ona poset P is defined by directed suprema, i.e., U ∈ σ(P ) if and only if U =↑ U and for any directed set D, ∨D ∈ U implies D∩U /= ∅ whenever ∨D exists. In [20], Zhao and Ho gave a new method of deriving a new topology τSI out of a given T0 space which makes use of the replacement of directed sets with irreducible sets, and proved that (X, τ ) is SI-continuous if and only if X equipped with irreducible-derived topology τSI is a C-space. Furthermore, a deep study concerning the replacement of directed sets with irreducible sets can be found in [2,3].
Motivated by the works of Zhao and Ho, we continue to develop domain theory in T0 spaces. In this paper, we define a new way below relation in T0 spaces by making use of the cut operator and introduce the concept of SI2-continuous spaces. It is proved that a space (X, τ ) is SI2-continuous if and only if the set X equipped with the SI2-topology τSI2 is a C-space. As a common generalization of both SI2- continuous spaces and quasicontinuous domains, we introduce the concept of SI2- quasicontinuous spaces and prove that a space (X, τ ) is SI2-quasicontinuous if and only if (X, τSI2 ) is a locally hypercompact space. Finally, we introduce the concept of meet SI2-continuous spaces and prove that a space is SI2-continuous if and only if it is a meet SI2-continuous and SI2-quasicontinuous space.
We would like to thank the referee for informing us that some properties of SI2-topology are also presented in [18]. It is also proved that a space (X, τ ) is SI2-continuous if and only if (X, τSI2 ) is a C-space independently in [18].

Preliminaries
In this section, we recall some basic definitions and notations needed in this paper; more detail can be found in [8,20]. For a poset P , x ∈ P and A ⊆ P , let ↓x = {y ∈
P : y ≤ x}, ↓ A = S{↓ x : x ∈ A}; ↑ x and ↑ A are defined dually. A subset A is
called an upper set if A =↑ A and a lower set is defined dually. A↑ and A↓ denote the sets of all upper and lower bounds of A, respectively. Let Aδ = (A↑)↓. We put P (<ω) = {F ⊆ P : F is finite} and FinP = {↑ F : F ∈ P (<ω)}.
For a poset P , the topology generated by the collection of sets P\ ↓x(as subbasic open subsets) is called the upper topology and denoted by υ(P ); the lower topology ω(P ) on P is defined dually. The Alexandroff topology A(P ) on a poset P is the topology consisting of all its upper subsets. A subset U of a poset P is called Scott open if U =↑ U and D ∩ U /= ∅ for all directed sets D ⊆ P with ∨D ∈ U whenever
∨D exists. The topology formed by all the Scott open sets of P is called the Scott topology, written as σ(P ). For a poset P and x, y ∈ P , we say that x is way-below

y and write x  y if for every directed set D ⊆ P with ∨D exists, x ≤ ∨D implies x ≤ d for some d ∈ D. A poset P is called continuous if {y ∈ P : x  y} is directed and x = ∨{y ∈ P : x  y} for each x ∈ P . We order the collection of nonempty subset of a poset P by G ≤ H if H ⊆↑ G. We say that a family of sets is directed if given F1, F2 in the family, there exists F in the family such that F1, F2 ≤ F , i.e., F ⊆↑ F1∩↑ F2.
Let (X, τ ) be a topological space. A non-empty subset F of (X, τ ) is irreducible if whenever F ⊆ A ∪ B for closed sets A and B, then F ⊆ A or F ⊆ B. The set of all irreducible subsets of (X, τ ) is denoted by Irrτ (X). A space (X, τ ) is called a C-space if for any U ∈ τ , x ∈ U , there exists u ∈ U such that x ∈ intτ ↑ u. A space (X, τ ) is called locally hypercompact if for any x and any open set U containing x, there exists a finite set E such that x ∈ intτ ↑ E ⊆↑ E ⊆ U . Obviously, a C-space is locally hypercompact.
Give a topological space (X, τ ), denote the interior of a subset A ⊆ X by intτ A and the closure of A by clτ A. For a T0 topological space (X, τ ), the specialization order ≤τ on (X, τ ) is defined by x ≤τ y if and only if x ∈ clτ (y). Unless otherwise stated, throughout the paper, whenever an order-theoretic concepts is mentioned, it is to be interpreted with respect to the specialization order on (X, τ ).
Definition 2.1 ([7,15]) Let P be a poset and x, y ∈ P .
Define a relation ≺ on P by x ≺ y iff y ∈ intυ(P ) ↑x.
P is called hypercontinuous if for all x ∈ P , x =  {u ∈ P : u ≺ x} and
{u ∈ P : u ≺ x} is directed.
P is called quasi-hypercontinuous if for all x ∈ P and U ∈ υ(P ) with x ∈ U , there exists H ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intυ(P ) ↑H ⊆↑H ⊆ U .
it is proven in [5,15] thata poset P is hypercontinuous if and only if for all x ∈ P and U ∈ υ(P ) with x ∈ U , there exists y ∈ P such that x ∈ intυ(P ) ↑ y ⊆↑ y ⊆ U , that is, a poset P is hypercontinuous iff P equipped with the upper topology υ(P )) is a C-space.
Definition 2.2 ([4]) Let P be a poset.
For any x, y ∈ P , define  2 on P by x  2 y if for all directed sets D ⊆ P with y ∈ Dδ, there exists d ∈ D such that x ≤ d. The set {y ∈ P : y 2 x} will be denoted by ⇓x and {y ∈ P : x  y} denoted by ⇑x.
P is called s2-continuous if for all x ∈ P , x ∈ (⇓x)δ and ⇓x is directed.
Definition 2.3 ([4,5]) Let P be a poset. A subset U ⊆ P is called weak Scott open if it satisfies
U =↑U ;
for all directed sets D ⊆ P , Dδ ∩ U /= ∅ implies D ∩ U /= ∅.
The collection of all weak Scott open subsets of P forms a topology. This topology will be called the weak Scott topology of P and will be denoted by σ2(P ). Obviously, σ2(P ) ⊆ σ(P ) and σ2(P )= σ(P ) if P is a dcpo.

Theorem 2.4 ([4]) Let P be a poset. Then the following statements are equivalent.
P is s2-continuous;
(P, σ2(P )) is a C-space.
Definition 2.5 ([21]) Let P be a poset and G, H ⊆ P .
Define G 2 H if for all directed sets D ⊆ P , ↑H ∩Dδ /= ∅ implies ↑G∩D /= ∅. We write G  2 x for G  2 {x} and y  2 H for {y}  2 H.
P is called s2-quasicontinuous if for each x ∈ P , w(x)= {F ⊆ P : F ∈ P (<ω)
and F  2 x} is directed and ↑x =  {↑F : F ∈ w(x) }.
Theorem 2.6 ([21]) Let P be a poset. Then the following statements are equiva- lent.
P is s2-quasicontinuous;
(P, σ2(P )) is locally hypercompact.
Definition 2.7 ([20]) Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space. A subset U of X is called SI-open
if the following conditions are satisfied:
U ∈ τ ;
For any F ∈ Irrτ (X), ∨F ∈ U implies F ∩ U /= ∅ whenever ∨F exists.
The collection of all SI-open sets of (X, τ ) is denoted by τSI . Obviously, τSI ⊆ τ .
Definition 2.8 ([20]) Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space.
Define x SI y if for any irreducible set, y ≤ ∨F implies x ∈↓ F whenever ∨F exists. Denote the set {x ∈ X : x  SI a} by ⇓SI a and the set {x ∈ X : a  SI x} by ⇑SI a.
(X, τ ) is called SI-continuous if for any x ∈ X, the following conditions hold:
⇑SI x is open in (X, τ ).
⇓SI x is directed and x = ∨ ⇓SI x.
It is proven in [2] that the condition ”directed” in Definition 2.8(2) can be replaced by ”irreducible” condition and one still has an equivalent continuous.
Theorem 2.9 ([20]) Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space. Then the following statements are equivalent.
(X, τSI ) is a C-space;
(X, τ ) is SI-continuous.
Lemma 2.10 ([9]) (Order Rudin Lemma) Let P be a preorder and F a directed family of ﬁnitary upper sets of P. Any lower set L that meets all members of F has a directed lower subset D that still meets all members of F.

SI2-continuous spaces
In this section, we introduce a new concept of SI2-continuous spaces and prove that a space (X, τ ) is SI2-continuous if and only if the set X equipped with the SI2-topology τSI2 is a C-space.
Definition 3.1 Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space and x, y ∈ X.
δ
Define x  SI2 y if for any F ∈ Irrτ (X), y ∈ F  implies x ∈↓ F . Denote the
set {x ∈ X : x  SI2 a} by ⇓SI2 a, and the set {x ∈ X : a  SI2 x} by ⇑SI2 a.
(X, τ ) is called SI2-continuous if for each x ∈ X, the following conditions hold:
⇑SI2 x is open in (X, τ ).
⇓SI2 x is directed and x = ∨ ⇓SI2 x.

In fact, we have x = ∨ ⇓SI2
x iff x ∈ (⇓SI2
x)δ since ⇓SI
x ⊆↓x.

Proposition 3.2 Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space and x, y, u, v ∈ X. Then
If x  SI2 y, then x ≤ y.
If u ≤ x  SI2 y ≤ v, then u  SI2 v.
If a smallest element ⊥ exists, then ⊥  SI2 x.
x  SI2 y implies x  SI y.
If (X, τ ) is an SI2-continuous space, then x  SI y ⇔ x  SI2 y.
If (X, τ ) is an SI2-continuous space, then (X, τ ) is SI-continuous.
Proof. The conditions (1)-(4) are straightforward.
Suppose x  SI y. Since (X, τ ) is an SI2-continuous, y = ∨ ⇓SI2 y and ⇓SI2 y is directed. Since every directed set is irreducible, by the definition of  SI , we have that x ∈↓ (⇓SI2 y) =⇓SI2 y. Thus x  SI2 y.
It is straightforward from (5)	2
Definition 3.3 Let (X, τ ) bea T0 space. A subset U of X is called SI2-open if the following conditions are satisfied:
U ∈ τ ;
For any F ∈ Irrτ (X), Fδ ∩ U /= ∅ implies F ∩ U /= ∅.
The collection of all SI2-open subsets of (X, τ ) forms a topology. This topology will be called SI2-topology and denoted by τSI2 . The complement of an SI2-open set is called SI2-closed. Recall that an upper set F in a poset P is a filter if every finite subset of F has a lower bounded in F . Let SOFiltτ (X) denote the collection of all SI2-open filters in (X, τ ).
Proposition 3.4 Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space. Then the following conditions hold.
For any x ∈ X, clτ {x} = clτSI {x}.
The specialization orders of spaces (X, τ ) and (X, τSI2 ) coincide.

A closed set C in (X, τ ) is SI2-closed if and only if for any F ∈ Irrτ (X),
F ⊆ C implies Fδ ⊆ C.
An open set U in (X, τ ) is SI2-open if and only if for any F ∈ Irrτ (X),
Fδ ∩ U /= ∅ implies F ∩ U /= ∅.
τSI2 ⊆ τSI ⊆ τ.
A set U is clopen in (X, τ ) if and only if it is clopen in (X, τSI2 ).
U is co-prime in τSI2 if and only if U ∈ SOFiltτ (X).
If y ∈ intτSI  ↑ x, then x  SI2 y.
Proof. The conditions (1)-(5) are easy to obtained.
Obviously, if U is clopen in (X, τSI2 ), then U is clopen in (X, τ ). Without loss of generality, assume that U is a non-trivial clopen set in (X, τ ). Let F ∈ Irrτ (X) with U ∩ Fδ /= ∅. If U ∩ F = ∅, then F ⊆ X\U . Since X\U is clopen, Fδ ⊆ X\U , a contradiction. Hence U ∩ F /= ∅. So U is SI2-open. Similarly, we can deduce that X\U is SI2-open.
Let U is co-prime in τSI2 . It is suffices to show that U is a filter. Suppose
x, y ∈ U . Then X\ ↓ x and X\ ↓ y are SI -open and U ¢ (X\ ↓ x)  (X\ ↓
y) = X\(↓ x  ↓ y) since U is co-prime in τSI . So there exists z ∈ U such that
2
z /∈ X\(↓ x	↓ y), that is, z ≤ x, y. Thus U is a filter. Conversely, suppose that U
is not a co-prime in τSI , then there exist V, W ∈ τSI such that U ⊆ V S W with
2	2
U ¢ V and U ¢ W . Choose x ∈ U\V and y ∈ U\W . Since U is a filter, there is a z ∈ U such that z ≤ x and z ≤ y. Then we have z /∈ V S W , a contradiction.
Hence, (7) holds.

Let y ∈ intτ

SI2
↑ x and F ∈ Irrτ (X). If y ∈ Fδ, then intτ

SI2
↑ x ∩ Fδ /= ∅.

By Definition 3.3, intτSI  ↑ x ∩ F /= ∅. Thus x ∈↓ F and x  SI2 y.	2
Lemma 3.5 Let (X, τ ) be a locally hypercompact space. If A is an irreducible set in (X, τ ), then there exists a directed subset D ⊆↓ A such that D↑ = A↑. Furthermore, we have Dδ = Aδ, clτ D = clτ A.
Proof. Let A ∈ Irrτ (X). Consider the collection F = {↑ F ∈ FinP : A ∩ intτ ↑ F /= ∅}. Let H, G ∈ F. Then intτ (↑ H) ∩ intτ (↑ G) ∩ A /= ∅ since A is irreducible. Pick x in this intersection. Since (X, τ ) is locally hypercompact, there exists E ∈ X(<ω) such that x ∈ intτ (↑ E) ⊆↑ E ⊆ intτ (↑ H) ∩ intτ (↑ G). Then ↑ E ∈ F and E ⊆↑ H∩ ↑ G. Thus F is directed and ↑ F∩ ↓ A /= ∅ for any ↑ F ∈ F. By Lemma 2.10, there is a directed set D ⊆↓ A such that D∩ ↑ F /= ∅ for every
↑ F ∈ F. Obviously, A↑ ⊆ D↑ since D ⊆↓ A. Let y be an upper bound of D. Assume that y /∈ A↑, then there exists x ∈ A such that x ¢ y. Since (X, τ ) is a locally hypercompact space and x ∈ X\ ↓ y ∈ τ , there is a finite subset F of X such that x ∈ intτ ↑ F ⊆↑ F ⊆ X\ ↓ y. Thus ↑ F ∈ F. So D∩ ↑ F /= ∅. Thus D ∩ (X\↓ y) /= ∅, that is, there is a d ∈ D such that d ¢ y, a contradiction. Hence D↑ ⊆ A↑. Therefore, D↑ = A↑, then we have Dδ = Aδ.
Now we show that clτ A = clτ D. Obviously, clτ D ⊆ clτ A. Let x ∈ clτ A, U ∈ τ
and x ∈ U . Since (X, τ ) is locally hypercompact, there exists G ∈ P (<ω) such that

x ∈ intτ ↑ G ⊆↑ G ⊆ U . Note that x ∈ clτ A, thus A ∩ intτ ↑ G /= ∅. So ↑ G ∈ F, which implies D∩↑ G /= ∅ and D∩U /= ∅. Thus x ∈ clτ D. Therefore clτ D = clτ A.2
Since a C-space is locally hypercompact, by Lemma 3.5, we have the following result.
Lemma 3.6 ([20]) If F is an irreducible subset of a C-space (X, τ ), then there is a directed subset D ⊆↓ F such that D↑ = F↑. In particular, ∨D = ∨F, if either exists.
Lemma 3.7 Let P be a poset. Then the following conditions hold.
υ(P )SI2 = υ(P )SI = υ(P ).
A(P )SI2 = σ2(P ).
If P is an s2-continuous poset, then σ2(P )SI2 = σ2(P )SI = σ2(P ).
Proof. (1) By Proposition 3.4(5), υ(P )SI2 ⊆ υ(P )SI ⊆ υ(P ). For any x ∈ P , let F be an irreducible set with Fδ ∩ (P\↓ x) /= ∅. Then there exists z ∈ Fδ such that z ¢ x. Suppose F ∩ (P\↓ x)= ∅. Then x ∈ F↑, so z ≤ x, a contradiction. Hence
holds as desired.
Because a non-empty subset F ⊆ P is irreducible with respect to the Alexandoff topology A(P ) iff it is a directed set.
Obviously, σ2(P )SI2 ⊆ σ2(P )SI ⊆ σ2(P ). Let P be an s2-continuous poset.	 By Theorem 2.4, (P, σ2(P )) is a C-space. Let U ∈ σ2(P ) and F ∈ Irrτ (X). If	 Fδ ∩ U /= ∅, by Lemma 3.6, there is a directed set D ⊆↓ F such that Dδ = Fδ.	 Thus we have that D ∩ U /= ∅, which implies F ∩ U /= ∅. Hence U ∈ σ2(P )SI2 .	 Therefore, σ2(P )SI2 = σ2(P )SI = σ2(P ).	2
The following example shows that an SI-open set need not be SI2-open.
Example 3.8 ([4]) Consider three disjoint countable sets A = {an : n ∈ N0},B =
{bn : n ∈ N0},C = {cn : n ∈ N}, and the order ≤ on P = A ∪ B ∪ C is defined as follows:
↓ a0 = {a0}∪ B,
↓ an = {bm : m < n}(n ∈ N,n /= 1, 2),
↓ a1 = {b0}∪ C,
↓ a2 = {b0, b1}∪ C,
↓ bn = {bn}(n ∈ N0),
↓ cn = {cm : m ≤ n}(n ∈ N),
x ≤ y ⇔ x ∈↓ y.
Then ↑ b0 is open in σ(P ) but not in σ2(P ) since C = {cn : n ∈ N} is a directed lower set with b0 ∈ Cδ∩↑ b0 /= ∅ while C∩↑ b0 = ∅. Thus ↑ b0 ∈ A(P )SI = σ(P ), but ↑ b0 /∈ A(P )SI2 = σ2(P ). Therefore, ↑ b0 is an SI-open set but not SI2-open in (P, A(P )).
The following theorem exhibits an important property of relation SI2 on SI2- continuous spaces, i.e., the interpolation property.

Theorem 3.9 Let (X, τ ) be an SI2-continuous. Then the following conditions hold.
The relation  SI2 satisﬁes interpolation property, i.e., x  SI2  z implies
x  SI2 y  SI2 z for some y ∈ X.

If x  SI2
z and z ∈ Fδ for an irreducible set F in (X, τ ), then x  SI
y for

some element y ∈ F.
Proof. (1) Let x  SI z. Since (X, τ ) is SI2-continuous, z ∈ (⇓SI z)δ ⊆ (S{(⇓SI
δ	δ	2S	δ	2	2
y) : y ∈⇓SI2 z}) = ( {⇓SSI2 y : y ∈⇓SI2 z}) . As the union of a directed family
of directed sets is directed,	{⇓SI2 y : y ∈⇓SI2 z} is directed. By the definition of
 SI2 , there exist y ∈⇓SI2 z and w ∈⇓SI2 y such that x ≤ w. Thus x  SI2 y  SI2 z.
(2) It is straightforward from (1).	2
Lemma 3.10 If a space (X, τ ) is SI2-continuous, then all sets ⇑SI2 x for x ∈ X
are SI2-open.
Proof. Since (X, τ ) is SI2-continuous, ⇑SI2 x ∈ τ . Let F be an irreducible subset

with Fδ∩ ⇑SI
x /= ∅. Then there exists z ∈ Fδ such that x SI
z. By Theorem

3.9(2), there is a y ∈ F such that x  SI2 y. Thus F∩ ⇑SI2 x /= ∅. Hence ⇑SI2 x is SI2-open.	2
Proposition 3.11 Let (X, τ ) be an SI2-continuous space and x ∈ X. Then
An upper set U is SI2-open iff for every x ∈ U, there is a u ∈ U such that
u  SI2 x.
The sets of the form ⇑SI2 x, x ∈ X form a basis for the SI2-topology.
intτSI ↑ x =⇑SI2 x.


For any subset A ⊆ X, intτ


SI2
A = S{⇑SI
u :⇑SI2
u ⊆ A}.

Proof. (1)Let U be an SI2-open and x ∈ U . Since (X, τ ) is SI2-continuous, x ∈

(⇓SI2
δ and ⇓SI
x is directed. Thus U ∩ (⇓SI2
δ /= ∅. It follows that there exists

u ∈ U such that u  SI2 x. Conversely, if for any x ∈ U , there is a u ∈ U such that
u  SI2 x, then U = {⇑SI2 u : u ∈ U}, which is SI2-open by Lemma 3.10. Thus U
is SI2-open.
It is immediate consequence of (1).
By Proposition 3.4(8), intτSI	↑ x ⊆⇑SI2 x. By Lemma 3.10, ⇑SI2 x is
SI2-open and ⇑SI2 x ⊆↑ x. Thus intτSI  ↑ x =⇑SI2 x.
2
This follows directly from (2).	2
Lemma 3.12 In an SI2-continuous space (X, τ ) the following hold.
If x  SI2 y, then there is an SI2-open ﬁlter U with y ∈ U ⊆⇑SI2 x.
If y /≤ z, then there is an SI2-open ﬁlter U containing y but not z.
Proof. (1) By the interpolation property, we construct inductively a decreasing
sequence of elements yn with x  SI2 ...  SI2 yn  SI2 yn−1  SI2 ...  SI2 y1 = y.
Set U = S{⇑SI yn : n = 1, 2, ...}. Clearly, y ∈ U and U ⊆⇑SI x. Now we show
2
that U is an SI2-open filter. Clearly, U is an upper set. If x1, x2 ∈ U , then there

are yn1 , yn2 such that x1 ∈⇑SI2 yn1 , x2 ∈⇑SI2 yn2 . Without loss of generality, we assume that n1 ≤ n2, then yn2  SI2 yn1  SI2 x1. Thus yn2 ≤ x1, x2. Note that yn2 ∈ U . Thus U is a filter. It is from Proposition 3.11 that U is SI2-open.
(2) Suppose that y /≤ z. Since (X, τ ) is SI2-continuous, y = ∨ ⇓SI2 y. It follows

that z /∈ (⇓SI2
↑. Thus there exists x ∈⇓SI
y such that x /≤ z. By the condition

, there is an SI2-open filter U such that y ∈ U ⊆⇑SI2 x, but z /∈ U .	2
Theorem 3.13 Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space. Then the following conditions are equiv- alent.
(X, τ ) is SI2-continuous;
each ⇑SI x is SI2-open, and if U ∈ τSI , then U = S{⇑SI x : x ∈ U};
2	2	2
SOFiltτ (X) is a basis of τSI2 and (τSI2 , ⊆) is a continuous lattice;
τSI2 has enough co-primes and (τSI2 , ⊆) is a continuous lattices;
(X, τSI2 ) is a C-space.
Proof. (1)⇒(2) By Lemma 3.10 and Proposition 3.11.
⇒(3) Obviously, ⇑SI2 x ∈ τ is open. By Proposition 3.11 and Lemma 3.12, SOFiltτ (X) isa basis of τSI2 . In order to prove the continuity of τSI2 , let U ∈ τSI2 . For any x ∈ U , there is a y ∈ U such that y  SI2 x by (2). Then x ∈⇑SI2 y ∈ τSI2 ,
and we claim that ⇑SI2 y   U . Indeed, if D is a directed family of SI2-open sets
with U ⊆ S D, then there exists W ∈D such that y ∈ W . Thus ⇑SI y ⊆↑ y ⊆ W .
2
Thus U =	{V : V  U}.
⇔ (4) Consequence of Proposition 3.4(7).
(3)⇒(5) Let x ∈ U ∈ τSI2 . Since (τSI2 , ⊆) is continuous, there exists V ∈ τSI2 such that x ∈ V  U . Since SOFiltτ (X) is a basis of τSI2 , there exists F ∈ SOFiltτ (X) such that x ∈ F ⊆ V . Now we show that there exists y ∈ U such that x ∈ F ⊆↑ y. If not, then for any y ∈ U , F ¢↑ y. Thus y ∈ X\ ↓ zy for some zy ∈ F , and thus there exists Fy ∈ SOFiltτ (X) such that y ∈ Fy ⊆ X\↓ zy. Hence
U ⊆  {Fy : y ∈ U}. Since V   U , there exists a finite set {yi : i = 1, 2, ..., n}
such that V ⊆ S{Fy ∈ SOFiltτ (X) : i = 1, 2, ..., n}. Let zy = zi. Then zi ∈ F .
i
Since F is a filter, there exists z ∈ F such that z ≤ zi for all i. Notice that
z ∈ F ⊆ V ⊆ S{Fy  ∈ SOFiltτ (X) : i = 1, 2, ..., n}.  Then there is a Fy	∈
k
SOFiltτ (X) such that z ∈ Fk ⊆ X\ ↓ zk, which contradicts z ≤ zi. Thus there

exists y ∈ U such that x ∈ F ⊆↑ y. Since F is SI2-open, x ∈ intτSI
↑ y ⊆↑ y ⊆ U .

Hence (X, τSI2 ) is a C-space.
(5)⇒(1) Let (X, τSI2 ) be a C-space.  For any x ∈ X, let Dx = {y ∈ X :
x ∈ intτSI  ↑ y}. By Proposition 3.4(8), Dx ⊆⇓SI2 x. First we show that Dx is

directed and x = ∨Dx. For any d1, d2 ∈ Dx, x ∈ intτSI
↑ d1 ∩ intτSI
↑ d2 ∈ τSI2 .

Since (X, τSI2 ) is a C-space, there is a d ∈ intτSI
↑ d1 ∩ intτSI
↑ d2 such that

x ∈ intτSI
↑ d ⊆↑ d ⊆ intτSI
↑ d1 ∩intτSI
↑ d2 ⊆↑ d1∩↑ d2. It follows that d ∈ Dx

and d1, d2 ≤ d. Thus Dx is directed. Obviously, x is an upper bound of Dx. Let y be
any upper bound of Dx and P = (X, ≤τ ). If x ¢ y, then x ∈ P\↓ y ∈ τSI2 . Since

(X, τSI2 ) is a C-space, there is a w ∈ P such that x ∈ intτSI
↑ w ⊆↑ w ⊆ P\ ↓ y.

Thus w ∈ Dx and w ¢ y, contradicting to the assumption that y is an upper bound

of Dx. Thus x = ∨Dx.
Since Dx ⊆⇓SI2 x, we have x = ∨ ⇓SI2 x. Now we show that ⇓SI2 x is directed.

For any y1, y2 ∈⇓SI2
x, y1  SI2
x, y2  SI2
x. By the definition of SI2
and x ∈ Dδ ,

there are d1, d2 ∈ Dx such that y1 ≤ d1, y2 ≤ d2. Since Dx is directed, there exists
d ∈ Dx such that d1, d2 ≤ d. Thus y1, y2 ≤ d. Note that Dx ⊆⇓SI2 x, so ⇓SI2 x is
directed.

Finally, we can directly check that ⇑SI2
x = S

(↑ z). In fact, for any

y ∈⇑SI2
x, x  SI2

directed, so there is a z ∈ Dy such that x ≤ z. Follows from the definition of Dy,

we have y ∈ int

SI2
↑ z and z ∈↑ x. Thus y ∈ S

z∈↑x
intτSI
(↑ z), i.e., ⇑SI2 x ⊆

z∈↑x intτSI2 (↑ z). To prove the inverse inclusion, let y ∈	z∈↑x intτSI2 (↑ z). Then
there is a z ∈↑ x such that y ∈ intτSI (↑ z), so y ∈ intτSI (↑ x). By Proposition

3.4(8), x

(↑ z). Therefore,

SI2

⇑SI2 x is open in (X, τ ). All there show that (X, τ ) is SI2-continuous.	2
By Theorem 2.9, Lemma 3.7 and Theorem 3.13, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 3.14 Let P be a poset. Then the following conditions are equivalent.
P is hypercontinuous;
(P, υ(P )) is SI-continuous;
(P, υ(P )) is SI2-continuous.
Corollary 3.15 Let P be a poset. Then the following conditions are equivalent.
P is an s2-continuous poset;
(P, σ2(P )) is a C-space;
(P, σ2(P )) is SI2-continuous ;
(P, A(P )) is SI2-continuous.
Proof. (1) ⇔ (2) By Theorem 2.4.
⇒ (3) Let (P, σ2(P )) be a C-space. By Lemma 3.7, σ2(P )SI2 = σ2(P ). Thus we have that (P, σ2(P )SI2 ) is a C-space. From Theorem 3.13, it follows that (P, σ2(P )) is SI2-continuous.
⇒ (1) Suppose that (P, σ2(P )) is SI2-continuous, then for any x ∈ P , x ∈

(⇓SI2
x)δ and ⇓SI
x is directed. Note that ⇓SI2
x ⊆ {y ∈ P : y  2 x}. Thus P is

s2-continuous.
(2) ⇔ (4) From Lemma 3.7 and Theorem 3.13, it follows that the condition (3)
and (4) are equivalent.	2
The following example shows that an SI-continuous space need not be SI2- continuous.
Example 3.16 ([4]) Consider the Euclidean plane P = R×R under the usual order, then P is a continuous poset, so (P, σ(P )) is a C-space, which implies that (P, A(P )) is an SI-continuous space (By Lemma 5.2 and Theorem 6.4 in [20]). Because every lower half-plane

Ea = {(x, y) ∈ R × R : y ≤ a}
is a directed lower set with Eδ = R × R, while {Ea : a ∈ R} = ∅, thus  is empty. Hence P is not s2-continuous. By Corollary 3.15, (P, A(P )) is not an SI2-continuous space.
SI2-quasicontinuous spaces
In this section, we introduce the concept of SI2-quasicontinuous spaces and prove that a space (X, τ ) is SI2-quasicontinuous if and only if (X, τSI2 ) is a locally hyper- compact space.
Definition 4.1 Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space and F ∈ Irrτ (X). G, H ⊆ X. Define
δ
G  SI2 H if ↑ H ∩ F /= ∅ implies ↑ G ∩ F /= ∅.
Write G  SI2 x for G  SI2 {x} and y  SI2 H for {y}  SI2 H. The set
{x ∈ X : G  SI2 x} will be denoted by ⇑SI2 G and {x ∈ X : x  SI2 H} denoted

by ⇓SI2
H. Let fin(x)= {E ∈ X(<ω) : E  SI
x}.

Definition 4.2 A T0 space (X, τ ) is called SI2-quasicontinuous if for any x ∈ X, the following conditions hold:

for any E ∈ X(<ω), ⇑SI
E is open in (X, τ );

fin(x) is directed;
↑ x =  {↑ E : E ∈ fin(x)}.
Remark 4.3 It is verify that the condition (3) in above definition is equivalent to (3j) for any x, y ∈ X, if x ¢ y, then there exists E ∈ fin(x) such that y /∈↑ E.
It is easy to get the following proposition and we omit the proof.
Proposition 4.4 Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space and G, H ⊆ X. Then
G  SI2 H iff G  SI2 x for all x ∈ H.
G  SI2 H ⇒ G ≤ H.
A ≤ G  SI2 H ≤ B ⇒ A  SI2 B.
If x ∈ intτSI  ↑ H, then H  SI2 x.
Lemma 4.5 ([8]) (Rudin’s Lemma) Let F be a directed family of nonempty ﬁnite
subsets of a poset P. Then there exists a directed set D ⊆ S	F such that
D ∩ F /= ∅ for all F ∈ F.
Lemma 4.6 Let H be a directed family of nonempty ﬁnite sets in a T0 space. If

G  SI2
x and 

H∈H
↑ H ⊆↑ x, then H ⊆↑ G for some H ∈ H.

Proof. Suppose not. Then the collection {H\ ↑ G : H ∈ H} is a directed family
of nonempty finite sets. By Lemma 4.5, there exists a directed set D ⊆ S{H\ ↑ 
G : H ∈ H} such that D ∩ (H\ ↑ G) /= ∅ for all H ∈ H. Then D† ⊆	↑
d∈D
δ
d ⊆	H∈H ↑ (H\ ↑ G) ⊆	H∈H ↑ H ⊆↑ x. Thus x ∈ D . Since every directed

set is irreducible and G  SI2 x, there exists d ∈ D such that d ∈↑ G. But this contradicts d ∈ H\↑ G for some H.	2
We now derive the interpolation property for SI2-quasicontinuous spaces.
Theorem 4.7 Let X be an SI2-quasicontinuous space. If H  SI2 x, then there
exists E ∈ X(<ω) such that H  SI E  SI x.
2
Proof. The statements has been proved for quasicontinuous domains in [8], and the similar proof carries over to this setting.	2
Proposition 4.8 Let (X, τ ) be an SI2-quasicontinuous space. Then
For any nonempty set H ⊆ X, ⇑SI2 H = intτSI  ↑ H.
A subset U of X is SI2-open iff U = S{⇑SI E : E ∈ X(<ω) and ↑ E ⊆ U}.
(<ω)
The set {⇑SI2 E : E ∈ X	} form a basis of τSI .
Proof. (1) From Proposition 4.4(4), we have intτSI  ↑ H ⊆⇑SI2 H. Obviously,
⇑SI2 H ⊆↑ H. Now we only need to show that ⇑SI2 H is SI2-open. Since (X, τ ) is

SI2-quasicontinuous, ⇑SI2
H ∈ τ . Let F ∈ Irrτ (X) and ⇑SI2
H ∩ Fδ /= ∅. Choose

x ∈⇑SI2
H∩Fδ, i.e., H  SI
x and x ∈ Fδ. By Theorem 4.7, there exists E ∈ X(<ω)

such that H  SI2 E  SI2 x, which implies ↑ E ∩ F /= ∅. Notice that E ⊆⇑SI2 H,

so ⇑SI2 H ∩ F /= ∅. Thus ⇑SI2 H is SI2-open. Therefore ⇑SI2 H = intτSI
↑ H.

(2) The sufficiency follows from the condition (1). To prove the necessity, let
U ∈ τSI2 and x ∈ U . From the definition of SI2-topology, we have U  SI2 x.

By Theorem 4.7, there exists E ∈ X(<ω) such that U  SI  E  SI
x.  Thus

S	(<ω)	2	2
x ∈	{⇑SI2 E : E ∈ X S	and ↑ E ⊆ U}. Obviously, the converse inclusion is
(<ω)
always true. Thus U =	{⇑SI2 E : E ∈ X	and ↑ E ⊆ U}, and thus the set
(<ω)
{⇑SI2 E : E ∈ X	} form a basis of τSI .	2
Theorem 4.9 Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space. Then the following conditions are equiva- lent.
(X, τ ) is an SI2-quasicontinuous space;
(X, τSI2 ) is a locally hypercompact space.
Proof. (1)⇒ (2) For any x and any SI2-open U containing x, by Proposition 4.8,

there exists E ∈ X(<ω) such that x ∈ intτ

SI2
↑ E =⇑SI2
E ⊆↑ E ⊆ U .

(2)⇒ (1) For any x ∈ X, let H = {H ∈ X(<ω) : x ∈ intτ
 

SI2
↑ H}. First, we

show that H is nonempty and ↑ x =	H∈H ↑ H. Since X is SI2-open, it follows

from (2) that there exists H ∈ X(<ω) such that x ∈ intτ
 

SI2
↑ H ⊆↑ H ⊆ U . Then

H ∈H /= ∅. Obviously, ↑ x ⊆	H∈H ↑ H. If x ¢ y, then x ∈ X\↓ y ∈ τSI2 . By (2),

there exists H ∈ X(<ω) such that x ∈ intτ
 

SI2
↑ H ⊆↑ H ⊆ X\ ↓ y. Thus H ∈ H 

and y ∈/↑ H. Thus ↑ x =	H∈H ↑ H.
Now we show that H is directed. Let H1, H2 ∈ H. Then x ∈ intτSI  ↑ H1 ∩

intτ

SI2
↑ H2. It follows from (2) that there exists H ∈ X(<ω) such that x ∈ intτ
SI2 ↑

H ⊆↑ H ⊆ intτSI
↑ H1 ∩ intτSI
↑ H2 ⊆↑ H1∩ ↑ H2, so H ∈ H and H1, H2 ≤ H.

Thus H is directed. Obviously, H⊆ fin(x). Then by Lemma 4.6, it is easy to show

that fin(x) is directed, and ↑ x ⊆ 
↑ H ⊆ 
↑ H =↑ x.

Finally, we show that ⇑SI2
E is open in (X, τ ) for any E ∈ X(<ω). For any
 

x ∈⇑SI2  E, E  SI2  x.  Notice that ↑ x =	H∈H ↑ H and H is directed, by

Lemma 4.6, there exists H ∈ H such that H ⊆↑ E. Thus x ∈ intτSI
↑ H ⊆

intτSI  ↑ E ⊆⇑SI2 E, which implies ⇑SI2 E is open in (X, τ ). Therefore, (X, τ ) is
SI2-quasicontinuous.	2
By Theorem 3.13 and Theorem 4.9, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 4.10 If (X, τ ) is SI2-continuous, then (X, τ ) is SI2-quasicontinuous.
Corollary 4.11 Let P be a poset. Then the following conditions are equivalent.
P is a quasi-hypercontinuous poset;
(P, υ(P )) is an SI2-quasicontinuous space.
Proof. By Lemma 3.7 and Theorem 4.9.
2
Lemma 4.12 Let P be a poset. If (P, σ2(P )) is a locally hypercompact space, then
σ2(P )SI2 = σ2(P ).
Proof. Obviously, σ2(P )SI2 ⊆ σ2(P ). Let U ∈ σ2(P ) and F ∈ Irrσ2(P )(P ), if Fδ ∩U /= ∅. By Lemma 3.5, there exists directed subset D ⊆↓ F such that Dδ = Fδ. Thus Dδ ∩U /= ∅. Since U ∈ σ2(P ), D ∩U /= ∅, which implies F ∩U /= ∅. Therefore U ∈ σ2(P )SI2 .	2
Corollary 4.13 Let P be a poset. Then the following conditions are equivalent.
P is an s2-quasicontinuous poset;
(P, σ2(P )) is a locally hypercompact space;
(P, σ2(P )) is an SI2-quasicontinuous space;
(P, A(P )) is an SI2-quasicontinuous space.
Proof. (1)⇔(2) By Theorem 2.6.
⇒(3) Let (P, σ2(P )) be a locally hypercompact space. By Lemma 4.12, we have σ2(P )SI2 = σ2(P ). Thus (P, σ2(P )SI2 ) is a locally hypercompact space. By Theorem 4.9, (P, σ2(P )) is an SI2-quasicontinuous space.
⇒(1) Let (P, σ2(P )) be an SI2-quasicontinuous space. It is easy to see that fin(x) ⊆ {E ∈ P (<ω) : E  2 x}. Thus P is an s2-quasicontinuous poset.
(2)⇔(4) By Lemma 3.7(2), we have A(P )SI2 = σ2(P ). From Theorem 4.9, it follows that (2) and (4) are equivalent.	2
Example 4.14 ([4]) Let P = {a}∪{an : n ∈ N}. The partial order on P is defined by setting an < an+1 for all n ∈ N , and a1 < a. Then P is an s2-quasicontinuous poset which is not s2-continuous. By Theorem 3.13 and Corollary 4.13, This poset P equipped with the Alexandroff topology A(P ) is an SI2-quasicontinuous space, but it is not SI2-continuous.

Meet SI2-continuous spaces
In this section, we define a meet SI2-continuous space and prove that (X, τ ) is SI2-continuous if and only if it is a meet SI2-continuous and SI2-quasicontinuous space.
Definition 5.1 A T0 space (X, τ ) is called meet SI2-continuous if for any x ∈ X
and any F ∈ Irrτ (X) with x ∈ Fδ, then x ∈ clτ  (↓ x∩↓ F ).
Proposition 5.2 Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space. Considering the following statements.
For any x ∈ X and U ∈ τSI2 , ↑ (U∩↓ x) ∈ τSI2 .
(X, τ ) is meet SI2-continuous.
Then (1)⇒(2). If (X, τ ) satisﬁes ↑ (U∩↓ x) ∈ τ for any x ∈ X and U ∈ τSI2 , then the two conditions are equivalent.
Proof. (1)⇒(2) Let F be an irreducible set in (X, τ ) with x ∈ Fδ. Suppose x /∈
clτSI (↓ x∩ ↓ F ). Then there exists U ∈ τSI2 containing x such that U ∩ (↓ x∩ ↓ 

2
F ) = ∅, thus ↑ (U∩ ↓ x)
F = ∅. By hypothesis ↑ (U∩ ↓ x) ∈ τSI2 , we have

↑ (U∩↓ x) ∩ Fδ = ∅. But x ∈↑ (U∩↓ x) ∩ Fδ, a contradiction. Thus (X, τ ) is meet
SI2-continuous.
(2)⇒(1) For any F ∈ Irrτ (X), if ↑ (U∩↓ x) ∩ Fδ /= ∅, then there exists y ∈ Fδ

and u ∈ U∩ ↓ x such that u ≤ y, which implies u ∈ Fδ. By (2), u ∈ clτ

SI2
(↓ u∩ ↓ 

F ). Note that U ∈ τSI2 and u ∈ U , thus U ∩ (↓ u∩ ↓ F ) /= ∅. It follows that
U ∩ (↓ x∩ ↓ F ) /= ∅. Hence ↑ (U∩ ↓ x) ∩ F /= ∅. Since ↑ (U∩ ↓ x) ∈ τ , we have
↑ (U∩↓ x) ∈ τSI2 .	2
Corollary 5.3 Let P be a poset. The following statements are equivalent.
For any x ∈ P and any U ∈ σ2(P ), ↑ (U∩↓ x) ∈ σ2(P );
P is meet s2-continuous;
(P, A(P )) is meet SI2-continuous.
Proof. (1)⇔(2) See [5,21].
⇔(3) Since any upper set is open in A(P ) and A(P )SI2 = σ2(P ), by Propo- sition 5.2, the condition (1) and (3) are equivalent.	2
Lemma 5.4 If H is a ﬁnite set in a meet SI2-continuous space (X, τ ), then intτSI  ↑

H ⊆ S{⇑

SI2

x : x ∈ H}.

Proof. Suppose y ∈ U := intτ


SI2
↑ H but y /∈ S{⇑SI
x : x ∈ H}. Let H =

{x1, x2, ..., xn}. For each i there exists Fi ∈ Irrτ (X) such that y ∈ Fδ with xi /∈↓ Fi.
Since (X, τ ) is meet SI2-continuous, y ∈ clτSI (↓ y∩ ↓ Fi). Choose z1 ∈ U∩ ↓
y∩ ↓ F1 /= ∅. Since y ∈ Fδ and z1 ≤ y, we have z1 ∈ Fδ, which implies that
z1 ∈ clτSI (↓ z1∩ ↓ F2). Choose z2 ∈ U∩ ↓ z1∩ ↓ F2 /= ∅. Thus we can get zi+1 ∈

2
U∩↓ z	F
,i = 1, 2,...,n− 1, and z
∈  n
↓ F . Note that z
∈ U ⊆↑ H, so

i∩↓ 
i+1
n	i=1	i	n

there exists xj ∈ H such that xj ≤ zn. Thus xj ∈↓ Fj, a contradiction to xi /∈↓ Fi

for any i ∈ {1, 2,..., n}. Hence intτ


SI2
↑ H ⊆ S{⇑SI
x : x ∈ H}.	2

Theorem 5.5 Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space. Then the following conditions are equiva- lent.
(X, τ ) is an SI2-continuous space;
(X, τ ) is an SI2-quasicontinuous and meet SI2-continuous space;
(X, τ ) is a meet SI2-continuous space, for any x ∈ X, ⇓SI2 x is directed with
⇑SI2 x ∈ τ and whenever x ¢ y in X, then there are U ∈ τSI2 and V ∈ ω(P )
such that x ∈ U, y ∈ V , and U ∩ V = ∅, where P = (X, ≤τ ).
Proof. (1)⇒(2) By Corollary 4.10, (X, τ ) is SI2-quasicontinuous. Now we prove that (X, τ ) is meet SI2-continuous. Consider any x ∈ X and any F ∈ Irrτ (X)

with x ∈ Fδ. For any U ∈ τSI
with x ∈ U , by SI2-continuity of (X, τ ), x ∈

U ∩ (⇓SI2
x)δ /= ∅, which implies U∩ ⇓SI
x /= ∅, that is, there exists u ∈ U such

that u  SI2 x. Thus there exists e ∈ F such that u ≤ e, so u ∈ U∩ ↓ x∩ ↓ F .
Hence x ∈ clτSI (↓ x∩↓ F ).
⇒(3) First, we show that ⇓SI2 x is nonempty for any x ∈ X. If not, then

x /∈ S{⇑SI
y : y ∈ X} ⊆ S{⇑SI
E : E ∈ X(<ω)}. By Proposition 4.8(1) and
S

Lemma 5.4, ⇑SI2 E = intSI2 ↑ E ⊆	{⇑SI2 y : y ∈ E}. From Proposition 4.8(2),
it is follows that X = S{⇑SI  E : E ∈ X(<ω)} ⊆ S{S ⇑SI  y : E ∈ X(<ω) and
S	2	2
y ∈ E} =	{⇑SI2 y : y ∈ X}, which implies x /∈ X, a contradiction. Thus ⇓SI2 x is
nonempty.
Now we show that ⇓SI2 x is directed and ⇑SI2 x ∈ τ .	For any x ∈ X, let u, v ∈⇓SI2 x. Since (X, τ ) is SI2-quasicontinuous, by Theorem 4.7, there are

E1, E2 ∈ X(<ω) such that u  SI
E1  SI2
x, v  SI2
E2  SI2
Thus E1, E2 ∈

fin(x) and E1 ⊆↑ u, E2 ⊆↑ v. Since fin(x) is directed, there exists E ∈ fin(x) such
that E1, E2 ≤ E, i.e., E ⊆↑ E1∩ ↑ E2. Thus x ∈⇑SI2 E ⊆↑ E ⊆↑ E1∩ ↑ E2. By
Proposition 4.8(1) and Lemma 5.4, we have ⇑SI2 E = intSI2 ↑ E ⊆ S{⇑SI y : y ∈
E}. So there is a y ∈ E such that x ∈⇑SI2 y, i.e., y ∈⇓SI2 x and u, v ≤ y. Thus
⇓SI2 x is directed. Since (X, τ ) is SI2-quasicontinuous, ⇑SI2 E ∈ τ for any finite E. Therefore, ⇑SI2 x ∈ τ .
Suppose that x ¢ y in X. Let P = (X, ≤τ ). Then x ∈ P\ ↓ y ∈ τSI2 . By

Theorem 4.9, there exists E ∈ X(<ω) such that x ∈ intτ

SI2
↑ E ⊆↑ E ⊆ P\ ↓ y.

Let U = intτSI  ↑ E and V = P\ ↑ E. Then x ∈ U ∈ τSI2 , y ∈ V ∈ ω(P ) and
U ∩ V = ∅.
⇒(1) We only have to check that x = ∨ ⇓SI2 x for all x ∈ X. Let y be any upper bound of ⇓SI2 x. Assume x ¢ y. By the condition (3), there are U ∈ τSI2 and V ∈ ω(P ) such that x ∈ U, y ∈ V and U ∩ V = ∅. We may assume that V
is a basic ω-open set, i.e., there exists H ∈ X(<ω) such that V = P\ ↑ H. Thus

U ⊆↑ H. By Lemma 5.4, x ∈ U ⊆ intτ


SI2
↑ H ⊆ S{⇑SI : x ∈ H}. Hence, there

is a z ∈ H such that z  SI2 x. Thus z ∈⇓SI2 x ⊆↓ y, which implies y ∈↑ H, a 
contradiction. Thus (1) holds.	2
Let P be a poset. By Corollary 3.15, Corollary 4.13 and Theorem 5.5, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 5.6 ([21]) Let P be a poset. Then the following conditions are equiva-

lent.
P is an s2-continuous poset;
P is an s2-quasicontinuous and meet s2-continuous poset;
P is a meet s2-continuous space, ⇓ x is directed for any x ∈ P, and whenever x ¢ y in X, then there are U ∈ σ2(P ) and V ∈ ω(P ) such that x ∈ U, y ∈ V , and U ∩ V = ∅.
