Abstract
We answer a question posed by Martin et al. at MFPS XXVI in the affirmative: the free affine monoid over a finite involution group has a quantum representation, in addition to the classical representation already shown to exist in [8]. In particular, this implies that in every dimension there are non-trivial classes of quantum channels that have classical representations which were not present in the lower dimensions. En route to establishing this result, we give two characterizations of the diagonal n-qubit channels (one of which
is stated in [1]) and necessary conditions for a Bloch matrix to satisfy.
Keywords: Bloch representation, free object, quantum channel, involution group.


Introduction
A classical channel with m inputs and n outputs can be represented by a m × n stochastic matrix; the set of these channels is denoted (m, n). One way to transmit information through a qubit channel is to fix a basis in the state space, {|ψ×, |φ×}, and let |ψ× and |φ× represent 0 and 1, respectively. Using this basis we can define a (2, 2) classical channel which has capacity

yH(x)−xH(y) 
	


where x = P (0|0),y = P (0, 1) and H(x)= −x log2(x) − (1 − x) log2(1 − x). The capacity measures the amount of classical information that can be transmitted through the qubit channel. For a qubit channel, each choice of a basis defines a classical channel, each with its own capacity. The scope of a qubit channel is the

range of capacities obtained when varying over all bases in the state space. Calcu- lating C(x, y) for an arbitrary basis is a tedious task, and thinking about calculating capacity for every basis in the state space makes us shudder.
In [11], Martin reduced the calculation of scope to a simple eigenvalue cal- culation. Moreover, there are classes of (m, n) channels which carry information theoretic data about certain classes of unital qubit channels. The classes are well studied and were shown to be conjugate to their quantum counterparts [4,5,9]; since conjugation preserves eigenvalues, the scope and capacity of these channels can be calculated from the classical representations.
The natural question arises whether there is a higher dimensional analog to calculating scope and are there classes of (m, n) classical channels that carry similar information theoretic data about multi-qubit channels. Attempting to extend the results from the qubit case requires more information about the Bloch representation of the higher dimensional quantum channels. In the case of a qubit, the set of Bloch matrices is the convex closure of SO(3). However, for n ≥ 2 it is only known that the set of n-qubit Bloch matrices is a proper subset of the convex closure of SO(22n − 1). Here we will give two characterizations of the diagonal Bloch matrices of arbitrary dimension. The first gives 22n inequalities for the elements of a diagonal matrix to satisfy; these are necessary and sufficient conditions stated in [1] which we will prove in full generality. We will then show those conditions are equivalent to taking the convex closure of a finite set of 22n-many diagonal matrices. More importantly, for the involution groups of order 22n and 22n−1, there is an isomorphism defined by conjugation from the classical representations of their free affine monoids into the set of unital n-qubit channels via the Bloch representation. Lastly, we will extend the trace condition, found in [11], to an arbitrary n-qubit channel and give a lower bound for the scope of a channel.

Preliminaries
In order to discuss quantum channels we need a way to talk about how an envi- ronment acts on quantum systems and a way of describing a system whose state is not completely known. We use density operators/matrices (the terms are used interchangeably) to describe a quantum system. Let 2n be a Hilbert space of dimension 2n.
Definition 2.1 A quantum state is a self adjoint, positive semi-definite, trace one,

n
linear operator ρ : H
n
→H	which is called a density operator; when the operator

is represented by a matrix it is called a density matrix. The set of density matrices
2n
on n-qubits is denoted Ω  .
If a quantum system can be in states |ψ × ∈ H2n with probabilities p , then the
density matrix can be written as ρ = i pi|ψi×⟨ψi|, where we take each |ψi× to be normalized. It is clear that ρ is a density matrix for an n-qubit system if and only if it is a 2n × 2n trace one, positive semi-definite, Hermitian matrix. The 2n × 2n Hermitian matrices form a vector space over R of dimension 22n, so there are 22n − 1

2n
Hermitian matrices, λ = {λi}i=2, such that {I2n }∪ λ is a basis. It is well known
that for the real vector space of 2 × 2 Hermitian matrices, the identity along with the spin operators, or Pauli Matrices, are a basis:

σ = ⎛1 0⎞ ,σ 
= ⎛0 1⎞ ,σ 
= ⎛ 0 −i ⎞ ,σ 
= ⎛ 1	0 ⎞ .

⎝1 0⎠	3
⎝ i	0 ⎠	4

Definition 2.2 Define	 1	 σ
2n−1
1 ⊗· · · ⊗ σjn
|ji ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}, to be the set of n-

qubit spin operators; we will order them with the dictionary order.
We call the ith matrix in this order λn (n denotes the dimension of the system and will be dropped when confusion does not arise). Typically we will represent the last 22n − 1 elements in vector form as λ = [λ2 λ3 ··· λ22n ]. Given two vector spaces V and W with their respective bases, {|vi×} and {|wj×}, {|vi×⊗ |wj×} is a basis for V ⊗ W (see [13] for properties of the tensor product). It is immediate that the n-dimensional spin operators form a linearly independent set contained in the 2n × 2n Hermitian matrices, and since there are 22n of them, they must form a basis. Thus, every density matrix can be written as some linear combination of n-dimensional spin operators (with certain constraints), i.e., every density matrix for an n-qubit system can be written as
ρ = I + cr · λ,
2n

where c =  22n−2n and λ is the vector of the n-dimensional spin operators (without
the identity).
Definition 2.3 The vector r in the above expansion of a density matrix is called the Bloch vector.
It is well known that for this decomposition to describe a quantum state, r B22n−1 (the unit ball of dimension 22n	1), but for n	2 the Bloch vectors form a proper subset of B22n−1 [6]. Note that sometimes we will absorb c into the Bloch vector. A density operator ρ describes a pure state if its state |ψ× is completely known, i.e., ρ = |ψ×⟨ψ|, otherwise it is a mixed state; the constant c ensures that the Bloch vector of a pure state has norm 1.
A quantum channel is a medium used to send quantum states. These channels can be modeled by maps on the set of density matrices that fulfill certain natural
intuitions. Consider a quantum channel ϵ : Ω2n → Ω2n . If we were selecting a
quantum state from a distribution {|ψi×} with probability pi and then applying ϵ, we would expect the output to be the same as if were selecting a quantum state from {|ϵ(ψi)×} with probability pi. Thus we would expect ϵ to be convex-linear. Since ϵ takes density matrices to density matrices it should be a positive map, i.e., it takes positive semi-definite operators to positive positive semi-definite operators. Similarly it must take trace one operators to trace one operators, and thus must

be trace preserving. Moreover, (∀m ∈ N+) Im ⊗ ϵ should be positive; this property is called complete positivity. Complete positivity ensures that if ϵ acts on just one part of a joint system, Im ⊗ ϵ is still a quantum channel.
Definition 2.4 A quantum channel Φ: Ω2n → Ω2n is a completely positive, trace preserving, convex-linear map. It is unital provided that the identity is a fixed point.
By Choi’s theorem [2], a linear operator on the complex N × N matrices, Φ :
MN → MN , is completely positive if and only if it has the form
Φ(ρ)=	EiρEi†,
i
where the Ei are complex matrices. We have the following characterization, called the operator sum representation, of quantum channels found in [12]: The map Φ : Ω2n → Ω2n is a completely positive, trace preserving, convex-linear map if and only if it has the form

Φ(ρ)=	AiρAi†
i=1
where {A } is a collection of operators on Ω2n and Σ


A†A


= I. A map of this

form clearly preserves hermiticity, so given Choi’s theorem and the operator sum representation of a quantum channel, every quantum channel is the restriction of a completely positive, linear map on the Hermitian matrices. Since we have formu- lated our density matrices in terms of Hermitian matrices, we will view a map on
Ω2n as a map on the 2n × 2  Hermitian matrices, H  . Since a quantum channel
2n
maps a density matrix to a density matrix, it must induce a map φ on the Bloch
vector:
Φ  I + cr · λ  = I + cφ(r) · λ.
These maps are of critical importance in understanding the scope and capacity of a qubit channel, and we will devote most of this note to investigating them.
Lemma 2.5 Every quantum channel induces an affine map on the Bloch vector. When the channel is unital, the affine map is linear.
Proof. Let N = 2n and Φ : HN → HN be a linear map with the property Φ(I +
r λ) = I + s λ. Consider an arbitrary element of H , ρ =	x λ , and take
ρ2 = Σi yiλi = Φ(ρ1). Let M = (aij) be the matrix of the operator Φ, then

⎜⎜⎝  . ⎟⎟⎠	⎜⎜⎝  .	.   ⎟⎟⎠ ⎜⎜⎝  .
⎟⎟⎠

yN	aN 1 aN 2 ··· aNN	xN
By assumption, if x1 = 1 then y1 = 1.	Also, if x1 = 1 then for i ≥ 2,
yi  = ΣN	aijxj + ai1.	Let b = [a21 a31 ··· aN1]t, y  = [y2 y3 ··· yN ]t, and

x = [x2 x3 ··· xN ]t. Then y = M˜ x + b, where
, a22 ··· a2N ⎞
M˜	.	. . .	. .
⎝aN2 ··· aNN ⎠
Therefore, if ρ1 is a density matrix, Φ(ρ1) = 1/2n(I + (M˜ x + b) · λ). To compute Φ(I), we take x to be the zero vector; for Φ(I)= I it is immediate that b must also be the zero vector.	2
Definition 2.6 Let ρ = 1/2n(I +cr·λ) be a density matrix and let Φ be a quantum channel defined as
Φ(ρ)= I + c(Ar + b) · λ.
2n
This is the Bloch representation of the channel Φ and A is the Bloch matrix associ-
ated with Φ. We will sometimes refer to Φ as ΦAx+b to put emphasis on the Bloch representation.
Define the set of Bloch representations on n-qubits to be Qn and the unital Bloch representations to be Un. There are multiple operator sum representations for one quantum channel; for example if Ui and Vi differed by a phase then for
2n Σ	Σ
each ρ ∈	U ρU† =	V ρV †. So for Definition 2.6 to make sense, we need
to make sure the correspondence between the operator sum representation and the Bloch representation is well-defined and preserves convex sums and composition. We state the following to be complete, but the proof is routine so it is omitted.
Lemma 2.7
The identiﬁcation between the operator sum representation and the Bloch repre- sentation is well-deﬁned.
The Bloch representation of the convex sum of quantum channels is the convex sum of the individual Bloch representations.
The Bloch matrix of a composition of unital channels corresponds to the multi- plication of the Bloch matrices.
A Characterization of The Unital Diagonal Channels
The set of Bloch matrices that corresponds to the completely positive maps for n = 1 is the convex closure of SO(3). Unfortunately for n ≥ 2, Un is not a well- known set. The set of Bloch diagonal matrices on one qubit is well-studied and a characterization of the Bloch diagonal channels on n-qubits was given in [1] but not rigorously proven for any finite dimensional system. We will give a proof, but first we need a little structure to prove the theorem.
One can compute σjσiσj = ±σi. Given that for m × m matrices r, s, t, and u, (r ⊗ s)(t ⊗ u)= (rt ⊗ su), we have λjλiλj = ±  λi. To characterize the diagonal unital channels, we need an efficient way of keep track of the signs.

Lemma 3.1 The sign of λnλnλn is determined by H⊗n, the (i, j) entry of the n-fold

tensor product of

Proof. In one dimension, if i or j is 1 or if i = j, then σjσiσj = σi. Since the Pauli matrices anti-commute, if i /= j and i, j /= 1, σjσiσj = −σjσjσi = −σi. Thus, the assertion is true for the one-dimensional spin operators
Now suppose for i, j ≤ 22k, that λkλkλk =  1  H⊗kλk. By construction, for
any two of the (k + 1)-dimensional spin operators, λi and λj (note we dropped the
k + 1 for ascetics), there exists ij, jj ≤ 22k and i1, j1 ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} so that

λi = √2 σi1 ⊗ λi′ and λj = √2 σj1 ⊗ λj′ .

Now suppose {Aj}k	is a set of linearly independent matrices, and let
Φ: H2n → H2n be defined by Φ(ρ) =  i βiAiρAi†. By a result in [1], Φ is com- pletely positive if and only if βi ≥ 0 for every i; we will use this result in the following. Please note that the next theorem was stated by Bourdon and Williams in [1], but they only gave a sketch of the proof. We claim no originality to the statement of the theorem, but since this result will be used throughout this note, we give a full proof and correct some discrepancies.
Theorem 3.2 Let N = 2n, r ∈ R22n—1 and Φ : H  → H  be deﬁned by
ΦD(r1I + r · λ)= r1I + (Dr) · λ

Then D ∈ Un if and only if H⊗ndj has all non-negative entries.

Proof. This operator is by definition linear and trace preserving regardless of D; also, ΦD(I)= I. Next we can calculate the action of ΦD on λj for each j ≥ 2:

ΦD(λj)= ΦD(ej · λ)= (Dej) · λ = djλj,

where ej is the jth coordinate vector. So we have characterized ΦD by its action on the basis of n-dimensional spin operators.
Consider the linear operator Φ : H	H	defined by Φ(ρ)=	β λ ρλ , where each β	R.	From Lemma 3.1, Φ(λ )=  1  (	H⊗nβ )λ .	Let
β = 2n—1H⊗ndj, then di =  1  Σj Hi⊗j nβj and  1  Σi βi = 1. This choice of βi
gives Φ(λj) = ΦD(λj) for every j and since linear operators are completely deter-
mined by their action on a basis, this implies ΦD = Φ. From the earlier discussion on complete positivity and given the fact that the n-dimensional spin operators are linearly independent, ΦD is completely positive if and only if each βi  0. This is equivalent to  1  β = H⊗ndj having all non-negative entries.	2

For the duration we will refer to dj as the vector associated to the diagonal channel D.

The Free Affine Monoid Over The Involution Groups
Definition 4.1 An involution group is a set with a binary operation, (S, ·), and an identity element 1, where (∀x ∈ S) x · x = 1.
By the classification of finite abelian groups and some basic algebra, S is a finite involution group if and only if it is isomorphic to the direct product of Z2 k-times, Zk.
The involution group in (2, 2) of order 2 is
V = ,⎨I = ,1 0⎞ ,f = ,0 1⎞,⎬ .
,	⎝0 1⎠	⎝1 0⎠,

From [9] (and also unknowingly in [3]) we can recursively generate Zn in the (2n, 2n)
channels. Given V2n = {Pi : i = 1,..., 2n} in (2n, 2n), we construct

V2n+1 = {I2 ⊗ P, f ⊗ P : P ∈ V2n }∈ (2n+1, 2n+1).

Note  that  V22n = {I2 ⊗ I2 ⊗ P, I2 ⊗ f ⊗ P, f ⊗ I2 ⊗ P, f ⊗ f ⊗ P : P ∈ V22n−2 }. Given this structure, an easy induction argument (which is omitted) shows that for every v ∈ V22n , there are v1,..., vn ∈ V4 such that v = v1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ vn.
We can also recursively construct an involution group of order 22n as a subset

of Un. First we have

The set {D1, D2, D3, D4} ⊂ SO(3) is a copy of the Klein V group in U1. We can obtain Di by placing the entires of the ith row of H, starting with the second column, on the diagonal of Di, i.e.
,Hi2  0	0 ⎞
i	. 0 Hi3 0 .
⎝ 0	0 Hi4⎠

We can systematically define a set of involutions in SO(22n − 1) in a similar way; although it may not be immediately clear these involutions will be elements of Un as well.

Recall that for two matrices A and B, the direct sum of A and B is
A ⊕ B = ,A 0 ⎞ .

From the properties of the tensor product and the construction of Dn, for each row of H⊗n there are indices i1,..., in ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} such that the row is equal to the diagonal of (1 ⊕ D1 ) ⊗· · · ⊗ (1 ⊕ D1 ). Therefore, each Dn can written in terms
of an n-fold tensor product of elements from the set {1 ⊕ D1}4	. Thus each Dn
has determinant one. Also, since all the entries of Dn are ±1, Dn is an involution,
so Dn ∈ SO(22n − 1). We will show in the following that ⟨Gn× is convex-linearly isomorphic to ⟨V22n × and that the convex closure of Gn is equal to the set of diagonal matrices in Un.

Definition 4.3 Let G be a subgroup of (m, n). An embedding of the convex closure of G, ⟨G×, into Ql is a function ϕ : ⟨G×→ Ql such that for all x, y ∈ ⟨G×,
ϕ(I)= I,
ϕ(xy)= ϕ(x)ϕ(y),
ϕ(px + (1 − p)y)= pϕ(x)+ (1 − p)ϕ(y) whenever p ∈ [0, 1], and
ϕ(x)= ϕ(y) ⇒ x = y.
That is, an embedding is an injective, convex-linear homomorphism. The set of channels ϕ(⟨G×) is then said to have a classical representation.
In [9], Martin constructs an embedding of the Klein V in (4, 4) into Q1. It is shown in [4] that there are no other involution groups embeddable into the set of qubit channels. The question naturally arose, are there other involution groups in the higher-dimensional quantum channels that have classical representations? We will show that the answer is yes for every finite involution group!
Lemma 4.4 Let h⊗n be the n-fold tensor product of the Hadmard matrix,

h = √2 ⎝

Then h⊗2n diagonalizes V22n to 1 ⊕ Gn = {1 ⊕ Dn : Dn ∈ Gn}.
Proof. From [5], we know that h ⊗ h diagonalizes V2 to 1 ⊕ G1. Let v ∈ V22n
2	⊗2
and v1,..., vn ∈ V4 such that v = v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vn.	Let 1 ⊕ Dij  = h⊗ vjh	.
Then h⊗2nvh⊗2n = h⊗2v1h⊗2 ⊗· · · ⊗ h⊗2vnh⊗2 = (1 ⊕ Di ) ⊗· · · ⊗ (1 ⊕ Di ). By
the discussion in the preceding paragraph, the latter is an element of 1 ⊕ Gn.  2
Corollary 4.5 The n-fold tensor product of the Hadamard matrix diagonalizes V2n .
What we have shown is that there is an isomorphism between the affine monoids
⟨V22n × and ⟨Gn× that is defined by conjugation. An affine monoid is a convex subset of a real algebra that contains an identity and is closed under multiplication. For example, given a group G the convex closure of G, denoted ⟨G×, is an affine monoid. In certain cases, the affine monoid ⟨G× is called the free affine monoid over G.
Definition 4.6 A free affine monoid over a finite group G is an affine monoid ⟨G× such that each homomorphism f : G → A into an affine monoid A has a unique convex-linear extension to all of ⟨G×.
From [8], the free affine monoid over every finite group exists and is unique up to convex-linear isomorphism. More importantly, it is shown in [8] that ⟨V2n × is the free affine monoid over the involution group of order 2 .
Theorem 4.7 For every j ∈ N there is an n ∈ N, such that ⟨V2j × is embeddable into Qn via conjugation. That is, every ﬁnite involution group has a classical and quantum representation. Moreover, ⟨Gn× ⊂ Un and ⟨Gn× is the free affine monoid over the involution group of order 2 .

Proof. Note for all i < j, the involution group of order 2j has the involution group of order 2i as a subgroup and the restriction of an embedding is still an embedding. So we will check the claim for involution groups of order 22j.
First we show for all Dn ∈ Gn, that Di  ∈ Un. Recall that H ∗ H = 4I4 so
the rows of H are orthogonal; since H⊗nH⊗n = (H ∗ H)⊗n, the rows of H⊗n are
orthogonal as well. Let d be the vector associated with Dn. Since H⊗n is symmetric, d is a column vector of H⊗n, implying the entries of H⊗nd are all zero except the ith entry which is 22n. Thus, all the entries of H⊗nd are non-negative, and by Theorem
3.2 Dn is a unital channel. By Lemma 2.7, the convex sum of unital channels is unital implying ⟨Gn×⊂ Un.
Since the isomorphism between 1 ⊕ Gn and V22n is defined by conjugation, it is injective, preserving multiplication, convex sums, and the identity. Note that if   x = 1 and x   0 for each i, then   x (1  D ) = 1    x D . Define ϕ : ⟨1 ⊕ Gn×→ ⟨Gn× to be ϕ( i xi(1 ⊕ Di)) =  i xiDi. This is clearly a convex- linear isomorphism and by transitivity of convex-linear isomorphisms, ⟨V22n × is convex-linearly isomorphic to ⟨Gn×. Thus, ⟨V22n × is a classical representation of
⟨Gn×. By the uniqueness of free objects, ⟨Gn× is the free affine monoid over the involution group of order 2  .	2
Without embedding V22n into Un, one can show directly that ⟨Gn× is the free affine monoid over the involution group of order 2 . By the uniqueness of the free affine monoid there must be a convex-linear isomorphism between V22n and Gn, however there is no reason for the isomorphism to preserve eigenvalues. Since this isomorphism is defined by conjugation, it preserves eigenvalues and therefore will preserve information theoretic quantities. Since these information theoretic quantities are preserved, there is a possibility of doing quantum information theory with classical channels under this isomorphism.
We have now laid all the necessary foundation for the second characterization of the diagonal unital channels. It was shown in [11] that the set of diagonal qubit channels is the convex closure of G1; we have a natural extension for the set of n-qubit channels.
Theorem 4.8 The set of diagonal channels on n-qubits is ⟨Gn×.
Proof. First assume D ∈ Un and D is diagonal. Let d = [1 d2   d22n ]t be the vector
associated with D. Let β be the vector so that d = H⊗nβ. Since the columns of H⊗n
define the diagonals of each Di ∈ Gn, di = Σj Hi⊗j nβj = Σj βj(Dj)ii. Therefore
22n
D =	βiDi.
i=1
Because we assumed that D was Bloch diagonal, Theorem 3.2 states that the entries of β are non-negative. Since the first entry of d is 1 and the first row of H⊗n is all 1’s, 1 = i βi; thus D ∈ ⟨Gn×. Conversely, ⟨Gn× is contained in the set of diagonal unital channels by Theorem 4.7.	2

With Theorem 4.7 we can see that every involution group with order less than 2n has a classical representation in Cn. It should be clear that ⟨Gn⟩ does not contain any other involutions because any element in ⟨Gn⟩\Gn will have an entry on the diagonal that is not ±1. This implies that the largest involution group in Cn with a diagonal representation has order 22n. More importantly, ⟨Gn⟩ provides a legitimate higher dimensional analog to the set of diagonal qubit channels. The set is not contrived, there is a clear conceptual connection between the set of n-qubit diagonal channels and ⟨G1⟩. This provides more evidence that the work done on the set of unital qubit channels will be extendable to Cn.
Arbitrary Unital Channels
As far as we know, there is no characterization of the Bloch matrices on n-qubits. This section will give conditions to disqualify an arbitrary (22n — 1) × (22n — 1) matrix from being unital.
Lemma 5.1 Let f ∈ Cn. Then the diagonal of f also deﬁnes a unital channel.
Proof. Recall from Lemma 2.7 that Cn is closed under products and convex sums. Let f ∈ Cn; we will show through a series of operations on f involving only convex sums and products of untial channels, f can be reduced to its diagonal. Let Dk ∈ Gn and recall that (Dk)ij =0 if i /= j and (Dk)ii = ±1. Thus,


(Dkf Dk)ij =
22n—1

r=1
(Dkf )i,r(Dk)r,j = ±(Dkf )ij = ±
22n—1

l=1

(Dk)i,lfl,j = ±fij,

where the sign of (Dkf Dk)ij is positive if (Dk)ii = (Dk)jj, and the sign is negative otherwise. So the diagonal of f and Dkf Dk are the same, and thus ( 1 f + 1 Dkf Dk)ii = fii for each i ∈ {1,..., 22n — 1}. Also, for every pair (i, j)
where (Dk)ii /= (Dk)jj, ( 1 f + 1 Dkf Dk)ij = 0; otherwise, ( 1 f + 1 Dkf Dk)ij = fij.
Also note that 1/2(f + Dkf Dk) ∈ Cn by the above remark. So if for every i /= j,
there was a D ∈ G  such that (D ) /= (D ) , then Σ22n  1  D fD ∈ U , and
it would have the same diagonal as f with 0 in every other entry.
To finish the proof, we need to show that for every pair (i, j), 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 22n—1, there is a Dk ∈ Gn such that (Dk)ii /= (Dk)jj. We will show something slightly stronger: for i /= j, there is a k such that H⊗n /= H⊗n. This can be checked true
for n = 1, and to break stride with the rest of the paper, we induct on n.
Assume that for each i and j,1 ≤ i < j ≤ 22n, there is a k such that H⊗n /= H⊗n.

Let 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 22n+2; define ij = i (mod 22n) and jj = j (mod 22n). Note that by construction of H⊗(n+1) for 2 ≤ k ≤ 22n, H⊗n = H⊗(n+1) (similarly with j and jj).
If ij /= jj, then by induction there is a k, 2 ≤ k ≤ 22n, such that H⊗n /= H⊗n; this
implies H⊗(n+1) /= H⊗(n+1). If ij = jj, then j = r22n + ij, where r ∈ {1, 2, 3}. The
next arguments should be clear by the construction of H⊗(n+1). If 1 ≤ i ≤ 22n and
r is either 2 or 3, then for every k, 22n < k ≤ 22n+1, H⊗(n+1) /= H⊗(n+1). Similarly,
if r = 1, the same is true for each k, 22n+1 < k ≤ 3 ∗ 22n. If 22n < i ≤ 22n+1, then
r is either 2 or 3. In either case, for each k, 22n < k ≤ 22n+1, H⊗(n+1) /= H⊗(n+1).
If 22n+1 < i ≤ 3 ∗ 22n, then r = 4 and for each k, 22n+1 < k ≤ 3 ∗ 22n, H⊗(n+1) /=
H⊗(n+1).	2

Interestingly enough, the proof of the last theorem, along with work done by Keye Martin on retractive groups, gives a bound on the scope of a unital channel: the scope of any unital channel is bounded from below by the capacity of its diagonal [10]. Moreover, Theorems 5.1 and 3.2 allow us to extend the trace lemma from [11] in a very intuitive way. We can bound the trace of an arbitrary unital channel with the following lemma.
Lemma 5.2 (The trace lemma for n-qubits) If f ∈ Cn, then tr(f ) ∈ [—1, 22n —
, and the bounds are achieved.
Proof. By Lemma 5.1, we only need to consider diagonal channels. For the lower bound, let D be diagonal in Cn with the associated vector d. By Theorem 3.2, (H⊗nd)1 = 1 + tr(D) ≥ 0, which implies that tr(D) ≥ —1.  To see the bound
is achieved, observe that Σi H2i = 0 and assume for l ≤ k, Σi H2⊗il = 0. By

the construction of H⊗(k+1), Σi
H2⊗ik+1 = 4 Σi
H2⊗ik
= 0. Since tr(Dk+1)+1 =

Σ H⊗(k+1), we have tr(Dk+1)= —1.
For the upper bound, let D ∈ C1 and d be the associated vector. Then
,1+ d2 + d3 + d4⎞ Hd =	1+ d2 — d3 — d3
1	d + d	d
⎝1 — d2 — d3 + d4⎠

must have non-negative entries. Summing the last three entries of Hd gives 3 — d2 — d3 — d4 ≥ 0, implying that tr(D) ≤ 3. Note the sum over all the en- tries of Hd equals 4, canceling the di’s. So assume for all k ≤ n that summing over the entries of H⊗kd is 22k when d is a vector of the from d = [1 a2 ··· a22k ]t. Next let Dj ∈ Cn+1 be diagonal with dj = [1 d2 ..., d22(n+1) ]t as the associated vector. Let x1 = [1 d2 ... d22n ]t, x2 = [d22n+1 ... d22n+1 ]t, x3 = [d22n+1+1 ... d3∗22n ]t and x4 = [d3∗22n+1 ... d22n+2 ]t. Then summing all the entries of column vector re-

gives 4  i (H⊗nx1)i, which is 4∗22n—2 = 22n+2 by induction. Using the fact that the
first entry of H⊗(n+1)dj is 1 + tr(Dj) and that all the entries must be non-negative, summing all but the first row will give 22(n+1) — 1 ≥ tr(Dj). To see that the bound is achieved, use Dn = I22n—1	2
In [11], Martin proves the following proposition for n = 1 using the trace lemma:

Proposition 5.3
If f ∈ Cn and f—1 ∈ Un, then —f ∈/ Cn.
If f ∈ Cn and orthogonal, then f ∈ SO(2	— 1).
If f ∈ Cn, f—1 ∈ Cn if and only if f ∈ SO(22n — 1).
The proof for n ≥ 1 is an immediate generalization of the proof given of Propo- sition 3.9 in [11], so we will omit it.
Some Remarks About the Results
We have characterized diagonal unital channels in two ways: the first is directly from the complete positivity conditions and the second as the convex hull of the unital diagonal involutions. With the second characterization, we were able to show that the diagonal untial channels form a copy of the free affine monoid over an involution group. This shows that in every dimension there are new non-trivial classes of quantum channels with a classical representation. More importantly, by Theorem 4.7, each classical channel in ⟨V22n ⟩ uniquely represents an n-qubit chan- nel, up to change of basis. As shown in [11], we can use this fact to measure the transmission rate of classical information through any unital qubit channel from the set of diagonal unital channels and their classical representations. Although a higher-dimensional analog to calculating scope is not well studied, we hope there are information theoretic properties that can be characterized via the classical rep- resentations of quantum channels.
Moreover, in higher dimensions we are able to answer some basic questions about unital channels. For example, the antipodal map on the Bloch vector, fx = —x, does not define a unital channel; for the proof we just invoke the trace lemma. The trace lemma also gives a way to show that any invertible unital channel must be an orientation-preserving rotation. This is well-known, but we were able to invoke the trace lemma to prove it. More importantly, the trace lemma gives an easy-to- calculate condition that every Bloch matrix must satisfy.

It is hard to overstate the importance of the diagonal qubit channels. As shown in [7], set of teleportation channels for a single qubit is exactly the set of diagonal channels; we believe that the diagonal channels will play a large roll in the general teleportation schemes. Also, the scope of every qubit channel can be calculated using the set of diagonal channels [11]. Although we can can only bound the scope from below by the set of diagonal channels, we hope that a similar result will be true for n-qubits.

We would like to thank Johnny Feng for entertaining more questions than any one person should and for his helpful discussions on the formalisms of quantum channels and density matrices...we are sure at those times he wished he had a secluded office. We would also like to thank Keye Martin for many valuable discussions on quantum mechanics and for persuading us to look into this topic.
