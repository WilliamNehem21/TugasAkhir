Abstract
A path partition P of a digraph D is a collection of directed paths such that every vertexΣbelongs to precisely
one path. Given a positive integer k, the k-norm of a path partition P of D is defined as	P ∈P min{|Pi|, k}.
A path partition of a minimum k-norm is called k-optimal and its k-norm is denoted by πk(D). A stable
set of a digraph D is a subset of pairwise non-adjacent vertices of V (D). Given a positive integer k, we denote by αk(D) the largest set of vertices of D that can be decomposed into k disjoint stable sets of D. In 1981, Linial conjectured that πk(D) ≤ αk(D) for every digraph. We say that a digraph D is arc-spine if V (D) can be partitioned into two sets X and Y where X is traceable and Y contains at most one arc in
A(D). In this paper we show the validity of Linial’s Conjecture for arc-spine digraphs.
Keywords: digraph, path partition, partial k-coloring, Linial’s conjecture.

Introduction
For a digraph D, let V (D) denote its set of vertices and let A(D) denote its set of arcs. Given an arc a = (u, v) ∈ A(D), we say that u and v are adjacent. The set of neighbors of a vertex u in D, denoted by N (u), is the set of all vertices that are adjacent to u and distinct from u. In this paper, we consider only digraphs without loops and parallel arcs. A path P is a sequence of distinct vertices (v1, v2,..., vl) such that for every i = 1, 2,...,l − 1, (vi, vi+1) ∈ A(D). We define the order of a path P , denoted by |P |, as the number of its vertices. A Hamilton path is a path containing every vertex in V (D). We say that a digraph D is traceable if it contains a Hamilton path. A cycle C is a sequence of vertices (v0, v1,..., vl) such that (vi, vi+1) ∈ A(D) for every i = 0, 1, 2,...,l − 1 and all vertices are distinct except precisely v0 and vl which coincide. We say digraph D is acyclic if it contains no cycles. A digraph D is transitive if whenever (u, v) ∈ A(D) and (v, w) ∈ A(D), then (u, w) ∈ A(D) as well.
Given a path P = (v1, v2,..., vl), we denote by ter(P) the terminal vertex vl of
P . The subpath (v1, v2,..., vi) of P is denoted by Pvi, the subpath (vi, vi+1,..., vl) of P is denoted by viP and the subpath (vi, vi+1,..., vj) of P is denoted by viPvj. We denote by λ(D) the order of a longest path in D. Given another path Q = (w1, w2,..., wf ), where vl = w1, we denote the concatenation of P and Q by P ◦Q = (v1, v2,..., vl = w1, w2,..., wf ).
A path partition P of a digraph D is a collection of directed paths such that every vertex belongs to precisely one path and we denote by |P| the number of paths in the partition. We say that a path partition P in D is optimal if there is no path partition Pj such that |Pj| < |P|. We denote by π(D) the cardinality of an optimal path partition. Given a positive integer k, the k-norm of a path partition P of D

is defined as Σ
P∈r
min{|Pi|, k}. A path partition of D with minimum k-norm is

called k-optimal and its k-norm is denoted by πk(D). Note that π(D)= π1(D).
A stable set S in D is a subset of vertices of V (D) such that every two vertices of S are nonadjacent. A stable set with maximum cardinality is called a maximum stable set and its cardinality is denoted by α(D). Let k be a positive integer and D be a digraph. A k-partial coloring Ck of D is a set of k disjoint stable sets. Each such stable set is called a color class. Note that some vertices may not belong to

any of the k color classes. The weight of a k-partial coloring is defined as Σ
C∈C
k |C|

and it is denoted by ||Ck||. We say that Ck is an optimal k-partial coloring of D
if it is a partial coloring of maximum weight and we denote its weight by denoted
αk(D). Note that α(D)= α1(D).
Dilworth [1] was the first to associate a path partition with stable set in digraphs.

In 1950, he showed that π(D)= α(D) when the digraph D is transitive and acyclic. A decade later, in 1960, Gallai and Milgram [2] generalized Dilworth’s Theorem to arbitrary digraphs by relaxing the equality to the inequality π(D) ≤ α(D). Note that equality does not always hold; for instance if D is a cycle of order 5, then π(D) = 1 but α(D) = 2. Much later, in 1976, Greene and Kleitman [3] found a different way to generalize Dilworth’s theorem by establishing a relation between πk(D) and αk(D), i.e., changing the notion of minimality of a path partition and allowing the use of up to k disjoint stable sets to cover the maximum number of vertices possible. They showed that for any transitive acyclic digraph D and any positive integer k, we have πk(D)= αk(D).
As much as Gallai-Milgram’s Theorem extends Dilworth’s Theorem by relaxing the equality when dealing with arbitrary digraphs, we may think that the next step is to relax the equality proved by Greene and Kleitman to the inequality πk(D) ≤ αk(D) in order to generalize their theorem for arbitrary digraphs. However, it is an open problem whether such generalization holds. Such question was raised by Linial [6] in 1981 and is known as Linial’s Conjecture. Some particular cases of the conjecture were already proved. We highlight the cases k = 1 (Gallai-Milgram’s Theorem itself), k =2 [8], acyclic digraphs [6], bipartite digraphs [7], digraphs with λ(D) ≤ k [7] and traceable digraphs [7]. For more details on the state of the art of Linial’s Conjecture we refer the reader to [10, Table 6.1].
There is one recent partial result on Linial’s Conjecture that is particularly relevant to this work. In 2017, Sambinelli, Nunes da Silva and Lee proved Linial’s Conjecture for a class of digraphs called spine digraphs [9]. A digraph D is a spine digraph if there exists a partition {X, Y } of V (D) such that D[X] is traceable and Y is a stable set in D. Spine digraphs are a superclass of split digraphs. Long before, in 1994, Hartman, Saleh and Hershkowitz [4] gave a proof of a different (although related) conjecture of Linial which we refer to as Linial’s Dual Conjecture (see [10] for its statement). The proof of Sambinelli, Nunes da Silva and Lee [9] has some similarity in structure to that of Hartman, Saleh and Hershkowitz; however some particular technique had to be developed to address Linial’s Conjecture. The recent discovery of this new technique motived this work. Here we present an extension of the use of that technique on a superclass of spine digraphs. The purpose of the work is to start the investigation of more superclasses where the new technique may be applied to solve Linial’s Conjecture. We started with the class of arc-spine digraphs, defined in the next section.

Arc-spine Digraphs
We say that a digraph D is an arc-spine digraph if there exists a partition {X, Y } in V (D) where D[X] is traceable and D[Y ] contains at most one arc. One such partition {X, Y } of an arc-spine digraph is maximal if X is maximal. We use D[X, Y ] to denote that D has one such partition {X, Y } and that it is maximal. We denote by a the unique arc of D[Y ] that may exist and by u and v the tail and head of a, respectively. Let P = (x1, x2,..., xl) be a Hamilton path of D[X].

The proof of Linial’s Conjecture for spine digraphs presented by Sambinelli, Nunes da Silva and Lee [9] involves defining a canonical path partition and a canon- ical partial k-coloring that have k-norm and weight differing by exactly one. Then, a subclass of spine digraphs whose optimal partial k-coloring has weight higher than that of the canonical one is identified. Those are called k-loose spine digraphs. For the remaining digraphs, called k-tight spine digraphs, it is shown that the canoni- cal path partition is not k-optimal. The proof of Linial’s Conjecture for arc-spine digraphs presented in this paper follows the same structure while adapting the def- initions and arguments for the superclass of arc-spine digraphs. We assume that positive integer k is at least 2 throughout the paper; this is fundamental in many steps of our proof. However, since Gallai-Milgram’s Theorem is a proof of Linial’s Conjecture for the case k = 1, Linial’s Conjecture does hold for every positive integer k for arc-spine digraphs.
Let D[X, Y ] be an arc-spine digraph. We define a canonical (path) partition of D[X, Y ] with respect to some Hamilton path P of D[X] as {P, (u, v)}∪ {(y): y ∈ Y − {u, v}}. Clearly, this path partition has k-norm equal to min{|X|, k} + |Y |. Hence, πk(D) ≤ min{|X|, k} + |Y |. We say that P is zigzag-free in D if none of the following types of arcs exist in D: (i) (y, x1) or (ii) (xl, y), where y ∈ Y ; (iii) (v, x2) or (iv) (xl—1, u); (v) (xi—1, u) and (v, xi+1) simultaneously or (vi) (xi, u) and (v, xi+1) simultaneously or (vii) (xi, y) and (y, xi+1) simultaneously, where 1 < i < l and y ∈ Y . The motivation for defining this concept is because if P is not zigzag- free, then there is Xj ⊃ X such that D[Xj] is traceable and Y j = V (D) −Xj induces at most one arc.
Proposition 2.1 Let D[X, Y ] be an arc-spine digraph and let P = (x1, x2,..., xl)
be a Hamilton path of D[X]. Then, P is zigzag-free.
Proof Follows directly from the definition of D[X, Y ] as having X maximal. When any of the arcs prohibited in the definition of zigzag-free path exist, Hamilton path P can be extended.	2
All of the following properties hold when P is zigzag-free:
Lemma 2.2 Let D[X, Y ] be an arc-spine digraph and let P = (x1, x2,.	, xl) be a
Hamilton zigzag-free path of D[X]. For every subpath xqPxr = (xq, xq+1,.	, xr) of
P, if there exists a vertex y ∈ Y such that y is adjacent to all vertices of xqPxr, then for every q ≤ i ≤ r:
(xi, y) ∈ A(D) if (xq, y) ∈ A(D) and,
(y, xi) ∈ A(D) if (y, xr) ∈ A(D).
Proof The proof is by induction on i. Consider first the case (i); the base case i = q is thus verified. Now, suppose that i > q. By the induction hypothesis, we have that (xt, y) ∈ A(D) for q ≤ t ≤ i − 1. If (y, xi) ∈ A(D), then P is not zigzag-free in D; whence (xi, y) ∈ A(D). In particular, when i = r, we have shown that (xi, y) ∈ A(D) for q ≤ i ≤ r. A symmetric reasoning can be used to prove case
(ii).	2

Corollary 2.3 Let D[X, Y ] be an arc-spine digraph and let P = (x1, x2,..., xl) be a zigzag-free Hamilton path of D[X]. Then there is no vertex y ∈ Y adjacent to all vertices of P.
Proof Assume to the contrary that there is some vertex y ∈ Y adjacent to every vertex of P . Since P is zigzag-free, (x1, y) ∈ A(D). Then, by Lemma 2.2, (xl, y) ∈ A(D); a contradiction to the fact that P is zigzag-free.	2
Linial’s Conjecture is valid for spine digraphs, thus we will assume that D[Y ] contains an arc (u, v). Thus, by Corollary 2.3, there is some vertex xv ∈ X that is not adjacent to vertex v. Now let S be any subset of X − xv containing min{|X|− 1,k − 2} vertices. We may thus define a canonical k-partial coloring with respect to S as {Y − v, {v, xv}} ∪ {{x} : x ∈ S}}. Clearly, this k-partial coloring has weight
|Y |− 1+2+ min{|X|− 1,k − 2}. But min{|X|− 1,k − 2} = min{|X|,k − 1}− 1; whence αk(D) ≥ |Y | + min{|X|,k − 1} for every arc-spine digraph D.
An arc-spine digraph is k-loose if either |X| < k or there is a subset S ⊆ X with |S| = k such that no vertex y ∈ Y is adjacent to every vertex of S and there are at least two distinct vertices xu and xv in S such that {u, xu} and {v, xv} are independent sets. In constrast, an arc-spine digraph is k-tight if it is not k-loose, i.e., |X|≥ k and for every subset S ⊆ X with |S| = k either:
there exists y ∈ Y : S ⊆ N (y) or
there exists x ∈ S such that N (u) ∩ S = N (v) ∩ S = S − {x}.
In Lemma 2.4 we show that there is an analogue of [9, Lemma 1] for k-loose arc- spine digraphs. Note, however, that the concept of k-loose for arc-spine digraphs presented here is different from the concept of k-loose for spine digraphs presented in [9]. The different definition of k-loose was needed as a means to guarantee that there would be perfect analogues of Lemmas 1 and 3 from [9] for arc-spine digraphs. The analogue of [9, Lemma 3] is Lemma 2.8.
Lemma 2.4 If D[X, Y ] is a k-loose arc-spine digraph, then:
αk(D) ≥ |Y | + min{|X|, k} and
πk(D) ≤ αk(D).
Proof Recall that πk(D) ≤ |Y | + min{|X|, k} since this is the k-norm of the canonical partition (even when D is spine there is a path partition with such k- norm). Also, recall that the canonical k-partial coloring |Y | + min{|X|,k − 1} (even when D is spine there is a k-partial coloring with such weight). If |X| < k, then min{|X|,k − 1} = min{|X|, k} in this case and both (i) and (ii) hold. Thus, we may assume that |X|≥ k. So, there exists S ⊆ X with |S| = k such that no vertex y ∈ Y is adjacent to every vertex in S and there are at least two distinct vertices xu and xv in S such that {u, xu} and {v, xv} are independent sets. Suppose that S = {x1, x2,..., xk} and let Ck = {C1, C2,.  , Ck} be a k-partial coloring in which
Cp = {xp}, p = 1, 2,..., k. By the choice of S, {u, xu} is an independent set for some xu ∈ S and {v, xv} is an independent set for some xv ∈ S such that xu /= xv. We thus add u to the color class of xu, v to the color class of xv and every other

vertex y ∈ Y − {u, v} to some color class Cp such that {y, xp} is an independent set (which exists by the choice of S). The k-partial coloring Ck thus obtained has weight |Y | + k = |Y | + min{|X|, k}. Therefore, αk(D) ≥ ||Ck|| = |Y | + min{|X|, k}. Hence, we establish that (i) and (ii) hold. This finishes the proof.	2
Lemma 2.5 Given a k-tight arc-spine digraph D[X, Y ], and a zigzag-free path P = (x1, x2,..., xl) of D[X], there is an arc (xj, y) ∈ A(D) such that y ∈ Y for some k − 1 ≤ j ≤ l.
Proof Consider S = {x1, x2,..., xk}, the set of the k first vertices of P . First assume that condition (a) in the definition of k-tight digraphs is valid, that is, there exists y ∈ Y such that S ⊆ N (y). Since P is zigzag-free, we have (x1, y) ∈ A(D). So by Lemma 2.2(i), the result follows with j = k. We may thus assume that exclusively condition (b) is valid. Let xt be the only vertex of S not adjacent to both u and v (note that 1 ≤ t ≤ k). If t /= 1, we conclude that (x1, u) ∈ A(D) and (x1, v) ∈ A(D) as P is zigzag-free. By Lemma 2.2 applied to subpath x1Pxt—1 and u, we conclude that (xt—1, u) ∈ A(D). If t = k, the result follows (Figure 1); we may thus assume that t < k. Thus xt+1 is in S and v is adjacent to xt+1. Arc (v, xt+1) /∈ A(D), otherwise there would be a zigzag in P . The latter assertion is true even if t = 1 (Figure 2); in fact, the only difference when t = 1 is that we do not know the orientation of the arcs joining vertices of S to u. Since (xt+1, v) ∈ A(D) whenever 1 ≤ t < k, by Lemma 2.2 applied to subpath xt+1Pxk and v, (xk, v) ∈ A(D) and the result follows (Figure 3).	2

Figure 1. t = k. The arc (xk−1, v) ∈ A(D).

Figure 2. t = 1. The arc (xk, v) ∈ A(D).

Lemma 2.6 Given a k-tight arc-spine digraph D[X, Y ], and a zigzag-free path P = (x1, x2,..., xl) of D[X], there is an arc (y, xi) ∈ A(D) such that y ∈ Y for some 1 ≤ i ≤ l.
Proof Consider S = {xl—k—1, xl—k,..., xl}, the set of the k last vertices of P . First assume that condition (a) is valid. By Lemma 2.2, the result follows immediately.



Figure 3. The arc (xk, v) ∈ A(D).
We may thus assume that exclusively condition (b) is valid. So let x be the unique vertex of S not adjacent to u and v. Consider first the case in which vertex x /= xl. Then, as u is adjacent to every vertex of S − {x}, it is adjacent to xl. Since P is zigzag-free, (u, xl) ∈ A(D) in this case. Now, when x = xl, vertex u is adjacent to every vertex of S − {x}, it is adjacent to xl—1. Since P is zigzag-free, (u, xl—1) ∈ A(D) and the result follows in both cases.	2
Lemma 2.7 Given a 2-tight arc-spine digraph D[X, Y ], and a zigzag-free path P = (x1, x2,..., xl) of D[X], for each vertex xp of P, there must be some vertex yp ∈ Y adjacent to xp, for every p = 1, 2,.  , l.
Proof Assume, to the contrary, that there is some p such that no vertex of Y is adjacent to xp. First we show that both u and v are adjacent to every vertex in X − {xp}, let Sq = {xp, xq} be a set of two vertices of X for some q /= p. Since no vertex of Y is adjacent to xp and D is 2-tight, we conclude (b) holds for Sq. Thus, both u and v are adjacent to xq. Such argument holds for every q,1 ≤ q ≤ l, p /= q. We therefore conclude that both u and v are adjacent to every vertex in X − xp.
Consider first the case in which p = 1. As the digraph D is 2-tight, |X| = l ≥ 2. Since P is zigzag-free, (u, xl) ∈ A(D) and (v, xl) ∈ A(D). By Lemma 2.2, we deduce (v, x2) ∈ A(D). But then P has a zigzag, a contradiction. We may thus assume p /= 1. By a symmetric reasoning, we can deduce p /= l.
Since P is zigzag-free, we conclude that (x1, u) ∈ A(D), (x1, v) ∈ A(D), (u, xl) ∈ A(D) and (v, xl) ∈ A(D). By Lemma 2.2, we conclude that (xq, u) ∈ A(D), (xq, v) ∈ A(D) for 1 ≤ q < p and (u, xq) ∈ A(D) and (v, xq) ∈ A(D) for p < q ≤ l. But then (xp—1, u, v, xp+1) is a zigzag in P ; again a contradiction.	2
The most ingenious part of the proof presented by Sambinelli, Nunes da Silva and Lee is the proof of [9, Lemma 3] . Next, we show the proof of its analogue for arc-spine digraphs, Lemma 2.8. Again, note that the concept of k-tight for spine digraphs is different from the presented definition of k-tight arc-spine digraphs. Fur- thermore, we point out that the proof of the base case of Lemma 2.8 is considerably more intricate than the base case of [9, Lemma 3].
Lemma 2.8 Let D[X, Y ] be a k-tight arc-spine digraph and let P = (x1, x2,.	, xl)
be a zigzag-free path of D. Then, there exist paths P1 and P2 such that:
V (P1) ∩ V (P2)= ∅;
|P1| + |P2|≥ |X| + k + 1;
ter(P1) ∪ ter(P2)= {xl, y}, for some y ∈ Y ;

X ⊆ V (P1) ∪ V (P2).
Proof We begin by stating the following useful claim.
Claim 2.9 Let t < l. If there exist yt and yt+1 such that (xt, yt) ∈ A(D) and
(yt+1, xt+1) ∈ A(D) then we may assume that
yt /= yt+1;
yt /= u;
yt+1 /= v;
otherwise either P is not zigzag-free or paths P1 and P2 trivially exist.
Proof We know that yt /= yt+1 because P is zigzag-free. Then, the first condition follows trivially. Assume that yt = u. Then yt+1 /= v, since P is zigzag-free. Now, consider the paths P1 = Pxt ◦ (xt, yt = u, v) and P2 = (yt+1, xt+1) ◦ xt+1P . Paths P1 and P2 meet conditions (i) through (iv). Finally, assume that yt+1 = v. Then yt /= u, since P is zigzag-free. Consider the two paths P1 = Pxt ◦ (xt, yt) and P2 = (u, v = yt+1, xt+1) ◦ xt+1P .  Paths P1 and P2 meet conditions (i) through
(iv).	2
The proof of the Lemma is by induction on k. The base case is k = 2. Given a 2-tight arc-spine digraph D, by Lemma 2.5 there is a vertex y ∈ Y such that (xj, y) ∈ A(D) for some xj ∈ V (P ). Among all arcs (xj, yj) ∈ A(D) with yj ∈ Y choose an arc aj such that j is maximum. As P is zigzag-free in D, we have that j < l and so the vertex xj+1 exists. Note that by Lemma 2.7 and the choice of aj, we can claim the existence of some vertex yj+1 ∈ Y such that (yj+1, xj+1) ∈ A(D). By Claim 2.9, we conclude that yj /= yj+1, yj /= u and yj+1 /= v. By Lemma 2.6 there is a vertex y ∈ Y such that (y, x) ∈ A(D) for some x ∈ V (P ). Let (yi, xi) ∈ A(D) such that i is minimum. We shall now show that i ≤ j. Let S = {xj, xj+1}. Since yj+1 /= v, we know that (v, xj+1) ∈/ A(D). If (a) holds for S, then there is a vertex y ∈ Y adjacent to both vertices in S. Thus, (y, xj+1) ∈ A(D) by the choice of the arc aj and since P is zigzag-free, (y, xj) ∈ A(D). If (b) holds for the subset S, then by the choice of the arc aj, (xj+1, v) ∈/ A(D) and since v /= yj+1, we deduce that (v, xj+1) ∈/ A(D). Therefore, u and v are adjacent to xj where (u, xj) ∈ A(D) as yj /= u. Since i is minimum, the analysis of these two cases allow us to conclude i ≤ j. Moreover, i > 1, otherwise P is not zigzag-free. Then, vertex xi—1 exists and so does arc (xi—1, yi—1) by the minimality of i and Lemma 2.7. Again, by Claim 2.9, we conclude that yi—1 /= yi, yi—1 /= u and yi /= v.
To conclude the base case, let Sj = {xi—1, xj+1}. Since yj+1 /= v and yi—1 /= u, neither xj+1 nor xi—1 can be simultaneously adjacent to u and v; therefore, (b) cannot hold for Sj. Then, (a) holds for Sj and there is a vertex yj such that it is adjacent to both vertices of Sj. By the choice of j, we have that (yj, xj+1) ∈ A(D). Therefore, yj /= yj because P is zigzag-free. By a symmetric reasoning we deduce that (xi—1, yj) ∈ A(D) and yj /= yi. By Claim 2.9 we have that yj /= u and yj /= v.
Vertices yi and yj may or may not be the same. Consider first the case in which
yi /= yj. Then, paths P1 = P xi—1 ◦ (xi—1, yj, xj+1) ◦xj+1P and P2 = (yi, xi) ◦xiPxj ◦



Figure 4. yi /= yj . The paths P1 = P xi−1 ○ (xi−1, y′, xj+1) ○ xj+1P and P2 = (yi, xi) ○ xiP xj ○ (xj , yj ).

Figure 5. yi = yj and (xt, yt) ∈ A(D). The paths P1 = P xt−1 ○ (xt−1, y′, xj+1) ○ xj+1P and
P2 = (yt, xt) ○ xtP xj ○ (xj , yj ) satisfy the conditions (i) through (iv).
(xj, yj) satisfy conditions (i) through (iv) (Figure 4).
We may thus assume that yi = yj. We will now show that some vertex xt, i ≤ t ≤ j, is not adjacent to yj. To do so, assume the contrary. Then, by Lemma 2.2, since (yj, xj+1) ∈ A(D), we must have arc (yj, xi—1) ∈ A(D) as well; a contradiction to the choice of i. Thus, choose i ≤ t ≤ j such that t is minimum and xt is not adjacent to yj. By Lemma 2.7, there is some vertex yt ∈ Y adjacent to xt. As yt is adjacent to xt, clearly yt /= yj. We shall now show that yt is distinct from yi = yj. Assume to the contrary that yt = yi = yj is the only vertex in Y adjacent to xt. Recall that yi /= u and yj /= v. Let St = {xt, xj+1}. Since yi /= u and yj /= v, (a) must hold for St. Therefore, (xj, yj = yt) ∈ A(D) and (yt, xj+1) ∈ A(D); so P has a zigzag, a contradiction. We thus deduce that yt is distinct from yi = yj.
If (xt, yt) ∈ A(D), then the paths P1 = Pxi—1 ◦ (xi—1, yj, xj+1) ◦ xj+1P and
P2 = xt+1Pxj ◦ (xj, yj = yi, xi) ◦ xiPxt ◦ (xt, yt) satisfy the conditions (i) through
(iv) (Figure 5).
If (yt, xt) ∈ A(D) note that, by the choice of t we know that yj is adjacent to every vertex in (xi—1,..., xt—1). Moreover, since (xi—1, yj) ∈ A(D), by Lemma 2.2 (xt—1, yj) ∈ A(D). Then, the paths P1 = Pxt—1 ◦ (xt—1, yj, xj+1) ◦ xj+1P and P2 = (yt, xt) ◦ xtPxj ◦ (xj, yj) satisfy the conditions (i) through (iv) (Figure 6).
Finally, the proof of the base case k = 2 is complete. Assume thus that k > 2.
By Lemma 2.5 there is some vertex xj ∈ V (P ) such that there is some arc (xj, yj) ∈ A(D) for yj ∈ Y and j ≥ k − 1. Among all such arcs choose an arc aj with j maximum. Since P is zigzag-free, we know that j < l and thus there is a vertex xj+1 in P . Let Xj = V (P xj) and let



Figure 6. yi = yj and (yt, xt) ∈ A(D). The paths P1 = P xt−1 ○ (xt−1, y′, xj+1) ○ xj+1P and
P2 = (yt, xt) ○ xtP xj ○ (xj , yj ) satisfy the conditions (i) through (iv).

Y j = {yj : yj ∈ Y and yj is adjacent to xj+1}, if at least one of {u, v} is adjacent to xj+1;
Y j = {yj : yj ∈ Y and yj is adjacent to xj+1}∪ {u}, otherwise.

Note that yj /∈ Y j as yj /= u by Claim 2.9 and P is zigzag-free. Morevover, if some vertex of Y j is not adjacent to xj+1, that vertex is u and v /∈ Y j in this case. Let Dj = D[Xj,Y j] and let Pj = Pxj. If Y j is a stable set, then Dj is a spine digraph and since at least one vertex in {u, v} is in Y j, it can be shown that Dj is (k − 1)-tight. According to [9, Lemma 3], Dj has paths Pj and Pj that meet the
1	2
conditions (i) through (iv) above. Consider now the case in which Y j contains u
and v.
We shall show that Pj is zigzag-free in Dj. Assume the contrary. Then, since P is zigzag-free in D, this implies that there either is an arc (xj—1, u) ∈ A(Dj) or (xj, y) ∈ A(Dj) for some vertex y ∈ Y j. However, if (xj—1, u) ∈ A(Dj), since v ∈ Y j then (v, xj+1) ∈ A(D) and P would not be zigzag-free in D, a contradiction. Similarly, if (xj, y) ∈ A(Dj) for some vertex y ∈ Y j, since y /= u by Claim 2.9, we deduce (y, xj+1) ∈ A(D). But then P would not be zigzag-free in D, again a contradiction.
We shall now show that Dj is a (k − 1)-tight arc-spine digraph. Let Sj ⊆ Xj be an arbitrary set of k − 1 vertices; by Lemma 2.5 we know that j ≥ k − 1. Let S = Sj ∪ {xj+1} be a set of k vertices of D. Since D is k-tight, either (a) or (b) holds for S. If (a) holds for S in D, then it is easy to see that (a) also holds for Sj in Dj. So suppose that (b) holds for S in D. We do know that {u, v}∈ Y j, therefore (v, xj+1) ∈ A(Dj). So, the only vertex in S not adjacent to u and v is some vertex of Sj and (b) holds for Sj in Dj (Figure 7).
We have thus shown that Dj is a (k−1)-tight arc-spine digraph (an assertion that holds even if Y j is stable) and Pj is zigzag-free. By the induction hypothesis applied to Dj and Pj, there exist paths Pj and Pj in Dj which satisfy conditions (i) through

(iv). Assume, without loss of generality, that ter(Pj) = xj and ter(Pj) = yj,

for some yj ∈ Y j.  If (yj, xj+1) ∈ A and we may take P1 = Pj ◦ (xj, yj) and
P2 = Pj ◦ (yj, xj+1) ◦ xj+1P as the paths of D. Condition (i) holds in this case because Pj and Pj are disjoint by induction hypothesis and neither vertex yj nor

any vertex of xj+1P are vertices of Dj. When (yj, xj+1) /∈ A, it is certain that yj = u
and v /∈ Y j. So we may take P1 = Pj ◦ xjP and P2 = Pj ◦ (u, v) as the paths of

D. Condition (i) also holds in this case. At last, we claim that P1 and P2 meet all
conditions (i) through (iv) in either case. Conditions (iii) and (iv) obviously hold. Condition (ii) holds because |P j| + |P j| = j + k by induction hypothesis. Therefore

|P1| + |P2| = |P j| + |P j| + |X|− j +1 = |X| + k +1

and the proof is complete.	2
Theorem 2.10 Let D[X, Y ] be a arc-spine digraph. Then, πk(D) ≤ αk(D).
Proof We may assume that D is k-tight, otherwise the result follows by Lemma 2.4. We know that αk(D) ≥ |Y | + min{|X|,k − 1}. Since D is k-tight, we have by definition that |X|≥ k and, therefore, that αk(D) ≥ |Y | + k − 1. Now, suppose that λ(D) > |X|. Since λ(D) > |X|, there exists a path P in D such that |P | = |X| + 1. Let P = P ∪ {(v) : v ∈/ V (P )}. Clearly, P is a path partition of D and |P|k = min{|P|, k}+|Y |−1= |Y |+k−1. Therefore, πk(D) ≤ |P|k = |Y |+k−1 ≤ αk(D) and the result follows. Hence, we may assume that λ(D)= |X|. Let P = (x1, x2,.  , xl)
be a Hamilton path in D[X]. Since λ(D)= |X|, we have that P is a longest path in D; as such, it must be zigzag-free. By Lemma 2.8, there exist disjoint paths P1 and P2 in D such that |P1| + |P2| = |X| + k + 1.  Note that |Pi| > k, for i = 1, 2, otherwise P3—i would be larger than |X|. Let P = {P1, P2}∪ {(y) : y ∈/ V (P1)∪V (P2)}. It is easy to see that P is a path partition in D. The k-norm of P is
|P|k = min{|P1|, k}+min{|P2|, k}+|Y |−k−1= |Y |+k−1. So, πk(D) ≤ |Y |+k−1 and the result follows.	2
3	Conclusion
Sambinelli, Nunes da Silva and Lee adapted the technique of the proof of Linial’s Dual Conjecture for split digraphs to prove Linial’s Conjecture for spine digraphs. In this paper we were able to apply the same technique to a superclass of spine digraphs. The most important statement proved is Lemma 2.8, whose assertion and structure of the inductive proof has similar elements to that of [9, Lemma 3]. Even though spine and arc-spine digraphs are very similar in structure, the proof of the base case for arc-spine digraphs happens to be a lot more complex than the base case for spine digraphs. It is hard to understand at this moment what does that represent. Intuition suggests that it might be possible to adapt the structure of

the proof presented here to deal with superclasses of spine digraphs more complex in structure than arc-spine digraphs.
