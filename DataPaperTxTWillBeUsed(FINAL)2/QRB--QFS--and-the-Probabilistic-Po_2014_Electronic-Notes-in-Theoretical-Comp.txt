Abstract
We show that the first author’s QRB-domains coincide with Li and Xu’s QFS-domains, and also with Lawson-compact quasi-continuous dcpos, with stably-compact locally finitary compact spaces, with sober QFS-spaces, and with sober QRB-spaces. The first three coincidences were discovered independently by Lawson and Xi. The equivalence with sober QFS-spaces is then applied to give a novel, direct proof that the probabilistic powerdomain of a QRB-domain is a QRB-domain. This improves upon a previous, similar result, which was limited to pointed, second-countable QRB-domains.
Keywords: QRB-spaces, QFS-spaces, QRB-domains, QFS-domains, stably compact spaces, probabilistic powerdomain


Introduction
An outstanding problem in denotational semantics is whether there is a full sub- category of continuous dcpos that is both Cartesian-closed and closed under the action of the probabilistic powerdomain monad V [17]. Indeed, there are very few categories of dcpos that are known to be closed under V: the category of all dcpos, that of all continuous dcpos [15], and that of all Lawson compact continuous dcpos [17]. To that list, one must add the pointed, second-countable QRB-domains [10].

While QRB-domains are only quasi-continuous and not continuous domains, and do not form a Cartesian-closed category either, they have attracted considerable attention recently.
QRB-domains are defined by imitating RB-domains. Independently, Li and Xu used a similar process to define QFS-domains [23], imitating the construction of FS-domains [16]. Rather surprisingly, QRB and QFS-domains are the same thing (RB and FS-domains are not known to coincide), and are also exactly the Lawson- compact quasi-continuous domains. This was shown independently by the present authors and J. Lawson and X. Xi. We present our proof in Section 5 below; Lawson’s and Xi’s proof will appear as [21].
One of our characterizations of QRB is as so-called sober QFS-spaces, and this will turn out to be instrumental in proving that the category of all QRB-domains, and not just the second-countable ones, is closed under the action of the probabilistic powerdomain, as we shall see in Section 6. This improves upon [10], and relies on a rather different proof argument.
Outline. After some brief preliminaries (Section 2), we discuss the notion of functional approximation in Section 3. This is a central concept in domain theory, at the heart of RB-, FS-, QRB-, and QFS-domains. Another domain-theoretic leitmotiv is that one should always topologize (paraphrasing M. Stone), and we introduce QFS-spaces in Section 4 as the natural topological counterpart of QFS- domains. We give our proof that QRB-domains and QFS-domains are the same thing (and coincide with four other natural notions, including sober QFS-spaces) in Section 5. We apply this to the promised result that the probabilistic powerdomain of a QRB-domain is a QRB-domain in Section 6.

Preliminaries
We refer to the classic texts [6,1] for the required domain-theoretic background, and to [11] for topology.
We agree that a subset of a space is compact if and only if every open cover has a finite subcover, that is, we do not require separation. We take coherence to mean that the intersection of any two compact saturated subsets is compact. (A saturated subset is one that is equal to the intersection of its open neighborhoods.) A space is stably compact if it is sober, compact, locally compact and coherent. As is well-known, the patch topology of a stably compact space is compact Hausdorff, see [11, Section 9] or [6, Section VI-6] for more details.
Any sober space is well-ﬁltered, meaning that if an open subset U contains a

filtered intersection T

i∈I
Qi of compact saturated subsets, then U contains Qi for

some i ∈ I. In a well-filtered space, every such filtered intersection is compact.
Given a T0 topological space (X; τ ), we will make heavy use of its specialisation order defined as x ≤ y if x ∈ {y}. We write ↑ E for the upward closure (w.r.t. ≤) of a subset E. Subsets equal to their upward closure are exactly the saturated one. If E is finite, then ↑ E is compact, and we call such sets the ﬁnitary compacts of X. The set of compact saturated subsets of a topological space (X; τ ) may be

equipped with an order by setting A ≤ B iff A ⊇ B, and we write Q(X) for the resulting poset. It may also be equipped with the upper Vietoris topology, which has a base of opens of the form 2U , U ∈ τ , where 2U denotes the collection of compact saturated subsets contained in U . This yields the upper space QV(X) of X. Happily, the specialisation order of the upper space is precisely reverse inclusion. Analogously, We write Fin(X) for the collection of finitary compacts of X, and topologize it with the subspace topology, yielding a space that we write FinV(X). When X is well-filtered (e.g., sober), Q(X) is a dcpo and directed suprema are computed as intersections.
For a finite subset E of a poset (X, ≤) and x ∈ X, write E  x iff every directed family (xi)i∈I whose supremum supi∈I xi is above x in X contains an element xi that is above some element z of E. We also write ↑ E  x instead of E  x, stressing the fact that this is a property of the finitary compact ↑ E, not just of the finite set E. The dcpo X is a quasi-continuous domain (see [7] or [6, Definition III-3.2]) if and only if for every x ∈ X, the collection of all ↑ E ∈ Fin(X) that approximate x (↑ E  x) is directed (w.r.t. ⊇) and their least upper bound in Q(X) is ↑ x.

Functional approximation
We are concerned with spaces in which points are “systematically” approximated, by which we mean that we are given functions which produce approximants for each element. In domain theory, the idea goes back to Plotkin’s characterization of SFP-domains, [24], as those dcpos X for which there is a chain of Scott-continuous functions (ϕn)n∈N from X to X, satisfying the following properties
for each n ∈ N, ϕn ≤ idX ;
for each n ∈ N, ϕn ◦ ϕn = ϕn;
for each n ∈ N, ϕn has finite image;
idX =  ↑	ϕn.
Plotkin also showed that the retracts of SFP-domains can be characterised similarly, by dropping the idempotency requirement (ii). If instead of a chain, only a directed family of such functions is present, then one obtains RB-domains. The concept was further generalized in the work of the second author, [16], where instead of requiring finite image, ﬁnite separation is stipulated: A function ϕ : X → X is ﬁnitely separated from idX if there exists a finite set M ⊆ X such that
∀x ∈ X. ∃m ∈ M. ϕ(x) ≤ m ≤ x.
An FS-domain, then, is a dcpo which contains a directed family (ϕi)i∈I of contin-
uous functions finitely separated from identity such that idX = ↑	ϕi.
In 2010 the first author, [9] realised that the concept of functional approximation could usefully be further generalized by allowing the approximating functions to produce compact neighborhoods rather than points, that is, the ϕi now take values in QV(X) rather than X. With this generalization there are then two choices to be

made about their ﬁniteness character :
Choice 1 One can require the ϕi to have finite image in QV(X) or not make any such restriction.
Choice 2 One can require the ϕi to only produce finitary compacts or allow general compact saturated sets.
Together this means that there are four variants that one might consider and it may come as a relief to the reader that they will in fact all turn out to lead to the same structures. Specifically, we will show that the most liberal notion, arbitrary image of general compact saturated sets, and the most restrictive one, finite image of finitary compacts, coincide. This will be true with and without assuming sobriety.
Definition 3.1 A continuous function ϕ : X → QV(X) is called a quasi-deflation if it is has finite image and for each x ∈ X, x ∈ ϕ(x) ∈ Fin X. It is called quasi-ﬁnitely separated (or qfs for short) if there exists a finite set M ⊆ X such that for every x ∈ X there is m ∈ M such that x ∈ ↑ m ⊆ ϕ(x). In this case, we say that ϕ is separated by M , or that M is a separating set for ϕ.
We shall agree to order continuous maps from X to QV(X) in the pointwise ex- tension of ⊇. Accordingly, a family (ϕi)i∈I of continuous functions from X to QV(X) is directed if and only if it is non-empty and for all i, j ∈ I, there is a k ∈ I such that, for every x ∈ X, ϕk(x) ⊆ ϕi(x), ϕj(x). We call it approximating if it is directed and

furthermore, ↑ x = T
i∈I
ϕi(x) holds for all x ∈ X.

We call a T0 topological space (X; τ )a QRB-space if there is an approximating
family of quasi-deflations for it. It is called a QFS-space if there is an approximating family of quasi-finitely separated maps.
A QFS- (or QRB-) space (X; τ ; (ϕi)i∈I ) is called topological if for all U ∈ τ and
x ∈ U there is i ∈ I such that ϕi(x) ⊆ U .
Clearly, every quasi-deflation ϕ is also qfs because we can take the finitely many minimal elements of the finitely many possible images of ϕ as the separating set. Therefore, every QRB-space is also QFS. To explain the last part of the definition, we give an example to show that not every QFS-space is topological:
Example 3.2 Consider the poset P1 in Figure 1 consisting of the natural numbers in their usual order plus an extra element a not related to any of the others. Equip this set with the Alexandroff topology (of all upper sets) and consider the map ϕm which maps each n ∈ N to ↑ min{m, n} and a to ↑ m ∪ {a}. Clearly, each ϕm is a quasi-deflation. Furthermore, the family (ϕm)m∈N is approximating and thus P1 is a QRB-space. However, for no m ∈ N do we have that ϕm(a) ⊆ ↑ a = {a}.
QFS-spaces
Proposition 4.1 QFS-spaces are compact.
Proof. Let X be a QFS-space and ϕ be any qfs map on X with separating set M . Then X = ↑ M since every x ∈ X is above some m ∈ M by definition. Since M is

Fig. 1. Two example spaces
finite, we have compactness.	2
For local compactness we start with a useful lemma:
Lemma 4.2 Let ϕ be a qfs map on a topological space X, separated by the ﬁnite set M. Then for every x ∈ X, x is in the interior of ↑(M ∩ ϕ(x)).
Proof. Fix x ∈ X and let U = X z ↓(M z ϕ(x)). Because of the finiteness of M , U is an open set and a neighborhood of ϕ(x). Let V = ϕ−1(2U ), which is an open set since ϕ is continuous. By construction, x is a member of V and, furthermore, we claim that V ⊆ ↑(M ∩ ϕ(x)). Indeed, let y ∈ V . Then ϕ(y) ⊆ U and hence the separating element m ∈ M with m ∈ ϕ(y) and m ≤ y also belongs to U . Hence m ∈ M ∩ ϕ(x) and y ∈ ↑(M ∩ ϕ(x)) follows.	2
A topological space X is locally ﬁnitary compact if every open neighborhood U of an arbitrary point x contains a locally finitary neighborhood ↑ E of x: U ⊇ ↑ E ⊇ int(↑ E) e x. The notion originates with Isbell [14], and the T0 such spaces are called qc-spaces in [21]. Every quasi-continuous domain is locally finitary compact, since in this case int(↑ E) = {x ∈ X | E  x} [6, III-3.6(ii)]. The following is immediate from the definitions and the preceding lemma:
Lemma 4.3 Every topological QFS-space is locally ﬁnitary compact.
It would be nice if one could also show coherence for QFS-spaces but without further assumptions this is not possible, even for QRB-spaces:
Example 4.4 Consider the poset P2 in Figure 1 together with the Scott topology
(note that the only non-trivial directed suprema are a =  ↑	an and b =  ↑	bn).
The QRB property is established by maps fm, m ∈ N, which map


and by setting ϕm(x) = ↑ fm(x). The resulting QRB-space is topological because every Scott neighborhood of a (resp. b) must contain some final segment of an’s (resp. bn’s). It is not coherent, though, because ↑ a ∩ ↑ b = {dn | n ∈ N} is not compact.
The situation is much nicer if we assume our spaces to be sober. First, since sobriety implies well-filteredness, we immediately have the following:
Lemma 4.5 Sober QFS-spaces are topological.
Combining the last two lemmas we get that sober QFS-spaces are locally finitary compact, and it is known from [3], or the equivalence between (6) and (11) in [22, Theorem 2], or [21, Corollary 3.6], or [11, Exercise 8.3.39], that the sober, locally finitary compact spaces are exactly the quasi-continuous dcpos in their Scott topology. Thus we have:
Proposition 4.6 Sober QFS-spaces are quasi-continuous domains, and their given topology coincides with the Scott topology derived from the specialisation order.
Thus it is appropriate to call sober QFS-spaces, QFS-domains, and similarly for sober QRB-spaces. A little amount of work should convince the reader that these QFS-domains are exactly the same of those defined by Li and Xu [23].
How far are (topological) QFS-spaces from QFS-domains? As it turns out, not very far as we will now show that sobrification leads from one to the other.
The sobrification Xˆ of a topological space (X; τ ) can be described in a number
of ways; the most convenient for our purposes is to realise it concretely as the set of closed irreducible 4 subsets of X, together with the topology τˆ which consists of open sets Uˆ = {A ∈ Xˆ | A ∩ U /= ∅}, where U ranges over the open sets in τ . Note that X and Xˆ have isomorphic frames of opens.
Given a qfs map ϕ : X → QV(X) we replace ϕ(x) with its set of open neigh- borhoods, defined as {U ∈ τ | ϕ(x) ⊆ U}. This is always a Scott-open filter in the frame τ , and the Hofmann-Mislove Theorem tells us that, conversely, every Scott-
open filter F of τ corresponds to a unique compact saturated set QF of the sobrifi- cation Xˆ of X. Indeed, F consists precisely of the opens U such that Uˆ is a neigh- borhood of QF , that is, a closed irreducible set belongs to QF if and only if it meets every member of F. For the upper Vietoris topology on QV(Xˆ), the basic open set 2Uˆ consists of those compacts QF where F ranges over the Scott-open filters which contain U . Using this setup, we define ϕ˜: Xˆ → QV(Xˆ) by mapping A ∈ Xˆ to Qψ(A) where ψ(A)= {U ∈ τ | ∃a ∈ A. ϕ(a) ⊆ U} = {U ∈ τ | A ∩ ϕ−1(2U ) /= ∅}.
Lemma 4.7 For ϕ : X → QV(X) qfs, ϕ˜ is a qfs map.
Proof. The function ϕ˜, equivalently ψ, is well-defined: if a directed union of opens belongs to ψ(A) then it covers ϕ(a) for some a ∈ A. Because ϕ(a) is compact, one of them does so already. Filteredness follows from ϕ−1(2U ∩ 2V )= ϕ−1(2(U ∩V )) = ϕ−1(2U ) ∩ ϕ−1(2V ) and the assumption that A is irreducible.

4 A set is irreducible if it meets every member of a finite family of open sets precisely if it meets their intersection (from which it follows that irreducible sets are non-empty).

For continuity, observe that ϕ˜—1(2Uˆ) = ψ—1({F | U ∈ F}) = {A ∈ Xˆ
ϕ—1(2U ) /= ∅} = ϕ—^1(2U ).
| A ∩

For finite separation, we assume that M is a separating set for ϕ. We show that

the set Mˆ
= {↓ m | m ∈ M} is separating for ϕ˜. Let A be a closed irreducible set.

For every U ∈ ψ(A) we have by definition that there is a ∈ A such that ϕ(a) ⊆ U . It follows that U ∩ (M ∩ A) is non-empty. Hence the family of these sets, indexed by U ∈ ψ(A), is a proper filter on the finite set M ∩ A and so there is mA ∈ M belonging to all of them. We clearly have that ↓ mA ⊆ A and because mA is in every U ∈ ψ(A), ↓ mA meets every element of ψ(A), whence ↓ mA ∈ Qψ(A) = ϕ˜(A).  2
The above construction has been chosen for its brevity but we may point out that the underlying idea relies on a natural transformation T (a “distributive law”)

from [−ˆ ] ◦Q to Q ◦ [−ˆ ]. Our map ϕ˜ is the composition Xˆ ϕ^  ^(X)−T→Q
(Xˆ).

V	V	−→QV	V
An even more explicit construction is also possible, and it demonstrates nicely the
usefulness of the “Topological Rudin Lemma” presented in [13]: We invite the reader

to use the latter to show that T (C) = {A ∈ Xˆ
| ∀Q ∈ C. Q ∩ A /= ∅}, and to also

use it to reprove Lemma 4.7 with that definition.
Finally, we would like to show that the lifted family (ϕ˜i)i∈I is approximating

for
Xˆ. It is here where we need the condition that the original QFS space be

topological, as without this condition this would not be the case. Consider again Example 3.2: The sobrification of the space P1 consists of the sets ↓ x, x ∈ X plus one more, the chain A = N. By definition, A belongs to each ϕ˜m(↓ a): check that, for every aj ≤ a, A meets every open neighborhood U of ϕm(aj). Hence A is also in the intersection of all ϕ˜m(↓ a), but it does not belong to ↑(↓ a)= {{a}}.
We come to the main result of this section:
Theorem 4.8 The sobriﬁcation of a topological QFS space is a QFS domain.
Proof. All that remains is to show that the family (ϕ˜i)i∈I is approximating for Xˆ.

Let A ∈ Xˆ
be a closed irreducible subset of X and let B be another such, not

above A. This means that B does not contain A (as subsets of X), and so let a ∈ A z B. By the definition of topological QFS spaces we obtain an index i ∈ I such that ϕi(a) is contained in the open set X z B. Writing ψi(A) for {U ∈ τ |
∃a ∈ A. ϕi(a) ⊆ U}, so that ϕ˜i(A) = Qψi(A), we obtain that U ∈ ψi(A) for U =
X z B. Since U does not meet B, B is not in ϕ˜i(A).	2

QFS-domains
We have already seen that the addition of sobriety to the conditions for a QFS-space results in much nicer structures. The best is still to come, however. We begin by giving a short argument to show that QFS-domains are coherent, a result which appears as Corollary 3.9 in [21]. First a lemma, also from [21]:
Lemma 5.1 If X is a QFS-domain then QV(X) is an FS-domain.
Proof. If ϕ is a qfs map on X separated by M , then Φ: QV(X) → QV(X), defined

by Φ(K)= ↑ ϕ[K], is finitely separated: For the separating set consider all sets ↑ E, E ⊆ M .	2
Proposition 5.2 The topology of a QFS-domain is coherent.
Proof. Let K, L be compact saturated sets of X. They are points in QV(X) and generate principal upper, hence compact, sets ↑QV (X) K and ↑QV (X) L. Since QV(X) is an FS-domain, it is coherent, hence the set K = ↑QV (X) K ∩↑QV (X) L is a compact saturated set. The claim follows from the observation that K ∩ L = K and the fact that  , as the multiplication of the upper powerspace monad ([25, Chapter 7]), is a continuous map from QV(QV(X)) to QV(X).	2
For quasi-continuous domains, compactness plus coherence is the same as com- pactness in the Lawson topology. This follows, for example, from the fact that the Lawson and patch topologies coincide on quasi-continuous dcpos [6, Lemma V- 5.15], and that every patch-compact space is coherent and compact [11, Propo- sition 9.1.27], while conversely quasi-continuous domains are locally compact and sober [11, Exercise 8.2.15]. We thus have the following refinement of Proposition 4.6:
Corollary 5.3 QFS-domains are Lawson-compact quasi-continuous domains equipped with their Scott topology.
We now work towards the converse of this:
Proposition 5.4 Every compact, locally compact, coherent space X has an approx- imating family of maps ϕn : X → QV(X) with ﬁnite image. Precisely, M ranges over the ﬁnite ∨-semi-lattices M of compact saturated sets of X, and ϕn maps each x ∈ X to the smallest element of M whose interior contains x.
Note that ϕn takes values in Q(X), not in Fin(X). Smallest is taken with respect to inclusion. A ∨-semi-lattice of compact saturated sets is a family of sets that is closed under finite intersections (in particular, contains X).
Proof. Define ϕn(x) as the intersection of all the elements Q of M that are neigh- borhoods of x. Using the fact that M is finite, ϕn(x) is the smallest neighborhood of x in M, so ϕn(x) is well defined, and in Q(X) by coherence and compactness. For continuity, let U be open and consider x ∈ ϕ—1(2U ). Let Q = ϕn(x). For every y ∈ int(Q), ϕn(y) ⊆ Q ⊆ U , so y is in ϕ—1(2U ). Hence int(Q) is an open
neighborhood of x included in ϕ—1(2U ), so ϕ—1(2U ) is open.
n	n
Clearly, if M ⊆ Mj, then ϕn(x) ⊇ ϕn′ (x) for every x ∈ X. The family of
all ϕn is directed: given M and Mj, there is a smallest semi-lattice MH Mj of compact saturated sets containing M and Mj, consisting of the intersections Q∩Qj with Q ∈ M and Qj ∈ Mj; coherence implies that each such Q ∩ Qj is compact saturated, and ϕnHn′ is above both ϕn and ϕn′ (w.r.t. ⊇).
All that remains to show is that the maps ϕ  form an approximating family. Given x ∈ X, ↑ x ⊆ Tn ϕn(x) is by definition. For the reverse inclusion, we show that every open neighborhood U of x contains Tn ϕn(x). By local compactness,

U contains a compact saturated neighborhood Q of x. M = {Q, X} qualifies as a semi-lattice of compact saturated sets, and we have ϕn(x)= Q ⊆ U .	2
The following is standard:
Lemma 5.5 Let X be a locally ﬁnitary compact space. For every compact saturated subset Q of X, and every open neighborhood U of Q, there is a further, ﬁnitary compact neighborhood ↑ E of Q contained in U.
Proposition 5.6 Every compact, locally ﬁnitary compact, coherent space X has an approximating family of quasi-deflations.
Proof. Applying Proposition 5.4, we obtain an approximating family of maps ϕn. We need to replace each compact saturated subset Q ∈ im ϕn by a finitary compact. Assume first that we are given an open neighborhood UQ around each of them.
Lemma 5.5 allows us to find finitary compact neighborhoods ↑ EQ between Q and UQ. We seek to find ↑ EQ so that, additionally, Q ⊆ Qj implies ↑ EQ ⊆ ↑ EQ′ . To ensure this, we define ↑ EQ step by step, always working on the largest Q ∈M that is still to be considered (so we start with X itself, the largest element of M). Given any Q ∈ M such that ↑ EQ′ is already defined for every strictly larger Qj ∈ M, we apply Lemma 5.5 and define ↑ EQ′ as some finitary compact neighborhood of Q contained in UQ ∩ Q′∈n int(↑ EQ).
Q′≥Q
We now replace each Q ∈ im ϕn by the so chosen ↑ EQ, resulting in a function ψn,£,C , where U is the collection of open neighborhoods UQ we started with, and E is the collection of finitary compacts ↑ EQ. We need to check that ψn,£,C is

continuous, and for that we check that ψ—1
(2U ) is open for every open subset U

of X. Let x be an element of ψ—1
(2U ), and Q = ϕn(x); in particular, ↑ EQ ⊆ U .

As in the proof of Proposition 5.4, every element y of int(Q) is such that ϕn(y) ⊆ Q; for Qj = ϕn(y), Qj ⊆ Q implies ↑ EQ′ ⊆ ↑ EQ, so ψn,£,C (y) ⊆ ↑ EQ ⊆ U . Therefore

int(Q) is an open neighborhood of x included in ψ—1
(2U ).

The family of all maps ψn,£,C (namely, with E = (↑ EQ)Q∈n monotone, U = (UQ)Q∈n, and Q ⊆ int(↑ EQ) ⊆ ↑ EQ ⊆ UQ for each Q ∈ M) is approximating, since we can choose the initial neighborhoods UQ as close to each Q ∈M as we like, and it remains to show that it is directed. It is non-empty: choose M = {X} and U = M, and define ↑ EX as X itself, which is finitary compact as a consequence of Lemma 5.5 with Q = U = X. We find an upper bound of ψn,£,C and ψn′,£′,C′ by defining N = MH Mj, and for the open neighborhood system V we let VN =
T{int(↑ EQ) | N ⊆ Q ∈ M} ∩ T{int(↑ Ej ′ ) | N ⊆ Qj ∈ Mj} for each N ∈ N . (We

write E = (↑ EQ)
Q∈n
, Ej = (↑ Ej ′ )
Q′∈n′
.) It is clear that ψN ,7,U is above ψn,£,C

and ψn′,£′,C′ .	2
Theorem 5.7 Let X be a topological space. The following are equivalent:
X is a stably compact, locally ﬁnitary compact space.
X is a sober QRB-space.
X is a sober QFS-space.

X is a QRB-domain with its Scott topology.
X is a QFS-domain with its Scott topology.
X is a Lawson-compact quasi-continuous dcpo in its Scott topology.
X is a compact, coherent, quasi-continuous dcpo in its Scott topology.
Proof. (i) ⇒ (ii): X is a QRB-space by Proposition 5.6, and sober since stably- compact. (ii) ⇒ (iii) and (iv) ⇒ (v) are obvious. (iii) ⇒ (v) is Proposition 4.6, which also implies (ii) ⇒ (iv) since QRB-spaces are instances of QFS-spaces.
⇒ (vi). Every QFS-domain is quasi-continuous [23, Proposition 3.8], and Lawson-compact [23, Theorem 4.9].
⇒ (vii). For quasi-continuous domains, compactness plus coherence is the same as compactness in the Lawson topology.
⇒ (i). Every quasi-continuous dcpo is sober [11, Exercise 8.2.15] and	 locally finitary compact [11, Exercise 5.2.31]. With compactness and coherence,	 this implies that X is stably-compact.	2
Lawson and Xi’s result mentioned in the introduction [21] is the equivalence
(iv) ⇔ (v) ⇔ (vi) above. Items (i)–(iii) offer other, purely topological characteri- zations of QRB-domains.
Returning to the topological beginnings of our paper, we note the following:
Theorem 5.8 Topological QFS-spaces are QRB.
Proof. Let (X; τ ; (ϕi)i∈I ) be a topological QFS-space. Then its sobrification Xˆ is a QFS-domain and so by the preceding theorem, a QRB-domain. Looking at the proof of Proposition 5.6 we find that we constructed the finitary compacts by invoking Lemma 5.5, so we should have a closer look at that in the case that we are dealing with a locally finitary compact space that is a sobrification. In that case, every element e of E is a closed irreducible set A that meets the open set U ∈ τ . We may therefore replace e with the irreducible set ↓ a where a is an arbitrarily chosen element of A ∩ U . In summary, then, we can make sure that the elements employed in the proof of Proposition 5.6 all stem from the image of the embedding x '→ ↓ x of X into its sobrification.	2
6	The Probabilistic Powerdomain over QRB-Domains
Let us turn to the probabilistic powerdomain V(X) over a space X. This was intro- duced by Jones in her PhD thesis [15] to give semantics to higher-order programs with probabilistic choice. Jones proved that V(X) was a continuous dcpo for every continuous dcpo X, but also that V(X) was not a continuous lattice, or even a bc-domain even for very simple continuous lattices or bc-domains X. We still do not know whether V(X) is an FS-domain, resp. an RB-domain whenever X is one, except in very specific cases [17]. However, the notion of functional approxima- tion offered by QRB-domains is relaxed enough that the probabilistic powerdomain of a QRB-domain is again a QRB-domain. The first author proved this [10], for

probability valuations (with total mass 1), and assuming second-countability.
Using Theorem 5.7, we shall see that the latter is an irrelevant assumption. We shall also prove it for spaces of continuous subprobability valuations, and of general, unbounded, continuous valuations. The nature of the proof is very different from [10]: we build an approximating family of qfs maps on V(X), directly 5 .
The elements of V(X) are a slight variation on the idea of a measure, and are called continuous valuations. A continuous valuation ν on a space X is a Scott- continuous, strict, modular map from the complete lattice O(X) of open subsets of X to R+ = R ∪ {+∞}. Strictness means that ν(∅) = 0, modularity states that ν(U ∪ V )+ ν(U ∩ V )= ν(U )+ ν(V ) for all U, V ∈ O(X).
Let V(X), the probabilistic powerdomain over X, denote the space of all continu- ous valuations on X, with the weak topology. We also write V1(X) for the subspace of continuous probability valuations (ν(X) = 1) and V≤1(X) for the subspace of continuous subprobability valuations (ν(X) ≤ 1). We shall write V•(X) for V(X), V1(X), or V≤1(X). The weak topology on V•(X) has subbasic open sets of the form [U > r], defined as {ν ∈ V•(X) | ν(U ) > r} [19, Satz 8.5] (see also [12, Theo- rem 8.3]). Whatever • is, V• is a functor on the category of topological spaces, and its action Vf on continuous maps f : X → Y is defined by Vf (ν)(V )= ν(f—1(V )). We again introduce a “distributivity law” θ, this time from V•QV to QVV•.
Given μ ∈ V•QV(X), one may define θ(μ) as the set of all ν ∈ V•(X) such that ν(U ) ≥ μ(2U ) for every open U . It is not completely trivial that θ(μ) is non-empty and compact, or that θ is continuous, but let us accept it for the moment. We

may use θ to produce maps V•(X) Uϕi
QV
(X)−θ→QV
V•(X) for an approximating

family of quasi-deflations ϕi on X. It will be fairly easy to see that the resulting
maps are approximating, but they certainly do not have finite image, and even the image of a single ν ∈ V•(X) is in general not finitary. However, and up to a minor variation on the theme of θ (θf , see below), we will manage to show that these maps are qfs. Hence V•(X) will be a QFS space, and the equivalence between (iii) and
(iv) of Theorem 5.7 will allow us to conclude.
Lemma 6.1 Let (X; τ ) be a stably compact space. If • is “1”, assume X pointed, too. For every Scott-continuous map f : R+ → R+ such that f ≤ idR+ , the map θf deﬁned by θf (μ) = {ν ∈ V•(X) | ∀U ∈ τ. ν(U ) ≥ f (μ(2U ))} is a continuous and Scott-continuous map from V•(QV(X)) to QV(V•(X)).
Proof. Let [X → R+] denote the dcpo of Scott-continuous maps from X to R+, in the pointwise ordering. For any monotonic set function ξ on the open subsets
of X with values in R+, and every h ∈ [X → R+], one can define ∫	h(x)dξ by

the Choquet formula
∫ +∞ ξ(h
x∈X
—1(t, +∞])dt, where the latter is a Riemann integral.
∫

For ξ = ν ∈ V•(X), the functional h '→ x∈X h(x)dν is Scott-continuous and linear
[26, Section 4]. Scott-continuity follows from the fact that Riemann integration of
antitonic maps is itself Scott-continuous.

5 This means proving the result using characterization 3 of QRB-domains given in Theorem 5.7. Charac- terization 1 may seem a better route, since U is already known to preserve stable compactness: only local finitary compactness remains to be proved. However, that seems quite a formidable effort by itself.

For ξ(U )= μ(2U ), notice that h∗(Q)= minx∈Q h(x) defines a continuous func- tion of Q ∈ QV(X), since h—1(t, +∞]= 2h—1(t, +∞] (by compactness, the inf of h

∫∗	∫ +∞	—1
∫ +∞	—1

is attained on Q), so that
x∈X h(x)dξ = 0	μ(2h
(t, +∞])dt =
0	μ(h∗ (t,

+∞])dt =  Q∈QV (X) h∗(Q)dμ. Since (h1 + h2)∗ ≥ h1∗ + h2∗, the functional p : [X →

R+] → R+ that maps h to ∫
h∗(Q)dμ is superlinear, meaning that p(h1 +

Q∈QV(X)
h2) ≥ p(h1)+p(h2) and p(ah)= ap(h) for every a ∈ R+
. Since p(h)= ∫
x∈X h(x)dξ =

∫ +∞ ξ(h—1(t, +∞])dt, p is also Scott-continuous in h.

θf (μ) is non-empty. Define q : [X → R+] → R+ by: q(h) = supx∈X h(x) if • is “1” or “≤ 1”, and q(h)= +∞. supx∈X h(x) otherwise, agreeing that +∞.0= 0. In each case, q is sublinear (q(h1 + h2) ≤ q(h1) + q(h2), and q(ah) = aq(h) for every a ∈ R+), and p ≤ q. The space [X → R+] is a continuous dcpo, because X is locally compact hence core-compact, and using Proposition 2 of [5], for ex- ample. Together with the obvious, pointwise addition and scalar multiplication by non-negative reals, [X → R+] is therefore a so-called continuous d-cone [27]. The Sandwich Theorem given there (Theorem 3.2) implies that there is a Scott- continuous linear map Λ: [X → R+] → R+ such that p ≤ Λ ≤ q. Defining ν(U ) as Λ(χU ), where χU is the characteristic map of U , yields a continuous valuation ν in V•(X) such that μ(2U )= p(χU ) ≤ Λ(χU )= ν(U ) for every open subset U of X.
Since f ≤ idR+ , in particular θf (μ) is non-empty.
θf (μ) is compact saturated. To show this, we use the following results. Define ν†(Q), for Q ∈ Q(X), as inf{ν(U ) | Q ⊆ U}, and ⟨Q ≥ r⟩• as {ν ∈ V•(X) | ν†(Q) ≥ r}. The latter sets are compact saturated subsets of V•(X): this is a consequence of [8, Lemma 6.6] if • is “≤ 1” or “1”, and of [18, Theorem 6.5 (3)] otherwise.
We now notice that:
θf (μ)= {ν ∈ V•(X) | ∀Q ∈ Q(X) · ν†(Q) ≥ a∗ },	(1)
where a∗ = infU open⊇Q f (μ(2U )). Before we prove this, observe that θf (μ) is
therefore the intersection of the compact saturated subsets ⟨Q ≥ a∗ ⟩, Q ∈ Q(X), and is therefore itself compact, since V•(X) is stably compact. (The latter holds because X is stably compact, see [17,2]. Technically, this is proved there for V1(X) and V≤1(X), but the proof is similar for V(X).)
To prove (1), let aU = f (μ(2U )). Every ν ∈ θf (μ) trivially satisfies ν†(Q) ≥ a∗ . Conversely, assume the latter holds for every Q ∈ Q(X). For every open subset U of X, by local compactness U is the directed union of all int(Q), where Q ranges over the compact saturated subsets of U . Since 2 commutes with directed unions, and μ and f are Scott-continuous, aU = supQ⊆U f (μ(2int(Q))). Since int(Q) ⊆ U for every open neighborhood U of Q, this is less than or equal to supQ⊆U a∗ , and
the latter is less than or equal to aU because a∗ ≤ aU whenever Q ⊆ U . Therefore
aU = supQ⊆U a∗ . A similar argument shows that ν(U )= supQ⊆U ν†(Q) (or see Tix [26, Satz 3.4 (1)]). It follows that ν(U ) ≥ aU . As U is arbitrary, ν is in θf (μ).
θf is Scott-continuous. Monotonicity is clear, while for a directed family (μi)i∈I in V•(X), θf (supi∈I μi)= {ν ∈ V•(X) | ∀U open in X · ν(U ) ≥ supi∈I f (μi(2U ))}

(since f is Scott-continuous) = T
i∈I
θf (μi).

θf is continuous. Since X is T0, well-filtered, and locally compact, Q(X) is a continuous dcpo, and the Scott and upper Vietoris topologies coincide [25, Sec- tion 7.3.4], i.e., Q(X)= QV(X). The Kirch-Tix Theorem states that given a con- tinuous dcpo Y , the Scott and weak topologies coincide on V(Y ) [26, Satz 4.10], and on V≤1(Y ) [19, Satz 8.6]; the same happens for V1(Y ) if additionally Y is pointed, by a trick due to Edalat [4, Section 3]: Y j = Y z {⊥} is again a continuous dcpo, and V1(Y ) is isomorphic to V≤1(Y j). Taking Y = Q(X) = QV(X) (and noticing that this is pointed, as X is compact), we obtain that V•(QV(X)) has the Scott topology of the pointwise ordering. To show that θf is continuous, it is therefore enough to show that θ—1(2U ) is open in the Scott topology for every open subset U of V•(X). Since 2U is itself Scott-open by well-filteredness, this amounts to the Scott-continuity of θf .	2
Theorem 6.2 For every QRB-domain X, V(X), V≤1(X), and also V1(X) if X is pointed, are QRB-domains.
Proof. Let X be a QRB-domain, and (ϕi)i∈I be an approximating family of quasi- deflations on X. By Theorem 5.7 (iii), we only need to show that V•(X) is a QFS-space. It is sober since stably compact, as we have noted earlier.
For ϵ ∈ (0, 1], and t ∈ R+, let fє(t) = max(0, min(t,

1/ϵ) − ϵ). This is a chain of Scott-continuous maps, as ϵ ≥ ϵj implies fє ≤ fє′ . Also, fє ≤ idR+ . For short, write θє for the map θfc given in Lemma 6.1, and de- fine ψiє as θє ◦ Vϕi : V•(X) → QV(V•(X)). The family (ψiє)i∈I,є∈(0,1] is directed, and for every ν ∈ V•(X), we
claim that T	ψiє(ν)= ↑ ν.
To this end, we notice that:

θє(μ)= θid(μ). Indeed, T
θє(μ)= {νj ∈ V•(X) | ∀U open in X ·

νj(U ) ≥ supє∈(0,1] fє(μ(2U ))} = {νj ∈ V•(X) | ∀U open in X · νj(U ) ≥
μ(2U )} = θid(μ).
(b) T	θid(Vϕi(ν)) = ↑ ν. This is proved as follows. For every open subset U of
i∈I	1
X,	i∈I ϕi (2U ) = U : the elements x of U are those such that ↑ x ∈ 2U ,
and we obtain the desired equality by the defining property of quasi-deflations,
plus well-filteredness. It follows that supi∈I ν(ϕ—1(2U )) = ν(  i∈I ϕ—1(2U )) =
j	T	•
ν(U ). The elements ν of	i∈I θid(Vϕi(ν)) are those elements of V (X) such
that, for every i ∈ I, for every open subset U of X, νj(U ) ≥ Vϕi(ν)(2U );
equivalently, such that νj(U ) ≥ supi∈I Vϕi(ν)(2U )= ν(U ), and we conclude.

Using these, T

as announced.
It remains to show that ψiє is qfs. Write δx for the Dirac mass at x, namely, the continuous valuation such that δx(U )= χU (x) for every open U . Let E be the finite set of all elements that are minimal in some finitary compact in the image of ϕi, n be its cardinality, and let M be the finite set of continuous valuations of

the form Σ
x∈E
axδx, where each ax is an integer multiple of ϵ/n between 0 and 1/ϵ

(and with Σ	ax ≤ 1 if • is “≤ 1”, Σ	ax = 1 if • is “1”). This will be our separating set.
Fix ν ∈ V•(X). We first simplify the expression of ψiє(ν). For Q ∈ Q(X), let
∗ = infU open⊇Q fє(Vϕi(ν)(2U )) = infU open⊇Q fє(ν(ϕ—1(2U ))). Let Q1, ··· , Qm
be the finitely many finitary compacts in the image of ϕi. For J ⊆ {1, ··· , m},

write QJ for 

j∈J
Qj. We claim that ψiє(ν) = T

J⊆{1,··· ,m}
⟨QJ ≥ a∗

end, recall equality (1), which we have used in the course of proving Lemma 6.1:
θf (μ)= {νj ∈ V•(X) | ∀Q ∈ Q(X) · νj†(Q) ≥ infU open⊇Q f (μ(2U ))}. So ψiє(ν)= 

{νj ∈ V•(X) | ∀Q ∈ Q(X) · νj†(Q) ≥ a∗ } = T
⟨Q ≥ a∗ ⟩. Looking back at the

Q	Q∈Q(X)	Q
definition of a∗ , we see that, since ϕi has finite image, ϕ—1(2U ) can only take finitely
Q	i
many values when U varies. The family of these values forms a (finite) filtered family
of open sets, which therefore has a least element, which happens to be ϕ—1(2Q)
(extending the 2 notation in the obvious way). Hence a∗ = fє(ν(ϕ—1(2Q))). For
j	T	∗	Q	i
every ν ∈	J⊆{1,··· ,m}⟨QJ ≥ aQJ ⟩, and every Q ∈ Q(X), let J be the set of indices
j ∈ {1, ··· , m} such that Qj ⊆ Q. Since ϕi takes its values among Q1, . . . , Qm,

ϕ—1(2Q)= ϕ—1(2QJ ), so a∗ = a∗ . It follows that νj†(Q) ≥ ν†(QJ ) ≥ a∗
= a∗ ,

i	i	j	QT	QJ	∗

and as Q is arbitrary, ν  ∈
Q∈Q(X)⟨Q ≥ aQ⟩ = ψiє(ν).  The converse inclusion

To show that ψiє is qfs, it will therefore be enough to find an element

Let L be the finite lattice of all intersections of sets of the form ↑ A, A ⊆
E. Tix observed that ν† defined a valuation on the compact saturated subsets of X [26, Satz 3.4 (2–4)]. In particular ν† restricts to a valuation on L. Using the Smiley-Horn-Tarski Theorem (see, e.g., [20, Theorem 3.4]), ν† extends to an additive measure on the algebra ρL of subsets generated by L. The algebra ρL is the smallest collection of subsets containing L and closed under unions, intersections, and complements. Its elements are the finite disjoint unions of sets of the form

CA = T
x∈EzA
↑ x, A ⊆ E.

For each x ∈ E, let bx = ν†(CA
) where Ax is the unique subset of E such

that C
Σ
contains x (that is, Ax = ↓ x ∩ E). This definition ensures that ν†(B)= 
x	Σ

x∈B∩E bx = ( 
x∈E bxδx)(B) for every B ∈ L. For every open subset U of X,

and every x ∈ E ∩ U , C
†

bxδx)(U ) = Σ

x∈E∩U
ν†(CA ) = 

ν ( x∈E∩U
CAx
) (since the sum is disjoint) ≤ ν†(↑(E ∩ U )) ≤ ν(U ).
Σ

When • is “≤ 1”, we define the desired element	x∈E axδx of M by letting ax

be the nearest multiple of ϵ/n below bx, namely є [ n bx♩. Clearly, Σ
axδx ≤

Σx∈E bxδx ≤ ν. Moreover, for every J ⊆ {1, ··· , m}, (
x∈E axδx) (QJ )+ ϵ =

ax + ϵ ≥ Σ
(ax + є ) ≥ Σ
bx = ν†(QJ ), since QJ be-

longs to ρL. Since ϕi(x) ⊇ ↑ x for every x ∈ X, ϕ—1(2QJ ) ⊆ QJ . For every Q ∈ Q(X), recall that ϕ—1(2Q) is the least element of some finite filtered fam- ily of open sets, hence is open. It follows that the notation ν(ϕ—1(2QJ )) makes
sense. From ϕ—1(2QJ ) ⊆ QJ , we obtain ν†(QJ ) ≥ ν(ϕ—1(2QJ )). We have just

Σi	†
—1	i	Σ	†

shown that (	x∈E axδx) (QJ )+ ϵ ≥ ν(ϕi  (2QJ )), whence (
x∈E axδx) (QJ ) ≥

max(0, ν(ϕ—1(2QJ )) − ϵ) = fє(ν(ϕ—1(2QJ ))) = a∗ . (We are silently using the
i	i	QJ	Σ

fact that fє(t) = max(0,t − ϵ) for every t ∈ [0, 1].) Therefore
x∈E axδx is in

⟨QJ ≥ a∗
⟩, and as J is arbitrary, it is in ψiє(ν).

When • is “1” instead, we use the standard trick of putting all the missing mass on the bottom element ⊥. In other words, we define ax as above for x /= ⊥, and

x∈E,x/=⊥
a  otherwise. (Note that E contains ⊥. Indeed, it appears as the
Σ

minimal element of ϕi(⊥)= X.) We check that (
x∈E axδx)(U ) ≤ ν(U ) as above

when U does not contain ⊥, while the same inequality reduces to the trivial 1 ≤ 1
when U contains ⊥, namely when U = X. Since we are using larger coefficients ax
than in the “≤ 1” case, the fact that (Σ	axδx)†(QJ ) ≥ a∗	follows by the same
Σ	x∈E	T	QJ	∗

arguments. It follows, again, that
x∈E axδx is in
J⊆{1,··· ,m}⟨QJ ≥ aQJ ⟩ = ψiє(ν).

Finally, when • is neither “≤ 1” not “1”, we argue as in the “≤ 1” case, ex-
cept we now define ax as є [ n min( 1 , bx)♩. To check that (Σ	axδx)†(QJ ) ≥ a∗  ,

the “≤ 1” case, this implies (	x∈E axδx) (QJ )+ ϵ ≥ min( є , ν(ϕi  (2QJ ))), so
