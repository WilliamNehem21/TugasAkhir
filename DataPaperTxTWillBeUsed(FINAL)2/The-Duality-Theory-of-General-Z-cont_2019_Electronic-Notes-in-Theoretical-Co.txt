Abstract
In this paper, we research further into Z-predistributive and Z-precontinuous posets introduced by Ern´e. We focus on duality theorems based on the application of Galois connections whenever Z is a closed subset selection. For example, there is a duality between the categories Z-PDG and Z-PDD of all Z-
predistributive posets with weakly ZΔ-continuous maps which have a lower adjoint, and maps preserve Z-below relation that have an upper adjoint, respectively, as morphisms. We introduce the concept of Z0-approximating auxiliary relation, and have made a slight improvement on Z-precontinuity, so that there is a generalization of the classical equivalence between domains and auxiliary relations.
Keywords: poset, Z-predistributive, Z-precontinuous, Z-closed, Galois connection, auxiliary relation.


Introduction
The “way-below” relation is an essential ingredient in continuous posets and do- mains [1,10,11] and plays a central role in the applications of computer sciences. Continuous poset is based on the axiom of approximation, where the classical “way- below” relation is associated with all directed subsets which have supremum, but not for arbitrary subsets. In [16], Wright, J. B., Wagner, E. G. and Thatcher, J. W. introduced the concept of subset systems Z, got rid of the restriction to directed subsets and replaced by “Z-sets”. After this, a theory of Z-continuous posets was developed by Bandelt and Ern´e [3,4], Novak [13], Venugopalan [15]. The theory has been pursued by others, such as [2,8,9,19] and so on. Z-continuity inherits the basic idea to use variants of the “way-below” relation, associated with Z-sets which have a least upper bound.

In [8], Ern´e used Z to denote a subset selection, which assigns every poset P to a certain collection ZP of subsets and is more extensive than subset system. Some types of posets with “Z-approximation” from below were put forward, for instance, Z-predistributive and Z-precontinuous posets. The “Z-approximation” involves the cut operator Δ (others may use δ) of subsets instead of the existence of supremum. Ern´e characterized these posets by certain homomorphism properties and adjunctions. In recent years, there are other results about Z-precontinuity, see [12,14,17,18], but none discussed the dual category on these posets. The purpose of our paper is to discuss that.
In Section 3, we give some statements of Z-predistributive and Z-precontinuous posets. Galois connections play an important role in the framework of category theory. Let Z be a closed subset selection. A duality is built up between categories Z-PDt and Z-PDD of all Z-predistributive posets with ZΔ-morphisms and ZΔ- comorphisms, as morphisms respectively, in particular the full subcategories Z-PCt and Z-PCD of all Z-precontinuous posets. We also show that the image of a Z- precontinuous poset under a ZΔ-morphism is Z-precontinuous. We characterize Z-precontinuity with appropriate auxiliary relations in Section 4.

Preliminaries
Let us recall some basic definitions. For each poset P and A ⊆ P , we denote
↓A := {y ∈ P | (∃ x ∈ A) y ≤ x} and ↓x := ↓{x}, ↓A is said to be the lower set generated by A. Au := {x ∈ P | (∀y ∈ A) y ≤ x} is called the upper bound set of A. The least element of Au if it exists is called the supremum of A and is denoted by A; Al := {x ∈ P | (∀y ∈ A) y ≥ x} is the lower bound set of A. The cut operator Δ is written by ΔA := Aul. A subset selection Z denotes a function which assigns
to each poset P a set ZP of subsets of P , and Z is called a subset system if
there exists a poset P such that ZP contains some nonempty set;
if f : P → Q is a monotone map from P into a poset Q, then f (Z) ∈ ZQ for all Z ∈ ZP .
By (ii), for any subset B ⊆ P , Z ∈ Z(B) implies Z ∈ Z(P ). The frequently used examples of subset selections are:
A where AP is the collection of all lower sets;
B where BP is the collection of all nonempty upper bounded subsets;
C where CP is the collection of all nonempty chains;
D where DP is the collection of all directed subsets;
E where EP is the collection of all one-element subsets;
F where FP is the collection of all finite subsets;
P where PP is the collection of all subsets.
Among these, all except A are subset systems. But note that ↓f (Z) ∈ AQ for all
Z ∈ AP .

For any subset selection Z, we denote by ZΛP = {↓Z : Z ∈ ZP	EP}, the collection of all Z-ideals. However, for A and subset system Z, ZΛP is just the set
{↓Z : Z ∈ ZP}. A subset selection Z such that Y ∈ Z(ZΛP ) implies	Y ∈ ZΛP
for all posets P is called union-complete. We denote
ZΔP := {Y ∈ AP | Z ∈ ZP and Z ⊆ Y implies ΔZ ⊆ Y },
this is called Δ-ideal completion of poset P . Obviously, ↓x ∈ ZΔP for x ∈ P and ΔX ∈ ZΔP for X ⊆ P . The closure X— of any subset X is defined by X— := {Y ∈ ZΔP | X ⊆ Y }. Let σ2 (P )= {P \Y | Y ∈ ZΔP}, which generalizes the classical Scott topology. It is easy to show that U ∈ σ2 (P ) iff U = ↑U and for all Z ∈ ZΛP , ΔZ ∩ U /= ∅ implies Z ∩ U /= ∅.
The function f is called weakly ZΔ-continuous if f—1(↓x) ∈ ZΔP for all x ∈ Q; f is said to be Z-closed if for every Z ∈ ZΛP implies ↓f (Z) ∈ ZΛQ. The subset selection Z is called closed if every monotone map is Z-closed. Some tedious manipulation yields that all the subset systems are closed, including subset selection A.
Duality of Z-predistributive posets
In this paper, unless otherwise stated, Z denotes a subset selection. We will con- sider variants of Z-continuity: Z-predistributive and Z-precontinuous posets, some properties will be given. In order to make connections between categories, we need to define suitable morphisms, that is, ZΔ-morphisms and ZΔ-comorphisms which involve the Galois connections for any closed subset selection.
Now, we firstly recall the “way-below” relation on posets with respect to Z-sets. The Z-below ideal of an element x in a poset P is the set ↓2x =  {Z ∈ ZΛP | x ∈ ΔZ}. For x, y ∈ P , we write y  2 x if Z ∈ ZΛP and x ∈ ΔZ imply y ∈ Z, the relation  2 is called Z-below relation. Denote the set {v ∈ P | x  2 v} by

2x, and for A ⊆ P , ↓2
A = {u ∈ P | (∃ y ∈ A) u  2
y}, ↑2
A = {v ∈ P | (∃ y ∈

y  2 v}. The properties of the relation  2 are as follows.
Proposition 3.1 For any poset P, the following statements hold for x, y, u, v ∈ P:
x  2 y implies x ≤ y;
u ≤ x  2 y ≤ v implies u  2 v;
0  2 x whenever P has bottom element 0 and x /= 0.
Remark 3.2 The empty set may confuse us. If ∅∈ ZΛP whenever P has bottom element 0, then 0 ∈ Δ∅. Thus 0 is impossible to have Z-below relationship with itself. Otherwise, 0  2 x for all x ∈ P .
Proposition 3.3 Let P be a poset. Suppose that there exists a Z-set Z ⊆ ↓2x with
x = W Z. Then ↓2x ∈ ZΛP and x = W ↓2x.
Definition 3.4 [8] Let P be a poset.
P is called Z-predistributive if x = W ↓2x for each x ∈ P ;

P is called Z-precontinuous if it is Z-predistributive and ↓2x ∈ ZΛP for each
x ∈ P .
Actually, Z-predistributive posets were called completely Z-distributive in [7]. If Z is a subset system, then Z-precontinuous is the Zδ-continuous poset essentially (see [18]); for a subset system which requires the existence of a non-singleton Z-set, Z-predistributive is the weak sZ-continuous, and Z-precontinuous is sZ-continuous in the sense of [14]. A-precontinuous is just the completely precontinuous in [17], D-precontinuous is s2-continuous in [5].
In a continuous poset, the classical “way-below” relation satisfies the interpo- lation property, that is, x  y implies x  u  y. For any union-complete, lower fine subset system Z, the interpolation property holds in Z-precontinuous poset in the sense of [18]. We have a similar property for subset selections.
Proposition 3.5 Let Z be a union-complete and closed subset selection. Then the
Z-below relation of a Z-precontinuous poset P satisﬁes the interpolation property.
Proof. Take x  2 y in P . Since P is a Z-precontinuous poset, we have that y =
↓2y and ↓2y ∈ ZΛP . Note that Δ(↓2y)= Δ( a  Z y ↓2a) and the function c '→
↓2c : P → ZΛP is monotone. Then ↓{↓2a : a  2 y} is a Z-ideal of ZΛP by Z being
↓	↓
closed. It suffices that there exists U ∈ Z(ZΛP ) such that ↓{↓2a : a  2 y} = ↓U 
in ZΛP . Thus U ∈ ZΛP by union-completeness and Δ( a Z y ↓2a)= Δ( U ). Hence, x ∈ ↓2a for some a  2 y.	2
Next, we use the relationship between elements to describe the variants of con- tinuity.
Theorem 3.6 Let P be a poset. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
P is Z-predistributive;
A ⊆ Δ(↓2A) for all A ∈ ZΛP;
there is a u ∈ P such that u  2 x with u ¢ y whenever x ¢ y for x, y ∈ P;
P \ ↓y =	{↑2 x | x ∈ P \ ↓y} for each y ∈ P;
P \ ΔA = ↑2 (P \ A) for each A ∈ ZΛP.
Proof. (1) ⇔ (2) ⇔ (3) and (5) ⇒ (4) ⇒ (3), are straightforward.
2
(3) ⇒ (5): For every y ∈ ↑ x where x ∈ P \ A. Assume that y ∈ ΔA. Then
x ∈ A by the Z-below relation, which is contradictory. On the other hand, P \ΔA ⊆
↑2 (P \ A) if the upper bound set of A is empty; otherwise, for any y ∈ P \ ΔA, then we have t ∈ Au such that y A t. According to (3), there exists x ∈ ↓2y such that x A t, that is, x belongs to P \ ↓t which contains in the complement of A. It follows that y is a member of ↑2 (P \ A).	2
Galois connection is one of the most efficient tools in dealing with complete lattices. Moreover, Galois connections can be used as morphisms to define the

functors between categories. It is a natural point in our study to use them to discuss duality theorems on the variants of Z-continuity.
Definition 3.7 [10] Let P and Q be two posets. We say that a pair (g, d) of functions g : P → Q and d : Q → P is a Galois connection or an adjunction between P and Q provided that
both g and d are monotone, and
the relations g(s) ≥ t and s ≥ d(t) are equivalent for all pairs of elements (s, t) ∈ P × Q.
In an adjunction (g, d), the function g is called the upper adjoint and d the lower adjoint.
Lemma 3.8 Let (g, d) be a Galois connection between posets P and Q. Then
d(ΔA) ⊆ Δd(A) for any subset A of Q.
Proof. Let A be a subset of poset Q. It is formed in case ΔA is an empty subset. For each x ∈ ΔA, if d(A)u = ∅, then Δd(A) = P ; otherwise, note that v ∈ d(A)u is equivalent to g(v) ∈ Au, then x ≤ g(v), that is, d(x) ≤ v. Therefore d(ΔA) ⊆ Δd(A) holds in all situations.	2
The following proposition is needed for later proof, slightly different from in [12, Proposition 2] and [6, Proposition 1.8].
Proposition 3.9 Let f be a map between posets P and Q. Consider the following conditions:
f is a weakly ZΔ-continuous map;
for every Z ∈ ZP, f (ΔZ) ⊆ Δf (Z).
Then (1) implies (2) for any subset selection Z; if Z is a subset system, then (1)
e (2). If f is monotone, then conditions are equivalent for all subset selections.
Remark 3.10 For an arbitrary subset selection Z, the condition of monotonicity of f is essential when (2) implies (1) in the above proposition. See the following example as Z = A. Let P be the set {a, b, T} with a, b ≤T and Q be the chain 2. Consider the function f which sends a, b to1 and T to 0, simple verification shows that f (ΔZ) ⊆ Δf (Z) for every lower set Z of P . However, a weakly AΔ-continuous map is monotone but f is not.
From Lemma 3.8 and Proposition 3.9, a lower adjoint d of map g between posets is always weakly ZΔ-continuous.
There is a well-known duality on posets.  The categories POSETt and POSETD have the class of all posets with the order preserving maps g which have a lower adjoint d and the order preserving maps d having an upper adjoint g as morphisms, respectively. We know that the categories POSETt and POSETD are dual via functors D and G, where for any poset P we write simply D(P )= P and G(P ) = P ; for every morphism g : P → Q of POSETt, D(g) : Q → P is the lower adjoint of g; for each morphism d : Q → P of POSETD, G(d): P → Q

is the upper adjoint of d. Then our following task is to investigate other duality theories in the context of subset selections. First, we see how the functors D and G translate certain preservation properties of morphisms.
Proposition 3.11 Let Z be a closed subset selection. If (g, d) is a Galois connec- tion between posets P and Q. Then the following statements are equivalent:
g is weakly ZΔ-continuous;
if U ∈ σ2 (Q), then †d(U ) ∈ σ2 (P ).
These conditions imply
d preserves Z-below relation  2, that is, x  2 y in Q implies d(x)  2 d(y)
in P.
and if Q is Z-predistributive, we have all three conditions are equivalent.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Let U be an element of σ2 (Q). We take a A ∈ ZΛP with ΔA ∩ †d(U ) /= ∅ and should show that A ∩ †d(U ) /= ∅. Then there exists u ∈ U such that d(u) ∈ ΔA by ΔA ∩ †d(U ) /= ∅. Without loss of generality, let A = ↓Z with Z ∈ ZP . It is easy to see that u ∈ Δg(Z)= Δ(↓g(A)). Since Z is closed and U ∩Δ(↓g(A)) /= ∅, there exists t ∈ A such that g(t) ∈ U . We obtain that t ∈ †d(U ), so †d(U ) ∈ σ2 (P ).
(2) ⇒ (1): Assume that v ∈ ΔZ such that g(v) ∈ g(ΔZ)\Δg(Z) for Z ∈ ZP . This means that we have an element x ∈ g(Z)u such that g(v) A x. Let U = Q \ ↓x. Then we have U ∈ σ2 (Q) and g(v) ∈ U . By hypothesis (2) we know that †d(U ) ∈ σ2 (P ). So, v ∈ †d(U ), we have a t ∈ Z with t ∈ †d(U ), that is, d(u) ≤ t for some u ∈ U . It follows that u ≤ g(t) ≤ x, a contradiction.
(1) ⇒ (3): Suppose that x  2 y in Q and A ∈ ZΛP with d(y) ∈ ΔA. It suffices to show that if A = ↓Z for some Z ∈ ZP , then d(x) ∈ A. By Proposition 3.9, g(d(y)) ∈ Δg(Z) = Δ(↓g(Z)). Recall that ↓g(Z) = ↓g(↓Z) since g is monotone, thus y ∈ Δ(↓g(A)) due to y ≤ g(d(y)). Because Z is a closed subset selection,
↓g(A) is a Z-ideal, we have x ∈ ↓g(A). Hence d(x) ∈ d(↓g(A)) ⊆ A. Therefore,
d(x)  2 d(y) in P .
It remains (3) ⇒ (1). Suppose that Q is a Z-predistributive poset. We claim g(ΔZ) ⊆ Δg(Z) for each Z ∈ ZP . Assume there is an element x ∈ g(ΔZ)\Δg(Z). Then we have an upper bound y of set g(Z) such that x ¢ y in Q. Thus there exists u such that u ∈ ↓2x but u ¢ y in Q by Theorem 3.6. It follows that d(u) 2 d(x) by hypothesis (3). Naturally d(u) ∈ ↓Z since d(x) ∈ d(g(ΔZ)) ⊆ Δ(↓Z), as a result, u ∈ g(↓Z) ⊆ ↓g(Z). Hence u ≤ y and this is the desired contradiction.  2
For simplicity of presentation, we assume that subset selection Z is closed throughout the rest of this section.
Definition 3.12 Let S, T be two posets.
A map g : S → T is said to be a ZΔ-morphism if g is weakly ZΔ-continuous and has a lower adjoint.
A map d : T → S is called a ZΔ-comorphism if d preserves Z-below relation

and has an upper adjoint.
A map f : S → T is called a quasiopen if U ∈ σ2 (S) implies †f (U ) ∈ σ2 (T ).
Corollary 3.13 Let g : P → Q be a map between posets which has a lower adjoint
d. If g is a ZΔ-morphism, then d is a ZΔ-comorphism. If Q is Z-predistributive and d preserves Z-below relation, then g is a ZΔ-morphism.
We introduce the subcategories of POSETt and POSETD, in order to refor- mulate Proposition 3.11 in terms of duality.
Definition 3.14 We define the following categories.
Z-POSt is the category of posets with ZΔ-morphisms.
Z-POSD is the category of posets and maps d as morphisms which are qua- siopen and have an upper adjoint.
Z-PDt and Z-PDD have the same objects of all Z-predistributive posets; the morphisms of Z-PDt are ZΔ-morphisms and the morphisms of Z-PDD are ZΔ-comorphisms.
Z-PCt is the full subcategory of Z-PDt consisting of all Z-precontinuous posets.
Z-PCD is the full subcategory of Z-PDD consisting of all Z-precontinuous posets.
Theorem 3.15 The following categories are dual under the functors D and G given through the Galois connection of functions:
Z-POSt and Z-POSD;
Z-PDt and Z-PDD;
Z-PCt and Z-PCD.
We explore the constructions of new Z-precontinuous posets. The following example gives us some constructions of posets, and the Table 1 will show whether the Z-precontinuity is preserved under these structures for a frequent subset selection Z.
Example 3.16 Let P and Q be two posets. We have the following five kinds of “disjoint” sums: (1) (Disjoint sum) P H Q, the disjoint union of P and Q (with the obvious partial ordering: elements x ∈ P and y ∈ Q are incomparable); (2) (Coalesced sum) P ⊕Q, the disjoint sum P HQ with the bottom elements identified, if they have them; (3) (Separated sum) P + Q = (P H Q)0, that is, the disjoint sum with a new bottom element adjoined; (4) P +1 Q = (P ⊕ Q)1, the coalesced sum with a new top element adjoined; (5) P +2 Q, the coalesced sum with the top elements identified if they have them.
Suppose that P and Q are Z-precontinuous posets where Z is the subset selection B, C or D respectively. Then it is easy to check that the sum corresponding to the first three is still Z-precontinuous. Pick P is the chain 3 and Q is a 4-element lattice. It is clear that A, F and P-precontinuity may be destroyed under all these

constructions. If P and Q are poset N, then P +1 Q and P +2 Q are not B, C or
D-precontinuous posets. As shown in Table 1.

Table 1
The 2-precontinuity of the sums

Lemma 3.17 Let (g, d) be an adjunction between posets P and Q. If g is surjective, then gˆ : ZΛP → ZΛQ deﬁned by gˆ(A)= ↓g(A) is surjective. Moreover, (gˆ, dˆ) is an adjunction between ZΛP and ZΛQ, where dˆ is similarly deﬁned.
Proof. gˆ is well-defined by Z being closed. For all subsets A of P , g(↓A) ⊆ ↓g(A) by
the monotonicity of g. Since x ∈ ↓g(A) implies d(x) ∈ ↓A, we have g(↓A)= ↓g(A). Recall that gd = idQ (see [10, Proposition O-3.7]). Then gˆ(↓d(B)) = ↓g(d(B)) = B
for B ∈ ZΛQ. As a result, gˆ maps Z-ideals of poset P onto Z-ideals of Q. It is easy to show that (gˆ, dˆ) is an adjunction.	2
Theorem 3.18 Let g : P → Q be a ZΔ-morphism from Z-precontinuous poset P onto poset Q. Then Q is Z-precontinuous. In particular, the image of a Z- precontinuous poset under a ZΔ-morphism is Z-precontinuous.
Proof. Let d be the lower adjoint of g. First, we claim that u  2 d(x) in P implies g(u)  2 x in Q. If x ∈ Δ(↓B)= ΔB for B ∈ ZQ, then d(x) ∈ d(ΔB) ⊆ Δd(B) by Lemma 3.8. Thus u ∈ ↓d(B), this means that g(u) ∈ g(↓d(B)) = ↓B. We obtain g(↓2d(x)) ⊆ ↓2x, furthermore, g(↓2d(x)) = ↓2x in Q by Proposition 3.11. Since
P is Z-precontinuous, ↓2d(x) is a Z-ideal of P . It follows that ↓2x ∈ ZΛQ due to
↓	↓
Lemma 3.17. Hence, we have
x = g(d(x)) ∈ g(Δ[↓2d(x)]) ⊆ Δg(↓2d(x)) = Δ(↓2x),
↓	↓	↓
i.e., x = W ↓2x. So far, we reach the conclusion that Q is a Z-precontinuous poset.2

Z0-approximating auxiliary relation
In this section, we take a closer look at the Z-below relation and auxiliary relations. We use appropriate auxiliary relations to characterize the improved Z-precontinuity.

Definition 4.1 [10] We say that a binary relation ≺ on a poset P is an auxiliary relation, or an auxiliary order, if it satisfies the following conditions for all u, x, y, v:
x ≺ y implies x ≤ y;
u ≤ x ≺ y ≤ v implies u ≺ v;
if a bottom element 0 exists, then 0 ≺ x.
The set of all auxiliary relations on P is denoted by Aux(P ).
Based on Remark 3.2, for any subset selection Z, we denote the truncated selection Z0 by Z0P = ZP\{∅}; Z0-ideals by Z0ΛP = {↓Z : Z ∈ Z0P  EP}. For x, y ∈ P , we write x  20 y if Z ∈ Z0ΛP and y ∈ ΔZ imply x ∈ Z, the re- lation 20 is called Z0-below relation of poset P . Similarly, we may define Z0- predistributive and Z0-precontinuous posets.  2 and  20  are equal whenever
∅ ∈/ ZP . Obviously, the Z0-below relation is an auxiliary relation.
We may introduce some definitions that help us to characterize Z0-precontinuous posets with auxiliary relations.
Definition 4.2 An auxiliary relation ≺ on a poset P is said to be Z0-approximating iff the set ↓≺x = {y ∈ P : y ≺ x} is a Z0-ideal and x =  ↓≺x for all x ∈ P . The set of all Z0-approximating auxiliary relations is written App20 (P ).
Definition 4.3 A poset P is called Z0-meet-precontinuous if ↓x ∩ Y — ⊆ (↓x ∩ Y )— for all x ∈ P and Y ∈ Z0ΛP .
As what we have anticipated, every Z0-precontinuous poset is Z0-meet- precontinuous (see [12,14]). Let Low(P ) denote the set of all lower sets of P . We know the assignment
≺ '→ s≺ = (x '→ {y : y ≺ x})
is an isomorphism from Aux(P ) onto monotone functions s : P → LowP , whose inverse associates to each monotone function s the relation ≺s given by x ≺s y iff x ∈ s(y) in [10]. If P is a semilattice, then we consider for each Z ∈ Z0ΛP the monotone function mZ : P → LowP given by
m (x)=	↓x ∩ Z = x ∧ Z,	if x ∈ ΔZ,
↓x,	otherwise.
Let P be a semilattice. The unary meet operation ∧x : P → P : y '→ x ∧ y
is monotone for x, y ∈ P , we say that ∧x is Z0-closed if for all Z ∈ Z0ΛP implies
∧x(Z) ∈ Z0ΛP . The truncated selection Z0 is called ∧-closed if each unary meet operation on all semilattices is Z0-closed. There is no doubt that each closed subset selection Z0 is ∧-closed. Let Z0 be the all nonempty Frink ideals. Then Z0 is a
∧-closed subset selection but not closed.
Proposition 4.4 For any ∧-closed subset selection Z0, a semilattice P is Z0-meet- precontinuous iff the unary meet operations ∧x : P → P : y '→ x ∧ y are weakly Z0Δ-continuous.

Proof. For all Z ∈ Z0P , ΔZ is equal to Z— by [12, Lemma 1]. We have ∧x(ΔZ)= x∧Z— = ↓x∩(↓Z)— for a semilattice. Let P be a Z0-meet-precontinuous. Then ↓x∩ (↓Z)— ⊆ (↓x ∩ ↓Z)— ⊆ Δ(x ∧ Z). Thus ∧x is weakly Z0Δ-continuous. Conversely, we just need to prove that ↓x ∩ (↓Z)— ⊆ (↓x ∩ ↓Z)— for all x ∈ P and Z ∈ Z0P . Indeed,
↓x ∩ (↓Z)— = x ∧ (ΔZ) ⊆ Δ(x ∧ Z)= [↓(x ∧ Z)]— = (↓x ∩ ↓Z)—,
the second inequality holds as the map ∧x is weakly Z0Δ-continuous, third equation because Z0 is ∧-closed. This completes the proof.	2
Lemma 4.5 Let Z be a subset selection which truncated selection Z0 is ∧-closed.

Then for a Z0-meet-precontinuous semilattice P, all relations ≺mZ
are Z0-approximating.
for Z ∈ Z0ΛP

Proof. Let x ∈ P . If x ∈ ΔZ, then {y ∈ P : y ≺mZ x} = x ∧ Z. x ∧ Z is a Z0-ideal since Z0 is ∧-closed. It follows that Δ(x ∧ Z) = (x ∧ Z)—. Thus Δ(x ∧ Z)= ↓x ∩ Z— = ↓x ∩ ΔZ = ↓x by Z0-meet-precontinuity. If x ∈/ ΔZ, then
{y ∈ P : y ≺mZ x} = ↓x. We have x =  {y ∈ P : y ≺mZ x} in all cases.	2
Proposition 4.6 Let P be a poset and Z0 a ∧-closed subset selection. Then the Z0-below relation  20 is contained in all Z0-approximating auxiliary relations, and is equal to their intersection if P is a Z0-meet-precontinuous semilattice.
Proof. It is straightforward that  20 is contained in all Z0-approximating auxil- iary relations. If P is a Z0-meet-precontinuous semilattice, then by Lemma 4.5 we obtain
  {s≺(x) |≺∈ App2 (P )}⊆  {mZ(x) | Z ∈ Z0ΛP}
=	(↓x ∩ Z) ∩	↓x
x∈ΔZ	x∈/ΔZ
= ↓x ∩	Z
x∈ΔZ
= ↓20 x,
thus  20 includes the intersection of all Z0-approximating auxiliary relations.	2
For a poset,  20 is itself not a Z0-approximating relation necessarily. But we may now derive the following theorem.
Theorem 4.7 Let P be a poset and Z0 a ∧-closed subset selection. Consider the following conditions:
P is Z0-precontinuous;
20 is the smallest Z0-approximating auxiliary relation on P;
there is a smallest Z0-approximating auxiliary relation on P.
Then (1) e (2) ⇒ (3), and if P is a Z0-meet-precontinuous semilattice, then con- ditions are equivalent.

Proof. (1) e (2): Observe that P is a Z0-precontinuous poset iff  20 is a Z0-approximating auxiliary relation. Then the equivalence follows from Proposi- tion 4.6.
(2) ⇒ (3) is clear.
Let P be a Z0-meet-precontinuous semilattice. Then Z0-below relation is equal to the intersection of all Z0-approximating auxiliary relations by Proposition 4.6. Thus, 20 has to be the smallest Z0-approximating auxiliary relation. Therefore we have (3) ⇒ (1).	2

Conclusion
The collection of all directed subsets is a crucial subset selection in domain theory. The present paper has further exhibited some results of general Z-continuity which enriches the Z-theory, a generalization of domain theory. In closed subset selec- tions, we investigated the duality theory for Z-predistributive (Z-precontinuous) posets. Finally, we used Z0-approximating auxiliary relations to characterize Z0- precontinuous posets. Naturally, it may take into consideration whether these re- sults are suitable for more subset selections.
