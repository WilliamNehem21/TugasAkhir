Laws’ mask method has achieved wide acceptance in texture analysis, however it is not robust to noise. Fuzzy filters are well known for denoising applications. This work proposes a noise-robust Laws’ mask descriptor by integrating the exiting fuzzy filters with the traditional Laws’ mask for the improvement of texture classification of noisy texture images. Images are corrupted by adding Gaussian noise of differ- ent values. These noisy images are transformed into fuzzy images through fuzzy filters of different win- dows. Then the texture features are extracted using Laws’ mask descriptor. To investigate the proposed techniques two texture databases i.e. Brodatz and STex are used. The proposals are assessed by compar- ing the performance of the traditional Laws’ mask descriptor alone and after combined with the fuzzy filters on noisy images. The k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier is utilized in the classification task. Results indicate that the proposed approach delivers higher classification accuracy than the traditional Laws’ mask method. Hence, validate that the suggested methods significantly improve the noised texture classification.

Introduction

The study of image texture is well suited for several difficult tasks in computer vision. Its numerous applications vary from object recognition to content-based image retrieval. In the 1970s, the first work in the texture classification is proposed by Haralick, which has been focused on the statistical analysis of images [1]. At the end of same decade 1979, Laws has proposed texture analysis using convolutions [2–3]. The main contribution of this approach is the filtering of images with specific masks created from the combi- nation of one-dimensional Kernel vector in order to evaluate the texture properties. Originally, Laws has classified samples based on expected values of variance-like square measures of these con- volutions and named as ‘‘texture energy measures”. Later on, many researchers have used Laws’ mask descriptor for medical image analysis [4–7]. In a view of extending the Laws’ mask method to

the frequency domain recently Dash et al. have recommended hybrid models of Laws’ mask descriptor and achieved higher clas- sification rates than the traditional Laws’ mask method [8–9]. Dash et al. have also suggested an improvement in texture classification by integrating the bilateral filter with the original Laws’ mask descriptor [10]. They have also recommended an improved colour texture classification by using homomorphic normalization and by extracting texture features through traditional texture analysis techniques such as Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Laws’ mask [11].
Noise reduction in images has been one of the common tasks in image processing. Fuzzy techniques have already been applied in several domains of image processing. Various fuzzy filters for noise reduction have been recommended in the literature [12–15]. Com- pare with the classical filter, Fuzzy filters provide better results in reducing noise in image processing tasks [16]. In 2003, Kwan has introduced seven fuzzy filters for noise reduction and achieved success in noise reduction in images [17]. Some authors have also used fuzzy theory for classification purpose [18–20]. Various researchers have extended the traditional Local binary pattern (LBP) descriptor to noise-robust descriptor with hybrid models [21–23]. The literature study has also revealed about some original fuzzy filters are combined with existing filters to reduce noise in images. For example, Biradar et al. have proposed triangular fuzzy filter with moving average center (TMAV) with wiener filter for

speckle noise reduction in images [24]. Santoso et al. have pro- posed fuzzy approaches by combining the existing fuzzy filters with Frost filter for speckle noise reduction. They have utilized the existing fuzzy filters such as, fuzzy filter with symmetrical tri- angular with median center (TMED), the fuzzy filter with asym- metrical triangular with median center (ATMED), the fuzzy filter with triangular function with moving average center (TMAV) and the fuzzy filter with asymmetrical triangular function with moving average center (ATMV) [25]. Russo and Ramponi have recom- mended a dual step fuzzy-ruled-based filter to detect and remove large amount of impulse noise. Harron et al. have reduced the noise to improve the classification using textural information [26]. They have used recursive least square filter for the reduction of noise [27]. Schulte et al. have proposed two step fuzzy filter for the reduction of impulse noise in colour images [28]. Mehra et al. have suggested denoising of images in wavelet domain by using fuzzy and wiener filter [29]. Bansal et al. have utilized thresholding tech- nique for removing impulse noise through simplified fuzzy filter [30]. Toh and Isa have suggested a noise adaptive fuzzy switching median filter for removal of salt-and-pepper noise [31].
The literature study exposes that fuzzy filters in many forms have been applied in many diversified filed. However, the issues related to de-noising of noisy texture images are remained as a great challenge. In general, there are two types of noises like impulse (salt and pepper) noise, and random (or Gaussian) noise. Impulse noise is represented by noise density whereas random noise is expressed in terms of its mean and variance. For impulse noise, maximum portion of an original image remains unchanged, and the image is distinguished by some corrupted samples, which differ intensely. In comparison to impulse noise, random noise is more challenging type of noise. Hence, it is an essential task to reduce the random noise effectively in images. In literature many
Take noise free texture images, convert it into gray scale and subimages. Afterwards the subimages are embedded with Gaussian noise of different values.
The noisy images are passed with four fuzzy filters of differ- ent window size and fuzzy transformed images are obtained.
The texture features are extracted with two approaches. In the first approach, the original Laws’ mask is utilized for the extraction of texture features of the noisy images. In the second approach, original Laws’ mask is utilized for the extraction of texture features of the fuzzy transformed images.
Classification is performed through k-NN classifier.

The proposed method is compared with the traditional Laws’ mask method with the noisy and noise free databases. Excellent experimental results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction technique is able to retain the finer details of the de- noised images and improves the texture classification rates.
The paper is arranged as follows. The traditional Laws’ mask descriptor and fuzzy filters are briefly reviewed in Section 2. Sec- tion 3 explains the proposed noise-robust Laws’ mask descriptor in detail. The experimental setup and results are presented in Sec- tion 4. In Section 5 final conclusion is given.

Review of fuzzy filters and Laws’ masks method

Fuzzy filters

In 2002, Kwan and Cai have defined fuzzy filter and from which they have derived seven different types of fuzzy filters [14]. If
x(m; n) is input of a two dimensional fuzzy filter, then the output
of fuzzy filter is defined as follows.

types of linear and nonlinear filtering techniques have been sug-
gested for noise removal for example median (MED) filter and

moving average (MAV) filter. Median filter performs in an average

manner to filter the random noise. A nonlinear filter named as moving average filter performs well in removing random noise but neither they can supress impulse noise nor preserves sharp edges of an image. Hence, fuzzy filters with membership functions in terms of moving average and median center are taken into con- sideration for further processing.
In addition, Laws’ mask method has achieved favourable accep- tance in texture classification, still no attempts have been made to design a noise-robust Laws’ mask descriptor. Hence, to extend the traditional Laws’ mask descriptor towards noise robustness, in this paper, we focus on designing a hybrid model that includes the existing fuzzy filters and the traditional Laws’ mask for noise tex- ture analysis. The four fuzzy filters utilized in the proposed method
where F[x(m; n)] is the window function and M is the area of the window. They have derived the fuzzy filter with symmetrical trian-
gular with median center (TMED), the fuzzy filter with asymmetri- cal triangular with median center (ATMED), the fuzzy filter with triangular function with moving average center (TMAV) and the fuzzy filter with asymmetrical triangular function with moving average center (ATMV) by considering different window functions.

are TMED, ATMED, TMAV and ATMV [15]. To validate the efficiency of the proposed descriptor on noisy dataset, two comprehensive texture databases are used in the experiments. As random noise (Gaussian) is more challenging type of noise compared to impulse
noise (salt and pepper). Therefore, Gaussian noise is added to the

images of the texture databases to evaluate the noise-robustness of the Laws’ mask descriptor. The purpose of the proposed method

is to reduce the Gaussian noise by combining the fuzzy filters with Laws’ mask descriptor. Initially noisy images are generated by cor- rupting with Gaussian noise of different standard deviation values for Brodatz and STex databases. Then these corrupted images are transformed into fuzzy images by utilizing TMED, ATMED, TMAV and ATMV fuzzy filters. In the next step, these fuzzy images are convolved with Laws’ mask descriptor and texture features are extracted. In the classification task, k-NN classifier is used.
The steps followed for implementation of integrated fuzzy fil- ters with Laws’ mask are described as below.

Proposed methodology

This section details the proposed descriptor, whose principles are presented on the block diagram illustrated on Fig. 1. The fuzzy filters are capable of suppressing the noise but the edges are not preserved. On the other hand, in the set of Laws’ mask one mask is particularly known for edge preservation. Therefore, it is sug- gested to integrate the edge preserving abilities of Laws’ mask and noise reducing abilities of fuzzy filters to preserve the edge and to reduce the Gaussian noise simultaneously. Fuzzy member- ship function with either median or moving average center is esti- mated asymmetrically or symmetrically.
The proposed fuzzy filters based Laws’ mask method is con- ducted in three steps: (1) the texture images are artificially embed-

2.2. Laws’ masks method

In 1980, Kenneth Ivan Laws has suggested an approach for the extraction of texture features that describes texture properties
a set of filters [2]. Originally he has recommended 1 × 3 vectors such as L3 = [1,2,1] for averaging, E3 = [—1, 0, 1] for edges and such as regularity, uniformity, density, roughness etc., by utilizing S3 = [—1, 2, —1] for spots. One-dimensional vectors are convolved in turn transposes with themselves or each other that create

ded with Gaussian noise, (2) fuzzy filtering, and (3) feature extrac- tion through Laws’ mask descriptor.

Gaussian noise: The noise parameter contains Gaussian noise standard deviation (rG). The texture images are artificially embedded with Gaussian noise of different values and noisy images are obtained.
Fuzzy filtering: To extend the Laws’ mask descriptor towards noise-robustness, fuzzy approach is applied. In the experiments four different types of fuzzy filter, namely, TMED, ATMED,
images. Square windows of dimensions M × M pixels are uti- TMAV, and ATMAV are employed to generate fuzzy transformed lized in the experiments. Windows of three different width val-
ues (M = 3, 5, 7) are employed for conducting the experiments. Apart from noise reduction, the interests of the fuzzy filtering steps are to preserve edges and image details.
Feature extraction through Laws’ mask descriptor:

The convolutions of the resultant fuzzy images are carried out with Laws’ mask approach. In our experiment, we have selected only four masks by excluding the wave mask. These vectors are combined in 15 different ways to perform the convolution with the fuzzy images, for example E5S5, L5E5, L5R5, etc. After a series of convolution with particular masks, the outputs are passed through texture energy measurement (TEM) filters. Some statisti- cal descriptors with moving non-linear window operation are used as energy measurement filters, through which each pixel is substi- tuted by comparing with its local neighborhood pixel. Three statis- tical descriptors such as mean, absolute mean and standard deviation are utilized texture energy measurement filters in the experiments. The mean energy filter is named as MEF, the absolute mean energy filter is named as AMEF, and the standard deviation energy filter is named as SDEF. Once the series of specific convolu- tion with selected filter masks are completed then the convolved outputs are applied to three different types of texture energy mea- surement filters for the investigation of the texture property of every pixel [6]. The filters are defined as follows.

Entropy =	I(x; y)(—lnI(x; y))	(13)

where I(x; y) is the pixel value, and L and M are the dimensions of image. Finally, to evaluate the efficiency of the suggested approach
classification is performed using k-nearest neighbour classifier.

Experimental setup and result discussions

In this section, the feasibility of the proposed technique will be examined and the results are compared with the original Laws’ mask descriptor. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique three different experiments are carried out on two benchmark databases: Brodatz and STex.
The Brodatz dataset is a very old and challenging platform for classification, presentation and analysis due to the exciting multi- plicity and perceptual similarity of some textures [32]. In this data- base, some textures belong to the same class but at different scales, while others are so inhomogeneous that a human observer may be unable to group their samples correctly. Based on these considera- tions we have chosen the Brodatz dataset from which 24 numbers
of image of size 640 × 640 pixels have been selected randomly as
sub images of size 128 × 128 pixels. Thus, 600 patches are derived. shown in Fig. 2. Splitting of each image into 25 non overlapping Out of which 288 patches are utilized for training and 312 patches
are utilized for testing.

25 different texture images are selected from this database as shown in Fig. 3. For this dataset also images are subdivided into

The convolved outputs are distributed over the three types of TEM fil- ters of size 15x15, then the normalization is performed and texture features are evaluated. Thus each image produces 45 numbers of features. The classification results of the original Laws’ mask descriptor are summarized in Table 1. The performance results of
the two different datasets are shown in Fig. 4. It is observed that

Laws’ mask descriptor. Different levels of Gaussian noise standard deviation such as rG = 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 are chosen as the noise parameter values. The images are contaminated by adding the noise with different values as mentioned above for both the data- bases. For feature extraction, the same procedure is followed as described in the Experiment #1. Table 2 presents the classification rates of the noisy images on both the datasets. It is observed from the classification results that as the noise levels are increased accordingly the classification rates are decreased for all the three TEM filters. The results of noisy images at different noise levels on both databases are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.
Experiment #3: This experiment is carried out to investigate the robustness of the proposed scheme towards noised texture analy- sis using both the datasets. The images are corrupted by following the steps of Experiment #2. Then the corrupted images are passed through the TMED, ATMED, TMAV and ATMAV fuzzy filters to obtain fuzzy transformed images. The fuzzy transformed images are obtained using different windows of width values such as M = 3, 5, 7. The purpose of using different window values is to ver- ify the effect of various noise levels at different window values. Next part of the experiment is to extract the texture features from fuzzy images through traditional Laws’ mask descriptor. For fea- tures extraction the same procedure is followed as mentioned in

Results on Brodatz dataset

Tables 3–6 represent the results of the proposed TMED, ATMED, TMAV, and ATMV fuzzy filter based Laws’ mask method on Brodatz dataset.
Table 3 shows the classification success rates for the suggested TMED fuzzy filter based Laws’ mask approach. The results displays
that when rG = 10 maximum classification rate of 93.59% is achieved at M = 3 for the mean filter. When rG = 15 highest classi-
fication rate of 92.06% is obtained at M = 3 for the MEF. For the highly noisy images the improvement in classification accuracy occurred with higher window size i.e. when rG = 20 classification rate is 89.52% with M = 5, when rG = 25 classification rate is
89.10% at M = 7, and when rG = 30 classification rate is 89.26% at
M = 7. However, for the AMEF there is not at all any improvement in classification rates are observed. For the SDEF higher classifica- tion rates are attained for only the window size M = 3. For the noise

MEF. Also for the window size M = 5 higher classification rates are noted for all the noise levels except rG = 20 for the MEF. For the AMEF higher classification rates are noted for only two noise levels
i.e. 88.14% at rG = 15 and 82.69% at rG = 30. Similarly, for the SDEF increased classification rates are attained for the window size M = 3 at each level of noise. For the noise levels rG = 10, rG = 15, rG = 20, rG = 25, and rG = 30 the corresponding classification
accuracies achieved are of 89.74%, 88.86%, 89.23%, 90.71%, and 83.33% at M = 3 for the SDEF.
The classification success rates for the suggested TMAV fuzzy filter based Laws’ mask approach are given in Table 5. For this approach, maximum classification rates of 95.91%, 91.39%, and 91.03% are achieved when rG = 10, rG = 15, and rG = 20 respec- tively with M = 3 for MEF. As the noise levels are increased i.e. when r = 25, and r = 30 it is observed that there is no improve- ment in classification rates for the window size M = 3. For the higher noise levels such as rG = 20, rG = 25, the corresponding classification accuracies achieved are of 92.95%, 91.67%, and 88.46% with M = 5 for the MEF. Similarly with window size M = 7 for all the noise levels higher classification rates are attained for the MEF, i.e. for the noise levels rG = 10, rG = 15, rG = 20,
rG = 25, and rG = 30 the corresponding classification rates are
93.91%, 91.39%, 90.71%, 88.88%, and 88.14%. For the AMEF the max-
imum classification accuracies are achieved continuously at win-
dow size M = 7 for all the noise levels. The classification rates of 92.95%, 89.74%, 87.50%, 87.82%, and 82.41% are attained when rG = 10, rG = 15, rG = 20, rG = 25, and rG = 30 respectively at M = 7 for the AMEF. However for window size M = 3 and M = 5 improvement in classification rates are noted for lower level of noise. Similarly for the SDEF the maximum classification accuracies are achieved for all the noise levels with window size M = 5 and M = 7. The classification rates of 90.71%, 88.18%, 88.46%, 87.65%, and 83.01% are attained when rG = 10, rG = 15, rG = 20, rG = 25,
and rG = 30 respectively at M = 5 for the SDEF. The classification
rates of 89.42%, 87.92%, 88.94%, 86.63%, and 84.94% are attained when rG = 10, rG = 15, rG = 20, rG = 25, and rG = 30 respectively at M = 7 for the SDEF. In addition higher classification rates are also obtained with window size M = 3 for lower noise levels for the SDEF.
The classification success rates for the suggested ATMAV fuzzy filter based Laws’ mask approach are given in Table 6. For this approach, higher classification accuracies are attained for all the noise levels with window size M = 3 for the MEF. The classification rates of 94.23%, 91.99%, 90.78%, 90.38%, and 88.82% are attained when rG = 10, rG = 15, rG = 20, rG = 25, and rG = 30 respectively at M = 3 for the MEF. Classification rates are not improved for lower noise levels with window size M = 5 and M = 7 for the MEF. However, for the higher noise levels i.e. when rG = 25, and

rG = 30 improved classification rates of 89.10%, 88.14% at M = 5, and 89.94%, 87.82% at M = 7 are obtained respectively for the MEF. Likewise for the AMEF higher classification accuracies of 89.13%, 87.76%, 88.18%, 88.78%, and 84.62% are achieved when rG = 10, rG = 15, rG = 20, rG = 25, and rG = 30 respectively at
M = 3. Nevertheless, for the higher noise levels i.e. when rG = 25,
and rG = 30 improved classification rates of 87.67%, 83.97% at M = 5, and when rG = 30 classification rate of 83.65% at M = 7 are obtained respectively for the AMEF. There is no increment in clas- sification rates at the noise level rG = 10 and rG = 15for the SDEF by applying this technique. However it is observed that for the higher noise levels i.e. when rG = 20, rG = 25, and rG = 30 the clas-
sification accuracies are increased to 89.42%, 86.65%, and 84.29% at M = 3 and 87.50%, 87.82%, 84.62% at M = 5 respectively for the SDEF. For the window size M = 7 the classification accuracies are increased to 91.67% and 86.65% when rG = 25 and rG = 30 respec- tively for the SDEF.

Results on STex dataset

Tables 7–10 represent the results of the proposed TMED, ATMED, TMAV, and ATMV fuzzy filter based Laws’ mask method on STex dataset.
The classification success rates for the suggested TMED fuzzy filter based Laws’ mask approach are given in Table 7. For this approach, the classification accuracies are increased only for two noise levels with the window sizes i.e. M = 3 and M = 5 for the MEF. The classification rates of 64.00% and 62.50% for M = 3, and 60.00% and 61.50% for M = 5 are attained when rG = 10 and
rG = 20 respectively for the MEF. For the rest of the noise levels
classification accuracies are not improved by using any of the win- dow sizes. Classification rates are not improved for lower noise levels for the AMEF using any of the window size. However, when rG = 25 and rG = 30 classification rates are improved to 41.00% and 38.00% at M = 7 for the AMEF. The similar case occurred in SDEF, when rG = 25 and rG = 30 classification rates are improved to 47.00% and 40.50% at M = 7.
The classification success rates for the suggested ATMED fuzzy filter based Laws’ mask approach are given in Table 8. From the table it is observed that the maximum classification accuracies for all the noise levels are attained for the window sizes M = 3 and M = 5 for the MEF. For the noise levels rG = 10, rG = 15,
rG = 20, rG = 25, and rG = 30 the corresponding classification
accuracies achieved are of 63.00%, 62.00%, 57.50%, 54.50%, and
52.50% at M = 3, and 60.00%, 61.00%, 57.00%, 58.50%, and 58.50%
at M = 5 for the MEF. For the window size M = 7 the higher classi-

fication rate of 62.50% is observed only when rG = 10 for the MEF. Classification rates are not improved for lower noise levels for the AMEF using any of the window size. However, when rG = 20, rG = 25 and rG = 30 classification rates are improved to 49.50%, 42.00%, and 39.50% at M = 3, 49.00%, 40.50%, and 39.50% at M = 5,
and 49.00%, 51.00%, and 43.50% at M = 7 respectively for the AMEF. The similar case observed for the SDEF. The maximum improve- ment in the classification rates are of 53.50%, 44.50%, and 45.00% when rG = 20, rG = 25 and rG = 30 respectively at M = 3 for the SDEF. There is no improvement in the classification rates for the window size M = 5 for any of the noise levels. For the window size M = 7 maximum improvement in the classification rates are of 48.00% and 40.00% when rG = 25 and rG = 30 respectively For the SDEF.
The classification success rates for the suggested TMAV fuzzy filter based Laws’ mask approach are given in Table 9. For this approach, higher classification accuracies are attained for all the noise levels with the entire window sizes i.e. M = 3, M = 5, and M = 7 for the MEF. The classification rates of 62.50%, 59.53%, 57.50%, 54.50%, and 52.00% are attained for all the noisy images at M = 3 for the MEF. The classification rates of 63.00%, 62.50%, 57.50%, 55.50%, and 56.50% are attained for all the noisy images at M = 5 for the MEF. The classification rates of 64.50%, 62.00%, 61.00%, 57.50%, and 53.00% are attained for all the noisy images at M = 7 for the MEF. For the AMEF, classification rates are not
improved for lower noise levels using any of the window size. However, when rG = 30 classification rates increased to 37.50%, 42.50%, and 43.00% at window size M = 3, M = 5, and M = 7 respec- tively for the AMEF. For the SDEF the classification rates are not increased for any of the noisy images at window size M = 3 and M = 5. Yet the classification rates are increased to 59.00%, 57.00%, 53.00%, 49.00%, and 39.50% when rG = 10, rG = 15, rG = 20,
rG = 25, and rG = 30 respectively at M = 7 for the SDEF.
The classification success rates for the suggested ATMAV fuzzy filter based Laws’ mask approach are given in Table 10. Likewise in the previous approach in this approach also higher classification accuracies are attained for all the noise levels with the entire win- dow sizes i.e. M = 3, M = 5, and M = 7 for the MEF. The classification rates of 64.00%, 63.00%, 61.50%, 58.50%, and 59.50% are attained for all the noisy images at M = 3 for the MEF. The classification rates of 62.00%, 63.50%, 58.50%, 59.50%, and 57.50% are attained for all the noisy images at M = 5 for the MEF. The classification rates of 63.00%, 60.00%, 58.50%, 57.00%, and 54.50% are attained for all the noisy images at M = 7 for the MEF. For the AMEF, classification rates are not improved for any of the window size when rG = 10.
Yet when rG = 15, rG = 20, rG = 25, and rG = 30 classification rates
are increased to 52.50%, 49.00%, 47.50%, and 42.00% at M = 3,
50.50%, 51.00%, 43.00%, and 41.50% at M = 5, and 53.00%, 54.00%,
50.00%, and 42.00% at M = 7 respectively for the AMEF. For the SDEF, classification rates are not improved for any of the noisy

These results firmly demonstrate the noise robustness of the
proposed techniques. Among all the suggested approaches the best results are provided by TMAV fuzzy Laws’ mask technique on Bro- datz database and ATMAV fuzzy Laws’ mask technique on STex database. Furthermore, it is observed that when the window width increases, the filtering capability also increases for the high-level noise. Hence, larger windows are produced better results for the heavier noise. Fig. 7 depicts the achievements of the proposed TMED fuzzy filter based Laws’ mask method. Fig. 8 shows the achievements of the suggested ATMED fuzzy filter based Laws’ mask method. Fig. 9 represents the achievements of the proposed TMAV fuzzy filter based Laws’ mask method.

Conclusion

In this paper, a new approach is presented combining the exist- ing fuzzy filters and Laws’ mask approaches to enhance the perfor- mance of conventional Laws’ mask for noise robustness in texture classification. The results on two texture databases such as Brodatz and STex validate that the proposed methods are capable of reduc- ing high level of Gaussian noise, at the same time preserving image details, edges and textures well. In addition, the performance of the proposed methods is superior compared to the traditional Laws’ mask method in terms classification on noisy texture images.
The encouraging results inspire to investigate further the appli- cation of the suggested approaches in areas like biomedical image analysis and SAR image analysis.
