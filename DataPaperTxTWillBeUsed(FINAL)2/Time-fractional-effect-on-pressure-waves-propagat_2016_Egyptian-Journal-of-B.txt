The reductive perturbation method is used to derive the KdV equation from the hydrodynamic equations of the system. The Euler– Lagrange variational technique described by Agrawal has been applied to formulate the time- fractional KdV equation.

Introduction

The propagation of pressure waves in fluid that moves in large vessels was studied by many authors, e.g. References 1–16. Many of the works studied the small amplitude wave propagation in elastic tubes, ignored the nonlinear effects and focused on the dispersive characteristic [3–5]. When the nonlinear character
appears, either finite amplitude or small-but-finite ampli- tude wave is considered, depending on the nonlinearity order. The propagation of finite waves through fluid filled elastic or viscoelastic tubes was studied [6–9]. Also, the small-but- finite amplitude waves propagating in distensible tubes were investigated [10–16], where the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equa- tion appears due to the balancing between the nonlinearity and the dispersion effects.

The KdV equation as evolution and interaction model of nonlinear waves is employed to represent a wide range of physi- cal phenomena. The KdV equation was first formulated as an evolution equation governing one-dimensional, small ampli- tude, long surface gravity waves propagating in a shallow water channel [17]. Afterward, the KdV equation has appeared in a number of other physical problems such as ion-acoustic waves, collision-free hydro-magnetic waves, plasma physics, strati- fied internal waves, lattice dynamics, etc. [18]. By means of the KdV model, some theoretical physics phenomena in quantum mechanics domain and continuum mechanics for shock wave formation are explained. The KdV model is also applied in many scientific fields like fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, solitons, tur- bulence, boundary layer behavior and mass transport.
Most of the forces in nature are non-conservative: dissipa- tive and/or dispersive forces. The classical mechanics treated conservative forces using integer differential equations, while the non-conservative forces can be described in terms of the non-integer differential equations. Non-integer differentia- tion and integration is called Fractional Calculus, which is a field of mathematics study that generalizes the traditional defi- nitions of calculus integral and derivative operators. During the last decades, Fractional Calculus has acquired importance due to its applications in various fields of science and engineer- ing, including electrical networks, signal processing, optics, fluid flow, viscoelasticity, rheology, probability and statistics, dy- namical process in self-similar and porous structures, diffusive transport, control theory of dynamical systems, electrochem- istry of corrosion, and so on [19–35].
differential equations and to an efficient numerical solution for nonlinear and fractional differential equations. The series solution begins with a trial function that can be used as the solution of the linear term of the differential equation.
Our main motive here is to study the time fractional pa- rameter effects on the propagation of solitary pressure waves through a fluid filled elastic tube. Therefore, beside what is con- sidered in Reference 16, the derived nonlinear KdV equation is transformed using variational technique described by Agrawal [24–26] into the time fractional KdV (TFKdV) equation [45]. The TFKdV equation is solved by applying VIM [46–48] developed by He and the effect of the fractional order is studied.
This paper is organized as follows: The basic set of tube and fluid equations, which governs our system, is presented in section 2. In section 3, the KdV equation is derived by apply- ing the reductive perturbation method [51]. Section 4 is devoted to derive and solve the time fractional KdV (TFKdV) equation using variational methods. Finally, some results and discus- sion are presented in section 5.

Basic equations of motion of the tube and fluid

A circular cylindrical long tube of un-deformed radius R0 , sub- jected to a uniform initial inner pressure P0 is considered. A position vector r of a general point on the tube is described as [11,12]:

Riewe [19,20] used fractional derivatives [21–23] in the action to have non-conservative Euler–Lagrange equations. In terms of Riemann–Liouville fractional derivatives, Agrawal [24–26] used variational technique to formulate fractional equations of

motion. These Euler–Lagrange equations are employed to in- vestigate different real problems [27–35].
where r0 is the radius of the tube after a finite static defor- mation, u(z, t) is a finite dynamic time dependent deformation

The fractional differential equations are solved by apply-

eˆz are the radial and axial unit


ing several methods such as: Fourier transformation method, Laplace transformation method, operational method, and the iteration method [21–23]. However, most of these methods are suitable only for special types of fractional differential equa- tions, called linear with constant coefficients. Recently, there are some works dealing with the solutions of nonlinear frac- tional differential equations using techniques of nonlinear analysis such as: Adomian decomposition method (ADM)
[36–42], variational-iteration method (VIM) [43–48], homotopy
vectors, respectively in the cylindrical polar coordinates. Z is the axial coordinate before the deformation, z is the axial co- ordinate after the static deformation and z is the axial stretch ratio. The equation of motion of a small element of the tube’s wall in the radial direction is given by [11,12]

different types of fractional nonlinear differential equations by applying the Adomian polynomials. This method is applied to study many problems arising from applied sciences and en- gineering [39–42]. The variational-iteration method [43–46] was successfully employed to solve many types of linear, nonlin- ear and fractional differential equations that describe scientific and engineering problems [46–48]. As advantages over ADM, the VIM solves differential equations without using Adomian polynomials and has no linearization or perturbation for solving the nonlinear and fractional problems. The VIM principles for solving the differential equations are given in many papers,
e.g. References 46–48. The VIM solution is provided as a con-

On the other hand, the fluid that filled the tube is consid- ered to be an incompressible inviscid fluid. The ratio of the viscous term to the nonlinear term is assumed to be very small. Therefore, the viscous effect in comparison to the nonlinear

The following stretched co-ordinates can be introduced by ap- plying the reductive perturbation theory [51] as:

where  is a smallness parameter and g is the long wave ap- proximation’s phase velocity. The physical quantities represented in (5)–(8) are expanded as power series in  as:

z	 f	r

The first equation (5a) is the incompressibility condition (mass conservation) of the fluid, while (5b) and (5c) are con- servative equations of fluid momentum in radial and axial directions, respectively.
These field equations (5) satisfy boundary conditions at the wall as follows:
The pressure at the final deformed radius of the tube is given

P(r, ,  )  P1(r, ,  )  2P2(r, ,  )  3P3(r, ,  )  …	(11c)

Substituting (10) and (11) into (5) and (6), applying (7) and equating the coefficients of different powers of  , the follow- ing results are obtained:

Eliminating the second order perturbation quantities P2, V2 , W2 and u2 in (14) and (15) employing (12) and (13) to define the first order perturbation quantities V1 , W1 and u1 lead to KdV equation for the first-order perturbation pres- sure P1 in the form:

Blood is known to be an incompressible non-Newtonian fluid.		 The order of hematocrit ratio (red cell concentration) and the

deformability of red blood cells are the main factors that make blood behave like a Newtonian fluid. Experimental observa- tions show that blood behaves as a Newtonian fluid when the shear rate is high. Blood viscosity can be considered very small to be neglected with respect to its nonlinear term. Due to these observations, it can be assumed that blood can be treated as incompressible inviscid fluid.
The reductive perturbation method [51] is applied to drive the KdV equation for a system of fluid filled elastic tube. A varia- tional method suggested by Agrawal [24–26] is used to derive the TFKdV equation. The VIM [43–48] developed by He [46] is employed to solve the derived equation by applying the Riemann–Liouville definition for the fractional derivative.
The numerical results are made physically relevant by ap- plying parameters close to experimental data in dogs [52,53]. The average values of the parameters are founded experimen- tally as R0  0.38 cm, H  0.02 cm ,   0.4, rf  0.75 cm,
0  1.03 gmcm3 ,  f  1.05 gmcm3 , a1  78.692, b1  296.105,
b2  991.496 , z  r  1.6 and v  8 cms. These experimental data are employed to study the pressure waves in dogs’ blood and the wave forms are represented in different figures.
The pressure wave against space and time at fractional pa- rameter   0.8 has soliton shape as presented in Fig. 1, which means that the pressure wave has constant shape through the artery. Effect of the variation of  on the pressure wave is
studied in Fig. 2. This figure shows that the fractional order of differentiation has a small effect only on the position of the wave peak. The initial radius of the blood-vessel R0 effect on the blood pressure wave is represented in Fig. 3, which shows that the increase of R0 decreases both the amplitude and width of the pressure wave. In Fig. 4, the increase of the thickness of the blood-vessel wall H increases both of the amplitude and
width of the blood pressure wave. The shear modulus of the blood-vessel wall material  effect on the blood pressure waves
is given in Fig. 5. It is shown that the increase of  increases both the amplitude and width of the pressure wave. Figure 6 represents the effect of the final radius of the blood-vessel rf on the pressure waves. The representation shows that the in- crease of rf decreases the amplitude while it increases the width of the pressure wave.

The above calculations show that the blood-vessel charac- teristics modulate the shape of the pressure waves in the blood for both the amplitude and width while the fractional order of the evolution equation that describes the pressure wave propagation has a small effect on these waves.
