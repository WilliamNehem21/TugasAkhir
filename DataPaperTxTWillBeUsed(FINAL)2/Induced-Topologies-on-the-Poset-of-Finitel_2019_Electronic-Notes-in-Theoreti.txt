Abstract
In [7], Heckmann and Keimel proved that a dcpo P is quasicontinuous iff the poset Fin P of nonempty finitely generated upper sets ordered by reverse inclusion is continuous. We generalize this result to general topological spaces in this paper. More precisely, for any T0 space (X, τ ) and U ∈ τ , we construct a topology τF generated by the basic open subsets UF = {↑F ∈ Fin X: F ⊆ U}. It is shown that a T0 space (X, τ ) is a hypercontinuous lattice iff τF is a completely distributive lattice. In particular, we prove that if a poset P satisfies property DINTop, then P is quasi-hypercontinuous iff Fin P is hypercontinuous.
Keywords: Hypercontinuous poset, quasicontinuous domain, Scott topology, upper topology


Introduction and Preliminaries
Quasicontinuous domains were introduced by Gierz, Lawson and Stralka (see [4]) as a common generalization of both generalized continuous lattices (see [5]) and continuous domains (see [6]). It was proved that quasicontinuous domains equipped with the Scott topologies are precisely the spectra of distributive hypercontinuous

lattices. In [7], Heckmann and Keimel proved that a dcpo P is quasicontinuous iff the poset Fin P of nonempty finitely generated upper sets ordered by reverse inclusion is continuous. In this paper, we generalize this result to general topological spaces. Firstly, for any T0 space (X, τ ) and U ∈ τ , we construct a topology τF generated by the basic open subsets UF = {↑F ∈ Fin X: F ⊆ U}. Then we show that a T0 space (X, τ ) is a hypercontinuous lattice iff τF is a completely distributive lattice. In particular, we prove that for a dcpo P , if the Scott topology σ(P ) is hypercontinuous or σ(Fin P ) is completely distributive, then σ(P )F =σ(Fin P ). Furthermore, it is proved that if a poset P satisfies property DINTop, then P is quasi-hypercontinuous iff Fin P is hypercontinuous.
For a poset P , let P (<ω) = {F ⊆ P : F is finite} and Fin P ={↑F : F ∈ P (<ω)}.

For all x ∈ P , A ⊆ P , let ↑x = {y ∈ P : x ≤ y} and ↑A = S

a∈A
↑a; ↓x and ↓A

are defined dually. For a poset P , the topology generated by the collection of sets
P \ ↓x (as a subbase) is called the upper topology and denoted by υ(P ); the lower topology on P is dually defined and denoted by ω(P ). A subset U of P is called Scott open provided that U = ↑U and D ∩ U /= ∅ for all directed sets D ⊆ P with
W D ∈ U whenever W D exists. The topology formed by all the Scott open sets of
P is called the Scott topology on P , written as σ(P ).
If P is a poset, more generally a preordered set, we introduce a preorder ≤ on the powerset of P , sometimes called the Smyth preorder, by A ≤ B iff ↑B ⊆ ↑A. Throughout the paper, Fin P is always endowed with the Smyth preorder.
Definition 1.1 ([6,11]) Let P be a poset.
For any two elements x and y in P , we write x  y, if for each directed subset
D ⊆ P with W D existing, y ≤ W D implies x ≤ d for some d ∈ D. The set
{y ∈ P : y  x} will be denoted ⇓x and {y ∈ P : x  y} denoted ⇑x.
P is called a continuous poset if x = W ⇓x and ⇓x is directed for all x ∈ P .
P is called an algebraic poset if x = W{y ∈ P : y  y ≤ x} for all x ∈ P and
the set {y ∈ P : y  y ≤ x} is directed.
Definition 1.2 ([5,6]) Let P be a poset.
We define a relation ≺ on P by x ≺ y ⇔ y ∈ intυ(P )↑x.
P is called a hypercontinuous poset if {u ∈ P : u ≺ x} is directed and x =
W{u ∈ P : u ≺ x} for each x ∈ P . A complete lattice which is hypercontinuous
as a poset is called a hypercontinuous lattice.
P is called a hyperalgebraic poset if {u ∈ P : u ≺ u ≤ x} is directed and
x = W{u ∈ P : u ≺ u ≤ x} for each x ∈ P . A complete lattice which is
hyperalgebraic as a poset is called a hyperalgebraic lattice.
Theorem 1.3 ([1,11]) Let P be a poset. Then the following conditions are equiva- lent:
P is a continuous poset;
For all x ∈ U ∈ σ(P ), there exists y ∈ P such that x ∈ intσ(P )↑y ⊆ ↑y ⊆ U;

(2) σ(P ) is a completely distributive lattice.
Theorem 1.4 ([5,6]) Let P be a poset. Then the following conditions are equiva- lent:
P is a hypercontinuous poset;
For all x ∈ U ∈ υ(P ), there exists y ∈ P such that x ∈ intυ(P )↑y ⊆ ↑y ⊆ U;
(2) υ(P ) is a completely distributive lattice.
Definition 1.5 ([2,3]) A T0 space (X, τ ) is called a web space if for each x ∈ X
and Y ⊆ X with x ∈ clτ Y , one has x ∈ clτ (↓x ∩ ↓Y ).
Definition 1.6 ([10]) A poset P is called meet continuous if for any x ∈ P and any directed set D, if W D exists and x ≤ W D, then x ∈ clσ(P )(↓x ∩ ↓D).
Theorem 1.7 ([2,3]) Let P be a poset. Then the following conditions are equiva- lent:
P is meet continuous;
P is a web space endowed with the Scott topology;
For any Scott open set U and any x ∈ P, ↑(U ∩ ↓x) is Scott open.
The proof of the following lemma is similar to that of the analogous results for dcpos in [6].
Lemma 1.8 If F is a ﬁnite set in a meet continuous poset P, then we have
intσ(P )↑F ⊆ S{⇑x : x ∈ F}.
Quasicontinuous domains and quasihypercontinuous posets
Definition 2.1 ([4,6]) Let P be a dcpo.
For all F , G ⊆ P , we say that G is way below F and write G  F if for every directed set D ⊆ P , W D ∈ ↑F implies d ∈ ↑G for some d ∈ D.
P is called a quasicontinuous domain if {↑F ∈ Fin P : F  x} is directed and ↑x =  {↑F ∈ Fin P : F  x} for each x ∈ P .
P is called a quasialgebraic domain if {↑F ∈ Fin P : F  F  x} is directed and ↑x =  {↑F ∈ Fin P : F  F  x} for each x ∈ P .
Definition 2.2 ([12]) Let P be a poset.
We define a relation ≺ on 2P by F ≺ G ⇔ G ⊆ intυ(P )↑F .
P is called a quasi-hypercontinuous poset if {↑F ∈ Fin P : F ≺ x} is directed and ↑x =  {↑F ∈ Fin P : F ≺ x} for each x ∈ P .
P is called a quasi-hyperalgebraic poset if {↑F ∈ Fin P : F ≺ F ≺ x} is directed and ↑x =  {↑F ∈ Fin P : F ≺ F ≺ x} for each x ∈ P .
Theorem 2.3 ([4,6]) Let P be a dcpo. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

P is a quasicontinuous domain;
For all x ∈ U ∈ σ(P ), there exists F ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intσ(P )↑F ⊆ ↑F ⊆
U;
σ(P ) is a hypercontinuous lattice.
Theorem 2.4 ([6]) Let P be a dcpo. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
P is a quasialgebraic domain;
For all x ∈ U ∈ σ(P ), there exists F ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intσ(P )↑F = ↑F ⊆
U;
σ(P ) is a hyperalgebraic lattice.
Theorem 2.5 ([12]) Let P be a poset. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
P is a quasi-hypercontinuous poset;
For all x ∈ U ∈ υ(P ), there exists F ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intυ(P )↑F ⊆ ↑F ⊆
U;
υ(P ) is a hypercontinuous lattice.
According to [10], a poset P is called a quasicontinuous poset (resp., quasial- gebraic poset) if for all x ∈ U  ∈ σ(P ), there exists F  ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intσ(P )↑F ⊆ ↑F ⊆ U (resp., x ∈ intσ(P )↑F = ↑F ⊆ U ).
Theorem 2.6 Let P be a poset. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
P is an algebraic poset;
P is a meet continuous and quasialgebraic poset.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Obviously.
(2) ⇒ (1): CLAIM: Let x ∈ P and F ⊆ P be finite. If x ∈ intσ(P )↑F = ↑F , then there exists t ∈ F with t ∈ ↓x ∩ K(P ).
Proof of Claim. Since F is finite, ↑F = ↑Min(F) where Min(F) is the set of all minimal elements in F . By Lemma 1.8, x ∈ ↑Min(F) = ↑F = intσ(P )↑F = intσ(P )↑Min(F) ⊆  {⇑t : t ∈ Min(F)}. So there exists t ∈ Min(F) with t  x. Since ↑Min(F) ⊆  {⇑t : t ∈ Min(F)}, there exists s ∈ Min(F) with s  t, hence s ≤ t. So s = t since s, t ∈ Min(F). Thus t ∈ ↓x ∩ K(P ).
Firstly, we show that x = W(↓x ∩ K(P )) for all x ∈ P . Clearly, x is an upper
bound of ↓x ∩ K(P ). Let y be any upper bound of ↓x ∩ K(P ) and assume x ¢ y. Then x ∈ P\↓y ∈ σ(P ). By (2), there exists F ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intσ(P )↑F =
↑F ⊆ P\↓y. By Claim, there exists t ∈ F with t ∈ ↓x ∩ K(P ), a contradiction to
↓x ∩ K(P ) ⊆ ↓y.
Then we show that ↓x ∩ K(P ) is directed for all x ∈ P . On the one hand, since P is quasialgebraic, there exists G ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intσ(P )↑G = ↑G ⊆ P . By Claim, there is a y ∈ G with y ∈ ↓x ∩ K(P ). Thus ↓x ∩ K(P ) /= ∅. On the other hand, let u, v ∈ ↓x ∩ K(P ). Then x ∈ ↑u ∩ ↑v ∈ σ(P ). By (2), there exists H ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intσ(P )↑H = ↑H ⊆ ↑u ∩ ↑v. By Claim, there exists m ∈ H with m ∈ ↓x ∩ K(P ). Whence m ∈ ↑u ∩ ↑v. Hence ↓x ∩ K(P ) is directed.2

Proposition 2.7 Let P be a poset. Then the following two conditions are equiva- lent:
P is a quasi-hyperalgebraic poset;
For all x ∈ U ∈ υ(P ), there exists F ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intυ(P )↑F = ↑F ⊆
U;
υ(P ) is a hyperalgebraic lattice.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): For all U ∈ υ(P ) with x ∈ U , there exists H ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ P\↓H ⊆ U . For all h ∈ H, by (1), there exists Fh ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intυ(P )↑Fh = ↑Fh ⊆ P\↓h. Since H ∈ P (<ω) and {↑F ∈ Fin P : x ∈
intυ(P )↑F = ↑F} is directed, there exists G ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intυ(P )↑G =
↑G ⊆   ↑Fh ⊆   P\↓h = P\↓H ⊆ U .
h∈H	h∈H
(2) ⇒ (1): Suppose ↑F1, ↑F2 ∈ {↑F ∈ Fin P : x ∈ intυ(P )↑F = ↑F}. Then
x ∈ intυ(P )↑F1 ∩ intυ(P )↑F2 ∈ υ(P ). By (2), there is F3 ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intυ(P )↑F3 = ↑F3 ⊆ intυ(P )↑F1 ∩ intυ(P )↑F2 ⊆ ↑F1 ∩ ↑F2. Therefore, {↑F ∈ Fin P : x ∈ intυ(P )↑F = ↑F} is directed. Clearly, ↑x ⊆  {↑F ∈ Fin P : x ∈
intυ(P )↑F = ↑F}. If z ∈/ ↑x, then x ∈ P\↓z ∈ υ(P ). By (2), there is G ∈ P (<ω)
with x ∈ intυ(P )↑G = ↑G ⊆ P\↓z. It follows that z ∈/  {↑F ∈ Fin P : x ∈
intυ(P )↑F = ↑F}. Therefore, ↑x =  {↑F ∈ Fin P : x ∈ intυ(P )↑F = ↑F}.
(2) ⇔ (3): This follows from Lemma 3.3 of [13].	2
It is similar to the proof of Theorem 2.6, we have the following
Theorem 2.8 Let P be a poset. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
P is a hyperalgebraic poset;
P is a meet continuous and quasi-hyperalgebraic poset.

Induced topologies on the poset of finitely generated saturated sets
Definition 3.1 ([2]) Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space.
(X, τ ) is called a c-space if for all x ∈ U ∈ τ , there exist y ∈ X and V ∈ τ such that x ∈ V ⊆ ↑y ⊆ U .
(X, τ ) is called a locally hypercompact space if for all x ∈ U ∈ τ , there exists
F ∈ X(<ω) and V ∈ τ such that x ∈ V ⊆ ↑F ⊆ U .
Theorem 3.2 ([1]) Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space. The following conditions are equiva- lent:
X is a c-space;
τ is a completely distributive lattice.
Theorem 3.3 ([2,8]) Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space. The following conditions are equiv- alent:

X is locally hypercompact;
τ is a hypercontinuous lattice.
Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space. For all U ∈ τ , let UF = {↑F ∈ Fin X: F ⊆ U}. The topology generated by the basic open subsets UF is denoted by τF .
It is easy to get the following
Proposition 3.4 Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space.
∅F = ∅, XF = Fin X.
For all U, V ∈ τ, (U ∩ V )F = UF ∩ VF .
Theorem 3.5 Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
τ is a hypercontinuous lattice;
τF is a completely distributive lattice.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): For any ↑G ∈ U = S (Ui)F , there exists i ∈ I such that
i∈I
↑G ⊆ Ui. By Theorem 3.3, for each g ∈ G, there exists Fg ∈ X(<ω) such that
g ∈ intτ ↑Fg ⊆ ↑Fg ⊆ Ui. Let F = S Fg and V = intτ ↑F . Obviously, F is finite.
g∈G
Thus ↑G ∈ VF ⊆ ↑FinX (↑F ) ⊆ (Ui)F ⊆ U . Thus τF is completely distributive by
Theorem 3.2.
(2) ⇒ (1): Let U ∈ τ with x ∈ U . Then ↑x ∈ UF . By (2), there exists ↑F ∈ Fin P such that ↑x ∈ intτF ↑FinX (↑F ) ⊆ ↑FinX (↑F ) ⊆ UF . Thus there exists V ∈ τ such that ↑x ∈ VF ⊆ ↑FinX (↑F ) ⊆ UF . Hence x ∈ V ⊆ ↑F ⊆ U . Therefore, τ is hypercontinuous by Theorem 3.3.	2
Similarly, we have the following
Theorem 3.6 Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
τ is a hyperalgebraic lattice;
τF is a completely distributive and algebraic lattice.

Lemma 3.7 Let P be a poset. Then W
↑Fd exists in Fin P iff 
↑Fd ∈ Fin P

d∈D
for all {↑Fd : d ∈ D}⊆ Fin P. In that case
 
d∈D
↑Fd =
W
d∈D
↑Fd.
d∈D

Proof. Obviously, 
↑Fd ∈ Fin P implies that W
↑Fd exists in Fin P .

d∈D
Conversely, let ↑F ∈ Fin P with
 
W
d∈D
d∈D
↑Fd = ↑F . Then for all d ∈ D, ↑Fd ≤ ↑F ,
 

i.e., ↑F ⊆ ↑Fd. Thus ↑F ⊆
 

d∈D
↑Fd. On the other hand, if

d∈D
↑Fd ¢ ↑F , then

there exists x ∈

d∈D
↑Fd but x ∈/ ↑F . Thus ↑x is an upper bound of {↑Fd : d ∈ D}

in Fin P and ↑F ¢ ↑x, a contradiction.	2

Proposition 3.8 For any poset P, Fin P is a meet continuous poset.
Proof. For all ↑F ∈ Fin P and U ∈ σ(Fin P ), we show that ↑FinP (↓FinWP (↑F ) ∩
U ) ∈ σ(Fin P ). For all directed sets {↑Fd : d ∈ D} ⊆ Fin P with	↑Fd ∈
d∈DW
↑FinP (↓FinP (↑F ) ∩U ), there exists ↑G ∈U with ↑G ≤ ↑F such that ↑G ≤	↑Fd.

By Lemma 3.7, we have
 
d∈D
↑Fd ⊆ ↑G. Thus ↑G = ↑G∪
 
d∈D
↑Fd =
 
d∈D
d∈D
(↑G∪↑Fd) ∈

U . Hence there exists d ∈ D such that ↑G ∪ ↑Fd ∈ U . Thus ↑G ∪ ↑Fd ≤ ↑Fd, ↑G,
which implies ↑G ∪ ↑Fd ∈ U ∩ ↓FinP (↑F ). Whence ↑Fd ∈ ↑FinP (↓FinP (↑F ) ∩ U ). Hence Fin P is meet continuous by Theorem 1.7.	2
Lemma 3.9 Let P be a dcpo. Then σ(P )F ⊆ σ(Fin P ).
Proof. For all U ∈ σ(P ), we show UF = {↑F ∈ Fin P : ↑F ⊆ U} ∈ σ(Fin P ). Obviously, UF = ↑FinP UF . For all directed sets {↑Fd : d ∈ D} ⊆ Fin P with
W ↑Fd ∈ UF , by Lemma 3.7, we have   ↑Fd = ↑H ∈ Fin P and ↑H ⊆ U .
d∈D	d∈D
By Rudin’s Lemma [6, III-3.3], there exists d ∈ D such that ↑Fd ⊆ U . Whence
↑Fd ∈ UF . Hence UF ∈ σ(Fin P ).	2
Lemma 3.10 Let P be a poset and U ∈ σ(Fin P ). Then U = S U = S{↑F ∈ Fin
P : ↑F ∈ U}∈ σ(P ).
Proof. Let y ∈ ↑U . Let x ∈ U such that x ≤ y. Then there exists ↑F ∈ U such that x ∈ ↑F . Thus ↑y ⊆ ↑x ⊆ ↑F , i.e., ↑F ≤ ↑x ≤ ↑y. Since U ∈ σ(Fin P ),
↑y ∈ U . Whence y ∈ U . Hence ↑U = U .
For all directed sets D ⊆ P with W D ∈ U , we have   ↑d = ↑ W D ∈ U . Thus
d∈D
there exists d ∈ D such that ↑d ∈ U . So d ∈ U .	2
Theorem 3.11 Let P be a dcpo. If σ(P ) is hypercontinuous or σ(Fin P ) is com- pletely distributive, then σ(P )F =σ(Fin P).
Proof. Let ↑F ∈ U ∈ σ(Fin P ). If σ(P ) is hypercontinuous, then ↑F = {↑G ∈ Fin P : ↑F ⊆ intσ(P )↑G} and {↑G ∈ Fin P : ↑F ⊆ intσ(P )↑G} is directed. Thus there exists ↑G ∈ Fin P such that ↑F ⊆ intσ(P )↑G ⊆ ↑G ∈ U . Let V = intσ(P )↑G. Then ↑F ∈ VF ⊆ ↑FinP (↑G) ⊆ U . Hence U ∈ σ(P )F .
If σ(Fin P ) is completely distributive, then there is ↑H ∈ Fin P with ↑F ∈ intσ(FinP )↑FinP(↑H) ⊆ ↑FinP(↑H) ⊆ U . Let W = S intσ(FinP )↑FinP(↑H). Then by Lemma 3.10, W ∈ σ(P ) and ↑F ∈ WF ⊆ ↑FinP (↑H) ⊆ U . Therefore, U ∈
σ(P )F . By Lemma 3.9, we have σ(P )F =σ(Fin P ).	2
By Theorem 3.5 and Theorem 3.11, we get the following
Corollary 3.12 Let P be a dcpo. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
σ(P ) is a hypercontinuous lattice;
σ(Fin P ) is a completely distributive lattice.
By Theorem 1.3, Theorem 2.3 and Corollary 3.12, we have the following

Corollary 3.13 ([7]) Let P be a dcpo. Then the following two conditions are equiv- alent:
P is a quasicontinuous domain;
Fin P is a continuous poset.
By Theorem 5.6 of [10] and Proposition 3.8, we have the following
Corollary 3.14 Let P be a poset. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
Fin P is a continuous poset;
Fin P is a quasicontinuous poset.
By Theorem 2.6 and Proposition 3.8, we have the following
Corollary 3.15 Let P be a poset. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
Fin P is an algebraic poset;
Fin P is a quasialgebraic poset.
A poset P is said to have property DINT (see [9]) if every set closed in the lower topology is a directed intersection of finitely generated upper sets.
Theorem 3.16 Let P be a poset satisfying property DINTop.	Then υ(Fin P)=υ(P )F .
Proof. For all ↑F ∈ Fin P , we have Fin P \↓FinP (↑F ) = S (P\↓u)F . Thus
u∈F
υ(Fin P ) ⊆ υ(P )F .
Conversely, it is clear that PF = Fin P ∈ υ(Fin P ). For any nonempty set U ∈ υ(P ) with U /= P , we show UF ∈ υ(Fin P ). Since P satisfies property DINTop, there exists a directed family {↓Fd : Fd ∈ P (<ω) and d ∈ D} such that
U = P\   ↓Fd = S (P\↓Fd). Thus UF =( S (P\↓Fd))F = S (P\↓Fd)F . We

d∈D
d∈D

d∈D

claim that (P\↓Fd)F ∈ υ(Fin P ) for all d ∈ D. For all ↑G ∈ (P\↓Fd)F , we have
↑G ⊆ P\↓Fd, i.e., ↑h ¢ ↑G for all h ∈ Fd. Thus ↑G ∈   (Fin P\↓FinP (↑h)) =

Fin P\
S
h∈Fd
h∈Fd
↓FinP (↑h) = Fin P\↓FinP {↑h : h ∈ Fd} ∈ υ(Fin P ).  Therefore,

UF ∈ υ(Fin P ).	2
Problem 3.17 Is property DINTop necessary to derive Theorem 3.16?
By Theorem 1.4, Theorem 2.5, Theorem 3.5 and Theorem 3.16, we have the following
Corollary 3.18 Let P be a poset satisfying property DINTop. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
P is a quasi-hypercontinuous poset;
Fin P is a hypercontinuous poset.

Corollary 3.19 Let P be a semilattice. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
P is a quasi-hypercontinuous poset;
Fin P is a hypercontinuous poset.
Similarly, we have the following two corollaries.
Corollary 3.20 Let P be a poset. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
Fin P is a hypercontinuous poset;
Fin P is a quasi-hypercontinuous poset.
Corollary 3.21 Let P be a poset. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
Fin P is a hyperalgebraic poset;
Fin P is a quasi-hyperalgebraic poset.
