(1) A sup-semilattice is both s2-C-continuous and s2-continuous if and only if it is s2-CD; (2) A sup- semilattice is both s2-C-continuous and hypercontinuous if and only if it is s2-CD; (3) A sup-semilattice is both s2-QC-continuous and s2-quasicontinuous if and only if it is s2-GCD; (4) A sup-semilattice is both s2-QC-continuous and quasi-hypercontinuous if and only if it is s2-GCD; (5) A poset is s2-C-continuous if and only if it is both s2-MC-continuous and s2-QC-continuous; (6) A poset is s2-CD if and only if its order dual is s2-CD; (7) A semi-lattice is s2-GCD if and only if its order dual is hypercontinuous; (8) The lattice of all σ2-closed subsets of a poset is C-continuous; (9) A poset P is s2-continuous if and only if the lattice C2(P ) of all σ2-closed subsets of P is a continuous lattice if and only if C2(P ) is a CD lattice; (10) A poset P is s2-quasicontinuous if and only if the lattice σ2(P ) of all σ2-open subsets of P is a hypercontinuous lattice if and only if C2(P ) is a GCD lattice if and only if C2(P ) is a quasicontinuous lattice.

Introduction
Domain theory was introduced by Dana Scott in the late sixties as models for the denotational semantics of programming languages, due to its strong background in computer science, general topology and topological algebra has been extensively studied in various areas. An important approach in the study of domains is to extend the theory of domains to that of posets as much as possible.
In domain theory, there are some categories which gained particularly wide at- tention, that is continuous lattice category, completely distributive (for short, CD) lattice category ([10]), Domain category, as well as hypercontinuous lattice cate- gory ([6]) etc. Recently, Ho and Zhao defined the binary relation ≺ by all Scott closed subsets instead of the directed subsets in the definition of the way below

relation, and proposed the concept of a C-continuous poset ([8]). The special case of the C-continuous poset is the C-continuous lattice. To know more about these research objects, the most important studying method is to generalize them. One of the generalizations of the continuous lattices is called quasicontinuous lattice ([5]), they were introduced by Gierz, Lawson and Stralka in 1983. The basic idea is to generalize the way below relation to that on the collection of all subsets of a complete lattice. Based on this idea: Yang and Xu introduced the concept of a generalized completely distributive (for short, GCD) lattice in 2010 ([11]); Xu gave the concepts of the quasi-hypercontinuous lattice in 2016; He, Xu and Yang provided the concept of a quasi-C-continuous (for short, QC-continuous) poset in 2016 ([7]). Another generalizations of the continuous lattices is called s2-continuous poset (s1-continuous poset) ([3]), they were proposed by Ern´e in 1981. The basic idea is by making use of the cut operator instead of joins in the definition of the way below relation. The notion of s2-continuty admits to generalize most important characterizations of continuity from dcpos to arbitrary posets and has the advantage that the existence of directed joins is not even required. Afterwards Yao gave the concept of the M-continuous in 2011 ([12]) and Zhang and Xu gave the concepts of the s2-quasicontinuous in 2015 ([13]) and s1-quasicontinuous poset in 2016 ([14]) in the manner of Ern´e. In addition, Mao and Xu introduced the concept of meet-C- continuous (for short, MC-continuous) poset by the semi-topological structure ([1]) and discussed the relation among C-continuous, QC-continuous and MC-continuous in 2016([9]).
In this paper, we will also generalize the binary relations ≺ and a by making use of the cut operator instead of joins, and define s2-C-continuous (s2-QC-continuous) and s2-CD (s2-GCD) posets, respectively. We obtain some characterization for the continuity of the poset: a poset is s2-CD if and only if its order dual is s2-CD; a semilattice is s2-GCD if and only if its order dual is hypercontinuous, and a sup- semilattice is both s2-C-continuous and s2-continuous if and only if it is s2-CD. We also prove that the lattice of all σ2-closed subsets of a poset is C-continuous. In last section, we will propose the concept of s2-meet-C-continuous (for short, s2- MC-continuous) poset by semi-topological structure and give the characterization theorem that a poset is s2-C-continuous if and only if it is both s2-MC-continuous and s2-QC-continuous.
Preliminaries
In this paper, the order dual of the poset P is written as Pop. For a poset P and for all x ∈ P , A ⊆ P , let ↑x = {y ∈ P | x ≤ y} and ↑A = a∈A ↑a; ↓x and ↓A are defined dually. Al and Au denote the sets of all upper and lower bounds of A are defined by
Au = {x ∈ P | a ≤ x for all a ∈ A}  and  Al = {x ∈ P | x ≤ a for all a ∈ A},
respectively. Let Aδ = (Au)l be the cut of A. Further, Au is an up-set and Al is a down-set.

Lemma 2.1 [2] Let P be a poset. For subsets A and B of P, we have
A ⊆ Aδ;
if A ⊆ B, then Au ⊇ Bu and Al ⊇ Bl, which implies that Aδ ⊆ Bδ;
Au = Aulu, i.e., Aδ = (Aδ)δ;
(↓x)δ = ↓x for all x ∈ P;
If sup A exists in P, then Aδ = ↓sup A.
Definition 2.2 [13] Let P be a poset. A subset U ⊆ P is called σ2-open if it satisfies:
U = ↑U .
Dδ ∩ U /= ∅ implies D ∩ U /= ∅ for all directed sets D ⊆ P .
The collection of all σ2-open subsets of P forms a topology. It will be called σ2- topology of P and will be denoted by σ2(P ). The topology λ2(P )= σ2(P ) ∨ ω(P ) is called the λ2-topology on P . Obviously, υ(P ) ⊆ σ2(P ) ⊆ σ(P ).
The complements of σ2-open sets of the poset P are the σ2-closed sets. We use C2(P ) and C∗(P ) to denote the set of all σ2-closed sets and the set of all nonempty σ2-closed sets of P , respectively. Thus a subset S ⊆ P is σ2-closed if and only if S = ↓S and for all directed subsets D ⊆ S implies Dδ ⊆ S. Both σ2(P ) and C2(P ) are distributive complete lattices with respect to the inclusion order. For a poset P and x ∈ P , let S(x)= {S ∈ C∗(P ) | x ∈ Sδ}.
Remark 2.3 (i) Let P be a poset. Then ↓x, Aδ ∈ C2(P ) for all x ∈ P, A ⊆ P .
(ii) If P is a dcpo, then σ2-closed subsets are precisely Scott-closed. We use C(P ) to denote the set of all Scott-closed sets of P .

s2-C-continuous posets
Definition 3.1 [13] Let P be a poset.
The way-below relation  2 on P is defined by x  2y for all x, y ∈ P , if for all directed subsets D ⊆ P with y ∈ Dδ, which implies that x ∈ ↓D. The set
{y ∈ P | y  2x} will be denoted ⇓x and {y ∈ P | x  2y} denoted ⇑x.
P is called s2-continuous if for all x ∈ P , the set ⇓x is directed and x = sup ⇓x.
Remark 3.2 Let P be a poset. Then x  2z and y  2z imply x ∨ y  2z whenever the least upper bound x ∨ y exists in P .
Proposition 3.3 Let P be a poset. If x  2z and if z ∈ Dδ for a directed subset D ⊆ P which ⇓d is directed and d = sup ⇓d for all d ∈ D, then x 2d for some element d ∈ D, that is, {⇓z | z ∈ Dδ} = {⇓d | d ∈ D}. Further, If P is s2- continuous, then ⇑x is σ2-open for all x ∈ P.
Proof. Assume that x ∈/ S {⇓d | d ∈ D}. Let I = Sd∈D ⇓d. Then I is a di-
rected subset of P and Iδ = (	⇓d)δ ⊇	(⇓d)δ ⊇ D, which implies that
Dδ ⊆ (Iδ)δ = Iδ.	Since x 2z and z ∈ Dδ, so x ∈ ↓I = I =		d∈D ⇓d, this is a contradiction.	Hence x  2d for some element d  ∈ D.	Further,

{⇓z | z ∈ Dδ}⊆	{⇓d | d ∈ D}. Since D ⊆ Dδ for a directed subset D ⊆ P , we have S {⇓z | z ∈ Dδ}⊇ S {⇓d | d ∈ D}.	2
Definition 3.4 [8] Let P be a poset. For any two elements x and y in P , we write x≺y, if for each nonempty Scott-closed subset S ⊆ P for which sup S exists, y ≤ sup S implies x ∈ S.
Given a poset P , we now define a new binary relation on P which is crucial for us to formulate the properties of lattices of σ2-closed sets.
Definition 3.5 Let P be a poset. For any two elements x and y in P , we write
x≺2y, if for each nonempty σ2-closed subset S ⊆ P , y ∈ Sδ implies x ∈ S. The set
{y ∈ P | y≺2x} will be denoted ↓≺x and {y ∈ P | x≺2y} denoted ↑≺x.
Remark 3.6 (i) If P is a poset, then x≺2y implies x ≺ y for all x, y ∈ P .
If P is a complete lattice, then x≺ y is equal to x ≺ y for all x, y ∈ P .
x≺2y if and only if x ∈  S(y) for all x, y ∈ P .
Now it is routine to verify the following properties of the relation ≺2.
Proposition 3.7 Let P be a poset and u, v, x, y ∈ P. Then the following statements hold:
x≺2y implies x ≤ y;
u ≤ x≺2y ≤ v implies u≺2v;
if P has a smallest element 0, then 0≺2x always holds.
Proof. This follows immediately from Definition 3.5.	2
Proposition 3.8 Let P be a poset and D a directed subset of P. If D ⊆ ↓≺x, then
Dδ ⊆ ↓≺x.
Proof. Suppose S ∈ C∗(P ) with x ∈ Sδ. Since d≺2x for all d ∈ D, it follows that D ⊆ S. Because S is σ2-closed and D is directed, we have Dδ ⊆ S. Thus Dδ ⊆ ↓≺x.	2
Propositions 3.7 and 3.8 together imply the following corollary.
Corollary 3.9 Let P be a poset. Then the set ↓≺x is a σ2-closed subset of P for all x ∈ P.
Definition 3.10 Let P be a poset. P is called s2-C-continuous if for all x ∈ P ,
x = sup ↓≺x.
Remark 3.11 Notice that one of the requirements of a s2-continuous poset P is that for every x ∈ P the set ⇓x is directed. In contrast, for any poset P , the set
↓≺x is automatically σ2-closed for all x ∈ P by virtue of Corollary 3.9.
Lemma 3.12 Let P be a poset. Then for any collection {S | i ∈ I} of the nonempty
σ2-closed subsets of P,  i∈I Si /= ∅ if and only if ( i∈I Si)δ /= ∅.

Proof. Since   S ⊆ (  S )δ, so   S /= ∅ implies (  S )δ /= ∅. Con- versely, assume that  S = ∅. Then P has no a smallest element, which implies that ( i∈I Si)δ = Pl = ∅, this is a a contradiction.	2
The following proposition is similar to Theorem I-1.10 in [4].
Proposition 3.13 For a poset P, the following conditions are equivalent:
P is s2-C-continuous;
for each x ∈ P, the set ↓≺x is the smallest nonempty σ2-closed set S ⊆ P with
x ∈ Sδ;
for each x ∈ P, there is a smallest nonempty σ2-closed set S ⊆ P with x ∈ Sδ;
for any collection {Si | i ∈ I} of σ2-closed subsets of P, the following equation hold:


i∈I
Sδ = ( 

i∈I
Si)δ.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Condition (1) holds if and only if for each x ∈ P , ↓≺x ∈ C∗(P ) and x ∈ (↓≺x)δ by Definition 3.10. Since for any nonempty σ2-closed set S ⊆ P with x ∈ Sδ, ↓≺x ⊆ S by Definition 3.5, so (2) hold.
Condition (2) trivially implies (3).
⇒ (1): For each x ∈ P , if S(x) has a smallest element S, then S ⊆  S(x) ⊆ S, and thus S =  S(x) = ↓≺x by Remark 3.6(iii). Since x ∈ Sδ, we have x = sup ↓≺x. Hence P is s2-C-continuous.

⇒ (4): Since  i∈I
Si ⊆ Si for all i ∈ I, we have ( i∈I
Si)δ ⊆ 

i∈I
Sδ.

For the reverse, suppose x ∈	Sδ. Then x ∈ Sδ, which implies that ↓≺x ⊆ Si
for all i ∈ I, since Si is σ2-closed for all i ∈ I. Thus ↓≺x ⊆  i∈I Si. Therefore,

x ∈ (↓≺x)δ ⊆ ( i∈I
Si)δ, because P is s2-C-continuous. Hence ( 

i∈I
Si)δ ⊇  i∈I
Sδ.

⇒ (3): Suppose (4) hold. Then for each x ∈ P , (	S)δ =	Sδ.
Therefore x ∈ (	S)δ, i.e., (	S)δ /= ∅ and	S ∈ S(x) by Lemma
3.12. Hence  S∈S(x) S a smallest element S(x).	2
The following example illustrates that s2-continuous and s2-C-continuous can be quite different.
Example 3.14 (1) Consider the poset P = {a, b, x, y, z}, where the order as defined by x, y, z < a, b. Since P is a finite poset, so P is a s2-continuous. Let S1 = {x} and S2 = {y, z}. Then S1 and S2 are σ2-closed by Remark 2.3(i), and (S1 ∩ S2)δ = ({x}∩ {y, z})δ = (∅)δ = ∅, Sδ ∩ Sδ = {x}δ ∩ {y, z}δ = {x}∩ {x, y, z} = {x} /= ∅.
1	2
Thus (S1 ∩ S2)δ /= Sδ ∩ Sδ, hence P is not s2-C-continuous by Proposition 3.13.

Consider the poset P = {(m, n) | m ∈ {0, 1} and n ∈ N}∪ {ω0, ω1} with ordering defined by (m1, n1) ≤ (m2, n2) if and only if m1 ≤ m2 and n1 ≤ n2 for all m1, m2 ∈ {0, 1}, n1, n2 ∈ N, and (m, n) ≤ ω0, ω1 for all m ∈ {0, 1}, n ∈ N. It is easy to prove that
↓≺(0, n)= {(0, nj) | nj ≤ n} = ⇓(0, n) for all n ∈ N;
↓≺(1, n) = {(0, nj) | nj ≤ n}∪ {(1, 0)}, ⇓(1, n) = {(0, nj) | nj ≤ n} for all
n ∈ N;
↓≺ωi = ↓ωi = ⇓ωi, i = 0, 1.
Hence P is s2-C-continuous, but it is not s2-continuous.

Proposition 3.15 Let P be a s2-C-continuous poset.	Then for any collection
{Fi | i ∈ I} of ﬁnite subsets of P, the following equation holds:


Fδ =

that is,

Since Fi is finite for all i ∈ I, we have ↓Fi is σ2-closed for all i ∈ I by Remark 3.6. Hence by Proposition 3.13, we know that

↓Fi is σ2-closed for all i ∈ I by Remark 3.6, since Fi is finite for all i ∈ I, so there
exists yi ∈ Fi such that u ≤ yi. Let f ∈	i∈I Fi be defined by f (i) = yi for all
i ∈ I. Then u ∈ {f (i) | i ∈ I}L, which implies that ↑u ⊇ {f (i) | i ∈ I}Lu, that is,

(↓≺x)u ⊇  ƒ∈Q

{f (i) | i ∈ I}Lu. Therefore,

The binary relation a2 on P is defined by xa2y for all x, y ∈ P , if for all subsets A ⊆ P with y ∈ Aδ, which implies that x ∈ ↓A. The set {y ∈ P | ya2x} will be denoted ↓ax and {y ∈ P | xa2y} denoted ↑ax.
P is called s2-completely distributive (for short, s2-CD) poset, if for all x ∈ P ,
x = sup ↓ax.
Remark 3.18 (i) ya2x if and only if x ∈/ (P\↑y)δ, for all x, y ∈ P ;
If P is a s2-CD poset which is also a complete lattice, then P is a CD lattice.
Theorem 3.19 Let P be a sup-semilattice. Then the following are equivalent:
P is s2-C-continuous and s2-continuous;
P is s2-CD.
Proof. (2) ⇒ (1) Follows immediately from Definitions 3.1, 3.10, 3.17 and Remark
3.2. For (1) ⇒ (2): Suppose that P is both s2-C-continuous and s2-continuous. Since P is s2-continuous, for each x ∈ P , x = sup{y ∈ P | y  2x}. Now for each y 2x, y = sup{z ∈ P | z≺2y} because P is s2-C-continuous. It follows that
x = sup{z ∈ P | there exists y ∈ P such that z≺2y  2x}.
Next, suppose z≺2y 2x, we shall show that za2x. Let A ⊆ P with x ∈ Aδ. Construct the set D = {sup F | F is a finite subset of A}. Then D is a directed set and x ∈ Aδ = Dδ. Since y  2x, so there is a finite subset F ⊆ A such that y ∈ ↓ sup F = (↓F )δ. Note that the last set ↓F is σ2-closed. So it follows from z≺2y that z ∈ ↓F ⊆ ↓A, this implies that za2x. Hence P is s2-CD.	2
Proposition 3.20 Let P be a poset and S ∈ C(C2(P )). Then  C2(P )S = S S.

Proof. Note that each member of S is a σ2-closed subset of P . So to prove the equation, it suffices to show that
  S ∈ C2(P ).

Obviously  S is a lower subset of P . Now let D be any directed subset of P with D ⊆ S. We want to prove that Dδ ∈ S. Since D = {↓d | d ∈ D} is a directed subset of C (P ). Moreover, D ⊆ S because S is a lower set in C (P ). Since S is a Scott-closed set of C2(P ), we have  C (P )D ∈ S. But  C (P )D is precisely Dδ by
Remark 2.3(i). Hence Dδ ∈ S.	2
Definition 3.21 (i) An element x of a poset P is called C-compact if x≺x. We use KC(P ) to denote the set of all the C-compact elements of P .
(ii) An element x of a poset P is called s2-C-compact if x≺2x. We use KC2(P ) to denote the set of all the s2-C-compact elements of P .
Remark 3.22 If P is a complete lattice, then KC(P )= KC2(P ).
Recall that an element q /= 0 of a poset P is called co-prime if P\↑q is directed in P .
Proposition 3.23 Let P be a poset. If k ∈ KC2(P ), then k is co-prime.
Proof. Assume that k is not co-prime. Then there exist u, v ∈ P\↑k such that
{u, v}u ⊆ ↑k, this implies that k ∈ {u, v}δ. Let S = ↓u ∪ ↓v. Then S ∈ C2(P ) by Remark 2.3(i) and S ⊆ P\↑k with Sδ = {u, v}δ. Since k ∈ KC2(P ), we have k ∈ S implies k ∈ P\↑k, this is a contradiction. Hence k is co-prime.	2
Proposition 3.24 Let P be a poset and S0 ∈ C∗(P ). Then for each x ∈ S0,
↓x ≺ S0 holds in C2(P ).
Proof. Let x ∈ S . Suppose S ∈ C(C (P )) with S ⊆    S. Then by Proposi- tion 3.20, S0 ⊆  S. Hence there exists S ∈S such that x ∈ S. Therefore, ↓x ⊆ S, and thus ↓x ∈ S.	2
Corollary 3.25 Let P be a poset. Then for each x ∈ P, it holds that ↓x ∈
KC(C2(P ))
Proof. Since x ∈ ↓x and ↓x ∈ C∗(P ), so ↓x ≺ ↓x, i.e., ↓x ∈ KC(C2(P )) for all
x ∈ P by Proposition 3.24.	2
Definition 3.26 A poset P is said to be s2-C-prealgebraic if for each x ∈ P ,
x = sup{k ∈ KC2(P ) | k ≤ x}.
A s2-C-prealgebraic poset P is s2-C-algebraic if for any x ∈ P ,
↓{k ∈ KC2(P ) | k ≤ x}∈ C2(P ).
Obviously every s2-C-prealgebraic poset is s2-C-continuous.

Proposition 3.27 For any poset P, the lattice C2(P ) is s2-C-prealgebraic. Hence the lattice C2(P ) is s2-C-continuous, i.e., C2(P ) is C-continuous.
Proof. This follows from Corollary 3.25 and the fact S = C2(P ){↓x | x ∈ S} holds for every S ∈ C2(P ).	2
It is well-known that a poset P is continuous if and only if C(P ) is completely distributive. From Theorem 3.19, we obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 3.28 For any poset P, the following statements are equivalent:
P is a s2-continuous;
C2(P ) is a continuous lattice;
C2(P ) is a completely distributive lattice.
Lemma 3.29 Let P be a poset. Then for any x ∈ P and H ⊆ P, x ∈/ (P\↑H)δ if and only if there exists u ∈ P such that x ∈/ ↓u and ↓u ∪ ↑H = P.
Proof. Suppose x ∈/ (P\↑H)δ. Then (P\↑H)u /= ∅ and there is u ∈ (P\↑H)u such that x ∈/ ↓u, which implies that ↓u ∪ ↑H = P . Conversely, if ↓u ∪ ↑H = P , then (P\↑H)δ ⊆ (↓u)δ = ↓u.	2
Proposition 3.30 A poset P is s2-CD if and only if for any x, y ∈ P with x ¢ y, there exists v ∈ P such that y ∈/ ↑v and x ∈/ (P\↑v)δ.
Proof. Suppose P is s2-CD and x, y ∈ P with x ¢ y. Then there exists v ∈ P such that y ∈/ ↑v and va2x. Thus x ∈/ (P\↑v)δ by Remark 3.18(i).
Conversely, we now need to prove that x = sup ↓ax for all x ∈ P . Suppose there exists x ∈ P such that x /= sup ↓ax, i.e., there is y ∈ (↓ax)u such that x ¢ y. Then there exists v ∈ P such that y ∈/ ↑v and x ∈/ (P\↑v)δ, i.e., va2x. Thus y ∈ ↑v, this is a contradiction.	2
Proposition 3.30 and Lemma 3.29 together imply the following corollary.
Corollary 3.31 A poset P is s2-CD if and only if for any x, y ∈ P with x ¢ y, there exist u, v ∈ P such that x ∈/ ↓u, y ∈/ ↑v and ↓u ∪ ↑v = P. Further, a poset P is s2-CD if and only if so is Pop.
For a poset P , we define x “ y if and only if y ∈ intυ↑x. A poset P is called hypercontinuous if and only if for all x ∈ P , the set ↓“x = {y ∈ P | y “ x} is directed and x = sup ↓“x.
Proposition 3.32 Let P be a poset. The following statements are equivalent:
P is hypercontinuous;
P is s2-continuous in which y 2x if and only if y “ x.
Proof. Suppose P is a hypercontinuous poset and y 2x. Then there exists z ∈ P such that y ≤ z “ x. If y “ x, then x ∈ intυ↑y ⊆ intσ2 ↑y, i.e., y 2x. Hence P is s2-continuous.
Conversely if (2) holds, then “ is approximating since 2 is. Hence P is hyper- continuous.	2

Proposition 3.33 Let P is a hypercontinuous poset. Then for any x, y ∈ P with
x ¢ y, there exist u ∈ P and a ﬁnite subset F of P such that y ∈/ ↑u, x ∈/ ↓F and
↑u ∪ ↓F = P.
Proof. Suppose P is hypercontinuous and x, y ∈ P with x ¢ y. Then there exists u ∈ P such that y ∈/ ↑u and u “ x. Since u “ x if and only if x ∈ intυ↑u, so there is a finite subset F ⊆ P such that x ∈ P\↓F ⊆ ↑u, i.e., x ∈/ ↓F and ↑u ∪ ↓F = P .2
Proposition 3.34 A sup-semilattice P is hypercontinuous if and only if for any x, y ∈ P with x ¢ y, there exist u ∈ P and a ﬁnite subset F of P such that y ∈/ ↑u, x ∈/ ↓F and ↑u ∪ ↓F = P.
Proof. If P is hypercontinuous, it is obvious that for any x, y ∈ L with x ¢ y, there exist u ∈ P and a finite subset F of P such that y ∈/ ↑u, x ∈/ ↓F and ↑u ∪ ↓F = P by Proposition 3.33.
Conversely, for any fixed x ∈ P , if x ≤ y for all y ∈ P , then x is the least element of P , and thus x “ x; If x is not the least element of P , then there exists y ∈ P such that x ¢ y, thus there exist u ∈ P and a finite subset F of P such that y ∈/ ↑u, x ∈/ ↓F and ↑u ∪ ↓F = P , implies x ∈ P\↓F ⊆ ↑u, i.e., u “ x. Hence
↓“x /= ∅ for all x ∈ P . Since P is a sup-semilattice, we have ↓“x is directed for all
x ∈ P .
We now need to prove that x = sup ↓“x for all x ∈ P . Suppose there exists x ∈ P such that x /= sup ↓“x, i.e., there is y ∈ (↓“x)u, such that x ¢ y. Then there exist u ∈ P and a finite subset F of P such that y ∈/ ↑u, x ∈/ ↓F and ↑u ∪ ↓F = P , i.e., x ∈ P\↓F ⊆ ↑u implies u “ x. Thus y ∈ ↑u, this is a contradiction.	2
From Theorem 3.19, Propositions 3.32, 3.34 and Corollary 3.31 we have the following.
Theorem 3.35 Let P be a sup-semilattice. Then
P is s2-CD implies P is hypercontinuous.
P is s2-C-continuous and hypercontinuous if and only if P is s2-CD.
s2-QC-continuous posets
For a set X, we use P(X) to denote the power set of X. We consider the order between subsets G, H of a poset P by G ≤ H if H ⊆ ↑G. This implies that a family F of subsets is directed if the corresponding family {↑F | F ∈ F} is a filter base. Generalizing the way below relation 2 on points of a poset P to the nonempty subsets of P , one obtains the following concept of s2-quasicontinuous poset.
Definition 4.1 [13] Let P be a poset.
The way-below relation  2 on P(P )\{∅} is defined by G  2H for all G, H ⊆ P , if for all directed subsets D ⊆ P with ↑H ∩ Dδ /= ∅, which implies that ↑G ∩ D /= ∅. We write G  2x for G  2{x}. The set {x ∈ P | H  2x} will be denoted ⇑H.
P is called s2-quasicontinuous if for all x ∈ P , the family
Qƒin(x)= {F ⊆ P | F is finite and F  2x}

is a directed family and whenever x ¢ y, there exists a finite subset F ∈ Qƒin(x) with y ∈/ ↑F , i.e., ↑x = {↑F | F ∈ Qƒin(x)}.
P is called s2-quasialgebraic if for all x ∈ P , the family
KQƒin(x)= {F ⊆ P | F is finite, F  2F and x ∈ ↑F }
is a directed family and whenever x ¢ y, there exists F ∈ KQƒin(x) with y ∈/ ↑F , i.e., ↑x = {↑F | F ∈ KQƒin(x)}.
Remark 4.2 Let P be a sup-semilattice. Then F1  2x and F2  2x imply F1 ∨ F2  2x, where F1, F2 are the nonempty finite subsets of P and F1 ∨ F2 = {y1 ∨ y2 | yi ∈ Fi, i = 1, 2}.
Lemma 4.3 [13] Let F be a directed family of nonempty ﬁnite sets in a poset. If
H  2x and  F∈F ↑F ⊆ ↑x, then F ⊆ ↑H for some F ∈ F.
Proposition 4.4 Let P be a poset. If H  2x and if x ∈ Dδ for a directed subset D ∈ P which Qƒin(d) is directed and ↑d = {↑F | F ∈ Qƒin(d)} for all d ∈ D, then H 2d for some element d ∈ D. Further, If P is s2-quasicontinuous, then ⇑H is σ2-open for all H ⊆ P.
Proof. Let F =  {Qƒin(d) | d ∈ D}. Then for any F1, F2 ∈ F, there exist d1, d2 ∈ D such that Fi 2di,i = 1, 2. Since D is directed, so there is d ∈ D such that F1, F2 2d, i.e., F1, F2 ∈ Qƒin(d), which implies that F ⊆ ↑F1 ∩ ↑F2 for some F ∈ Qƒin(d). Thus F is a directed family. Since F∈F ↑F = d∈D ↑d = Du ⊆ ↑x and H 2x, so there exists F ∈F such that F ⊆ ↑H by Lemma 4.3. For F , there is d ∈ D such that F  2d, and thus H  2d.	2
Definition 4.5 [7] Let P be a poset. For any two subsets G and H of P , we write G≺H, if for each nonempty Scott-closed subset S ⊆ P for which sup S exists, sup S ∈ ↑H implies S ∩ ↑G /= ∅. We write G≺x for G≺{x}.
Given a poset P , we now define a new binary relation on P(P ) which is crucial for us to formulate the properties of lattices of σ2-closed sets.
Definition 4.6 Let P be a poset. For any two subsets G and H of P , we write G≺2H, if for each nonempty σ2-closed subset S ⊆ P , Sδ∩↑H /= ∅ implies S∩↑G /= ∅. We write G≺2x for G≺2{x} and y≺2H for {y}≺2H. The set {x ∈ P | H≺2x} will be denoted ↑≺H.
Remark 4.7 (i) If P is a poset, then G≺2H implies G ≺ H for all G, H ⊆ P .
(ii) If P is a complete lattice, then G≺2H is equal to G ≺ H for all G, H ⊆ P .
The next proposition is basic and the proof is omitted.
Proposition 4.8 Let P be a poset and E, F, G, H ⊆ P. Then the following state- ments hold:
G≺2H implies G ≤ H;
G≺2H if and only if G≺2h for all h ∈ H;
E ≤ G≺2H ≤ F implies E≺2F;

{x}≺2{y} if and only if x≺2y;
if P has a smallest element 0, then 0≺2H always holds.
Definition 4.9 Let P be a poset.
P is called s2-quasi-C-continuous (for short, s2-QC-continuous), if for all x ∈ P ,
↑x =  {↑F | F ∈ Cƒin(x)},

where Cƒin(x)= {F ⊆ P | F is finite and F≺2x};
P is called s2-quasi-C-prealgebraic (for short, s2-QC-prealgebraic), if for all
x ∈ P ,
↑x =  {↑F | F ∈ KCƒin(x)},
where KCƒin(x)= {F ⊆ P | F is finite, F≺2F and x ∈ ↑F }.
Proposition 4.10 Every s2-C-continuous (resp., s2-C-prealgebraic) poset is a s2- QC-continuous (resp., s2-QC-prealgebraic) poset.
Proof. Suppose P is a s2-C-continuous poset and x ∈ P . Then {{y}⊆ P | y≺2x}⊆ 
C	(x) and	{↑y | y≺ x} = ↑x.	Therefore, ↑x ⊆	{↑F | F ∈ C	(x)} ⊆
{↑y | y≺2x} = ↑x. Hence P is s2-QC-continuous. The s2-C-prealgebraic case can be similarly proved.	2
Definition 4.11 Let P be a poset.
The binary relation a2 on P(P ) is defined by Ga2H for all G, H ⊆ P , if for all subsets A ⊆ P with Aδ ∩ ↑H /= ∅, which implies that ↑G ∩ A /= ∅. We write Ga2x for Ga2{x} and ya2H for {y}a2H. The set {x ∈ P | Ha2x} will be denoted ↑aH.
P is called s2-generalized completely distributive (for short, s2-GCD), if for all
x ∈ P ,
↑x =  {↑F | F ∈ Gƒin(x)},
where Gƒin(x)= {F ⊆ P | F is finite and Fa2x};
P is called s2-strongly pseudoalgebraic (for short, s2-SPA), if for all x ∈ P ,
↑x =  {↑F | F ∈ KGƒin(x)},
where KGƒin(x)= {F ⊆ P | F is finite, Fa2F and x ∈ ↑F }.
Remark 4.12 (i) Ga2H if and only if ↑H ∩ (P\↑G)δ = ∅, for all G, H ⊆ P ;
If P is a s2-GCD poset which is also a complete lattice, then P is a GCD lattice ([11]).
Theorem 4.13 Let P be a sup-semilattice. Then the following are equivalent:
P is s2-QC-continuous and s2-quasicontinuous;
P is s2-GCD.
Proof. (2) ⇒ (1) follows immediately from Definitions 4.1, 4.9, 4.11 and Re- mark 4.2. For (1) ⇒ (2): Suppose that P is both s2-QC-continuous and s2- quasicontinuous. Since P is s2-quasicontinuous, for each x ∈ P , ↑x =  {↑F | F ∈

Qƒin(x)}. Now for each F ∈ Qƒin(x),
↑F =  x∈F  {↑Ex | Ex ∈ Cƒin(x)} =  {↑(  x∈F Ex) | Ex ∈ Cƒin(x) and x ∈ F}
because P is s2-QC-continuous. By Proposition 4.8, we have {  x∈F Ex | Ex ∈
Cƒin(x) and x  ∈ F} ⊆ {E | E is finit and E≺2F}.	Therefore, ↑F =
{↑E | E is finit and E≺2F}. It follows that
↑x =  {↑E | there exists F ∈ Qƒin(x) such that E≺2F  2x}.
Next, suppose E≺2F 2x, we shall show that Ea2x. Let A ⊆ P with x ∈ Aδ. Construct the set D = {sup G | G is a finite subset of A}. Then D is a directed set and x ∈ Aδ = Dδ. Since F 2x, so there is a finite subset G ⊆ A such that sup G ⊆ ↑F , i.e., (↓G)δ ∩ ↑F /= ∅. Note that the last set ↓G is σ2-closed. So it follows from E≺2F that ↑E ∩ ↓G /= ∅, i.e., ↑E ∩ A ⊇ ↑E ∩ G /= ∅, this implies that Ea2x. Hence P is s2-GCD.	2
For the algebraic case, similarly, we have the following statements:
Theorem 4.14 Let P be a sup-semilattice. Then the following are equivalent:
P is s2-QC-prealgebraic and s2-quasialgebraic;
P is s2-SPA.
Proposition 4.15 A poset P is s2-GCD if and only if for any x, y ∈ P with x ¢ y, there exists a ﬁnite subset F of P such that y ∈/ ↑F and x ∈/ (P\↑F )δ.
Proof. Suppose P is s2-GCD and x, y ∈ P with x ¢ y. Then there exists a finite subset F ⊆ P such that y ∈/ ↑F and F a2x. Thus x ∈/ (P\↑F )δ by Remark 4.12(i).
Conversely, for any fixed x ∈ P , if x ≤ y for all y ∈ P , then x is the least element of P , and thus {x} ∈ Gƒin(x); If x is not the least element of P , then there exists y ∈ P such that x ¢ y, thus there exists a finite subset F of P such that y ∈/ ↑F and x ∈/ (P\↑F )δ, implies F ∈ Gƒin(x) by Remark 4.12(i). Hence Gƒin(x) /= ∅ for all x ∈ P .
We now need to prove that ↑x = {↑F | F ∈ G (x)} for all x ∈ P . Suppose there exists x ∈ P such that ↑x /=  {↑F | F ∈ G  (x)}, i.e., there exists y ∈
{↑F | F ∈ Gƒin(x)}, such that x ¢ y. Then there exists a finite subset F of P such that y ∈/ ↑F and x ∈/ (P\↑F )δ, i.e., F ∈ Gƒin(x) by Remark 4.12(i). Thus y ∈ ↑F , this is a contradiction.	2
Proposition 4.15 and Lemma 3.29 together imply the following corollary.
Corollary 4.16 A poset P is s2-GCD if and only if for any x, y ∈ P with x ¢ y, there exist u ∈ P and a ﬁnite subset F of P such that x ∈/ ↓u, y ∈/ ↑F and ↓u∪ ↑F = P.
From Proposition 3.34 and Corollary 4.16 we have the following.
Corollary 4.17 A semi-lattice P is s2-GCD if and only if Pop is hypercontinuous.

It is easy to see that for a finite poset P , Pop is hypercontnious, hence by Corollary 4.17, P is s2-GCD, especially P is a s2-QC-continuous poset by Definitions
4.9 and 4.11. By this observation, we have
Corollary 4.18 Every ﬁnite poset is a s2-QC-continuous poset.
Observe that a s2-QC-continuous poset is generally not actually a s2-C- continuous poset.
Example 4.19 Consider the poset P = {a, b, x, y, z}, where the order is defined by x, z ≤ a, b and y ≤ x. Since P is a finite poset, so P is s2-QC-continuous by Corollary 4.18. Let S1 = ↓x and S2 = ↓y ∪ ↓z. Then S1 and S2 are σ2-closed by Remark 2.3(i), and
(S1 ∩ S2)δ = (↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z))δ = (↓y)δ = ↓y,


as well as
Sδ ∩ Sδ = (↓x)δ ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z)δ = ↓x ∩ (↓x ∪ ↓z)= ↓x.

1	2
Thus (S1 ∩ S2)δ /= Sδ ∩ Sδ, hence P is not s2-C-continuous by Proposition 3.13.

y

For a poset P , a binary relation “ on the set of all subsets of P is defined as follows: G “ H if and only if H ⊆ intυ↑G. We write G “ x for G “ {x} and y “ H for {y} “ H. Note that x “ y is unambiguously defined. A poset P is called quasi-hypercontinuous if for each x ∈ P the family
Hƒin(x)= {F ⊆ P | F is finite and F “ x}
is a directed family and whenever x ¢ y, then there exists a finite subset F ∈ Hƒin(x) with y ∈/ ↑F , i.e., ↑x = ∩{↑F | F ∈ Hƒin(x)}.
Proposition 4.20 Let P be a poset. The following statements are equivalent:
P is quasi-hypercontinuous;
P is s2-quasicontinuous in which H 2x implies H “ x.
Proof. Suppose P is a quasi-hypercontinuous poset and H  2x. Then there exists a finite subset F ∈ P such that H ≤ F “ x. If H “ x, then x ∈ intυ↑H ⊆ intσ2 ↑H, i.e., H 2x. Hence P is s2-quasicontinuous.
Conversely if (2) holds, then “ is approximating since  2 is. Hence P is hyper- continuous.	2
Proposition 4.21 Let P is a quasi-hypercontinuous poset. Then for any x, y ∈ P
with x ¢ y, there exist ﬁnite subsets F1, F2 of P such that y ∈/ ↑F1,x ∈/ ↓F2 and
↑F1 ∪ ↓F2 = P.

Proof. Suppose P is quasi-hypercontinuous and x, y ∈ P with x ¢ y. Then there exists a finite subset F1 ⊆ P such that y ∈/ ↑F1 and F1 “ x. Since F1 “ x if and only if x ∈ intυ↑F1, so there is a finite subset F2 ⊆ P such that x ∈ P\↓F2 ⊆ ↑F1, i.e., x ∈/ ↓F2 and ↑F1 ∪ ↓F2 = P .	2

Proposition 4.22 A sup-semilattice P is quasi-hypercontinuous if and only if for any x, y ∈ P with x ¢ y, there exist ﬁnite subsets F1, F2 of P such that y ∈/ ↑F1, x ∈/ ↓F2 and ↑F1 ∪ ↓F2 = P.
Proof. Suppose that P is quasi-hypercontinuous. It is obvious that for any x, y ∈ P
with x ¢ y, there exist finite subsets F1, F2 of P such that y ∈/ ↑F1, x ∈/ ↓F2 and
↑F1 ∪ ↓F2 = P by Proposition 4.21.
Conversely, for any fixed x ∈ P , if x ≤ y for all y ∈ P , then x is the least element of P , and thus {x} ∈ Hƒin(x); If x is not the least element of P , then there exists y ∈ P such that x ¢ y, thus there exist finite subsets F1, F2 of P

such that y ∈/
↑F1,x ∈/
↓F2 and ↑F1 ∪ ↓F2 = P , implies x ∈ P\↓F2 ⊆ ↑F1, i.e.,

F1 ∈ Hƒin(x). Hence Hƒin(x) /= ∅ for all x ∈ P . Since P is a sup-semilattice, we have {↑F | F ∈ Hƒin(x)} is filtered for all x ∈ P .
We now need to prove that ↑x =  {↑F | F ∈ H  (x)} for all x ∈ P . Sup- pose there exists x ∈ P such that ↑x /=  {↑F | F ∈ H  (x)}, i.e., there is y ∈  {↑F | F ∈ Hƒin(x)}, such that x ¢ y. Then there exist finite subsets F1,
implies F1 ∈ Hƒin(x). Thus y ∈ ↑F1, this is a contradiction.	2

From Theorem 4.13, Propositions 4.20, 4.22 and Corollary 4.16 we have the following.
Theorem 4.23 Let P be a sup-semilattice. Then
P is s2-GCD implies P is quasi-hypercontinuous.
P is s2-QC-continuous and quasi-hypercontinuous if and only if P is s2-GCD.
Lemma 4.24 [13]A poset P is s2-quasicontinuous if and only if the lattice σ2(P )
of all σ2-open sets is hypercontinuous.
So, in view of Corollary 4.17 and Remark 4.12(ii), a poset P is s2-quasicontinuous if and only if C2(P ) is a GCD lattice.
Theorem 4.25 For any poset P, the following statements are equivalent:
P is a s2-quasicontinuous poset;
σ2(P ) is a hypercontinuous lattice;
C2(P ) is a GCD lattice;
C2(P ) is a quasicontinuous lattice.
Proof: (1) ⇔ (2) By Lemma 4.24. (2) ⇔ (3) By Remark 4.12(ii) and Corollary
4.17. (3) ⇔ (4) By Propositions 3.27, 4.10, 4.15 and Remark 4.12(ii). 2

s2-MC-continuous posets
We first give a definition of the σ2-C-set of a poset P , and then introduce the notion of s2-meet-C-continuous (for short, s2-MC-continuous) poset by the σ2-C-set.
Definition 5.1 Let P be a poset. A subset A ⊆ P is called σ2-C-set if it satisfies:
A = ↓A;
S ⊆ A implies Sδ ⊆ A for all S ∈ C∗(P ).
The collection of all σ2-C-sets of P will be denoted by SC2(P ) and let SO2(P )= 
{U ⊆ P | P\U ∈ SC2(P )}.
Proposition 5.2 Let P be a poset. Then the following statements hold:
L, ∅∈ SC2(P );
↓x ∈ SC2(P ) for all x ∈ P;
For any the family {Ai | i ∈ I}⊆ SC2(P ),	i∈I Ai ∈ SC2(P );
Aδ ∈ SC2(P ) for all A ⊆ P;
U ∈ SO2(P ) if and only if U = ↑U and Sδ ∩ U /= ∅ implies S ∩ U /= ∅ for all
S ∈ C∗(P ).
Proof. This follows immediately from Definition 5.1 and Lemma 2.1.	2
Remark 5.3 For a poset P and A1, A2 ∈ SC2(P ), in general A1 ∪ A2 ∈ SC2(P ) does not hold. Thus the dual SO2(P ) of SC2(P ) cannot compose a topology on P . But SO2(P ) can compose a semi-topology of P by Proposition 5.2.
Definition 5.4 A poset P is s2-meet-C-continuous (for short, s2-MC-continuous), if for any x ∈ P and any S ∈ C∗(P ) with x ∈ Sδ, then x ∈  {A ∈ SC2(P ) | ↓x∩S ⊆
A}.
Proposition 5.5 If a poset P is s2-C-continuous, then it is also s2-MC-continuous.
Proof. Suppose that P is a s2-C-continuous poset. Then for any x ∈ P and S ∈ C∗(P ) with x ∈ Sδ, we know that ↓≺x ⊆ S∩↓x. Therefore, for any A ∈ SC2(P ) with ↓x ∩ S ⊆ A, we have ↓≺x ⊆ A. Hence by Corollary 3.9 and Definition 5.1, we have x ∈ (↓≺x)δ ⊆ A. Thus x ∈  {A ∈ SC2(P ) | ↓x ∩ S ⊆ A}, that is, P is s2-MC-continuous.	2
Proposition 5.6 Let P be a s2-MC-continuous poset. Then for any x, y, z ∈ P, the following equation hold:
(↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z))δ = ↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z)δ.
Proof. Since ↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z) ⊆ ↓y ∪ ↓z and ↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z) ⊆ ↓x, we know that
(↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z))δ ⊆ ↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z)δ,
by Lemma 2.1. Conversely, for any u ∈ ↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z)δ, we know that ↓u ⊆ ↓x and
u ∈ (↓y ∪ ↓z)δ. Thus ↓u ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z) ⊆ ↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z) ⊆ (↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z))δ. Since
↓y ∪ ↓z ∈ C∗(P ) and (↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z))δ ∈ SC2(P ), so u ∈ (↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z))δ.	2

Corollary 5.7 Let P be a s2-MC-continuous poset. If P is also a lattice, then P
is a distributive lattice.
Proof. For any x, y, z ∈ P ,

↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z)= (↓x ∩ ↓y) ∪ (↓x ∩ ↓z)= ↓(x ∧ y) ∪ ↓(x ∧ z).
Thus (↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z))δ = ↓((x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z)) by Lemma 2.1(5). Since ↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z)δ = ↓(x ∧ (y ∨ z)) by Lemma 2.1(5), and (↓x ∩ (↓y ∪ ↓z))δ = ↓x∩(↓y ∪ ↓z)δ by Proposition 5.6, we know that ↓((x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z)) = ↓(x ∧ (y ∨ z)), that is, ((x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z)) = (x ∧ (y ∨ z)).	2
Theorem 5.8 A poset P is s2-MC-continuous if and only if for any U ∈ SO2(P )
and any x ∈ P, ↑(U ∩ ↓x) ∈ SO2(P ).
Proof. Suppose that P is a s2-MC-continuous poset, x ∈ P and U ∈ SO2(P ) with Sδ ∩ ↑(U ∩ ↓x) /= ∅ for some S ∈ C∗(P ). Then there exists z ∈ U ∩ ↓x such that z ∈ Sδ. Assume that S ∩ ↓z ∩ U = ∅. Then S ∩ ↓z ⊆ P\U ∈ SC2(P ). Since P is s2-MC-continuous, so z ∈ P\U , this is a contradiction. Thus S ∩ ↓z ∩ U /= ∅, which implies that S ∩ ↑(U ∩ ↓x) ⊇ S ∩ ↑(U ∩ ↓z) /= ∅. Therefore, ↑(U ∩ ↓x) ∈ SO2(P ).
Conversely, assume that there exist x ∈ P, S ∈ C∗(P ) with x ∈ Sδ and A ∈ SC2(P ) with ↓x ∩ S ⊆ A such that x ∈/ A. Then x ∈ P\A = U ∈ SO2(P ), and thus x ∈ Sδ ∩ U ∩ ↓x implies Sδ ∩ ↑(U ∩ ↓x) /= ∅. Since ↑(U ∩ ↓x) ∈ SO2(P ), so S ∩ ↑(U ∩ ↓x) /= ∅ implies S ∩ U ∩ ↓x /= ∅, this is a contradiction. Therefore, for any x ∈ P and any S ∈ C∗(P ) with x ∈ Sδ, x ∈  {A ∈ SC2(P ) | ↓x ∩ S ⊆ A}, that is, P is s2-MC-continuous.	2
Corollary 5.9 A poset P is s2-MC-continuous if and only if for any U ∈ SO2(P )
and any nonempty subset A ⊆ P, ↑(U ∩ ↓A) ∈ SO2(P ).
Proof. This follows immediately from Theorem 5.8.	2
Theorem 5.10 For any poset P, the following statements are equivalent:
P is a s2-MC-continuous poset;
↓x ∩ Sδ = (↓x ∩ S)δ for all x ∈ P and S ∈ C∗(P );
Sδ ∩ Sδ = (S1 ∩ S2)δ for all S1, S2 ∈ C∗(P );
1	2	2
x ∈ Sδ implies x = sup(↓x ∩ S) for all x ∈ P and S ∈ C∗(P ).
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) Since ↓x ∩ S ⊆ S and ↓x ∩ S ⊆ ↓x, we know that (↓x ∩ S)δ ⊆
↓x ∩ Sδ, by Lemma 2.1. Conversely, for any u ∈ ↓x ∩ Sδ, we have ↓u ⊆ ↓x and
u ∈ Sδ. Thus ↓u∩S ⊆ ↓x∩S ⊆ (↓x∩S)δ. Since S ∈ C∗(P ) and (↓x∩S)δ ∈ SC2(P ),
so u ∈ (↓x ∩ S)δ. Hence ↓x ∩ Sδ = (↓x ∩ S)δ.
⇔ (3) Suppose (3) holds. Then (2) is also holds, because ↓x ∈ C∗(P ) and
(↓x)δ = ↓x for all x ∈ P . Suppose (2) holds. Then

(2) ⇒ (4) For any x ∈ P and S ∈ C∗(P ) with x ∈ Sδ, by (2), we have ↓x =
↓x ∩ Sδ = (↓x ∩ S)δ. Thus x = sup(↓x ∩ S).
(4) ⇒ (1) For any x ∈ P, S ∈ C∗(P ) with x ∈ Sδ, by Lemma 3.12 we have
↓x ∩ S ∈ C∗(P ) because ↓x = (↓x ∩ S)δ /= ∅. Thus for every A ∈ SC2(P ) with
↓x ∩ S ⊆ A, we know that x ∈ (↓x ∩ S)δ ⊆ A. Hence P is s2-MC-continuous. 2
Lemma 5.11 Let P be a s2-MC-continuous poset, x ∈ P and F ⊆ P ﬁnite. Then
F≺2x if and only if there exists y ∈ F such that y≺2x.
Proof: Suppose F≺2x. Assume that x ∈/	y∈F ↑≺y. Then by Definition 3.5, we know that for each y ∈ F , there exists Sy ∈ C∗(P ) such that x ∈ Sδ and y ∈/ Sy.
y
Let S =	Sy. Then x ∈	Sδ = Sδ by Theorem 5.10, and S ∈ C∗(P ) by
Lemma 3.12. Since F≺2x, so ↑F ∩ S /= ∅. Thus there exists y0 ∈ F such that
y0 ∈ S ⊆ Sy0 , this is a contradiction. Therefore, there exists y ∈ F such that y≺2x.
Conversely, if there exists y ∈ F such that y≺2x, then for any S ∈ C∗(P ) with
x ∈ Sδ, y ∈ S, which implies that ↑F ∩ S /= ∅. Thus F≺2x.	2
Theorem 5.12 Let P be a poset. Then P is s2-C-continuous if and only if P is both s2-MC-continuous and s2-QC-continuous.
Proof. Suppose that P is s2-C-continuous. Then P is both s2-MC-continuous and
s2-QC-continuous by Propositions 4.10 and 5.5.
Suppose that P is both s2-MC-continuous and s2-QC-continuous. Assume that there exist x ∈ P and z ∈ (↓≺x)u such that x ¢ z. Since P is s2-QC-continuous,
so there exists a finite subset F of P such that F≺2x and z ∈/ ↑F . By Lemma
5.1, there exists y ∈ F such that y≺2x, because P is s2-MC-continuous. Therefore y ≤ z, this is a contradiction. Hence x = sup ↓≺x since x ∈ (↓≺x)u for all x ∈ P , i.e., P is s2-C-continuous.	2
