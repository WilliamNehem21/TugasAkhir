Interval parameter Weight vector Neighborhood adjustment
Interval multi-objective optimization problems (IMOPs) are one of the most critical optimization problems in practical applications. However, compared to deterministic multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), there are few researchs addressing IMOP. In addition, the uncertainty contained in the problem makes the distribution of the population more challenging. Therefore, this paper proposed a decomposition-based interval multi- objective evolutionary algorithm with adaptive adjustment of weight vectors and neighborhoods (IMOEA/D- AWN). Firstly, an interval sparsity level function (ISL) is constructed to measure the density of individuals, and a comprehensive ranking of interval sparsity ranking and interval uncertainty ranking is proposed. For the purpose of improving the distribution of the population while reducing its uncertainty, based on the above comprehensive ranking, a new adaptive adjustment weight vector strategy guided by interval elite population is designed. Besides, an adaptive adjustment neighborhoods strategy is designed. This strategy adjusts individuals’ neighborhood size according to the number of iterations to improve the eﬃciency of evolution. Finally, the IMOEA/D-AWN is evaluated on 17 interval benchmark test problems and a collaborative computation oﬄoading optimization problem, and compared with four advanced multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with interval parameters (IMOEAs). Experimental results show that this algorithm performs well in convergence, diversity, and uncertainty.





Introduction

In real-world applications, there exist various optimization problems with multiple conflicting objectives [1–3], which are known as MOPs [4–6]. Unlike single objective optimization problems, the purpose of solving MOPs is to find a set of optimal solutions which form its Pareto Front in the objective space [7–9]. Multi-objective evolutionary algo- rithms (MOEAs) can effectively solve MOPs [10–12], which are divided into three main categories: Based on Pareto [13], decomposition-based [14], and indicator-based [15]. Among them, MOEA/D is the classic decomposition-based algorithm, which decomposes MOPs into multi- ple single-objective subproblems through a uniformly distributed set of weight vectors and optimizes these subproblems collaboratively. At present, there are various improved MOEA/D algorithms that can solve MOPs well [16]. However, in real production, the parameters of the ob- jective function are usually uncertain due to various factors. Uncertain parameters can be represented as fuzzy numbers, random variables, in- tervals, etc. However, the membership function of fuzzy numbers and the distribution function of random variables are diﬃcult to obtain in
advance, while the interval information of uncertain parameters is eas- ier to obtain [17]. Moreover, fuzzy numbers and random variables can be transformed to interval numbers by confidence level and cut set [18], respectively, and the interval numbers have a clear operation criterion. Therefore, IMOPs are receiving increasing attention from researchers in various fields.
Currently, there are two main approaches to solve IMOPs through evolutionary algorithms (EAs). The first method mainly transforms IMOPs into deterministic MOPs using information such as the mid- point, width, and endpoints of the interval, and solves the transformed problem using MOEAs. Zhang et al. [19] transformed IMOPs into deter- ministic MOPs by using the midpoint and width of the interval values as new objective functions. Fu et al. [20] considered the radius and midpoint of the initial objective functions as two objectives of equal im- portance and solved them using MOEA. Liu et al. [21] used nonlinear interval number programming to convert each objective function con- taining uncertain information to a deterministic single-objective prob- lem, and solved the nested optimization problems using two genetic algorithms. Li et al. [22] established the interval multi-objective opti-

mal dispatch of microgrid (MODMG) model to meet the requirements of economy, security of microgrid and power quality, and transformed the interval MODMG into MOPs by simultaneously optimizing the mid- point of each interval objective function. Guo et al. [23] designed a knowledge-induced MOEA/D to solve IMOPs by using the midpoint of the interval value as the objective. Recently, He et al. [24] used the mid- point of the interval as the objective value and reacted the robustness of the solution with the length of the interval. And designed Knee-based and Interval-based MOEA to solve portfolio optimization problem. Al- though the above approaches are simple and easy to implement, they can lead to the loss of interval information, resulting in some differences between the transformed problem and the original problem. Moreover, different transformation methods will produce different MOPs, and the final solution obtained can hardly reflect the uncertainty of the prob- lem.
The second approach designs IMOEAs by defining interval Pareto dominance relation for the direct solving of IMOPs. This method can avoid losing uncertain information and obtain more accurate solutions. Therefore, this paper mainly focuses on the second approach. Limbourg et al. [25] first defined interval Pareto dominance relation (IPDR) based
on interval order relation ≻𝐼𝑃 , and calculated interval crowding dis-
tance (ICD) by defining the degree of contribution of individuals to the
hypervolume using interval upper and lower limits, but this approach has high computational complexity. Jiang et al. [26] defined the in- terval probability dominance relationship, subdivided the positions of two intervals into six cases, and provided specific calculations for each. Gong et al. [17] proposed an IPDR using the interval confidence level, and defined an ICD using the midpoint and volume of each interval, and overlap between the two intervals, proposing the II-MOEA algo- rithm. On this basis, Sun et al. [27] designed interval Pareto dominance relationship based possibility degree lower bound through confidence
threshold parameter 𝛾 . The algorithm can obtain different Pareto fron-
tiers by adjusting the value of 𝛾 , which has greater flexibility. Gong et
al. [28] developed the theory of preference polyhedron for the IMOP
and based on this, they designed the sorting of individuals. Zhang et al.
[29] analyzed the features of 𝜇 [30] and P [31] in sorting intervals and
proposed an integrated sorting assistance NSGA-II for IMOPs. Zhang
et al. [32] chose interval confidence as the interval ranking method and proposed interval cooperative multiobjective artificial bee colony algorithm. Sun et al. [18] proposed the IMOMA-II by integrating the lo- cal search into the existing IMOEA. The fitness function of individuals is calculated using the contribution of individuals to the hypervolume and the uncertainty of individuals in the local search stage, so that the individuals with excellent convergence, diversity and uncertainty are more likely to enter the next generation population. Liu et al. [33] defined a new interval crowding distance by the ratio of the distance between two intervals on a certain objective and the distance between the maximum and minimum intervals on this objective, and modified the interval confidence dominance method to compare each individual
the DI-𝜇MOGA algorithm. Yi et al. [34] used parallel cell entropy to in the external elite population and evolution population, and proposed
subdivide the evolutionary state to three stages, and designed different interval dominance relationships for the different stages, in addition to interval crowding distances that take into account the shape of the in- tervals.
In recent years, Sun et al. [35] proposed adaptive interval confi- dence and developed a probabilistic wind power interval prediction model. Xu et al. [36] proposed a hybrid search IMOEA that includes modified gray wolf optimization and pattern search. Zhang et al. [37] modified the calculation of interval distance in interval confidence level and proposed the InMaOEA. Chen et al. [38] proposed a modified IPDR, and ICD calculation with respect to the mixture of real values and intervals, and proposed the interval multi-objective particle swarm op- timization algorithm. Xu et al. [39] designed an angle-based ICD (ICA), providing a new way to calculate ICD. They also defined interval knee point to help decision-makers make decisions, and proposed an inter-
val elite selection strategy to generate better performance offspring. However, this algorithm is for bi-objective optimization problems only, corresponding ICA still needs to be designed when solving tri-objective optimization problems. The above algorithms all use the framework of Pareto-based IMOEAs. However, for the most IMOPs, particularly for over-concave, over-convex or discontinuous Pareto Fronts (PFs), it is hard for the above algorithms to produce the well distributed irregular PFs due to the lack of a diversity maintained mechanism for irregu- lar PFs. To solve the above problems, Gan et al. [40] proposed a new IMOEA within the framework of MOEA/D, which explored a new way of solving IMOPs. They integrate various interval Pareto dominance relationships and propose an integrated comparison strategy. Besides, an adaptive reference vectors adjustment strategy was proposed using interval crowding distance, which significantly improves the computa- tional eﬃciency, and the convergence and diversity of the population. However, the uncertain information introduced brings more challenges to the distribution of the population, and the uncertainty of the inter- val conflicts with diversity and convergence, so the algorithm does not significantly reduce the uncertainty of the population.
Currently, a large number of studies have focused on interval Pareto
dominance relations, in contrast to few studies that have considered designing interval diversity maintenance strategies [39,41]. However, the uncertainty negatively affects population diversity [40], and, for most IMOPs, especially for problems with irregular PFs, it is diﬃcult to generate optimal solution sets that are uniformly distributed on the true PFs because the majority of present IMOEAs lack diversity mainte- nance methods designed for irregular PFs. IMOEA/D [40] significantly improved the diversity of the population, however, it did not signif- icantly reduce the uncertainty of the population as the uncertainty conflicted with the diversity and convergence. Thus, to better balance the three performances of IMOEA, i.e., to improve diversity and con- vergence while reducing population uncertainty, this paper proposes a decomposition-based IMOEA with adaptive adjustment of weight vec- tors and neighborhoods (IMOEA/D-AWN). In order to increase diversity while reducing population uncertainty, we introduced uncertainty in- formation when adjusting the weight vectors, and designed an adaptive weight vector adjustment strategy based on the dual ranking of inter- val sparsity ranking and interval uncertainty ranking. In addition, in order to ensure that the population converges to the true PFs, an ex- ternal archive is constructed, denoted as the interval elite population (IEP), which stores the interval Pareto non-dominant individuals. And IEP is merged with the current population prior to each adjustment of the weight vectors, picking the most appropriate solution for each of the weight vectors in order to update the current population, which indi- rectly guides the updating of the weight vectors. Furthermore, since the objective values of IMOPs are interval values rather than exact values, comparing the size of the interval values and deriving inter- val non-dominated solutions increases the computational cost, and in decomposition-based IMOEAs, a fixed-size neighborhood produces the computational resources [42]. Based on the above reasons, we design an adaptive neighborhood adjustment strategy to improve evolutionary eﬃciency.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

To improve the population distribution and reduce uncertainty, a dual-ranking adaptive weight vector adjustment strategy based on interval sparsity ranking and interval uncertainty ranking is pro- posed. The weights of the rankings are also discussed in detail. In addition, to ensure population convergence on the true PF, an IEP is established to update the contemporary population before adjust- ing the weight vector.
In order to improve the evolutionary eﬃciency and avoid wast- ing computational resources, an adaptive neighborhood adjustment strategy is proposed. In the early stage of evolution, individuals have large neighborhoods to accelerate global search. As the evo- lution progresses, the neighborhood size gradually decreases to


ensure local search. Reduced runtime with guaranteed algorithm performance.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 in- troduces some relevant definitions. Section 3 elaborates the adaptive weight vectors adjustment strategy, the adaptive neighborhoods adjust- ment strategy, and the framework of the proposed algorithm. Experi- mental results and analysis are presented in Section 5. Finally, the main conclusions and future works of this paper are presented.

Preliminaries

Generally, a minimization IMOP is described as [33]: min 𝑓 (𝑥, 𝑐)= (𝑓1(𝑥, 𝑐), 𝑓2(𝑥, 𝑐), ..., 𝑓𝑀 (𝑥, 𝑐))
𝑠.𝑡.  𝑥 = [𝑥1, 𝑥2, ..., 𝑥𝑑 ]∈ 𝑆⊆ 𝑅𝑛,

component of an IMOP, and c is a vector with K parameters and its

Definition 5. Interval distance [43]: The interval distance between two intervals is calculated as [43]:
𝐷(𝐴, 𝐵)= √[𝑀 (𝐴)− 𝑀 (𝐵)]2 + 1 [𝑤2(𝐴)+ 𝑤2(𝐵)] − 2 [𝑤(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵)]2	(6)

Definitions of interval

Definition 1. Interval [34]: One interval can be expressed as A = [𝐴, 𝐴], where 𝐴 < 𝐴 ∈ R. 𝐴 and 𝐴 are the lower limit and the upper limit,
interval      when       𝐴     =     𝐴. respectively. In particular, A can regress to a point and called a point

Definition 2. Interval Arithmetic Operations [40]: For two intervals A
and B
𝐴 + 𝐵 = [𝐴 + 𝐵, 𝐴 + 𝐵], 𝐴 − 𝐵 = [𝐴 − 𝐵, 𝐴 − 𝐵],
𝛾𝐴 = [𝛾𝐴, 𝛾𝐴], 𝛾 > 0; 𝛾𝐴 = [𝛾𝐴, 𝛾𝐴], 𝛾 < 0.	(2)

Definition 3. Interval confidence level [17]: For two intervals A and
B, their minimum interval is expressed as K = [𝐾, 𝐾], where 𝐾 =
𝑚𝑖𝑛{𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐴, 𝐵} and 𝐾 = 𝑚𝑖𝑛{{𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐴, 𝐵}∖𝐾}}, respectively. The inter-
val confidence level of A min than B is defined as [17]:
where 𝑀 (𝐴) = (𝐴 + 𝐴)∕2 is the midpoint of the interval, 𝑤(𝐴) = (𝐴 − 𝐴)∕2
is the width of the interval A. 𝑤(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) is the intersection of the interval
A and B. This definition integrates the deviation of each point in the
number of two intervals and the relationship between the positions of the interval numbers.

Interval-valued Chebyshev scalar function

IMOEA/D decomposes the IMOP into multiple subproblems and then co-optimizes the solutions of these subproblems to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions of the IMOP [40].
As the red rectangle in Fig. 1 shows, each individual is a hypercube in objective space since the value of the function for each objective in IMOPs is an interval value. The blue curve in this figure is PF, and the blue rectangle at the bottom left is the reference hypercube, it consists of the minimum upper limit and minimum lower limit val-
ues of each objective in the population, as 𝑍 = ([𝑍1 , 𝑍1], [𝑍2, 𝑍2]) in
Fig. 1, where 𝑍 = (𝑍1, 𝑍2) is the lower reference point and 𝑍 = (𝑍1, 𝑍2)
is the upper reference point. Therefore, for the IMOPs, the reference

𝑃 (𝐴 ≤ 𝐵)= 	𝑑(𝐵, 𝐾)	
𝑑(𝐴, 𝐾)+ 𝑑(𝐵, 𝐾)
where 𝑑(𝐵, 𝐾) is the distance between B and K, calculated as [17]:
√ (𝐵 − 𝐾)2 + (𝐵 − 𝐾)2

hypercube is 𝑍 = ([𝑍1, 𝑍1], .., [𝑍𝑀 , 𝑍𝑀 ]), where 𝑍𝑘 = min𝑓𝑘(x, 𝑐), 𝑍𝑘 =
min𝑓𝑘(x, 𝑐), 𝑘 = 1, 2, ...𝑀 . The minimization Interval-valued Tchebycheff
Scalar Function is defined as [40]:
𝑔𝑖𝑡𝑐(x|𝑤, 𝑍)= 𝑚𝑎𝑥 {𝑤𝑘(𝑓𝑘(x, 𝑐)− 𝑍𝑘)}	(7)

The calculation of 𝑑(𝐴, 𝐾) is similar to Equation (4).
Definition 4. IPDR based on the lower limit of possibility degree 𝛾 [27]:
𝛾 ∈ [0.5, 1] is the threshold, if 𝑃 (𝐴 ≤ 𝐵) ≥ 𝛾 , the probability that 𝐴 is less than or equal to 𝐵 can be considered to be no less than 𝛾 . For two solutions 𝑥𝑖 and 𝑥𝑗 , on any 𝑘-th objective, 𝑘, 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑀 , we can say that the 𝑥𝑖 interval dominates 𝑥𝑗 , denoted as 𝑥𝑖 ≺𝐼𝑁 𝑥𝑗 , if all of the following
conditions are met:
∀𝑘, 𝑃 (𝑓𝑘(𝑥𝑖, 𝑐)) < 𝑝(𝑓𝑘(𝑥𝑗 , 𝑐)) ≥ 𝛾
∃𝑘0, 𝑃(𝑓𝑘(𝑥𝑖, 𝑐)) < 𝑝(𝑓𝑘(𝑥𝑗 , 𝑐)) > 𝛾	(5)
where, 𝑤𝑗 ∈ 𝑊𝑉 is the weight vector. 𝑍 is a reference hypercube and
𝑍𝑘 = [𝑍𝑘, 𝑍𝑘] is its 𝑘-th component.

Proposed approach

In this paper, we propose an IMOEA/D-AWN to improve the con- vergence and diversity of the population while reducing its uncertainty. To achieve this task, we propose an adaptive adjustment of the weight vectors (WVs) strategy based on the comprehensive ranking of interval sparsity ranking and interval uncertainty ranking to improve the diver- sity and uncertainty performance of the population. And establish an IEP to update the current population to enhance the performance of

Since uniformly distributed WVs do not ensure that uniformly dis- tributed optimal solutions are produced on PFs with spikes and low tails [44], and, for irregular PFs, uniform WVs can adversely affect the population distribution [40]. Therefore, to ensure the distribution of population, the WVs need to be adjusted according to their sparsity. In addition, the introduction of uncertain information has a negative impact on the distribution of the population [40]. Therefore, individ- ual uncertainty should also be taken into account when adjusting the weight vector. On the basis of the above considerations, we design an adaptive adjustment weight vectors strategy based on interval spar-
sity ranking and interval uncertainty ranking. Individuals with worse

The adaptive adjustment strategy of the WVs based on comprehen- sive ranking is elaborated in the following. First, the interval sparsity level function is designed according to the interval objective function
value, and for the 𝑖-th subproblem, its interval sparsity level is calcu-
lated as follows:
∏𝑀 𝐷(𝑓𝑘(𝑥𝑖−1, 𝑐), 𝑓𝑘(𝑥𝑖, 𝑐)) + ∏𝑀 𝐷(𝑓𝑘(𝑥𝑖, 𝑐), 𝑓𝑘(𝑥𝑖+1 , 𝑐))

in the discontinuous part of PF [45], when the population converges to a certain level, the individuals in the IEP are considered as interval non- dominated solutions. This approach can ensure that the algorithm does not add too many new subproblems in discontinuous part. It also helps generate new subproblems in truly sparse regions so individuals can
distribute in the 𝑃𝐹𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 . For regular PFs, due to the use of IEP which
contains well distributed interval non-dominated solutions to update
the current population, the diversity and convergence of the popula- tion can be further enhanced. The way to update the IEP is shown in Algorithm 1 (Line 1-11). Initially, the IEP is empty, so the interval non-
dominated solutions among the current population 𝑃 and the offspring
population 𝑂 are selected as the IEP. In the later stage of evolution,
the IEP and offspring population 𝑂 are selected as the updated IEP. If the IEP is not empty, so the interval non-dominated solutions among the size of the IEP ( 𝐼𝐸𝑃 ) is larger than the predefined maximum IEP size 𝑛𝐼 𝐸𝑃 , those individuals with the worst comprehensive ranking are removed from the IEP so that the |𝐼𝐸𝑃 | is equal to 𝑛𝐼 𝐸𝑃 . The way to
Where 𝐷(∗, ∗) is the same as Eq. (6). 𝑥𝑖−1 and 𝑥𝑖+1 are the two nearest individuals to individual 𝑥𝑖 , and 𝑀 is the number of objective func- tions. From this formula, we can know that the larger the 𝐼𝑆𝐿 value is,
the larger the interval distance between the current individual and its neighboring individuals, and the sparser the individual and the corre- sponding weight vector of that individual. The interval sparsity ranking
𝑅𝐼𝑆𝐿 is obtained by sorting the 𝐼𝑆𝐿 in descending order so that the
sparse subproblems get the top ranking, while those dense ones get the
bottom ranking.
Since IMOPs contain uncertain information: intervals, which leads to different solutions having overlapping parts in the objective space, it has a negative influence on the distribution of individuals [40]. There- fore, the uncertainty of individuals needs to be considered when adjust- ing the weight vectors. The interval uncertainty is calculated as follows:
𝑀
𝐼 (𝑖)=   (𝑓𝑘(𝑥𝑖, 𝑐)− 𝑓𝑘(𝑥𝑖, 𝑐))	(9)
𝑘=1



The product of the interval lengths of an individual 𝑥𝑖 on every ob- jective is its uncertainty, and the smaller the value of 𝐼 (𝑖), the smaller
the uncertainty of that individual. For uncertainty problems, decision makers tend to prefer solutions that can lower the uncertainty of the
algorithm. Therefore, the interval uncertainty ranking 𝑅𝐼 is obtained
by sorting 𝐼 in ascending order so that those solutions with small
uncertainty get the top ranking, while those individuals with larger un-
certainty get the bottom ranking.
Based on the above two rankings, we can obtain a comprehensive
Since the size of neighborhoods is continuously adjusted with the num- ber of iterations (Line 2), the neighborhoods of each individual are also changing (Line 5).

Adaptive adjustment of neighborhoods
Since the size of the neighborhood has an influence on the algo- rithm’s performance [44], specifically, larger neighborhoods usually increase the diversity of the population but also increase the complexity of the algorithm.

In order to reduce the waste of computing resources and improve evolutionary eﬃciency, a neighborhoods adaptive adjustment strategy is designed. At the early stage of evolution, the setting of a large neigh- borhood is needed to accelerate the global convergence of the popula- tion. With the progression of evolution, the size of the neighborhood needs to be gradually reduced to ensure local convergence. Such a setting can eﬃciently allocate computing resources and improve evo- lutionary eﬃciency. The size of the neighborhood is adjusted according to the following formula:

is set to 1, and IEP is the empty set (Line 1-3). Then, evolutionary op- erations are performed for each individual in the population in turn,
and the newly produced offspring 𝑂(𝑖) is compared with 𝑍 to update
𝑍 (Line 6-7). Subsequently, the interval scalar function values of the offspring 𝑂(𝑖) and the neighborhoods of the current individual 𝐵(𝑖) are
calculated, and the interval confidence level is used to determine the magnitude between them to update the neighborhoods of the current

This metric can reflect the two performances of convergence and diversity of the population. The smaller the value, the better.

The hypervolume of the approximate Pareto solution set X of IMOP (Eq. (1)) is calculated as [49]:

Experiments

In this section, the performance of the proposed IMOEA/D-AWN is validated. Four advanced IMOEAs were selected for comparison,
namely, II-MOEA [17] DI-𝜇MOGA [33], InMaOEA [37] and IMOEA/D
[40]. All algorithms were evaluated on 17 interval benchmark test prob-
lems.

Test problems

WFG1-9 [46], DTLZ1-4 [47], MaF1-4 [48] test problems are used to evaluate the performance of IMOEA/D-AWN. The number of objectives in the above problems is 3, and the number of variables in WFG1-9, DTLZ2-4 and MaF1-4 is 12, that in DTLZ1 is 7.
Since the objective value of the test problem is deterministic, while the objective values of IMOPs are interval values, it is necessary to add
an imprecision factor 𝛿 [49] to expand the deterministic values into
interval values. For the tri-objective problem [40]:
𝑠𝑖𝑛(10𝜋	𝑥 )∕4
⎢	⎥
is the worst-case hypervolume and 𝐻 (𝑋) is the best-case hypervol- ume. The midpoint of 𝐻 (𝑥) is referred to as the hypervolume [40].
Imprecision-metric
The performance of the population in uncertainty is reflected by Imprecision, which is the sum of the interval lengths of all individ- uals in the Pareto optimal solution set for all objectives [49]. The smaller the Imprecision indicator, the better.

Comparison algorithms

II-MOEA [17]: II-MOEA is a classic IMOEA based on Pareto dom- inance. Interval Pareto dominance relation based interval confi- dence level sorts individuals into different interval Pareto fronts. Then calculate the interval crowding distance according to the lo- cation and volume of the individual in the objective space. And select the optimal solution set based on the above two strategies.
DI-𝜇MOGA [33]: DI-𝜇MOGA employs the interval dominance re-
lation in [17] to compare the individuals from the evolutionary
population and the external elite population. Modified the interval crowding distances to take into account the maximum and min- imum interval values for the entire population at each objective when calculating the crowding distances of individuals.
InMaOEA [37]: InMaOEA is a variant of II-MOEA. Modified the calculation of the interval confidence level and defined the interval Pareto dominance relation based on the modified interval confi-

𝑠𝑖𝑛(40𝜋  𝑖 𝑥𝑖)∕4
where 𝑥𝑖 is the 𝑖-th variables, 𝑖 = 1, 2, ..., 𝑑.
The original optimization problem is represented as 𝑓𝑗 (𝑥), 𝑗 = 1, 2, ..., 𝑀 . And the perturbed interval-valued function is denoted as
𝑓𝑗 (𝑥, 𝛿):
𝑓𝑗 (x, 𝛿𝑗 )= min 𝑓𝑗 (x), 𝑓𝑗 (x)+ 𝛿𝑗
𝑓𝑗 (x, 𝛿𝑗 )= max 𝑓𝑗 (x), 𝑓𝑗 (x)+ 𝛿𝑗
Corresponding interval benchmark test problems are denoted as IWFG1-9, IDTLZ1-4, and IMaF1-4.

Performance metrics

The following three performance metrics are used to evaluate the convergence, diversity, and uncertainty performance of each algorithm.

(1) IGD-metric
as 𝑃𝐹𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 of each uncertainty problem. The IGD metric is computed Pareto-optimal Front of each deterministic benchmark test problem as the average Euclidean distance between 𝑃𝐹𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 and the midpoint
of the interval objective value of the approximate Pareto optimal solution set [17]:
based on hypervolume and overlap degree.
IMOEA/D [40]: An adaptive reference vector-based interval multi- objective evolutionary algorithm in the framework of MOEA/D. Decompose IMOP into multiple subproblems with interval param- eters, and developed an ensemble scheme for evaluating interval individuals. Then, adaptively adjusted reference vectors based on the interval crowding distance.

Parameter setting
To make sure the experiment is fair, the population size 𝑁 was set
algorithms. The neighborhood size 𝑇 was set to 10 for our algorithm to 105, and the maximum number of iterations was set to 900 for all
is equal to 𝑁 . Referring to [43], ratio of iterations to evolve 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑣𝑜𝑙 is and IMOEA/D based on the original paper [40], and the number of WVs set to 0.8, and the adjustment period 𝑤𝑎𝑔 is set to 100, the ratio of updated weight vectors is set to 0.05, and 𝑛𝑢𝑠 = 0.05 ∗ 𝑁 . The crossover
and mutation probabilities of II-MOEA, InMaOEA, and IMOEA/D are set
crossover and mutation probabilities of DI-𝜇MOGA are set to 0.8 and to 0.9 and 0.1, respectively, according to the original papers, and the
0.05, respectively, according to the original paper [33]. The generation for starting adjusting reference vectors of IMOEA/D is set to half of the maximum generation according to the original paper [40].

Experimental results and analysis
Eﬀects of diﬀerent values of 𝛼
This subsection will evaluate the parameters 𝛼 in the comprehensive ranking. The 𝛼 was set to 0.1-0.9, and to avoid experimental accidents,
each group was run 30 times independently. The values of IGD and Im- precision obtained by IMOEA/D-AWN were recorded, and the average values were calculated. Fig. 3 and 4 show the IGD and Imprecision val-
ues obtained on each test problem when 𝛼 is taken to different values,
respectively.
As mentioned in Section 3, 𝛼 is the weight of interval sparsity level ranking, and (1 − 𝛼) is the weight of interval uncertainty ranking. The larger 𝛼 is, the greater the impact of interval sparsity level on an indi-
vidual’s comprehensive ranking, and vice versa, the greater the impact of interval uncertainty. From Fig. 3, we can see that the value of IGD
keeps decreasing as 𝛼 gradually increases, i.e., the convergence and di-
value of 𝛼 can improve these two performances of the algorithm. While versity of the algorithm gradually become better, indicating that a large
ing as the weight of individual uncertainty ranking (1 − 𝛼) gradually from Fig. 4, we can see that the value of Imprecision keeps increas-
becomes worse, indicating that a small value of 𝛼 can reduce the un- decreases, i.e., the uncertainty performance of the algorithm gradually
certainty of the population. Since the introduced uncertain information has a negative impact on the distribution of the population, to minimize the impact of uncertainty on the distribution of the population and to
reduce the uncertainty of the population at the same time, 𝛼 is set to
0.8 here, i.e., the weight of interval sparsity is set to 0.8 and the weight
of interval uncertainty is set to 0.2.

Eﬀectiveness of Adaptive Adjustment of Weight Vectors
We designed interval uncertainty ranking 𝑅𝐼 in the weight vectors
adaptive adjustment strategy to enhance the uncertainty performance
of the population. And we established an IEP to guide the update of the current population and thus guide the adjust of the WVs to enhance the

convergence and diversity of the population. The following experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the above strategies:
Eﬀectiveness of ranking of interval uncertainty 𝑅𝐼
To verify whether the introduction of 𝑅𝐼 can reduce the uncertainty
of the optimal solution, the following experiments were conducted. Ta-
metrics in two cases: one case is the algorithm without the 𝑅𝐼 , and the ble 1 shows the experimental results of IMOEA/D-AWN on Imprecision other case is the algorithm with the 𝑅𝐼 . To avoid the randomness of the

without 𝑅𝐼 in 16 test instances. For IDTLZ4, the values of Impreci- in all testing problems, and significantly outperformed IMOEA/D-AWN
IMOEA/D-AWN is still slightly better than IMOEA/D-AWN without 𝑅𝐼 . sion for the two cases are not statistically significantly different, but Therefore, designing the uncertainty ranking 𝑅𝐼 in the weight vectors
adaptive adjustment strategy can effectively reduce the uncertainty of the optimal solution.
Eﬀectiveness of interval elite population IEP
This part will verify whether the strategy of IEP-guided weight vector adjustment can improve the convergence and diversity of the optimal solutions. Tables 2 and 3 show the experimental results of IMOEA/D-AWN on IGD and HV metrics in two cases, respectively. From Table 2, we can see that, for the IGD metric, IMOEA/D-AWN is signifi- cantly better than IMOEA/D-AWN without IEP on all 17 test instances. From Table 3, we can see that IMOEA/D-AWN is significantly superior to IMOEA/D-AWN without IEP on 16 test cases. In the IWFG1, there is no statistically significant difference between the HV values of the two cases. Nevertheless, the HV of IMOEA/D-AWN is slightly better than that of IMOEA/D-AWN without IEP in this problem. Therefore, using interval elite populations to guide the adjustment of the weight vectors can effectively improve the convergence and diversity of the optimal solutions.
Eﬀectiveness of adaptive adjustment weight vectors to solve IMOPs
In order to verify the effectiveness of the adaptive adjustment weight vector strategy for solving IMOPs, the following comparison experi- ments are conducted. The algorithm that does not adjust the weight vectors is denoted as IMOEA/D-AWN (no AW). Table 4 shows the IGD of IMOEA/D-AWN in two cases: one is the algorithm without AW and the other is the algorithm using AW. From this table, IMOEA/D-AWN is better than IMOEA/D-AWN without adaptive weight vector adjust- ment on 16 test instances. In only one problem IDTLZ4, the IGD of IMOEA/D-AWN is slightly inferior to the algorithm without weight vector adjustment, but they are not significantly different at the statis- tical level. Table 5 shows the HV values of two cases, IMOEA/D-AWN achieved optimal values on 14 test instances, in the IWFG6 and IMaF2 problems, IMOEA/D-AWN did not achieve an optimal value, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two cases again. On the IDTLZ4 problem, the HV of IMOEA/D-AWN is inferior to that of the algorithm without weight vector adjustment. Therefore, the weight vector adjustment strategy proposed in this paper improves the con- vergence and diversity of the IMOEA which deals with IMOPs. Table 6 shows the Imprecision values of two cases, IMOEA/D-AWN achieved optimal values in 10 test problems, and IMOEA/D-AWN performed slightly worse than the algorithm without adaptive weight vectors ad- justment in the five problems: IWFG3, IWFG4, IWFG6, IWFG7, IWFG9, but there was no significant difference at the statistical level. For the

IWFG8 and IMaF1 problems, IMOEA/D-AWN performs worse than the algorithm without weight vector adjustment, which may be due to the
𝛼 is uniformly set to 0.2 during the weight vector adjustment, which
may be improved by adjusting the value of the 𝛼 for the different prob-
lems, but as a whole, the population imprecision of IMOEA/D-AWN is
better than that of the algorithm without weight vector adjustment.

Eﬀectiveness of Adaptive Adjustment of Neighborhoods to solve IMOPs
This section will verify whether the adaptive adjustment neighbor- hood strategy (AN) can accelerate convergence and improve computa- tional eﬃciency. Table 7 shows the running times of IMOEA/D-AWN in two cases: one is the algorithm without AN and the other is the al- gorithm using AN. From this table, we can see that the running time of IMOEA/D-AWN is significantly smaller than IMOEA/D-AWN without AN in all 17 test problems. This shows that the adaptive adjustment of the neighborhood strategy can significantly reduce the runtime of the algorithm.
Table 8 shows the number of optimal values (denoted as Rank 1) and suboptimal values (denoted as Rank 2) obtained by IMOEA/D-AWN on the IGD and Imprecision metrics in two cases. From Table 8, we can see that, for the IGD metric, IMOEA/D-AWN without AN achieves opti- mal values in 9 of the 17 test problems, while IMOEA/D-AWN achieves optimal values in 8 problems. For the Imprecision metric, IMOEA/D- AWN without AN achieves the optimal value in 8 test problems, and
The number of Rank1-2 obtained by two cases.



IMOEA/D-AWN achieves the optimal value in 9 problems. It shows that convergence, diversity, and uncertainty are similar in both cases. Based on the above experimental results, the adaptive adjustment neighbor- hood strategy can guarantee the convergence, diversity, and uncertainty of the population while shortening the running time of the algorithm. Therefore, AN can accelerate the convergence of the population and improve computational eﬃciency.

lem inferiorly to DI-𝜇MOGA and IMOEA/D on IGD, but better than
II-MOEA and InMaOEA. DTLZ4 has a concave and biased PF. In deal-
ing with this problem, the IGD values of IMOEA/D-AWN are all larger than those of the other four algorithms, so this problem poses a chal- lenge for IMOEA/D-AWN. However, IMOEA/D-AWN performs best for other problems with complex features, such as IWFG2-9, IMaF1-2, and IDTLZ1-3, where IWFG2 is a discontinuous PF, IWFG3, IMaF2 are irreg- ular PFs, and these irregular PFs can pose challenges to the algorithm, but IMOEA/D-AWN can deal with these problems well. This means that IMOEA/D-AWN has better convergence and diversity for most test prob- lems compared to other algorithms.

instances, and IMOEA/D on five test instances. II-MOEA and InMaOEA did not achieve the optimal value. This implies that IMOEA/D-AWN has better comprehensive performance for most of the test problems compared to other algorithms. The HV values of IMOEA/D-AWN are
inferior to DI-𝜇MOGA for IWFG1, IMaF4 and IDTLZ1 problems, but
IMOEA/D-AWN outperforms DI-𝜇MOGA for the remaining 14 prob-
lems. IMOEA/D outperforms IMOEA/D-AWN on IWFG9, IMaF3-4, and
IDTLZ1,4 problems, IMOEA/D performs similarly to IMOEA/D-AWN on IDTLZ3 problems, but IMOEA/D-AWN outperforms IMOEA/D on the other 12 problems. Thus, for the HV metric, IMOEA/D-AWN signifi- cantly outperforms IMOEA/D. In addition, IMOEA/D-AWN outperforms II-MOEA and InMaOEA for all problems.
Table 11 is the Imprecision index of different algorithms. From this table, we can see that IMOEA/D-AWN achieves optimal values for all the tested problems, especially for some irregular PF problems, e.g.,

WFG1 has an irregular PF features sharp tail and mixed, WFG2 has dis- continuous PF [50], WFG3 has a degenerate PF, which is also irregular. MaF2 has concave irregular PF, MaF4 has badly-scaled and multi-modal PF [42]. This is due to the individual uncertainty that is taken into ac- count when designing the weight vector adaptive adjustment strategy. Fig. 5 is the boxplot of Imprecision on IWFG series benchmark opti- mization problems. From Fig. 5, we can see that the Imprecision values of IMOEA/D-AWN are overall significantly smaller than the other four algorithms, and the Imprecision values of the solutions obtained by it are more aggregated, except for IWFG1. For IWFG1, although the Im- precision values obtained by IMOEA/D-AWN are not as aggregated as those of IMOEA/D, their average value is apparently smaller than its of IMOEA/D. Therefore, the uncertainty performance of IMOEA/D-AWN for the IWFG series problems is significantly superior to that of the other algorithms. Fig. 6 shows the boxplot of Imprecision on IMaF se- ries benchmark optimization problems. From this figure, we can know that the Imprecision values of IMOEA/D-AWN are all overall signifi- cantly smaller than the other four algorithms, except for IMaF3. As can be seen in Table 11, for IMaF3, the Imprecision values obtained by
IMOEA/D-AWN are not statistically significantly different from those obtained by IMOEA/D, but the average value of Imprecision achieved by IMOEA/D-AWN is still slightly better than that of IMOEA/D. Fig. 7 shows the boxplot of Imprecision on IDTLZ series benchmark optimiza- tion problems. From the figure, we can see that the Imprecision values of IMOEA/D-AWN are all overall significantly smaller than the other four algorithms except for IDTLZ3. From Table 11, we can see that for IDTLZ3, the imprecision values obtained by IMOEA/D-AWN and IMOEA/D are not statistically significantly different from each other, but the average value of Imprecision gained by IMOEA/D-AWN is still slightly better than that of IMOEA/D and significantly superior to the other three algorithms. These experimental results show the superior uncertainty performance of IMOEA/D-AWN.

tation oﬄoading is a two-layer edge computing framework, including the terminal layer and edge layer. The edge layer deploys edge servers to provide strong computing power support for the entire framework, while the terminal layer deploys intelligent terminal devices. Each intel- ligent terminal device generates tasks and has limited computing power, which can be used for data transmission and computing tasks. Collabo- rative computing oﬄoading aims to fully use the remaining computing and storage capacity of various edge servers, achieve task load balanc- ing, improve the computing response speed of terminal nodes, reduce the cost of the entire computing oﬄoading system, and make more rea- sonable use of the computing resources of the entire system. Due to uncertain factors such as network bandwidth, which results in oﬄoad- ing delay, load balancing, and energy consumption being uncertain, so it is an IMOP.

by II-MOEA, DI-𝜇MOGA, InMaOEA, IMOEA/D, and IMOEA/D-AWN on Table 12 shows the values of HV and Imprecision that are obtained
the uncertain collaborative computation oﬄoading optimization prob- lem. It is clear from this table that the HV and Imprecision values of IMOEA/D-AWN are all the best. This implies that IMOEA/D-AWN out- performs the other four algorithms in terms of convergence, diversity, and uncertainty. In terms of the HV metric, IMOEA/D-AWN ranks first, and the other algorithms are ranked as follows: IMOEA/D, InMaOEA,
II-MOEA, and DI-𝜇MOGA. For the Imprecision metric, IMOEA/D-AWN
MaOEA, DI-𝜇MOGA, and IMOEA/D. The ranking of some of the com- also ranks first, and the other algorithms are ranked as: II-MOEA, In-
parison algorithms has changed in these two metrics, while the ranking of IMOEA/D-AWN has not changed and ranks first. This implies that IMOEA/D-AWN can better balance convergence, diversity, and uncer- tainty. This is due to that not only interval sparsity but also impreci- sion is taken into account when adjusting the weight vectors, and the interval elite population is used to update the contemporary popula- tion, further improving the performance of the population. The above experimental results and analysis illustrate that IMOEA/D-AWN can effectively solve the uncertain collaborative computation oﬄoading op- timization problem.

Conclusions

Designing IMOEAs that can enhance population convergence and diversity while reducing population uncertainty is important for solv- ing IMOPs. This paper proposes a decomposition-based IMOEA with
adaptive adjustment of weight vectors and neighborhoods. Firstly, an

√√ ∑𝑀 (



𝑇𝑆𝑚 − 𝑇𝐿𝑚)2
interval sparsity function is designed, and interval sparsity ranking and interval uncertainty ranking are given based on interval sparsity and






where 𝑇 𝑆𝑚 = [𝑇 𝑆𝑚, 𝑇 𝑆𝑚] is the size of the task uploaded to the terminal equipment, 𝑇𝐿𝑚 is the load limit of the terminal equipment, and 𝑀 is
the number of terminal equipments.
𝐿𝐸𝑆 is the load balancing function of edge servers,

interval elite population is designed. Besides, an adaptive adjustment neighborhoods strategy is designed. This strategy focuses on global search in the early stage of evolution and gradually focuses on local search as evolution proceeds, so as to allocate computing resources rea- sonably and enhance evolutionary eﬃciency. The experimental results demonstrate that the IMOEA/D-AWN can effectively reduce the uncer- tainty of the population and enhance its convergence and diversity.
However, the changes of the parameter in the comprehensive rank-

edge servers.
Summarize, the interval load balancing function is 𝐿 = [𝐿, 𝐿], where

rithm. Although we have selected its appropriate value through com- parative experiments, it may not be optimal. Therefore, how to obtain its optimal value deserves further research. And the number of itera- tions to start adjusting the weight vectors is fixed, different number of generations to start adjusting will have an impact on the performance of the algorithm. Therefore, how to adaptively determine this value deserves further research. Besides, IMOEA/D-AWN can be applied to practical applications to provide more high-quality options for decision makers. However, IMOPs with interval constraints are not uncommon



in the real world. Therefore, it is our future research direction to design an eﬃcient IMOEA to solve the problems mentioned above.
