Abstract
We discuss how the theory of operator algebras, also called operator theory, can be applied in quantum computer science. From a computer scientist point of view, we explain some fundamental results of operator theory and their relevance in the context of domain theory. In particular, we consider the category W∗ of W*-algebras together with normal sub-unital maps, provide an order-enrichment for this category and exhibit a class of its endofunctors with a canonical fixpoint.
Keywords: W*-algebras, operator theory, domain theory, fixpoint theorem, quantum computation


Introduction
Our aim here is to use the theory of operator algebras to study the differences and similarities between probabilistic and quantum computations, by unveiling their domain-theoretic and topological structure. To our knowledge, the deep connection between the theory of operator algebras and domain theory was not fully exploited before. This might be due to the fact that the theory of operator algebras, mostly unknown to computer scientists, was developed way before the theory of domains. Our main contribution is a connection between two different communities: the community of theoretical computer scientists, who use domain theory to study program language semantics (and logic), and the community of mathematicians and theoretical physicists, who use a special class of algebras called W*-algebras to
study quantum mechanics.

Our main purpose was to pave the way to a study of quantum programming language semantics, where types are denoted by W*-algebras, terms are denoted by normal completely positive maps, recursive terms and weakest preconditions are denoted by fixed points (via Dcpo⊥!-enrichment), and recursive types are denoted by fixed points of endofunctors (via algebraical compactness).
We list here the main points of the paper, that will be detailed and explained later on:
Positive maps can be ordered by a generalized version of the L¨owner order [8], considered in the finite-dimensional case by Selinger in [13]: for two positive maps f and g, f ± g iff (g − f ) is positive [Definition 2.1]. We also consider completely positive maps in Section 4.
Hom-sets of normal (positive) sub-unital maps between W*-algebras are directed- complete with this so-called Lo¨wner order [Theorem 2.2].
The category of W∗ of W*-algebras together with normal sub-unital maps is order-enriched [Theorem 2.9].
The notion of von Neumann functor is introduced to denote the locally continuous endofunctors on W∗ which preserve multiplicative maps [Definition 3.1].
For such functors, we provide a canonical way to construct a fixpoint, by showing that the category W∗ is algebraic compact (for the class of von Neumann functors) [Theorem 3.6]. Our proof are in the lines of Smyth-Plotkin [14].

A short introduction to operator theory
In this section, we will introduce two structures, known as C*-algebras and W*- algebras. We refer the interested reader to [15] for more details.

C*-algebras
A Banach space is a normed vector space where every Cauchy sequence converges. A Banach algebra is a linear associative algebra A over the complex numbers C with a norm · such that its norm · is submultiplicative (i.e. ∀x, y ∈ A, xy  ≤ x   y  ) and turns A into a Banach space. A Banach algebra A is unital if it has a unit, i.e. if it has an element 1 such that a1= 1a = a holds for every a ∈ A and 1  = 1.
A *-algebra is a linear associative algebra A over C with an operation (−)∗ : A → A such that for all x, y ∈ A, the following equations holds: (x∗)∗ = x, (x + y)∗ = (x∗ + y∗), (xy)∗ = y∗x∗ and (λx)∗ = λx∗  (λ ∈ C).
A C*-algebra is a Banach *-algebra A such that  x∗x  =  x  2 for all x ∈ A. This identity is sometimes called the C*-identity, and implies that every element x of a C*-algebra is such that x  = x∗  .
Consider now a unital C*-algebra A. An element x ∈ A is self-adjoint if x = x∗. An element x ∈ A is positive if it can be written in the form x = y∗y, where y ∈ A.
We write Asa ‹→ A (resp. A+ ‹→ A) for the subset of self-adjoint (resp. positive)

elements of A.
For every C*-algebra, the subset of positive elements is a convex cone and thus induces a partial order structure on self-adjoint elements, see [15, Definition 6.12]. That is to say, one can define a partial order on self-adjoint elements of a C*-algebra A as follows: x ≤ y if and only if y − x ∈ A+.
From now on, we will consider the following kind of maps of C*-algebras. Let
f : A → B be a linear map of C*-algebras:
P The map f is positive if it preserves positive elements and therefore restricts to a function A+ → B+. A positive map A → C will be called a state on A. It should be noted that positive maps of C*-algebras preserve the order on self-adjoint elements.
M The map f is multiplicative if ∀x, y ∈ A, f (xy)= f (x)f (y);
I The map f is involutive if ∀x ∈ A, f (x∗)= f (x)∗;
U The map f is unital if it preserves the unit;
sU The map f is sub-unital if the inequality 0 ≤ f (1) ≤ 1 holds;
cP For every C*-algebra A, one can easily define pointwise a C*-algebra Mn(A) from the set of n-by-n matrices whose entries are elements of A. The map f is completely positive if for every n ∈ N, Mn(f ) : Mn(A) → Mn(B) defined for every matrix [xi,j]i,j≤n ∈ Mn(A) by Mn(f )([xi,j]i,j≤n)= [f (xi,j)]i,j≤n is positive.
For every Hilbert space H, the Banach space B(H) of bounded linear maps on H is a C*-algebra. The space C0(X) of complex-valued continuous functions, that vanish at infinity, on a locally compact Hausdorff space X is a common example of commutative C*-algebra.
Self-adjoint and positive elements of B(H) can be defined alternatively through the inner product of H, as in the following standard theorem (see [3, II.2.12,VIII.3.8]):
Theorem 1.1 Let H be a Hilbert space and T ∈ B(H). Then:
T is self-adjoint if and only if ∀x ∈ H, ⟨Tx|x⟩∈ R;
T is positive if and only if T is self-adjoint and ∀x ∈ H, ⟨Tx|x⟩≥ 0.
W*-algebras
We will denote by B(H) (resp. Ef(H)) the collection of all bounded operators (resp. positive bounded operators below the unit) on a Hilbert space H. There are several standard topologies that one can define on a collection B(H) (see [15] for an overview).
Definition 1.2 The operator norm T is defined for every bounded operator T in B(H) by:  T  = sup {T (x)  | x ∈ H, x ≤ 1} . The norm topology is the topology induced by the operator norm on B(H). A sequence of bounded operators (Tn)
converges to a bounded operator T in this topology if and only if Tn − T  −→ 0.
n→∞
The strong operator topology on B(H) is the topology of pointwise convergence

in the norm of H: a net of bounded operators (Tλ)λ∈Λ converges to a bounded operator T in this topology if and only if  (Tλ − T )x  −→ 0 for each x ∈ H. In that case, T is said to be strongly continuous.
The weak operator topology on B(H) is the topology of pointwise weak conver- gence in the norm of H: a net of bounded operators (Tλ)λ∈Λ converges to a bounded operator T in this topology if and only if ⟨(Tλ − T )x|y⟩ −→ 0 for x, y ∈ H. In that case, T is said to be weakly continuous.

It is known that, for an arbitrary Hilbert space H, the weak operator topology on B(H) is weaker than the strong operator topology on B(H), which is weaker than the norm topology on B(H). However, when H is finite-dimensional, the weak topology, the strong topology and the norm topology coincide. Moreover, for the strong and the weak operator topologies, the use of nets instead of sequences should not be considered trivial: it is known that, for an arbitrary Hilbert space H, the norm topology is first-countable whereas the other topologies are not necessarily first-countable, see [15, Chapter II.2].
The commutant of A ⊂ B(H) is the set AJ of all bounded operators that com- mutes with those of A: AJ = {T ∈ B(H) | ∀S ∈ A, TS = ST} . The bicommutant of A is the commutant of AJ and will be denoted by AJJ.
The following theorem is a fundamental result in operator theory as it remark- ably relates a topological property (being closed in two operator topologies) to an algebraic property (being its own bicommutant).

Theorem 1.3 (von Neumann bicommutant theorem) Let A be a unital *- subalgebra of B(H) for some Hilbert space H. The following conditions are equiva- lent:
A = AJJ.
A is closed in the weak topology of B(H).
A is closed in the strong topology of B(H).

A W*-algebra (or von Neumann algebra) is a C*-algebra which satifies one (hence all) of the conditions of the von Neumann bicommutant theorem. The col- lections of bounded operators on Hilbert spaces are the most trivial examples of W*-algebras. The function space L∞(X) for some standard measure space X and the space l∞(N) of bounded sequences are common examples of commutative W*- algebras.
For every C*-algebra A, we denote by AJ the dual space of A, i.e. the set of all linear maps φ : A → C. It is known that a C*-algebra A is a W*-algebra if and only if there is a Banach space A∗, called pre-dual of A, such that (A∗)J = A, see [11, Definition 1.1.2].
A positive map φ : A → B between two C*-algebras is normal if every increasing net (x )  in A+ with least upper bound  x ∈ A+ is such that the net (φ(x ))
is an increasing net in B+ with least upper bound W φ(xλ)= φ(W xλ).

Direct sums and tensors of W*-algebras
The direct sum of a family of C*-algebras {Ai}i∈I is defined as the C*-algebra


  Ai =  (ai)i ∈  Ai | sup
		

 ai  < ∞ 

where the operations are defined component-wise and with a norm defined by (ai)i∈I  ∞ = sup  ai  .
The direct sum of a family of W*-algebras {A }  is the W*-algebra    A
defined as the dual of the C*-algebras  i∈I Ai∗, such that Ai is the dual of Ai∗, seen as a C*-algebra.
The spatial tensor product A⊗B of two W*-algebras A with universal normal representations πA : A → B(H) and πB : B → B(K) can be defined as the subalge- bra of B(H⊗K) generated by the operators m⊗n ∈ B(H⊗K) where (m, n) ∈ A×B.
Proposition 1.4 For a W*-algebra A, one has the following properties:
A ⊕ 0= A =0 ⊕ A;
A⊗0=0= 0⊗A;
A⊗C = A = C⊗A;

A⊗(  i∈I Bi)=  i∈I (A⊗Bi) for every family of W*-algebras {Ai}i∈I.
Rediscovering the domain-theoretic structure of W*- algebras
The W*-algebras together with the normal sub-unital maps (or NsU-maps), i.e. pos- itive and Scott-continuous maps, give rise to a category W∗, which is a subcategory of the category C∗ of C*-algebras together with positive sub-unital maps.
In this section, after recalling some standard notion of domain theory, we will show that positive sub-unital maps can be ordered in such a way that the category W∗ will be Dcpo⊥!-enriched. The decision of considering normal sub-unital maps instead of normal completely positive maps will be discussed in Section 4.1.

A short introduction to domain theory
A non-empty subset Δ of a poset P is called directed if every pair of elements of Δ has an upper bound in Δ. We denote it by Δ ⊆dir P . A poset P is a directed-complete partial order (dcpo) if each directed subset has a least upper bound. A function φ : P → Q between two posets P and Q is strict if φ(⊥P
) =⊥Q, is monotonic if it preserves the order and Scott-continuous if it preserves directed joins. We denote by Dcpo⊥ (resp. Dcpo⊥!) the category with dcpos with bottoms as objects and Scott-continuous maps (resp. strict Scott-continuous maps) as morphisms.

A L¨owner order on positive maps
Since positive elements are self-adjoint, one can define the following order on positive maps of C*-algebras.
Definition 2.1 [L¨owner partial order] For positive maps f, g : A → B between C*-algebras A and B, we define pointwise the following partial order ±, which turns out to be an infinite-dimensional generalization of the L¨owner partial order
[8] for positive maps: f ± g if and only if ∀x ∈ A+,f (x) ≤ g(x) if and only if
∀x ∈ A+, (g − f )(x) ∈ B+ (i.e. g − f is positive).
One might ask if, for arbitrary C*-algebras A and B, the poset (C∗(A, B), ±) is directed-complete. The answer turns out to be no, as shown by our following counter-example:
Let us consider the C*-algebra C([0, 1]) := {f : [0, 1] → C | f continuous}.
The hom-set C∗(C, C([0, 1])) is isomorphic to C([0, 1]) if one considers the func- tions F : C∗(C, C([0, 1])) → C([0, 1]) and G : C([0, 1]) → C∗(C, C([0, 1])) respec-
tively defined by F (f )= f (1) and G(g)= λα ∈ C.α · g.
We define an increasing chain (fn)n≥0 of C([0, 1]) define for every n ∈ N by

0	if 0 ≤ x < 1
fn(x)= ⎨ (x − 1 )2n+1	if 1 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 2−(n+1)

2	2	2
⎪
1	−(n+1)
2
Suppose that there is a least upper bound φ in C([0, 1]) for this chain. Then,
φ(x) = 0 if x < 1 . Moreover, limn→∞ 1 + 2−(n+1)  = 1 implies that φ(x) = 1 if

By the Intermediate Value Theorem, the continuity of the function φ on the interval [0, 1] implies that there is a c ∈ [0, 1] such that φ(c)= 1 . From φ(c) ∈/ {0, 1}, we obtain that c = 1 . That is to say φ( 1 )= 1 , which is absurd since fn( 1 )=0 for
2	2	2	2
every n ∈ N.
It follows that there is no least upper bound for this chain in C([0, 1]) and therefore C([0, 1]) is not chain-complete. However:
Theorem 2.2 For W*-algebras A and B, the poset (W∗(A, B), ±) is directed- complete.
The proof of this theorem will be postponed until after the following lemmas.
Lemma 2.3 ([10], Corollary 1) Let f ∈ C∗(A, B) and x ∈ A+. Then, f (x) ≤
 x  · 1. Therefore, f (x)  ≤ x  .
The following result is known in physics as Vigier’s theorem [16]. A weaker version of this theorem can be found in [13]. It is important in this context because it establishes the link between limits in topology and joins in order theory.

Lemma 2.4 Let H be a Hilbert space. Let (Tλ)λ∈Λ be an increasing net of Ef(H). Then the least upper bound  Tλ exists in Ef(H) and is the limit of the net (Tλ)λ∈Λ in the strong topology.
Proof. For any operator U ∈ B(H), the inner product ⟨Ux|x⟩ is real if and only if U is self-adjoint (by Theorem 1.1). Thus, for each x ∈ H, the net (⟨Tλx|x⟩)λ∈Λ of real numbers is increasing, bounded by x  2 and thus convergent to a limit limλ ⟨Tλx|x⟩ since R is bounded-complete.
By polarization on norms, ⟨Tλx|y⟩ = 1 (⟨Tλ(x + y)|(x + y)⟩− ⟨Tλx|x⟩− ⟨Tλy|y⟩) for any λ ∈ Λ. Then, for all x, y ∈ H, the limit limλ ⟨Tλx|y⟩ exists and thus we can define pointwise an operator T ∈ Ef(H) by ⟨Tx|y⟩ = limλ ⟨Tλx|y⟩ for x, y ∈ H.
Indeed, T is the limit of the net (Tλ)λ∈Λ in the weak topology, and therefore in the strong topology since a bounded net of positive operators converges strongly whenever it converges weakly (see [1, I.3.2.8]).
Moreover, T is an upper bound for the net (Tλ)λ∈Λ since Tλ ≤ T for every λ ∈ Λ. By Theorem 1.1, if there is a self-adjoint operator S ∈ B(H) such that Tλ ≤ S for every λ ∈ Λ, then ⟨Tλx|x⟩≤ ⟨Sx|x⟩ for every λ ∈ Λ. Thus, ⟨Tx|x⟩ = limλ ⟨Tλx|x⟩≤ 
⟨Sx|x⟩. Then, ⟨(S − T )x|x⟩≥ 0 for every x ∈ H. By Theorem 1.1, S − T positive and thus T ≤ S. It follows that T is the least upper bound of (Tλ)λ∈Λ.	2
Corollary 2.5 For every W*-algebra A, the poset [0, 1]A is directed-complete.
Proof. Let A be a W*-algebra. By definition, A is a strongly closed subalgebra of B(H), for some Hilbert space H. Then, let (Tλ)λ∈Λ be an increasing net in [0, 1]  ⊆ Ef(H). By Lemma 2.4, (T )   converges strongly to  T  ∈ Ef(H). It follows that Tλ ∈ [0, 1]A because [0, 1]A is strongly closed. Thus, [0, 1]A is directed-complete.	2
This corollary constitutes a crucial step in the proof of Theorem 2.2, as it unveils a link between the topological properties and the order-theoretic properties of W*- algebras.
Lemma 2.6 Any positive map f : A → B between C*-algebras is completely deter- mined and deﬁned by its action on [0, 1]A.
Proof. A positive map of C*-algebras f : A → B restrict by definition to a map f : A+ → B+. Since f preserves the order ≤ on positive elements, it restricts to [0, 1]A → [0, 1]B:
Let x ∈ A+ \ {0}. From x ≤  x  1, we can see that  1  x ∈ [0, 1]A and thus
f (  1  x) ∈ [0, 1]B. Moreover, f (x)= x  f (  1  x). This statement can be extended
x	x
to every element in A since each y ∈ A is a linear combination of four positive
elements (see [1, II.3.1.2]), determining f (y) ∈ B.	2
We can now show that the poset (W∗(A, B), ±) is directed-complete for every pair A and B of W*-algebras.
Proof. [Proof of Theorem 2.2] Let A and B be two W*-algebras. By Corollary 2.5, [0, 1]A and [0, 1]B are directed-complete.

We now consider an increasing net (fλ)λ∈Λ of NsU-maps from A to B, increasing in the Lo¨wner order. Then, for every x ∈ A+, there is an increasing net (fλ(x))λ∈Λ bounded by x  · 1 (by Lemma 2.3).
Moreover, for every non-zero element x ∈ A+, from the fact that [0, 1]B is directed-complete, we obtain that the increasing net (fλ(  x  ))λ∈Λ has a join fλ(  x  ) in [0, 1]B and thus we can define pointwise the following upper bound
f : [0, 1]A → [0, 1]B for the increasing net (f J )λ∈Λ of NsU-maps from [0, 1]A to [0, 1]B such that, for every λ ∈ Λ, f J (x) = fλ(  x  )(x /= 0): f (  x  ) = W fλ(  x  )	(x ∈
This upper bound f is a positive sub-unital map by construction and can be extended to an upper bound f : A → B for the increasing net (fλ)λ∈Λ: for every nonzero x ∈ A+, the increasing sequence (fλ(x))λ∈Λ =(  x  fλ(  x  ))λ∈Λ has a join f (x)= x 	f (  x  ) in B+ and thus one can define pointwise an upper bound
f : A → B for (fλ)λ∈Λ by f (x)=  fλ(x) for every x ∈ A+.
We now need to prove that the map f is normal, by exchange of joins.
Let (x )  be an increasing bounded net in A+ with join  x . For every γJ ∈ Γ, we observe that xγ∗ ≤  γ xγ and thus, f (xγ) ≤ f ( γ xγ) (recall that f preserves the order). As seen earlier, since [0, 1]B is directed-complete, the increasing net (f (x ))  , which is equal by definition to the increasing net (  (f (x )))  , has a
that x ∗∗ /= 0 and by	f (x ) = 0 otherwise. It follows that	f (x ) ≤ f (	x ). We have to prove now that f (	x ) ≤	f (x ). Since each map f  (λ ∈ Λ)
is normal, we obtain that f (	x ) =	(f (		x )) =	(	(f (x )). More- over, for γJ ∈ Γ and λJ ∈ Λ, f (x ) ≤		f (x  ) ≤	 (		f (x )).	Then,
Wγ fλ∗ (xγ) ≤ Wγ (Wλ fλ(xγ)) and thus Wλ(Wγ fλ(xγ)) ≤ Wγ (Wλ fλ(xγ)). It follows
Let g ∈ W∗(A, B) be an upper bound for the increasing net (fλ)λ∈Λ. For λJ ∈ Λ and x ∈ A+, fλ∗ (x) ≤ g(x). Then, ∀x ∈ A+,f (x)= fλ(x) ≤ g(x), i.e. f ± g. It follows that f is the join of (fλ)λ∈Λ.	2
This theorem generalizes the fact that the effects of a W*-algebra A (i.e. the positive unital maps from C2 to A) form a directed-complete poset [15, III.3.13-16]. Moreover, it turns out that Theorem 2.2 can be slightly generalized to the following theorem, with a similar proof.
Theorem 2.7 Let A and B be two C*-algebras.
If [0, 1]B is directed-complete, then the poset (C∗(A, B), ±) is directed-complete.

Dcpo⊥!-enrichment for W*-algebras
In this section, we will provide a Dcpo⊥!-enrichment for the category W∗ and discuss the domain-theoretic properties of C*-algebras.
Definition 2.8 Let C be a category for which every hom-set is equipped with the structure of a poset. C is said to be Dcpo⊥!-enriched if its hom-sets are dcpos with

bottom and if the composition of homomorphisms is strict and Scott-continuous,
i.e. the pre-composition (−) ◦ f : C(B, C) → C(A, C) and the post-composition h ◦ (−) : C(A, B) → C(A, C) are strict and Scott-continuous for homomorphisms f : A → B and h : B → C.
Theorem 2.9 The category W∗ is a Dcpo⊥!-enriched category.
Proof.
For every pair (A, B) of W*-algebras, W∗(A, B) together with the L¨owner order is a dcpo with zero map as bottom, and therefore W∗(A, B) ∈ Dcpo⊥!.
In particular, for every W*-algebra A, W∗(A, A) ∈ Dcpo⊥!. We consider now for every W*-algebra A a map IA : 1A = {⊥A} → W∗(A, A) such that IA(⊥) ∈ W∗(A, A) is the identity map on A. The map IA is clearly strict Scott-continuous for every W*-algebra A.
Then, what need to be proved is that, given three W*-algebras A, B, C, the composition ◦A,B,C : W∗(B, C) × W∗(A, B) → W∗(A, C) is Scott-continuous (the strictness of the composition can be easily verified).
We now consider a NsU-map f : A → B and the increasing net (gλ)λ∈Λ in W∗(B, C), with join  g ∈ W∗(B, C). One can define an upper bound pointwise by u(x)= (( λ gλ) ◦f )(x) for the increasing net (gλ ◦f )λ∈Λ in W∗(A, C). It is easy to check that u is a join for the increasing net (gλ ◦ f )λ∈Λ: for every upper bound v ∈ W∗(A, C) of the increasing net (gλ ◦ f )λ∈Λ, we have that ∀λ ∈ Λ, gλ ◦ f ± v,
i.e. ∀λ ∈ Λ, ∀x ∈ A+, g (f (x)) ≤ v(x) and thus ∀x ∈ A+, u(x)= ((  g ) ◦ f )(x)= (  λ gλ)(f (x)) ≤ v(x), which implies that u ± v. It follows that the pre-composition is Scott-continuous and, similarly, the post-composition is Scott-continuous.   2
In operator theory, a C*-algebra is monotone-complete (or monotone-closed) if it is directed-complete for bounded increasing nets of positive elements. The notion of monotone-completeness goes back at least to Dixmier [4] and Kadison [5] but, to our knowledge, it is the first time that the notion of monotone-completeness is explicitly related to the notion of directed-completeness. The interested reader will find in Appendix A a more detailed correspondence between operator theory and order theory.
It is natural to ask if all monotone-complete C*-algebras are W*-algebras. Dixmier proved that every W*-algebra is a monotone-complete C*-algebra and that the converse is not true [4]. For an example of a subclass of monotone-complete C*-algebras which are not W*-algebras, we refer the reader to a recent work by Saitˆo and Wright [12].

A fixpoint theorem for endofunctors on W*-algebras
In this section, we will show that it is possible to exhibit a fixpoint for a specific class of endofunctors on W*-algebras, that we will define later.
For this purpose, we first observe that the one-element W*-algebra 0 = {0} is the zero object, i.e. initial and terminal object, of the category W∗: a NsU-map

f : A → 0 must be defined by f (x) = 0; a NsU-map g : 0 → A is linear and thus
g(0) = 0A must holds.
We will now consider the following class of functors and then show that they admit a canonical fixpoint.
Definition 3.1 A von Neumann functor is a locally continuous endofunctor on W∗
which preserves multiplicative maps.
Example 3.2 The identity functor and the constant functors on W∗ are locally continuous and so does any (co)product of locally continuous functors. It is also clear that all those functors preserve multiplicative maps.
Secondly, our proofs and structures will use the notion of embedding-projection pairs, that we will define as follows.
Definition 3.3 An embedding-projection pair is a pair of arrows ⟨e, p⟩∈ C(X, Y )×
C(Y, X) in a Dcpo⊥-enriched category C such that p ◦ e = idX and e ◦ p ≤ idY .
For two pairs ⟨e1, p1⟩, ⟨e2, p2⟩, it can be shown that e1 ≤ e2 iff p2 ≤ p1, which means that one component of the pair can uniquely determine the other one. We denote by eP the projection corresponding to a given embedding e and pE the embedding corresponding to a given projection p. It should be noted that (e◦f )P = f P ◦ eP , (p ◦ q)E = qE ◦ pE and idP = idE = id.
The category CE of embeddings of a Dcpo⊥!-enriched category C is the subcat- egory of C that has objects of C has objects and embeddings as arrows. It should be noted that this category is itself a Dcpo⊥!-enriched category. Dually, one can
define the category CP = (CE)op of projections of a Dcpo -enriched category C.
An endofunctor F on a Dcpo⊥!-enriched category C is locally continuous (resp. locally monotone) if FX,Y : C(X, Y ) → C(FX, FY ) is Scott-continuous (resp. monotone).
We can now consider the following setting. Let F : W∗ → W∗ be a von Neumann functor. Consider the ω-chain Δ = (Dn, αn)n for which D0 = 0, the embedding α0 : D0 → FD0 is the unique NsU-map from D0 to FD0, and the equalities αn+1 = Fαn and Dn+1 = FDn hold for every n ≥ 0.
Since the endofunctor F is locally monotone, if for some n ∈ N there is an
embedding-projection pair αE, αP , the pair αE  , αP	 = FαE,FαP  is also



Definition 3.4 Consider the collection D = {(x
n)n
∈  n Dn
| ∀n ≥ 0, αp (x
n+1)= 

xn}. It forms a poset together with the order ≤D defined by (xn)n ≤D (yn)n ≡
∀n ≥ 0, xn ≤Dn yn. Moreover, the collection D can be seen as a *-algebra:
From the fact that the projection αP : D1 → D0 = 0 is trivially a multiplicative map (which maps everything to the unique element of 0) and that the functor F preserves multiplicative maps, we can conclude that for every n ≥ 0, the projection

P
n+1
= FαP
= ··· = Fn+1αP
is a NMIsU-map. In fact, it can be shown that

the embeddings αn : Dn → Dn+1 are NMIsU-maps as well, by the same reasoning.
Moreover, it should also be noted that embeddings and projections are strict, i.e.

preserves 0.
Considering these facts, one can verify that the collection D forms a *-algebra with operations defined component-wise on the family of W*-algebras {Dn}n≥0.
E
The unit is defined by (1n)n = (1Dn )n. From the fact that the embeddings α  are
NsU-maps, i.e. αE(1) ≤ 1 for every n ∈ N, we deduce that 1 = (αP ◦ αE)(1) ≤
n	n	n
αP (1) for every n ∈ N (recall that the projection αP is an order-preserving map).

Hence, every projection αP is a unital map and thus αP (1n+1) = αP (1n) holds
n	n	n
for every n ∈ N.
The addition is defined by (xn)n +D (yn)n = (xn +Dn yn)n for all (xn)n, (yn)n ∈ D.

This operation is well-defined: since the projections αP
are linear maps, one can

observe that αP (0n+1) = 0n and αP (xn+1 + yn+1) = αP (xn+1)+ αP (yn+1) = 
n	n	n	n
xn + yn for every n ∈ N. Moreover, by the triangle inequality, supn  xn + yn  ≤ 
supn  xn  + supn  yn  < ∞.
The scalar multiplication is defined by λ(xn)n = (λxn)n for every λ ∈ C and and every (xn)n ∈ D. It is easy to verify that this operation is well-defined: αP (λxn+1) = λαP (xn+1) = λxn for every n ∈ N (by linearity of αP ) and
n	n	n
 (λxn)n  ∞ = λ (xn)n  ∞ < ∞.
The multiplication is defined by (xn)n ·D (yn)n = (xn ·Dn yn)n for all (xn)n, (yn)n ∈

D. This operation is well-defined since the projections αP
are multiplicatives:

αP (xn+1 · yn+1)= αP (xn+1) · αP (yn+1)= xn · yn.
n	n	n
Moreover, the Banach spaces Dn are submultiplicatives and thus the following
inequality holds: supn  xn · yn  ≤ (supn  xn  )(supn  yn  ) < ∞.
The involution is defined by ((xn)n)∗ = (x∗ )n for every (xn)n ∈ D.

This operation is well-defined since the projections αP
are involutives:

αP (x∗	) = αP (xn+1)∗ = x∗ . Moreover, as a direct consequence of the C*-
n	n+1	n	n
identity of the C*-algebras Dn, the following equality holds:	supn  x∗   =
supn  xn  < ∞.
Proposition 3.5 The *-algebra D forms a C*-algebra.
Proof. Since every Dn is a C*-algebra, the C*-identity holds for D as well:

 (xn)∗ (xn)n  ∞
= (x∗ xn)n  ∞
= supn  x∗ xn  = supn  xn  2 =(  (xn)n

Consider a Cauchy sequence ((xm,n)n)m ∈ D. It follows that for every nJ ∈ N,
the following proposition holds: ∀ε > 0, ∃M ∈ N, ∀m, mJ ≥ M,  xm,n∗ − xm∗,n∗	≤

We are required to prove that the Cauchy sequence ((xm,n)n)m ∈ D converges, by constructing its limit that we will denote by (ln)n. We can first deduce that, for every n ∈ N, the sequence (xm,n)m in Dn is a Cauchy sequence, which converges to a limit ln ∈ Dn since Dn is a W*-algebra (and therefore a Banach space). Then, we obtain a sequence (ln)n ∈  n∈N Dn. Since PsU-maps (and therefore NMIsU-maps) are contractive, we can conclude that (ln)n ∈ D by the following arguments.
Let n ∈ N and ε > 0. From the fact that the inequality  xm,n+1 − ln+1  < ε holds, we deduce that ̈αP (xm,n+1) − αP (ln+1)̈ = ̈αP (xm,n+1 − ln+1)̈ ≤

αP (ln+1). Moreover,  (ln)n  ∞
= supn  ln  < ∞ since ln is the limit of a Cauchy

sequence (recall that every Cauchy sequence is bounded).	2
This leads us to the following new result.
Theorem 3.6 The category W∗ is algebraically compact for the class of von Neu- mann functors, i.e. every von Neumann functor F admits a canonical ﬁxpoint and there is an isomorphism between the initial F-algebra and the inverse of the ﬁnal F-coalgebra.
The proof of this theorem involves the following notions.
Definition 3.7 An ω-chain in a category C is a sequence of the form Δ = D0 −α→0
D1 −α→1  · · ·
Given an object D in a category C, a cocone μ :Δ → D for the ω-chain Δ is a sequence of arrows μn : Dn → D such that the equality μn = μn+1 ◦ αn holds for every n ≥ 0.
A colimit (or colimiting cocone) of the ω-chain Δ is an initial cocone from Δ to
D, i.e. it has the following universal property: for every cocone μJ :Δ → DJ, there

exists a unique map f : D → DJ such that the equality f ◦ μn = μJ
holds for every

n ≥ 0.
Dually, we will consider ωop-chains Δop = D

β

γ : Δop → D and limits (or limiting cones) for an ωop-chain Δop.
Proof. [Proof of Theorem 3.6] Together with its previously defined order, the C*-algebra D is monotone-complete, since all the W*-algebras Dn are monotone- complete. Moreover, a separating set of normal states can be defined for D, on the separating set of normal states of the W*-algebras Dn. We can then conclude by Theorem A.4 that D forms a W*-algebra and we are now required to prove that it can be turn into a colimit for the diagram Δ.
We now define a cocone Δ → D which arrows are embeddings μn : Dn → D(n ≥
0) defined by:

μn(x)= ((αP ◦· · · ◦ αP	)(x), (αP ◦ ··· ◦ αP
)(x),..., αP
(x), x, αE(x), (αE	◦

αE)(x),.. .) for every x ∈ Dn. It is easy to check that for every m ∈ N if we
define a sequence (yn)n = μm(x), then the equation αP (yn+1) = yn holds for every n ∈ N. Moreover, as a positive map, the embedding μn is contractive and thus μn(x)  ∞ ≤ supn  x  = x  ∞ < ∞.
μP ((xn)n)= xn for every (xn)n ∈ D.
Indeed, it is easy to check that those projections μP are NMIU-maps by construc- tion and that the corresponding embeddings μE are NMIsU-maps by construction.
Then, one can see that μP (μE(x)) = x for every x  ∈  Dn and that
n	n
μE(μP ((xn)n)) ≤ (xn)n for every (xn)n ∈ D since:

For every m ∈ N such that 0 ≤ m < n, (αP

every m ≤ n;
From the fact that αE ◦αP ≤ idD	for every n ∈ N, we obtain that αE(xn)=

αE(αP (xn+1)) ≤ xn+1 for every n ∈ N and thus by induction, αE ◦ · · · ◦

Moreover, for every n  ≥ 0, we observe that μn	=  μn+1 ◦ αn  since
αP (μP	((xn)n)) = αP (xn+1) = xn = μP ((xn)n) and thus μP = αP ◦ μP	=
n	n+1	n	n	n	n	n+1

(μn+1 ◦ αn)P .
As stated in [9], the fact that F is locally continuous implies that Wn

(μn ◦μP )= 

idD, and thus μ :Δ → D is a colimiting cocone for Δ by [14, Theorem 2,Proposition
A]. Dually, one can show that μP : D → ΔP is a limiting cone for ΔP , the cone of
αP	αP
projections D0 →−0− D1 →−1− ··· .
Since F is locally continuous, it is therefore locally monotone. It follows that :
For every n ∈ N,  Fμn,FμP  is an embedding-projection pair;
The chain {Fμn ◦ FμP }n is increasing with join W (Fμn ◦ FμP )= idFD.
From [14, Theorem 2] again, we conclude that Fμ : F Δ → FD is a colimiting cocone (and dually FμP : FD → F ΔP is a limiting cone). Then, we observe that F Δ is obtained by removing the first arrow from Δ (recall that Fαn = αn+1). Finally, the fact that two colimiting cocone with the same vertices are isomorphic implies that D and FD share the same limit and the same colimit and that there is an isomorphism φ : D → FD, i.e. the functor F admits a fixpoint.	2
We will now consider as example the construction of the natural numbers.
Example 3.8 The functor defined by FX = X ⊕ C gives the chain of embeddings
0 → C → C2 → C3 →   , where Cn is the direct sum of n copies of C. The relation
αE	= αE ⊕ idC holds for every n ∈ N and thus by induction, αE = αE ⊕ idCn .
n+1	n	n	0
Hence, for every n ∈ N, αE : Cn = 0 ⊕ Cn → Cn+1 is defined by αE(c1,..., cn)= 
n	n
(0, c1,..., cn).

Similarly, for every n ∈ N, αP
= αP
⊕ idCn  : Cn+1 → Cn is defined by

αP (c1, c2,..., cn) = (c2,..., cn) and thus the property αP (xn+1) = xn holds for
every (xn)n ∈  i≥1 Ci =  i≥0 C.
It follows that D =	C = l∞(N) for this functor. More generally, if one
consider a functor FX = X ⊕ A where A is a W*-algebra, then D =  i≥0 A.
Streams of qubits

We will now consider the functor FX = (X⊗A) ⊕ C to represent the construction of a list of unbounded length whose elements are in a W*-algebra A. It should be noted that in this setting, the functor FX = (X⊗M2)⊕C represent the construction of a list of unbounded length whose elements are qubits.
The functor defined by FX = (X⊗A) ⊕ C gives the chain of embeddings 0 →
C → A ⊕ C → 2 · A ⊕ A ⊕ C → · · · where n · A denotes the spatial tensor of n

copies of A. Assume that this functor has a canonical fixpoint D (this point will be discussed in the next subsection).

From the relation αE
= (αE
⊗ idA) ⊕ idC(n  ∈ N), we obtain by in-

duction that αE
= (αE
⊗ idn·A) ⊕ id(n—1)·A ⊕··· ⊕ idA ⊕ idC for every n  ∈

N.	It follows that an embedding αE	:  n · A ⊕ · · · ⊕ A ⊕ C  →  (n +

1) · A ⊕ · · · ⊕ A ⊕ C (n ∈ N) is defined by αn (⟨a1 ,..., an⟩ ,..., a1
( 0, an—1,..., an—1 , an—1,..., an—1 ,..., a1 , x).
, x) =

It is clear that the corresponding projection is π2,(n+1)·A⊕···⊕A⊕C and thus D =
i≥0 i · A (where, by convention, we denote C by 0 · A).

Remark 4.1 It is well known that  i≥1A is the colimit of the (trivial) diagram
 
maps.  However in our framework, the functor F = −⊗A is associated to the
diagram 0 → 0⊗A = 0 → 0⊗A = 0 → · · · .

4.1  Remarks about complete positivity

Unfortunately, the functor FX = (X⊗A) ⊕ C does not preserve NsU-maps. How- ever, one might consider restricting to NcPsU-maps to consider such functor. There is a Dcpo⊥!-enrichment for the category W∗cP of W*-algebras together with NcPsU-maps, investigated independently by Cho [2], who proposed the following variation of the L¨owner order :
f ±cP g if and only if g − f is completely positive, i.e. ∀n.∀x.Mn(f )(x) ≤ Mn(g)(x).
In fact, the following proposition shows that our domain-theoretic structure do not change if one restricts to completely-positive maps.
Proposition 4.2 Let f and g be two NsU-maps from a W*-algebra A to a W*- algebra B. If f and g are completely positive maps, then the relation f ±cP g holds if and only if the relation f ± g (Deﬁnition 2.1) holds.
Proof. If g − f is completely positive with f and g completely positive (i.e. f ±cP
g), it is therefore positive and thus it is clear that f ±cP g implies f ± g.
Conversely, we will now show that f ± g implies f ±cP g when f and g are completely positive maps. It is equivalent to show that if f and f + g are completely positive maps, then g is positive implies that g is completely positive.
By the Hahn-Banach theorem, if we consider P = W∗(A, B) as a normed vector space (defined pointwise) and cP = W∗cP(A, B) as a linear subspace of P and if we consider an element z ∈/ P \ span(cP ), then there is a (continuous) linear map ϕ : P → R with ϕ(x) = 0 for every x ∈ cP and ϕ(z)= 1.
We will now apply this fact. If the map g is just positive and not completely positive, we obtain that ϕ(g) = 1 and therefore ϕ(f + g)= ϕ(f )+ ϕ(g)= 0 + 1=1 by linearity. But this is absurd since, by assumption, the map f + g is completely positive, and thus ϕ(f + g) = 0. It follows that g is completely positive.	2
Then, it is easy to see that every directed join of completely positive maps is

completely positive map as well (using the fact that M( i fi)=	i M(fi) for every direct set of completely positive maps {fi}i).
Moreover, as shown in [7], the direct sums and the spatial tensor products of W*-algebras can be turned into endofunctors −⊕− : W∗cP × W∗cP → W∗cP and
−⊗− : W∗cP × W∗cP → W∗cP, which are von Neumann functors.
Concluding remarks
The theorem 2.2 provides a Dcpo⊥!-enrichment for the category W∗ of W*- algebras with NsU-maps, while the theorem 3.6 gives a canonical fixpoint for every multiplicative map-preservering locally continuous endofunctor on W∗. We believe that these two theorems are encouraging enough to consider further investigations of the semantics of quantum computation, using W*-algebras.

A	Correspondence between operator theory and order theory
In this section, we will provide the following correspondence table between operator theory and order theory, where A and B are C*-algebras.

In the standard litterature [1,15], monotone-closed C*-algebras and normal maps are defined as follows.
Definition A.1 A C*-algebra A is monotone-closed (or monotone-complete) if ev- ery bounded increasing net of positive elements of A has a join in A+.
A positive map φ : A → B between C*-algebras is normal (or a N-map) if every increasing net (x )	in A+ with a join	x ∈ A+ is such that the net (φ(x ))
is an increasing net in B+ with join	φ(xλ)= φ(	xλ).
In the standard definition of the notion of monotone-closedness, the increasing nets are not required to be bounded by the unit, like in the definitions we used in this thesis. We will now show that we can assume that the upper bound is the unit, without loss of generality.
Proposition A.2 A C*-algebra A is monotone-closed if and only if the poset
([0, 1]A, ≤) is directed-complete.
Proof. Let A be a C*-algebra.
If A is monotone-closed, then, by definition every increasing net of positive elements bounded by 1 has a join in [0, 1]A and therefore, the poset ([0, 1]A, ≤) is directed-complete.
Conversely, suppose that [0, 1]A is directed-complete. We now consider an in- creasing net of positive elements (aλ)λ∈Λ in A+, bounded by a nonzero positive element b ∈ A+. Then, it restricts to an increasing net (  aλ )λ∈Λ in [0, 1]A since

b ≤ b  · 1. By assumption, the increasing net (  aλ )λ∈Λ has a join W
 aλ
b
∈ [0, 1]A

and thus b Wλ
 aλ
b
is an upper bound for (aλ)λ∈Λ.

Let c ∈ A+ be an upper bound for the increasing net (aλ)λ∈Λ such that c ≤ b.
For every λJ ∈ Λ, aλ∗ ≤ c ≤ b ≤  b  · 1 and thus  c  is an upper bound for the

increasing net( aλ )λ∈Λ. It follows that W
 aλ
  
≤  c  and therefore, b  W
 aλ
  
≤ c.

conclude that A is monotone-closed.	2
In this thesis, we have chosen to use the standard definition of normal maps. However, one can say that a PsU-map is normal if its restriction f : [0, 1]A → [0, 1]B is Scott-continuous.
Proposition A.3 A PsU-map f : A → B between C*-algebras is normal if and only if its restriction f : [0, 1]A → [0, 1]B is Scott-continuous.
Proof. Let f : A → B be a positive map between two C*-algebras A and B.
If f is normal, then by definition every increasing net (xλ)λ∈Λ in [0, 1]A ⊆ A+ with join  x  ∈ [0, 1] is such that the net (f (x ))  is an increasing net in [0, 1]B ⊆ B+ with join  f (xλ)= f ( xλ) ∈ [0, 1]B. That is to say, the restriction f : [0, 1]A → [0, 1]B is Scott-continuous.
Conversely, suppose that the restriction f : [0, 1]A → [0, 1]B is Scott-continuous. Let (xλ)λ∈Λ be an increasing net in A+ with a nonzero join y ∈ A+. Since y ≤  y  · 1, it restricts to an increasing net (  xλ )λ∈Λ in [0, 1]A with a join  y  . From the
y	y
Scott-continuity of f : [0, 1]A → [0, 1]B, we deduce that the net (f (  xλ ))λ∈Λ is an
increasing net in [0, 1]B with join W f(  xλ ) = f (  y  ) ∈ [0, 1]B. It follows that the
net (f (xλ))λ∈Λ, which is equal to ( y f (  xλ ))λ∈Λ by linearity, is an increasing net
in B+ with an upper bound y  W f (  xλ )= f (  y   y  )= f (y) ∈ B+.
the fact that f (xλ∗ ) ≤ z and therefore f ( xλ∗ ) = f(xλ∗ ) ≤  z  for every λJ ∈ Λ, we
y	y	y
obtain that f (  y  ) ≤  z  and thus f (y) ≤ z. It follows that f (y) is the join of the
y	y
increasing net (f (xλ))λ∈Λ. Hence, we can conclude that the map f is normal.  2
It is known that a C*-algebra A is a W*-algebra if and only if it is monotone- complete and admits sufficiently many normal states, i.e. the set of normal states of A separates the points of A, see [15, Theorem 3.16]. By combining this fact and Proposition A.2, one can provide an order-theoretic characterization of W*-algebras, as in the following theorem.
Theorem A.4 Let A be a C*-algebra.
Then A is a W*-algebra if and only if its set of effects [0, 1]A is directed-complete with a separating set of normal states (i.e. ∀x ∈ A, ∃f ∈ W∗(A, [0, 1]C),f (x) /= 0).
The proof will be postponed until after the following theorem, which can be found in [15], and the following lemma.
Theorem A.5 Every C*-algebra A admits a faithful (i.e. injective) representation,
i.e. an injective *-homomorphism π : A → B(H) for some Hilbert space H. A C*- algebra A is a W*-algebra if and only if there is a faithful representation π : A → B(H), for some Hilbert space H, such that π(A) is a strongly-closed subalgebra of B(H).

Lemma A.6 For each W*-algebra A, there is an isomorphism A  span(N£(A))J, where N£(A)= W∗(A, [0, 1]) is the collection of normal states of A.
Proof. We now consider the map ζX : X → XJJ defined by ζX (x)(φ) = φ(x) for x ∈ X and φ ∈ XJ. Let A be a W*-algebra. We observe that ζA∗ : A∗ → AJ is a “canonical embedding” of A∗ into AJ and it can be proved that A∗ is a linear subspace of AJ generated by the normal states of A, i.e. ζA∗ (A∗) = span(N£(A)), see the proof of [11, Theorem 1.13.2]. Then, we can now consider the induced surjection ζA∗ : A∗ → span(N£(A)), which turns out to be injective (and thus bijective): for every pair (x, y) ∈ A∗×A∗ such that x /= y, there is a f ∈ N£(A) such that ζA∗ (x)(f )= f (x) /= f (y)= ζA∗ (y)(f ), which implies that ζA∗ (x) /= ζA∗ (y).
Then for every W*-algebra, from A∗ span(N£(A)) for every W*-algebra A, we obtain that A = (A∗)J  span(N£(A))J .
2
Proof. [Proof of Theorem A.4] Let A be a C*-algebra.
Suppose that A is a W*-algebra. Then, by Corollary 2.5, [0, 1]A is a dcpo and thus A is monotone-complete by Proposition A.2. Moreover, we know by Lemma A.6 that there is an isomorphism ζA : A → span(N£(A))J defined by ζA(a)(ϕ)= ϕ(a) for a ∈ A and ϕ ∈ AJ. Therefore, ζA is injective and thus for every pair (x, y) of distinct elements of A, ζA(x) /= ζA(y), which means that there is a ϕ ∈ N£(A) such that ϕ(x)= ζA(x)(ϕ) /= ζA(y)(ϕ)= ϕ(y). It follows that the set N£(A) is a separating set for A.
Conversely, suppose that A is monotone-closed and admits its normal states as a separating set.
There is a representation π : A → B(H), for some Hilbert space H, induced by the normal states on A, by the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction [15, Theorem I.9.14, Definition I.9.15]:
Every normal state ω on A induces a representation πω : A → ¥(Hω) such that there is a vector ξω such that ω(x)= ⟨πω(x)ξω|ξω⟩ for every x ∈ A
We define a Hilbert space H, which is the direct sum of the Hilbert spaces Hω, where ω is a normal state on A.
The representation π : A → ¥(H) is defined pointwise for every x ∈ A: π(x) is the bounded operator on H defined as the direct sum of the bounded operators πω(x) on Hω, where ω is a normal state on A.
By assumption, the set of normal states of A is a separating set for A and thus, for every pair of distincts elements x, y in A, there is a state ρ on A such that
⟨πρ(x)ξρ|ξρ⟩ = ρ(x) /= ρ(y)= ⟨πρ(y)ξρ|ξρ⟩ and thus πρ(x) /= πρ(y) for some state ρ
on A. It follows that π(x) /= π(y) and hence, the representation π is faithful.
Let ρ be a normal state on A. Since A is monotone-closed, every directed set (ρ(x ))  in ¥(H) has a join  ρ(x )= ρ(  x ). According to the definition we gave earlier of πρ, this imply that πρ(xλ) converges weakly to  λ πρ(xλ). Since a
bounded net of positive operators converges strongly whenever it converges weakly (see [1, I.3.2.8]), it turns out that Wλ πρ(xλ) is the strong limit of (πρ(xλ))λ∈Λ in

¥(Hρ). Hence, the strong limit of (π(xλ))λ∈Λ in ¥(H) exists in ¥(H) and is defined as the direct sum of the strong limit of the nets (πω(xλ))λ∈Λ where ω is a normal state on A. Thus, π(A) is strongly closed in ¥(H) and thus A is a W*-algebra (by Theorem A.5).	2
It is important to note that, in one of the very first articles about W*-algebras [5], Kadison defined W*-algebras as monotone-closed C*-algebras which separates the points. However, to our knowledge, this definition never became standard.
