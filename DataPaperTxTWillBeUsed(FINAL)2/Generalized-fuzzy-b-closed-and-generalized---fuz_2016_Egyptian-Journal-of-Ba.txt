Introduction

A progressive development of fuzzy sets [1] has been made to discover the fuzzy analogues of the crisp sets theory. On the other hand, the idea of intuitionistic fuzzy sets was first in- troduced by Atanassov [2]. Later on, Çoker [3] presented the
notion of intuitionistic fuzzy topology. Samanta and Mondal [4], introduced and characterized the intuitionistic gradation of openness of fuzzy sets which is a generalization of smooth topology and the topology of intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The name “intuitionistic” is discontinued in mathematics and applica- tions. Garcia and Rodabaugh [5] concluded that they work under the name “double”.

In 2009, Omari and Noorani [6] introduced generalized b-closed sets (briefly, gb-closed) in general topology. As a gen- eralization of the results in References 6 and 7, we introduce and study (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed sets in double fuzzy topological spaces, then a new class of fuzzy sets between an (r, s)-fuzzy b-closed sets and an (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed sets namely (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-closed sets is intro- duced and investigated. Finally, the relationships between (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed and (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-closed sets are introduced and established with some inter- esting counter examples.


Preliminaries

Throughout this paper, X will be a non-empty set, I = [0, 1], I0 = (0, 1] and I1 = [0, 1). A fuzzy set h is quasi-coincident with a fuzzy set μ (denoted by, hqμ) iff there exists x ∈ X such that
(x)  (x)  1 and they are not quasi-coincident otherwise (denoted by, q ). The family of all fuzzy sets on X is denoted
by IX. By 0 and 1, we denote the smallest and the greatest fuzzy sets on X. For a fuzzy set h ∈ IX, 1   denotes its comple- ment. All other notations are standard notations of fuzzy set
theory.
Now, we recall the following definitions which are useful in the sequel.

Definition 2.1. (see [4]) A double fuzzy topology (τ, τ*) on X is a pair of maps τ, τ* : IX → I, which satisfies the following properties:


The triplet (X, τ, τ*) is called a double fuzzy topological space (briefly, dfts). A fuzzy set h is called an (r, s)-fuzzy open (briefly, (r, s)-fo) if τ(h) ≥ r and τ*(h) ≤ s. A fuzzy set h is called an (r, s)- fuzzy closed (briefly, (r, s)-fc) set iff 1   is an (r, s)-fo set.

Theorem 2.1. (see [8]) Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. Then double fuzzy closure operator and double fuzzy interior operator of h ∈ IX are defined by

C, *(, r, s)  { IX   , (1  )  r,  *(1  )  s},

I, *(, r, s)  { IX   , ()  r,  *()  s}.
(r, s)-generalized fuzzy open (briefly, (r, s)-gfo) iff 1   is (r, s)-gfc set.

Definition 2.3. (see [11,12]) Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. For each h, μ ∈ IX and r ∈ I0, s ∈ I1. Then, a fuzzy set h is said to be (r, s)- fuzzy generalized ψρ-closed (briefly, (r, s)-fgψρ-closed) if
C, *(, r, s)   such that h ≤ μ and μ is (r, s)-fuzzy ρ-open set. h is called (r, s)-fuzzy generalized ψρ-open (briefly, (r, s)-fgψρ- open) iff 1   is (r, s)-fgψρ-closed set.


(r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed sets

In this section, we introduce and study some basic proper- ties of a new class of fuzzy sets called an (r, s)-fuzzy b-closed sets and an (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed.

Definition 3.1. Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. For each h ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and
s ∈ I1. A fuzzy set h is called:

An (r, s)-fuzzy b-closed (briefly, (r, s)-fbc) if

  (I, *(C, *(, r, s), r, s))  (C, *(I, *(, r, s), r, s)).

λ is called an (r, s)-fuzzy b-open (briefly, (r, s)-fbo) iff 1   is (r, s)-fbc set.
An (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed (briefly, (r, s)-gfbc) if bC, *(, r, s)   , h ≤ μ, τ(μ) ≥ r and τ*(μ) ≤ s. h is called an (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-open (briefly, (r, s)-gfbo) iff 1   is (r, s)-gfbc set.

Definition 3.2. Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. Then double fuzzy b-closure operator and double fuzzy b-interior operator of h ∈ IX are defined by

bC, *(, r, s)  { IX    and  is (r, s)-fbc},

bI, *(, r, s)  { IX    and  is (r, s)-fbo}.

Where r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1 such that r + s ≤ 1.

Remark 3.1. Every (r, s)-fbc set is an (r, s)-gfbc set.

The converse of the above remark may be not true as shown by the following example.

Example 3.1. Let X = {a, b}. Defined μ, α and β by:


Where r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1 such that r + s ≤ 1.

Definition 2.2. Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. For each h ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and
s ∈ I1. A fuzzy set h is called:

An (r, s)-fuzzy semiopen (see [9]) (briefly, (r, s)-fso) if
  C, *(I, *(, r, s), r, s) . h is called an (r, s)-fuzzy semi closed (briefly, (r, s)-fsc) iff 1   is an (r, s)-fso set.
An (r, s)-generalized fuzzy closed (see [10]) (briefly, (r, s)- gfc) if C, *(, r, s)  , h ≤ μ, τ(μ) ≥ r and τ*(μ) ≤ s. h is called an

Definition 3.3. Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts, h ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. h
is called an (r, s)-fuzzy b-Q-neighborhood of xt ∈ Pt(X) if there
bI, *(0, r, s)  0,
	
bI, *(, r, s)   ,
bI, *(1, r, s)  1 ,
	


exists an (r, s)-fbo set μ ∈ IX such that xtqμ and μ ≤ h.

The family of all (r, s)-fuzzy b-Q-neighborhood of xt denoted by b-Q(xt, r, s).

Theorem 3.1. Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. Then for each h, μ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0
and s ∈ I1, the operator bC, * satisfies the following statements:
If h is an (r, s)-fbo, then   bI, *(, r, s),
If h ≤ μ, then bI, *(, r, s)  bI, *(, r, s),
bI, *(bI, *(, r, s), r, s)  bI, *(, r, s) ,
bI, *(  , r, s)  bI, *(, r, s)  bI, *(, r, s),
bI, *(  , r, s)  bI, *(, r, s)  bI, *(, r, s).


Proof. It is similar to Theorem 3.1.

Theorem 3.3. Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. h ∈ IX is (r, s)-gfbo set, r ∈ I0
and s ∈ I1 if and only if    bI, *(, r, s) whenever μ ≤ h,
(1  )  r and  *(1  )  s.
	

Proof. Suppose that h is an (r, s)-gfbo set in IX, and let (1  )  r and  *(1  )  s such that μ ≤ h. By the definition, 1   is an (r, s)-gfbc set in IX. So,




Proof. (1), (2), (3), and (4) are proved easily.

Let q and μ is an (r, s)-fbo set, then   1  . But we have, μqh iff qbC, *(, r, s) and
bC, *(, r, s)  bC, *(1  , r, s)  1  ,
	

so  qbC, *(, r, s), which is contradiction. Then μqh iff
qbC, *(, r, s) .
Let xt be a fuzzy point such that xt § bC, *(, r, s). Then there is an (r, s)-fuzzy b-Q neighborhood μ of xt such that q . But by (5), we have an (r, s)-fuzzy b-Q-neighborhood μ of xt such that

qbC, *(, r, s)

Also,

xt § bC, *(bC, *(, r, s), r, s).

Then

bC, *(bC, *(, r, s), r, s)  bC, *(, r, s).
bC, *(1  , r, s)  1  


Also,

1  bI, *(, r, s)  1  .
	

And then,

  bI, *(, r, s).

Conversely, let μ ≤ h, (1  )  r and  *(1  )  s, r ∈ I0 and
s ∈ I1 such that   bI, *(, r, s). Now

1  bI, *(, r, s)  1  ,
	

Thus

bC, *(1  , r, s)  1  .
	
That is, 1   is an (r, s)-gfbc set, then h is an (r, s)-gfbo set. Theorem 3.4. Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts, h ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. If h
is an (r, s)-gfbc set, then



But we have,
bC, *(, r, s)  
sets.
does not contain any non-zero (r, s)-fc

bC, *(bC, *(, r, s), r, s)  bC, *(, r, s).

Therefore

bC, *(bC, *(, r, s), r, s)  bC, *(, r, s).

(7) and (8) are obvious.

Theorem 3.2. Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. Then for each h, μ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1, the operator bI, * satisfies the following statements:
h is an (r, s)-fbc iff bC, *(, r, s)   is (r, s)-fc.
μ is  (r, s)-gfbc  set  for  each  set  μ ∈ IX  such  that
    bC, *(, r, s).
For each (r, s)-fo set μ ∈ IX such that μ ≤ h, μ is an (r, s)-gfbc relative to h if and only if μ is an (r, s)-gfbc in IX.
For each an (r, s)-fbo set μ ∈ IX such that bC, *(, r, s)q iff


q .

Proof. (1) Suppose that (1  )  r and  *(1  )  s, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1 such that   bC, *(, r, s)   whenever h ∈ IX is an (r, s)- gfbc set. Since 1   is an (r, s)-fo set,




  (1  )  bC, *(, r, s)  (1  )
	
   (1  bC, *(, r, s))

   (1  bC, *(, r, s))  (bC, *(, r, s)   )

 0


and hence   0 which is a contradiction. Then bC, *(, r, s)  

does not contain any non-zero (r, s)-fc sets.
Let h be an (r, s)-gfbc set. So, for each r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1 if
h is an (r, s)-fbc set then,

bC, *(, r, s)    0


which is an (r, s)-fc set.
Conversely, suppose that bC, *(, r, s)   is an (r, s)-fc set. Then by (1), bC, *(, r, s)   does not contain any non-zero an (r, s)-fc set. But bC, *(, r, s)   is an (r, s)-fc set, then

bC, *(, r, s)    0    bC, *(, r, s).


So, h is an (r, s)-fbc set.
Suppose that τ(α) ≥ r and τ*(α) ≤ s where r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1
such that μ ≤ α and let h be an (r, s)-gfbc set such that h ≤ α.
Then

bC, *(, r, s)  .

So,

bC, *(, r, s)  bC, *(, r, s),

Therefore

bC, *(, r, s)  .

So, μ is an (r, s)-gfbc set.
Let h be an (r, s)-gfbc and τ(h) ≥ r and τ*(h) ≤ s, where r ∈ I0
and s ∈ I1. Then bC, *(, r, s)   . But, μ ≤ h so,

bC, *(, r, s)  bC, *(, r, s)  .

Also, since μ is an (r, s)-gfbc relative to h, then

  bC, *()(, r, s)  bC, *(, r, s),

so

bC, *(, r, s)  bC, *()(, r, s)  .
bC, *(, r, s)    bC, *()(, r, s)  bC, *(, r, s)        .

That is, μ is an (r, s)-gfbc relative to h.
Suppose μ is an (r, s)-fbo and q , r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. Then
  (1  ) . Since (1  ) is an (r, s)-fbc set of IX and h is an (r,
	
s)-gfbc set, then

bC, *(, r, s)q.

Conversely, let μ be an (r, s)-fbc set of IX such that h ≤ μ, r ∈ I0
and s ∈ I1. Then

q(1  ).

But

bC, *(, r, s)q(1  )  bC, *(, r, s)  .

Hence h is an (r, s)-gfbc.

Proposition 3.1. Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts, h ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1.

If h is an (r, s)-gfbc and an (r, s)-fbo set, then h is an (r, s)- fbc set.
If h is an (r, s)-fo and an (r, s)-gfbc, then h ∧ μ is an (r, s)-
gfbc set whenever   bC, *(, r, s).

Proof. (1) Suppose h is an (r, s)-gfbc and an (r, s)-fbo set such that h ≤ h, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. Then

bC, *(, r, s)  .

But we have,

  bC, *(, r, s).

Then,

  bC, *(, r, s).

Therefore, h is an (r, s)-fbc set.
(2) Suppose that h is an (r, s)-fo and an (r, s)-gfbc set, r ∈ I0
and s ∈ I1. Then

bC, *(, r, s)     is an (r, s)-fbc set
    is an (r, s)-fbc
    is an (r, s)-gfbc.



Now, if μ is an (r, s)-gfbc relative to h and τ(α) ≥ r and τ*(α) ≤ s where r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1 such that μ ≤ α, then for each an (r, s)-fo set α ∧ h,          . Hence μ is an (r, s)-gfbc relative to h,

bC, *(, r, s)  bC, *()(, r, s)  (   )  .

Therefore, μ is an (r, s)-gfbc in IX.
Conversely, let μ be an (r, s)-gfbc set in IX and τ(α) ≥ r and τ*(α) ≤ s whenever α ≤ h such that μ ≤ α, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. Then for each an (r, s)-fo set β ∈ IX, α = β ∧ h. But we have, μ is an (r, s)-gfbc set in IX such that μ ≤ β,


(r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-closed sets

In this section, we introduce and study some properties of a new class of fuzzy sets called an (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy closed sets and an (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-closed sets

Definition 4.1. Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. For each h ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and
s ∈ I1. A fuzzy set h is called:



An (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy closed (briefly, (r, s)-g ⋆fc) if C, *(, r, s)   whenever h ≤ μ and μ is an (r, s)-gfo set in IX. h is called an (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy open (briefly, (r, s)-g
⋆fo) iff 1   is (r, s)-g ⋆fc set.

An (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-closed (briefly, (r, s)-g ⋆fbc) if bC, *(, r, s)   whenever h ≤ μ and μ is an (r, s)-gfo set in IX. h is called an (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-open (briefly, (r, s)-g ⋆fbo) iff 1   is (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set.


Theorem 4.1. Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. h ∈ IX is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbo set if and only if   bI, *(, r, s) whenever μ is an (r, s)-gfc, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1.

Proof. Suppose that h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbo set in IX, and let μ is an (r, s)-gfc set such that μ ≤ h, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. So by the defi- nition, we have 1   is an (r, s)-gfo set in IX and 1    1   .
		
But 1   is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set, then bC, *(1  , r, s)  1   .
		
But

bC, *(1  , r, s)  1  bI, *(, r, s)  1  .
		

Therefore,

  bI, *(, r, s).

Conversely, suppose that   bI, *(, r, s) whenever μ ≤ h and
μ is an (r, s)-gfc set, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. Now

1  bI, *(, r, s)  1  ,
	

Thus
But h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set and 1   is an (r, s)-gfo set, then


bC, *(, r, s)  1      bC, *(, r, s)  (1  bC, *(, r, s))  0.
		

Therefore bC, *(, r, s)   contains no non-zero (r, s)-gfc set.
Let h be an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. Then by (1) we have, bC, *(, r, s)   contains no non-zero (r, s)-gfc set. So,
bC, *(, r, s)   is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbo set.
Let h be an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set. If h is an (r, s)-fbc, r ∈ I0 and
s ∈ I1, then

bC, *(, r, s)    0.


Conversely, let bC, *(, r, s)   is an (r, s)-fbc set in IX and h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1, then by (1) we have, bC, *(, r, s)   contains no non-zero (r, s)-gfc set. Then,

bC, *(, r, s)    0,


that is

bC, *(, r, s)  .

Hence h is an (r, s)-fbc set.
Let μ be an (r, s)-gfc set and bI, *(, r, s)  (1   )  , r ∈ I0
and s ∈ I1. Hence

1    bC, *(1  , r, s)    bC, *(1  , r, s)  (1   ).
			

But (1  ) is an (r, s)-gfc and 1   is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc by (1),
	
   0 and hence   1.
		

Proposition 4.2. Let (X, τ, τ*) be dfts’s. For each h and μ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0
and s ∈ I1.

bC, *(1  , r, s)  1  .
	

Therefore, 1   is an (r, s)-gfbc set and h is an (r, s)-gfbo set.

Proposition 4.1. Let (X, τ, τ*) be dfts’s. For each h ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and
s ∈ I1

If a fuzzy set h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, then bC, *(, r, s)   con- tains no non-zero (r, s)-gfc set.
If a fuzzy set h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, then bC, *(, r, s)   is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbo.
An (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set h is an (r, s)-fbc iff bC, *(, r, s)   is an
(r, s)-fbc set.
If a fuzzy set h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, then   1, whenever μ is an (r, s)-gfo set and bI, *(, r, s)  (1   )  .

Proof. (1) Suppose that h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set and μ is an (r, s)-gfc set of IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1 such that

  bCτ,τ *(, r, s)

And

  1  .


If h and μ are (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, then h∧μ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc. 1.
2. If h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc and τ(μ) ≥ r, τ*(μ) ≤ s, then h ∧ μ is an
(r, s)-g ⋆fbc.

Proof. (1) Suppose that h and μ are (r, s)-g ⋆fbc sets in IX such that h ∧ μ ≤ ν for each an (r, s)-gfo set ν ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. Since h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc,

bC, *(, r, s)  

for each an (r, s)-gfo set ν ∈ IX and h ≤ ν. Also, μ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc,

bC, *(, r, s)  

for each an (r, s)-gfo set ν ∈ IX and μ ≤ ν. Then we have,

bC, *(, r, s)  bC, *(, r, s)  ,

whenever h ∧ μ ≤ ν, Therefore, h ∧ μ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc.
(2) Since every an (r, s)-fc set is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc and from
we get the proof.

Proposition 4.3. Let (X, τ, τ*) be dfts’s. For each h and μ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0
and s ∈ I1.



If h is both an (r, s)-gfo and an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, then h is an1(.r,
s)-fbc set.
2. If h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc and     bC, *(, r, s), then μ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc.

Proof. (1) Suppose that h is an (r, s)-gfo and an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc in
IX such that bC, *(, r, s)   , r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. But

  bC, *(, r, s).
Thus

(  bC, *(, r, s))  (1  bC, *(, r, s))    (1  bC, *(, r, s)).
	
   (1  bC, *(, r, s))    (1  bC, *(, r, s)).
	

Since h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, then

bC, *(, r, s)    (1  ).


Also,

Therefore

    bC  (, r, s)  bC

(, r, s).


  bC, *(, r, s).

Hence h is an (r, s)-fbc set.
 , * 


Thus
 , * 

Suppose that h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc and ν is an (r, s)-gfo set in IX such that μ ≤ ν for each μ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. So h ≤ ν. But we have, h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, then

bC, *(, r, s)  .
bC, *(, r, s)  bC, *(, r, s)    (1  bC, *(, r, s)).


Therefore bC, *(, r, s)   , but bC, *(, r, s) is not contained in (1  bC, *(, r, s)). That is, μ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc relative to X.



Now

bC, *(, r, s)  bC, *(bC, *(, r, s), r, s)  bC, *(, r, s)  .

Therefore μ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set.

Theorem 4.2. Let (X, 1, 1* ) and (Y, 2, 2* ) be dfts’s. If   1Y  1X
	
such that h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc in IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1, then h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc relative to Y.

Proof. Suppose that (X, 1, 1* ) and (Y, 2, 2* ) are dfts’s such that
  1Y  1X , r ∈ I0, s ∈ I1 and h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc in IX. Now, let
  1Y   such that μ is an (r, s)-gfo set in IX. But we have, h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc in IX,

    bC, *(, r, s)  .

So that

1Y  bC, *(, r, s)  1Y  .
	

Hence h is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc relative to Y.

Theorem 4.3. Let (X, 1, 1* ) be adfts. For each h and μ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1 with μ ≤ h. If μ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc relative to h such that h is both an (r, s)-gfo and (r, s)-g ⋆fbc of IX, then μ is an (r,
s)-g ⋆fbc relative to X.

Proof. Suppose that μ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc and τ(ν) ≥ r and τ*(ν) ≤ s such that μ ≤ ν, r ∈ I0, s ∈ I1. But we have,     1, therefore μ ≤ h and μ ≤ ν. So


Interrelations

The following implication illustrates the relationships between different fuzzy sets:




None of these implications is reversible where A → B represents A implies B, as shown by the following examples. But at this stage we do not have information re- garding the relationship between an (r, s)-gfbc and (r, s)-g ⋆fc sets.

Example 5.1. (1) Let X  {a, b, c} and let μ and α are fuzzy sets defined by:

(a)  1.0,  (b)  0.5,  (c)  0.0,

(a)  0.0, (b)  0.4, (c)  1.0.

Define (τ, τ*) on X as follows:



    .

Also we have, μ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc relative to h,
