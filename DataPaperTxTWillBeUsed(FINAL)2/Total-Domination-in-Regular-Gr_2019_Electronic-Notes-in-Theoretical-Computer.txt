Abstract
We find new upper bounds on the size of a minimum totally dominating set for random regular graphs and for regular graphs with large girth. These bounds are obtained through the analysis of a local algorithm using a method due to Hoppen and Wormald [17].
Keywords: Total domination, Random regular graphs, Large girth.

Introduction and Main Results
This paper is concerned with totally dominating sets in graphs. As usual, a graph G = (V, E) consists of a vertex set V and of an edge set E ⊆ {{u, v} : u, v ∈ V, u /= v}. Even though we use standard graph-theoretical notation and terminology, we define concepts that appear in the statement of the main results of this paper. For other definitions, we refer the reader to [1].
There is a multitude of parameters that are related with the general notion of domination in graphs. The most studied version is the domination number γ(G) of a graph G = (V, E). A set S ⊆ V is a dominating set of G if every vertex in V \ S is adjacent to some vertex in S. The domination number is the minimum size of a dominating set of G, that is,
γ(G)= min{|S| : S is a dominating set of G}.
The following related notion has been introduced by Cockayne, Dawes and Hedet- niemi [7]. A totally dominating set S ⊆ V is a set such that every vertex v ∈ V is

adjacent to a vertex in S. Clearly, any totally dominating set is also a dominating set, and there is a totally dominating set in a graph if and only if it does not have isolated vertices. Naturally, the total domination number γt(G) of a graph G with no isolated vertices is defined as
γt(G)= min{|S| : S is a totally dominating set of G}.

Computing the value of γ(G) is a notoriously hard problem, which appears on the original list of NP-complete problems provided by Karp [19]. Pfaff, Laskar and Hedetniemi [20] proved that computing γt(G) is also NP-complete. For results and references about domination and total domination, we refer to Haynes, Hedetniemi and Slater [13] and to Henning and Yeo [15], respectively.
There has been a large number of upper and lower bounds on the size of a minimum totally dominating set in an n-vertex graph G. Since the addition of a vertex to a set may only dominate its neighbors, it is clear that γt(G) ≥ n/Δ(G), where Δ(G) denotes the maximum degree of G. On the other hand, Henning and Yeo [15, Theorem 5.1] proved that γt(G) ≤ 1+ln(δ) n, where δ(G) ≥ 1 is the minimum degree of G. A natural setting for comparing upper and lower bounds of this type are d-regular graphs, namely graphs where every vertex is incident with d edges, so that δ(G)= Δ(G)= d (we shall always assume that nd is even).
In general, the size of a minimum totally dominating set may still vary consid- erably among n-vertex d-regular graphs. For instance, if G is a collection of disjoint complete bipartite graphs Kd,d, we have γt(G)= n/d, as every component is totally dominated by one vertex of each side of the bipartition. This shows that the trivial lower bound on γt(G) mentioned above is sharp for all d. On the other hand, if G is a collection of disjoint complete graphs Kd+1, we have γt(G)= 2n/(d + 1), which is substantially larger. Table 1 gives upper bounds Γ0(G) on the size of a minimum totally dominating set in a d-regular graph G (actually, these bounds have been obtained for δ(G) = d). As it turns out, the upper bounds in the table are sharp for d-regular graphs for d ∈ {2, 3, 4}.
Two traditional ways to investigate the behavior of a graph-theoretical param- eter on d-regular graphs are to consider its typical value, namely its value for a randomly chosen d-regular graph, and to consider its value on graphs with large girth. The girth of a graph is the length of a shortest cycle in the graph. Properties of random regular graphs have been intensively studied (see [24] for a survey of results in such probabilistic models). The effect of large girth on graph parameters has also been of interest at least since Erd˝os [11] showed that, for any given positive integers k and g, there is a graph with girth at least g and chromatic number at least k, which shows the global nature of the chromatic number of a graph.
Regarding the effect of large girth on the total domination number of a d-regular graph G, Henning and Yeo [16] showed that, if G is an n-vertex graph with δ(G) ≥ 2 and girth g ≥ 3, then
γ (G) ≤  1 + 1  n.


Table 1
Upper bounds on the size of a minimum totally dominating set in a d-regular graph G, the corresponding references and approximations of the upper bound Γg on the parameter γg(d, ∞) obtained in this paper.

In particular, this shows that the trivial lower bound is asymptotically optimal for 2-regular graphs as g → ∞. (This fact can also be proved directly by looking at totally dominating sets of long cycles.) We study this parameter for general d.
Precisely, for d ≥ 2 and g0 ≥ 3, let
γg(d, g0) := sup{γt(G)/|V (G)| : G is d-regular with girth g ≥ g0},	(1)
that is, γg(d, g0) is the smallest possible upper bound on d-regular graphs with girth at least g0. This produces a monotone sequence as g0 increases, and we consider the parameter
γg(d, ∞) =  lim γg(d, g0).	(2)
g0→∞
Henning’s result shows that γg(2, ∞)= 1/2. One of the main results in our paper, which will be described in detail below (Theorem 1.3), implies the following upper bounds on γg(d, ∞) for some fixed values of d.
Theorem 1.1 For integers 3 ≤ d ≤ 6, we have γg(d, ∞) ≤ Γg for the values of Γg

given in Table 1.

We now consider the typical value of the total domination number on a large d-regular graph. To this end, let Gn,d be the set of (labelled) n-vertex d-regular graphs and, for an integer d ≥ 2 and a constant ε > 0, consider
γR(d, ε)=	inf	sup  γ(G) : G ∈ A  .	(3)
A⊆Gn,d,n∈N,	n
|A|≥(1−ε)|Gn,d|
Note that, for fixed d, γR(d, ε) is bounded and increases as ε decreases, so that this

limit is well-defined:
γR(d) = lim γR(d, ε).	(4)

ε→0+
Let Gn,d denote the probability space with sample space Gn,d and uniform proba-
bility distribution. In the language of probability, finding an upper bound Γr on
γR(d) means that a random d-regular graph asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.) has a minimum totally dominating set of size at most Γr.

A well-known construction, which uses the fact that random d-regular graphs
a.a.s. have a small number of cycles of bounded length [5,25], allows us to prove that
γR(d) ≤ γg(d, ∞),	(5)
so that any deterministic upper bound on the total domination number of d-regular graphs with large girth gives us an upper bound on the total domination number of a typical d-regular graph. This leads to the following.
Theorem 1.2 For integers 3 ≤ d ≤ 6, a graph G ∈ Gn,d asymptotically almost surely satisﬁes γt(G)/n ≤ Γg for the values of Γg given in Table 1.
In fact, the connection between the behavior of graph parameters for graphs with large girth and for random regular graphs given in (5) in the context of total domination actually holds for many different parameters, and it is a significant open question whether (5) holds with equality (see Backhausz and Szegedy [3] for a detailed description of problems in this line of research).
Recently, Wormald and the first author [17] proved that an upper bound on
γR(d) implies an upper bound on γg(d, ∞) as long as it is obtained through the
analysis of a local algorithm, as described in their paper. (Again, the previous sentence would hold for a host of parameters other than total domination.) In this paper, this result by Hoppen and Wormald plays a fundamental role as the tool that allows us to transfer a result obtained in the random graph context (Theorem 1.2) to the large-girth context (Theorem 1.1).
We should also mention that the ability of local algorithms to approximate the value of graph parameters for graphs with large girth has attracted a lot of attention. Recently, Gamarnik and Sudan [12] showed that, for sufficiently large d, local algorithms cannot approximate the size of the largest independent set in a d-regular graph of large girth with an arbitrarily small multiplicative error. The approximation gap was improved by Rahman and Vir´ag [21].
The proof of our results use the approach described in [17]. We use a method due to Wormald [26], known as the differential equation method, to analyse the performance of a specific local algorithm that produces a totally dominating set in an input graph G when this algorithm is applied to a random regular graph G ∈ Gn,d. We then translate this result to all graphs with sufficiently large girth using [17, Theorem 8.1]. The differential equation method is a concentration-type result that has proven to be very successful in the analysis of random processes. In the particular case of random regular graphs, it has already been used to study parameters related with domination, see [9,10], and results for graphs with large girth using the general approach described above have also been proved in [18].
To be more precise, Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 follow from the following technical result, which holds for any fixed d ≥ 3.
Theorem 1.3 For any d ≥ 3 and ε > 0, a random graph G ∈ Gn,d asymptotically almost surely contains a totally dominating set DT ⊆ V (G) such that
|DT |≤ n (q(x∗)+ ε) ,

where z0(x) and q(x) are solutions to the initial value problem (7) and x∗ = inf{x > 
0: z0(x)= 0}.
The system of differential equations mentioned in the statement of the theorem arises naturally as we analyse the algorithm described in Section 2. It is not easy to compute the value of q(x∗) analytically, and the values of Γg in Table 1 are numerical approximations of this quantity for some values of d (the fourth decimal place has been rounded up). This immediately leads to the conclusion of Theorem 1.2. To derive Theorem 1.1, we just apply [17, Theorem 8.1], which requires that we check that the algorithm satisfies a particular set of rules described in [17].
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present our algorithm and we describe the setting in which the analysis is carried out. Section 3 contains information about the proof of our main results.
A heuristic to produce small totally dominating sets
In addition to many other applications, the differential equation method has been used to analyze the typical performance of a large number algorithms on random regular graphs. As in most applications of this method to random regular graphs, instead of working directly with regular graphs, we use the approach of Bollob´as [5], known as the conﬁguration model, which considers the following probability space whose elements may be generated by the following simple randomized procedure. Start with nd points in n buckets labelled 1,..., n, with d points in each bucket, and choose uniformly at random (u.a.r.) a pairing P = a1,..., adn/2 of the points such that each ai is an unordered pair of points, and each point is in precisely one pair ai. As usual Pn,d denotes the probability space of pairings. By collapsing each bucket into a single vertex, we see that each pairing corresponds to a d-regular pseudograph (loops and multiple edges permitted) with vertex set 1,...,n and with an edge for each pair. A pair with points in buckets i and j gives rise to an edge joining vertices i and j. A straightforward calculation shows that any two simple d-regular graphs (i.e. with no loops or multiple edges) on n vertices are produced with the same probability. For fixed d, a crucial property is that the probability that a random pairing produces a d-regular graph tends to the positive constant e(1−d2)/4 as n tends to infinity (Bender and Canfield [4]), and so results that hold
a.a.s. for random pairings in Pn,d must also hold a.a.s. for random d-regular graphs.
We choose the pairs sequentially: the first point in a pair can be selected using any rule that depends only on the choices made so far, as long as the second is chosen u.a.r. from the remaining points. We call this exposing the pair, and this property is the independence property of the model. For simplicity, we shall refer to graphs and vertices even though we mean pairings and buckets. Here, we consider the following heuristic.
We start with an n-vertex graph G0 where no edges have been exposed and with a set D0 = ∅. The idea is to generate a random d-regular graph by sequentially exposing its edges and, at the same time, produce a totally dominating set D. Our construction proceeds by rounds that are labeled by a discrete parameter t. For

each t ∈ {0,..., TC}, where TC satisfies a termination condition, we produce Gt+1
and Dt+1 from Gt and Dt, respectively, according to the following rules:
Choose a vertex vt u.a.r. among all vertices of degree 0 in Gt and expose a vertex ut to be adjacent to vt.
If the degree of ut in Gt is 0, then expose all remaining neighbors of both ut
and vt to produce Gt+1 and define Dt+1 = Dt ∪ {vt, ut}.
If the degree of ut in Gt is not 0, then expose all remaining neighbors of ut to produce Gt+1 and define Dt+1 = Dt ∪ {ut}.
Note that, if Gt generates a simple graph, the set of vertices of degree 0 in Gt is precisely the set of vertices that are not dominated by vertices in Dt. As a consequence, this sequence of steps should be performed until Gt does not contain any isolated vertices. However, for technical reasons associated with the analysis, we need to consider an additional parameter ε > 0 and we perform the algorithm until the number of vertices of degree 0 in Gt falls below εn. Then the set DTC obtained at the end of the heuristic is not yet a totally dominating set, but may be turned into a totally dominating set by adding a neighbor of each vertex that has not yet been dominated.
The relevant variables associated with this heuristic are Q(t)= |Dt| and Yi(t), the number of vertices of degree i in Gt, for i ∈ {0,..., d}. In fact, since vertices of degree d do not affect the remainder of the application of the algorithm, we ignore the variable Yd(t). We write ht = (G0,..., Gt) to denote the history of the process to time t (that is, the results obtained in an actual application of the heuristic up to round t). The basic idea of the differential equation method is to keep track of the expected value of each variable at each round. If some technical conditions are satisfied, powerful results by Wormald, see for instance [26, Theorem 5.1], imply that the actual values of the variables are a.a.s. close to their expected value for all t ∈ {0,..., TC}. To achieve them, we shall prove that the following conditions are met (we observe that some of them are stronger than what is actually needed for [26, Theorem 5.1]):
There is an absolute constant β = β(d) such that
1 ≤ Q(t + 1) − Q(t) ≤ 2 and 0 max 1 |Yj(t + 1) − Yj(t)|≤ β
for all j ∈ {0,...,d − 1} and all t ∈ {0,..., TD}.
There exist functions f0, f1,..., fd−1, fd : Rd+1 → R and λ1 = λ1(n)= o(1) such that, for all 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1,
|E[Yj(t + 1) − Yj(t)|ht] − fj(t/n, Y0(t)/n,..., Yd−1(t)/n)|≤ λ1(n)


and

|E[Q(t + 1) − Q(t)|ht] − fd(t/n, Y0(t)/n,..., Yd−1(t)/n)|≤ λ1(n)

for all t < TD.

The functions fj defined in (ii) are Lipschitz continuous in a domain
D ∩ {(t, z0,..., zd−1): t ≥ 0},

where D is an open, connected and bounded set containing the point = (x0, z0,..., zd−1) = (0, 1, 0,..., 0), which represents that, at the beginning of the algorithm, Yi(0) = zin for 1 ≤ i ≤ d − 1.
Roughly speaking, condition (i) tells us that the variables cannot vary substantially in a single round of the heuristic, condition (ii) tells us that the expected change in the variables (conditional on the history of the process) may be calculated, while condition (iii) tells us that these expected changes are described by well-behaved functions. If these conditions are met, Theorem 5.1 [26] establishes that the sys- tem of differential equations associated with the functions fj has a unique solution (z0(x),..., zd−1(x), q(x)) with initial conditions z0(0) = 1, zi(0) = 0 for i ≥ 1 and q(0) = 0.
Moreover, the variables Q(t) and Yi(t) are approximated throughout the process by the solutions of a system of differential equations involving the functions defined in (ii). More precisely, for λ > λ1, there is an absolute constant C such that, with probability 1 − O  β exp −nλ3  , we have
Yj(t)/n = zj(t/n)+ O(λ),	Q(t)/n = q(t/n)+ O(λ)	(6)
for all j and all 0 ≤ t ≤ σn, where σ = σ(n) is the supremum of all x such that the solution to the system of differential equations may be extended up to distance at most Cλ from the boundary of D.
Proving our main results
In this section, we argue that the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) described in the pre- vious section are satisfied for our heuristic. In particular, we compute the functions f0,..., fd−1, fd that give rise to the system of differential equations that mentioned in the statement of Theorem 1.3.
We first note that β = 2d is a trivial bound for (i), as we expose at most 2d  1
pairings at each round, involving at most 2d vertices. To verify (ii), we first compute E[X(t + 1)  X(t) ht] for each variable X. In fact, the conditional expectations in our process may be computed based on Gt, rather than in the full history ht. We are able to prove that

where S(t)= d−1 (d − m)Ym(t) and δi,j is the function with values in {0, 1} such that δi,j = 1 if and only if i = j. The variation in the number of vertices of degree j depends basically on the number of vertices of degree j and j − 1 in the previous step.
Normalizing the quantities involved in the recurrence relations by
x := t/n,	yi(x) := Yi(xn)/n,	q(x) := Q(xn)/n,

and letting n → ∞, we may see the recurrence relations as a discretization of the following system of differential equations and initial conditions:


qj(x) = fd(x, z0, z1,..., zd−1)
z0(0) = 1, zj(0) = 0 for 1 ≤ j ≤ d − 1, q(0) = 0, where the functions fj are defined by

At this point, we have found the functions fj that verify (ii) with λ1 = O(1/√n).
Next we need to define a domain D ⊆ Rd+1 for which (iii) is satisfied. For ε > 0, let Dε contain all tuples (x, z0, z1,..., zd−1) ∈ Rd+1 such that −ε < x < 1, ε < z0 < 1+ ε and −ε/d < z1,..., zd−1 < 1+ ε.
Proposition 3.1 For any ε > 0, each function fj is Lipschitz continuous in Dε.
Sketch of the proof. Note that each fj is a rational function of the form p/s2, where p and s are multivariate polynomials on d + 1 variables such that s does not contain roots in Dε.	2
As mentioned in the previous section, using β = 2d, we may find A > 0 suffi- ciently large so that λ(n)= A/n1/4 satisfies (6) with probability at least

This expression converges to 1 as n → ∞. In particular, we conclude that Q(t)/n =
q(t/n)+ O(λ)) holds with high probability up to step σn.

We still need to prove that step σn occurs in a region where z0 is small, which implies that we may carry out the analysis of the process up to a point where almost all vertices of the input graph have been totally dominated. To prove this, we shall establish properties of the solutions to the system of differential equations.
The results below ensure that the solutions zj(x) and q(x) lie within the interval [0, 1] for all values of x ≥ 0 such that z0(x) > 0. This implies that the reason why the vector of solutions approaches the boundary of the closure of Dε is that z0(x) approaches 0.
Proposition 3.2 There exists δ > 0 such that, for all x ∈ (0, δ] and 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1, we have zj(x) > 0.
Sketch of the proof. This is trivial for z0(x), as it is continuous and z0(0) = 1. To show that the statement is true for j ≥ 1, it suffices to verify that the first nonzero derivative of zj(x) is positive at x = 0, which is easily done by induction on j.  2
The next proposition gives upper bounds on zj(x) and s(x) provided that some conditions are satisfied.
Proposition 3.3 If zj(x) ≥ 0 and z0(x) > ε0 for all x ∈ [0, θ] and all j ∈
{1,...,d − 1}, where ε0 > 0 and θ > 0, then s(x) ≤ d and zj(x) ≤ 1 for all
∈ [0, θ] and all j ∈ {0,...,d − 1}.
Sketch of the proof. Let Z(x) = z0(x)+ z1(x)+  + zd 1(x). Observe that Zj(x)= z0j (x)+ z1j (x)+  + zdj 1(x), which, using the differential equations in (7), lead to

for x ∈ [0, θ]. Note that the last inequality follows from the fact that s(x) ≥ dz0(x) ≥ dε0. This proves that Z(x) is decreasing in [0, θ]. The conclusion that s(x) ≤ d comes from dZ(0) = dz0(0) = d = s(0) and dZ(x) ≥ s(x).
To bound zj(x), observe that, for all j ∈ {0, 1,...,d − 1}, we have 1 ≥ Z(x) ≥
zj(x) and Z(0) = 1 ≥ zj(0).	2
We know that there is θ > 0 satisfying the hypotheses of Proposition 3.3, namely θ = δ of Proposition 3.2. Henceforth, when we refer to δ and θ we always mean a values of δ and θ for which the hypotheses of Propositions 3.2 and 3.3 hold. The next result, whose elementary (but slightly technical) proof is omitted, implies that, after the point where all functions zj(x) are positive, for i ≤ d−2, a function zi+1(x) cannot approach 0 unless zi(x) approaches 0.
Proposition 3.4 Assume that zj(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ [δ, θ] and j ∈ {0, 1,.  ,d − 1}.
Moreover, assume that there is i ∈ {0, 1,...,d − 2} and εi > 0 such that εi ≤ min{zj(δ)/2 : 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1} and zi(x) > εi. Then there is εi+1 > 0 such that zi+1(x) > εi+1 in [δ, θ].
Let ε0 > 0 be an arbitrary real number less than min{zj(δ)/2:0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1}. For suitable values of θ, we may apply Proposition 3.4 repeatedly in order to obtain
{ε0, ε1,..., εd—1} such that zj(x) > εj for all j ∈ {0, 1,.  ,d − 1}.

Define θ0 := inf{x > δ : zj(x) = εj, for some j}. This is well-defined because zj(δ) > εj for all j and z0j (x) ≤ −1 in any interval [δ, θ] for which zj(x) ≥ 0 for all j. We claim that z0(θ0) = ε0. Indeed, assume that zj(θ0) = εj for som j ≥ 0. Proposition 3.4 and the continuity of zj ensure that zj—1(θ0)= εj—1. Repeating the argument, we get to z0(θ0)= ε0.

Fig. 1. z0(x) is red, z1(x) is blue, z2(x) is green, q(x) is black. Note that vertices with degree 3 that are not in the totally dominating set produced by the algorithm are not depicted in the graphs.
This leads to the following conclusion.
Proposition 3.5 For all ε0 > 0 less than min{zj(δj)/2 : 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1}, there exists θ0 > δ such that z0(θ0)= ε0 and, for all x ∈ [δ, θ0] and j ∈ {0, 1,...,d − 1}, zj(x) > 0.
Putting together Propositions 3.2, 3.3 and 3.5, since z0(x) is decreasing and no other variable may approach the boundary of Dε0 until z0 approaches ε0, we derive the following.
Proposition 3.6 For d ≥ 3, consider the initial value problem given in (7). Fix ε > 0 and let θε := inf{x > 0 : z0(x) = ε}. Then, for all x ∈ [0, θε], we have ε ≤ z0(x) ≤ 1, 0 ≤ q(x) ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ zj(x) ≤ 1, for 1 ≤ j ≤ d − 1.
Proof. It suffices to check that 0 ≤ q(x) ≤ 1, as the other statements are conse- quences of the previous propositions. To see why this holds, let l(x)= −z0(x)+ 1, so that q(0) = l(0) = 0. Moreover, for x ∈ [0, θε], we have 1 ≤ 1+ dz0(x)/s(x) = qj(x) ≤ −z0j (x)= lj(x). As a consequence, we have 0 ≤ q(x) ≤ l(x) ≤ 1 − ε.   2
Proposition 3.6 tells us that, as ε → 0+, z0 tends to 0, since, for all ε > 0, its derivative is less than −1 for all x ∈ [0, θε]. As a consequence, the constant x∗ = inf{x > 0: z0(x)= 0} is well-defined and we have proved Theorem 1.3.
To illustrate the behavior of the solutions to (7), we show a computational approximation of the solutions for d = 3 in Figure 1.
