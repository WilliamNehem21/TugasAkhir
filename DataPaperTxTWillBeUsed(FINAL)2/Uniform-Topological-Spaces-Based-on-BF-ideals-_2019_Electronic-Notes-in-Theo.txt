Abstract
In this paper, the uniform topological spaces are established based on the congruences induced by BF-ideals and some of their properties are discussed in negative non-involutive residuated lattices. The following conclusions are proved: (i) every uniform topological space is first-countable, zero-dimensional, disconnected, locally compact and completely regular. (ii) a uniform topological space is a T1 space iff it is a T2 space.
(iii) the lattice and adjoint operations in a negative non-involutive residuated lattice are continuous with respect to the uniform topology, which make the negative non-involutive residuated lattice to be topological negative non-involutive residuated lattice. Meanwhile, some necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniform topological spaces to be compact and discrete are obtained. The results of this paper have a positive role to reveal internal features of negative non-involutive residuated lattices at a topological level.
Keywords: Non-classical logic, negative non-involutive residuated lattice, BF-ideal; uniform topological space


Introduction
It is well-known that non-classical mathematical logic [1] has become a formal and useful tool for computer science to deal with fuzzy information and uncertain in- formation. Various logical algebras have been proposed as the semantical systems of non-classical mathematical logic systems. Among these logical algebras, resid- uated lattices introduced by Ward and Dilworth [2] are very basic and important algebraic structures. Some other logical algebras such as MTL-algebra, BL-algebra, MV-algebras [3] and NM-algebra, which is also called R0-algebra [4] are all able to be considered as particular classes of residuated lattices. Filter and ideal are two

important concepts for studying of logical algebraic structures. The related research work has attracted much attention from scholars [5,6]. It is noteworthy that in log- ical algebras with negative involutive (regular) properties, considering that filters and ideals are mutually dual, most people focus their attention on the problem of filters. However, when the negation operation in logical algebra loses its involution, the dual relationship between ideal and filter is also broken. Therefore, it will be a meaningful work to explore ideal and its application in the framework of negative non-involutive logic algebras. In view of this, the concepts of ideal and fuzzy ideal have been introduced in BL-algebra and negative non-involutive residuated lattices in [7,8,9], and some results with theoretical significance and application prospect have been obtained.
The concept of fuzzy sets, a remarkable idea in mathematics, was proposed by Zadeh [10] in 1965. At present, fuzzy sets have been extremely used to deal with the many problems in applied mathematics, control engineering, information sciences, expert systems and theory of automata etc. However, in traditional fuzzy sets, the membership degrees of elements are all restricted to the interval [0, 1], which leads to a great difficulty in expressing the difference of the irrelevant elements from the contrary elements in fuzzy sets. If a set representation could express this kind of difference, it would be more informative than the traditional fuzzy set representa- tion. Based on these observations, Lee [11] introduced the notion of bipolar-valued fuzzy sets, abbreviated as BF-sets, which is an extension of the traditional fuzzy sets. In the past few decades, more and more researchers have devoted themselves to applying BF-sets theory to various algebraic structures [12,13,14].
Recently, we introduced the concept of BF-ideals in negative non-involutive residuated lattices and discussed some related properties in [15] and [16]. As a continuation of the above work, in this paper, we consider a collection of BF-ideals and use congruence relation induced by BF-ideal to define a uniform topological space and investigate some of its properties. Some interesting results are obtained.
Preliminaries
In this section, we review some concepts and properties regarding negative non- involutive residuated lattices [2,3,8,9] and BF-sets [11,15,16]. For notions about topology, please refer to [17] and [18].
Definition 2.1 A residuated lattice is an algebra (L, ∨, ∧, ⊗, →, 0, 1) of type (2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0) such that:
(R1) (L, ∨, ∧, 0, 1) is a bounded lattice with the greatest element 1 and the least element 0,
(R2) (L, ⊗, 1) is a commutative monoid,
(R3) (⊗, →) is an adjoint pair on L, i.e., for all x, y, z ∈ L, x⊗ y ≤ z if and only if x ≤ y → z.
A negative non-involutive residuated lattice is a residuated lattice (L, ∨, ∧, ⊗, →
, 0, 1) which satisfies that: there exists x ∈ L such that x /= xjj, where xj = x → 0 for all x ∈ L.

In the sequel, a residuated lattice (L, ∨, ∧, ⊗, →, 0, 1) will be denoted by L in short.
Lemma 2.2 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice, then for all
x, y, z ∈ L,
(P1) x ≤ y if and only if x → y = 1,
(P2) x → x =1 and x → 1=1 and 1 → x = x,
(P3) x ≤ y implies x ⊗ z ≤ y ⊗ z and z → x ≤ z → y and y → z ≤ x → z, (P4) y → z ≤ (x → y) → (x → z) ≤ x → (y → z) and x → y ≤ (y → z) →
(x → z),
(P5) x → (y ∧ z)= (x → y) ∧ (x → z) and (y ∨ z) → x = (y → x) ∧ (z → x), (P6) (x → y)⊗(y → z) ≤ x → z and x → (y → z)= (x⊗y) → z = y → (x → z), (P7) x ≤ y =⇒ yj ≤ xj =⇒ xjj ≤ yjj and x ≤ xjj and xjjj = xj and x ⊗ xj = 0, (P8) x → yj = y  → xj = (x ⊗ y)j and (x → yj)jj = x → yj and
(x → yjj)jj = x → yjj,
(P9) (x ∨ y)j = xj ∧ yj and (x ∧ y)j ≥ xj ∨ yj and x → y ≤ yj → xj.

Uniformity and Uniform Topological Space Based on BF-ideals
In this section, we induce a congruence relation by a BF-ideal firstly, then give the definition of uniformity and uniform topological space base on BF-ideals in negative non-involutive residuated lattices.
Definition 3.1 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice. A binary relation R ⊆ L × L is said to be a congruence relation on L if it satisfies the following conditions:
(CR1) R is an equivalence relation on L, i. e., R satisfies reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity,
(CR2) for all x, y, z ∈ L, (x, y) ∈ R implies (x∗z, y ∗z) ∈ R and (z ∗x, z ∗y) ∈ R, where ∗∈ {∧, ∨, ⊗, →}.
Theorem 3.2 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice and A = (μP , μN ) ∈ BFI(L). A binary relation ≡A⊆ L × L is deﬁned as follows:
A	A

 μP ((x → y)j)= μP ((y → x)j)= μP (0),

A	A	A
Then ≡A is a congruence relation on L. We named it the congruence relation induced by BF-ideal A on L.
Proof. Firstly, it is obvious that A satisfies reflexivity and symmetry. For transitiv- ity, assume that x ≡A y and y ≡A z, we have μP ((x → y)j)= μP ((y → x)j)= μP (0)
A	A	A
and μN ((x → y)j)= μN ((y → x)j)= μN (0), μP ((y → z)j)= μP ((z → y)j)= μP (0)
A	A	A	A	A	A
and μN ((y → z)j) = μN ((z → y)j) = μN (0).	For every x, y, z ∈ L, Since
A	A	A
y → z ≤ (x → y) → (x → z) ≤ (x → z)j → (x → y)j ≤ (x → y)jj → (x → z)jj
by (P4) and (P9), we have that (y → z)j ≥ ((x → y)jj → (x → z)jj)j by (P7). according to A ∈ BFI(L) and Lemma 2.4, we have that μP ((y → z)j) ≤ μP (((x →
A	A
jj → (x → z)jj)j) and μN ((y → z)j) ≥ μN (((x → y)jj → (x → z)jj)j), thus by
A	A
Definition 2.3 we can obtain that μP ((x → z)j) ≥ μP ((x → y)j) ∧ μP (((x → y)jj →
A	A	A
(x → z)jj)j) ≥ μP ((x → y)j) ∧ μP ((y → z)j)= μP (0) and μN ((x → z)j) ≤ μN ((x →
A	A	A	A	A

j) ∨ μN (((x → y)jj → (x → z)jj)j) ≤ μN ((x → y)j) ∨ μN ((y → z)j)= μN (0), and
A	A	A	A
thus μP ((x → z)j)= μP (0) and μN ((x → z)j)= μN (0). Similarly, we can also get
A	A	A	A
that μP ((z → x)j)= μP (0) and μN ((z → x)j)= μN (0). Therefore, x ≡A z, i. e., A
A	A	A	A
satisfies transitivity.
Secondly, assume that x ≡A y, we have μP ((x → y)j)= μP ((y → x)j)= μP (0)
A	A	A
and μN ((x → y)j) = μN ((y → x)j) = μN (0).	Since (x ∧ z) → (y ∧ z) =
A	A	A
((x ∧ z) → y) ∧ ((x ∧ z) → z) = (x ∧ z) → y ≥ x → y by (P4) and (P5), we
have that (x → y)j ≥ ((x ∧ z) → (y ∧ z))j by (P7). according to A ∈ BFI(L) and Lemma 2.4, we have that μP (0) = μP ((x → y)j) ≤ μP (((x ∧ z) → (y ∧ z))j)
A	A	A
and μN (0) = μN ((x → y)j) ≥ μN (((x ∧ z) → (y ∧ z))j), and so μP (((x ∧ z) →
A	A	A	A
(y ∧ z))j)= μP (0) and μN (((x ∧ z) → (y ∧ z))j)= μN (0). Similarly, we can also get
A	A	A
that μP (((y ∧z) → (x∧z))j)= μP (0) and μN (((y ∧z) → (x∧z))j)= μN (0). There-
A	A	A	A
fore (x∧z) ≡A (y ∧z). Using similar methods, we can prove that (x∨z) ≡A (y ∨z),
(x ⊗ z) ≡A (y ⊗ z), (x → z) ≡A (y → z) and (z → x) ≡A (z → y). The proof is completed.	2
Theorem 3.3 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice, A	= (μP , μN ),B = (μP , μN ) ∈ BFI(L), μP (0) = μP (0) and μN (0) = μN (0). Then
A	B	B	A	B	A	B
≡A ∩ ≡B=≡AHB.
Proof. Assume that A = (μP , μN ),B = (μP , μN ) ∈ BFI(L), μP (0) = μP (0) and
A	A	B	B	A	B
μN (0) = μN (0). For every x, y ∈ L, it follows that

(x, y) ∈≡A ∩ ≡B⇐⇒x ≡A y and x ≡B y
⇐⇒  μP ((x → y)′)= μP ((y → x)′)= μP (0) = μP (0) = μP ((x → y)′)= μP ((y → x)′)

Let X be a non-empty set, U, V ⊆ X ×X, the composition, inverse and diagonal are defined as follows
U ◦ V = {(x, y) ∈ X × X|∃z ∈ X, (x, z) ∈ V, (z, y) ∈ U},
U—1 = {(x, y) ∈ X × X|(y, x) ∈ U},
Δ = {(x, x) ∈ X × X|x ∈ X}.
Definition 3.4 [17,18] Let X be a non-empty set. A uniformity on X is a non- empty collection Ω of subset of X × X which satisfies the following conditions:
(U1) for all U ∈ Ω, Δ ⊆ U , (U2) for all U ∈ Ω,U—1 ∈ Ω,
(U3) for all U ∈ Ω, there exists a V ∈ Ω such that V ◦ V ⊆ U , (U4) for all U, V ∈ Ω,U ∩ V ∈ Ω,
(U5) U ∈ Ω and U ⊆ V ⊆ X × X imply V ∈ Ω. The pair (X, Ω) is called a uniform space.

Let Ω be a uniformity on X, x ∈ X, U ∈ Ω and U [x] := {y ∈ X|(x, y) ∈ U}, the Ω can naturally induce a topology τ on X such that τ = {O ⊆ X|∀x ∈ O, ∃U ∈ Ω, s.t. U [x] ⊆ O}, we named it uniform topology induced by Ω on X, and (X, τ ) uniform topology space induced by Ω on X.
Now we define uniformity and induce uniform topology base on BF-ideals in a negative non-involutive residuated lattice L. For this reason, in the next sequel, we suppose that I is a non-empty family of BF-ideals of L which is closed under BF-intersection and for all A = (μP , μN ),B = (μP , μN ) ∈ I, μP (0) = μP (0) and

μN (0) = μN (0).

Proposition 3.5 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice and UA =
{(x, y) ∈ L × L|x ≡A y} for every A = (μP , μN ) ∈ I. Then the subsets family
A	A
ω∗ = {UA|A ∈ I} of L × L satisﬁes conditions (U1)-(U4).
Proof. For every UA ∈ ω∗, ω∗ satisfies (U1)-(U3) follow from reflexivity, symmetric and transitivity of ≡A. For (U4), let UA, UB ∈ ω∗, we have that UA ∩ UB = UAHB by Theorem 3.3. Since A, B ∈ I and I is closed under BF-intersection, we have that A H B ∈ I. Thus UA ∩ UB ∈ ω∗. Therefore ω∗ also satisfies (U4).	2
Theorem 3.6 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice. Then ω =
{U ⊆ L × L|∃UA ∈ ω∗, s.t. UA ⊆ U} is a uniformity on L, and so (L, ω) is a uniform space.
Proof. By Proposition 3.5 and the definition of ω, we know that ω satisfies the conditions (U1)-(U4). We will show that ω satisfies the condition (U5). Indeed, let U ∈ ω and U ⊆ V ⊆ L × L, then there exists UA ∈ ω∗ such that UA ⊆ U ⊆ V , thus
V ∈ ω. The proof is completed.	2
Combining Definition 3.4 and Theorem 3.6, we give the following definition:
Definition 3.7 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice. Then τ£ =
{O ⊆ X|∀x ∈ O, ∃U ∈ ω, s.t. U [x] ⊆ O} is a topology on L, which is called a uniform topology on L induced by I, and (L, τ£ ) is called uniform topological space induced by I. In particular, if I = {A = (μP , μN )}, then ω = {U ⊆ L×L|UA ⊆ U},
A	A
and the uniform topology on L induced by I is denoted by τA.
Note 1 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice. According to the deﬁ- nition of uniform topology τ£ in Deﬁnition 3.7, for every x ∈ L and A = (μP , μN ) ∈
A	A
I, It is obvious that UA[x] is an open neighborhood of x.
Example 3.8 Let lattice L = {0, a, b, c, 1}, the Hasse diagram of L be defined as Figure 1, and the operators → and ⊗ of L be defined as following two Tables, respectively,

and xj = x → 0 for every x ∈ L, then (L, ≤, ∧, ∨, ⊗, →, 0, 1) is a negative non- involutive residuated lattice. Let A = (μP , μN ) ∈ BFS(L) be defined as follows
A	A

By routine calculation, we know that A = (μP , μN ) ∈ BFI(L). Taking I = {A =

A	A
ω∗ = {UA} = {{(x, y) ∈ L × L|x ≡A y}}

ω = {U ⊆ L × L|UA ⊆ U} and
UA[0] = UA[a]= {0, a}, UA[b]= {b, 1}, UA[c]= {c, 1}, UA[1] = {b, c, 1}.
Thus τ£ = τA = {∅, {1}, {0, a}, {b, 1}, {c, 1}, {0, a, 1}, {b, c, 1}, {0, a, b, 1}, {0, a, c, 1}, L}.
Theorem 3.9 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice. Then for every
x ∈ L and A = (μP , μN ) ∈ I, UA[x] is a clopen subset of (L, τ£ ).
A	A
Proof. For arbitrary x ∈ L and A = (μP , μN ) ∈ I, firstly, it follows that UA[x] is
A	A
an open subset of (L, τ£ ) from Note 1. Secondly, we will show that UA[x] also is
a closed subset of (L, τ£ ), it suffices to show that (UA[x])c ∈ τ£ . Let y ∈ (UA[x])c, we claim that UA[y] ⊆ (UA[x])c. In fact, suppose that z ∈ UA[y], then y ≡A z, thus by Theorem 3.2 we have that μP ((y → z)j) = μP ((z → y)j) = μP (0) and
A	A	A
μN ((y → z)j) = μN ((z → y)j) = μN (0). If z /∈ (UA[x])c, then z ∈ UA[x], i.e.,
A	A	A
x ≡A z, thus we have that μP ((x → z)j) = μP ((z → x)j) = μP (0) and μN ((x →
A	A	A	A
j)= μN ((z → x)j)= μN (0). It follows from A = (μP , μN ) ∈ BFI(L) and Lemma
A	A	A	A
2.4 that
  μP (0) = μP ((x → z)j) ∧ μP ((z → y)j) ≤ μP ((x → y)j),

and
  μP (0) = μP ((y → z)j) ∧ μP ((z → x)j) ≤ μP ((y → x)j),


A	A	A

thus μP ((x → y)j) = μP ((y → x)j) = μP (0) and μN ((x → y)j) = μN ((y → x)j) = 
A	A	A	A	A
μN (0), and thus x ≡A y, this shows that y ∈ UA[x], it is a contradiction with
y ∈ (UA[x])c. Therefore z ∈ (UA[x])c and UA[y] ⊆ (UA[x])c. Hence (UA[x])c ∈ τ£
and the proof is completed.	2
Proposition 3.10 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice and A = (μP , μN ),B = (μP , μN ) ∈ BFI(L). If A ± B, μP (0) = μP (0) and μN (0) = μN (0),
A	A	B	B	A	B	A	B
then UA ⊆ UB.
Proof. Let (x, y) ∈ UA, then μP ((x → y)j)= μP ((y → x)j)= μP (0) and μN ((x →
A	A	A	A
j) = μN ((y → x)j) = μN (0). Since A ± B, μP (0) = μP (0) and μN (0) = μN (0),
A	A	B	A	B
we have that μP (0) = μP (0) = μP ((x → y)j) ≤ μP ((x → y)j), μP (0) = μP (0) =
A	A	B	B	A
μP ((y → x)j) ≤ μP ((y → x)j) and μN (0) = μN (0) = μN ((x → y)j) ≥ μN ((x → y)j),
B	B	A	A	B
μN (0) = μN (0) = μN ((y → x)j) ≥ μN ((y → x)j). Thus μP ((x → y)j) = μP ((y →
A	A	B	B	B

the proof is completed.	2
Theorem 3.11 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice and A = (μP , μN ),B = (μP , μN ) ∈ BFI(L). If A ± B, μP (0) = μP (0) and μN (0) = μN (0),
A	A	B	B	A	B	A	B
then τB ⊆ τA.
Proof. Define I1 = {B}, ω∗ = {UB}, ω1 = {U ⊆ L × L|UB ⊆ U} and I2 = {A},
∗ = {UA}, ω2 = {U ⊆ L × L|UA ⊆ U}.  Let O ∈ τB, then for all x ∈ O,
there exists U ∈ ω1 such that U [x] ⊆ O, thus UB[x] ⊆ U [x] ⊆ O. Since A ± B,
μP (0) = μP (0) and μN (0) = μN (0), by Proposition 3.10 we have that UA ⊆ UB.
A	B	A	B
Thus UA[x] ⊆ UB[x] ⊆ U [x] ⊆ O, therefore O ∈ τA and τB ⊆ τA.	2
Theorem 3.12 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice. If B = . A,
A∈£
then τ£ = τB.
Proof. Let I1 = {B}, ω∗ = {UB}, ω1 = {U ⊆ L × L|UB ⊆ U} and ω∗, ω be as defined in Proposition 3.5 and Theorem 3.6 respectively. Assume that O ∈ τB, then for all x ∈ O, there exists U ∈ ω1 such that U [x] ⊆ O, thus UB[x] ⊆ U [x] ⊆ O.
Since B = . A and I is closed under BF-intersection, we know B ∈ I. Thus
A∈£
UB ∈ ω, and thus O ∈ τ£ , this shows that τB ⊆ τ£ . Conversely, let O ∈ τ£ , then
for all x ∈ O, there exists U ∈ ω such that U [x] ⊆ O. Since U ∈ ω, there exists
A ∈ I such that UA[x] ⊆ U [x]. Notice that B = . A ± A, μP (0) = μP (0) and

A∈£
μN (0) = μN (0), we can obtain that UB[x] ⊆ UA[x] ⊆ U [x] ⊆ O, thus O ∈ τB, and

thus τ£ ⊆ τB. Hence τ£ = τB.	2

By Theorem 3.12, we know that τ£ = τB. For every x ∈ L and U ∈ ω, we can obtain that UB[x] ⊆ U [x]. Hence τ£ = {O ⊆ L|∀x ∈ O, UB[x] ⊆ O}. This fact shows that O ⊆ L is an open subset of (L, τ£ ) if and only if for all x ∈ O,

UB[x] ⊆ O if and only if O =
x∈O
UB[x].

For every x ∈ L, by (i), we know that UB[x] is the smallest open neighborhood of x.
Let BB = {UB[x]|x ∈ L}, By (i) and (ii), it is easy to check that BB is a base of uniform topology τB.
For every x ∈ L, {UB[x]} is a countable neighborhood base of x.
Theorem 3.13 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice. then (L, τ£ ) is discrete space if and only if for all x ∈ L, there exists A ∈I such that UA[x]= {x}.
Proof. Let (L, τ£ ) is discrete space. Assume that for any A = (μP , μN ) ∈ I, there
.	A	A

exists x ∈ L such that UA[x] /= {x}. Taking B =
A, then B ∈ I and there
A∈£

exists x0 ∈ L such that UB[x0] /= {x0}, it follows that there exists y0 ∈ UB[x0] such
that x0 /= y0. By Note 2 (ii), UB[x0] is the smallest open neighborhood of x0, hence
{x0} /∈ τB = τ£ , which is a contradiction with (L, τ£ ) is discrete space. Therefore for all x ∈ L, there exists A ∈ I such that UA[x]= {x}. Conversely, assume for all x ∈ L, there exists A ∈ I such that UA[x]= {x}. Then {x} ∈= τ£ . Hence (L, τ£ ) is discrete space.	2
Definition 3.14 Let  L  be  a  negative  non-involutive  residuated  lattice,
A(μP , μN ) ∈I and X ⊆ L. We define UA[X] :=   UA[x].
Theorem 3.15 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice, A(μP , μN ) ∈
A	A

I and X ⊆ L. Then the closure of X is equivalent to
UA∈ω∗
UA[X] and it is denoted

by c(X) in the uniform topological space (L, τ£ ).
Proof. Let x ∈ c(X), then for any A ∈ I, UA[x] is an open neighborhood of x and
UA[x] ∩ X /= ∅. Thus there exists y ∈ X such that y ∈ UA[x], i.e., (x, y) ∈ UA,

it follows that x ∈ UA[y] ⊆
y∈X
UA[y] = UA[X].  Therefore x ∈
UA∈ω∗
UA[X].

Conversely, let x ∈
UA∈ω∗
UA[X], then for any A ∈ I, x ∈ UA[X], thus there exists

y ∈ X such that x ∈ UA[y] and UA[x] ∩ X /= ∅. Hence x ∈ c(X). The proof is
completed.	2

Topological Properties of Uniform Topological Space
(L, τI)
In this section, we study some topological properties of Uniform Topological Space (L, τ£ ), such as compactness, connectedness, separation and countability and so on.
Definition 4.1 [17,18] Let (X, τ ) is a topological space. A subset Y of X is said to be compact if every open covering of Y contains a finite sub-collection also covers
Y . A topological space (X, τ ) said to be a compact space if and only if X itself is compact. A topological space (X, τ ) said to be locally compact at a point x ∈ X, if x has a compact neighborhood in X, and (X, τ ) said to be locally compact if it is locally compact at every point.

Theorem 4.2 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice. If B = . A,
A∈£
Then for any x ∈ L, UB[x] is a compact subset of uniform topological Space (L, τ£ ).


Proof. For arbitrary x ∈ L, let {Oλ}λ∈Λ ⊆ τ£ such that UB[x] = 
λ∈Λ
Oλ. Since

x ∈ UB[x], then there exists λ ∈ Λ such that x ∈ Oλ ∈ τ£ . It follows from Note 2
that UA[x] ⊆ Oλ. Hence UB[x] is a compact subset of (L, τ£ ).	2
Lemma 4.3 [17,18] A topological space (X, τ ) is connected if and only if the only subsets of X that are both open and closed in X are empty set and X itself.
Lemma 4.4 [17,18] If (X, Ω) is a uniform space, then the corresponding uniform topological Space (X, τ ) is a completely regular space.
Theorem 4.5 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice. Then the uni- form topological Space (L, τ£ ) is a ﬁrst-countable, zero-dimensional, disconnected, locally compact and completely regular space.

Proof. Taking B = .
A∈£
A, by Theorem 3.12, it suffices to show that (L, τB) is

a first-countable, zero-dimensional, disconnected, locally compact and completely
regular space. In fact,
For any x ∈ L, by Note 2 (iv), {UB[x]} is a countable neighborhood base of
x. Thus (L, τB) is a first-countable space.
By Theorem 3.9 and Note 2 (iii), we know that BB = {UB[x]|x ∈ L} is a clopen base of τB. Thus (L, τB) is a zero-dimensional space.
By Theorem 3.9 and Lemma 4.3, we have that (L, τB) is a disconnected space.
For any x ∈ L, Note 2 (ii) and Theorem 4.2, we know that UB[x] is a compact neighborhood of x. Thus (L, τB) is a locally compact space.
It follows that (L, τB) is a completely regular space from Lemma 4.4.	2
Definition 4.6 [17,18] A uniform space (X, Ω) is said to be totally bounded if for

every U ∈ Ω, there exists {xi}n	⊆ X such that X =
n
i=1
U [xi].

Theorem 4.7 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice and A = (μP , μN ) ∈ BFI(L). Then the following conditions are equivalent:
A	A
Uniform topological Space (L, τA) is compact,
Uniform Space (L, ω) is totally bounded,

There exists P = {xi}n
⊆ L, for all x ∈ L, there exists xi ∈ P such that

≡A xi.
Proof. (1)=⇒(2): This is clear by Theorem 32 of Chapter 6 in [10].
(2)=⇒(3): Let UA ∈ ω, since (L, ω) is totally bounded, by Definition 4.6, there

exists P = {xi}n	⊆ L such that L =
n

i=1
UA[xi]. Thus for all x ∈ L, there exists

∈ P such that x ∈ UA[xi], therefore x ≡A xi.
=⇒(1): For any x ∈ L, by hypothesis there exists xi ∈ P such that x ≡A xi.

Therefore x ∈ UA[xi], hence L =
 


n i=1
UA[xi]. Now let there exists ∃{Oλ}λ∈Λ ⊆ τA
n

that xi ∈ Oλi . Since Oλi ∈ τA, UA[xi] ⊆ Oλi , we have that L =
 n



n

i=1
UA[xi] ⊆
n

i=1
Oλi .

About the separation of Uniform topological Space (L, τ£ ), we have the following conclusion:
Theorem 4.8 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice. Then the fol- lowing statements are equivalent:
Uniform topological Space (L, τ£ ) is a T1-space,
Uniform topological Space (L, τ£ ) is a T2-space.
Proof. (1)=⇒(2): Let (L, τ£ ) is a T1-space and x, y ∈ L such that x /= y. Then there exists O1, O2 ∈ τ£ such that x ∈ O1,y /∈ O1 and y ∈ O2,x /∈ O2. Hence there exists A = (μP , μN ),B = (μP , μN ) ∈ BFI(L) such that UA[x] ⊆ O1UB[y] ⊆ O2.
A	A	B	B
Let C = A H B, then C ∈ I. We will show that UC[x] ∩ UC[y] = ∅. In fact, let
z ∈ UC[x] ∩ UC[y], then z ≡C x and z ≡C y, by Definition 3.1 we have that
 μP ((z → x)j)= μP ((x → z)j)= μP (0) = μP ((z → y)j)= μP ((y → z)j),

C	C	C	C	C
It follows from C ∈ BFI(L) and Lemma 2.4 that μP (0) = μP ((x → z)j) ∧ μP ((z →
C	C	C
y)j) ≤ μP ((x → y)j), μN (0) = μN ((x → z)j) ∨ μN ((z → y)j) ≥ μN ((x → y)j) and
C	C	C	C	C
μP (0) = μP ((y → z)j) ∧ μP ((z → x)j) ≤ μP ((y → x)j), μN (0) = μN ((y → z)j) ∨
C	C	C	C	C	C
μN ((z → x)j) ≥ μN ((y → x)j). Hence μP ((x → y)j) = μP ((y → x)j) = μP (0) and
C	C	C	C	C
μN ((x → y)j)= μN ((y → x)j)= μN (0). Since C = A H B ± A and μP (0) = μP (0),
C	C	C	C	A
μN (0) = μN (0), by Proposition 3.10 we can obtain that y ∈ UC[x] ⊆ UA[x] ⊆ O1,
C	A
which is a contradiction. Therefore UC[x] ∩ UC[y]= ∅. This show that (L, τ£ ) is a 
T2-space.
(2)=⇒(1): It is obvious.	2
Finally, let L a negative non-involutive residuated lattice. we discuss the con- tinuity of lattice operators ∧, ∨ and adjoint operations ⊗, → in L with respect to uniform topology τ£ .
Definition 4.9 [17,18] Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice and τ a topology on L. Then (L, τ ) is called a topological negative non-involutive residuated lattice if the lattice operators ∧, ∨ and adjoint operation ⊗, → in L are continuous with respect to τ .
Note 3 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice, τ a topology on L and
X, Y ⊆ L. Deﬁne
X Y := {x y ∈ L|x ∈ X and y ∈ Y }, ∈ {∧, ∨, ⊗, →}.

Then operations  ∈ {∧, ∨, ⊗, →} are continuous with respect to τ equivalent to: for every x, y ∈ L and O ∈ τ, x y ∈ O implies there exists O1, O2 ∈ τ such that x ∈ O1,y ∈ O2 and O1  O2 ⊆ O.
Theorem 4.10 Let L be a negative non-involutive residuated lattice. Then (L, τ£ )
is a topological negative non-involutive residuated lattice.
Proof. By Definition 4.9, it suffices to show that ∀ ∈ {∧, ∨, ⊗, →} are continuous with respect to the uniform topology τ£ . In fact, for every x, y ∈ L and O ∈ τ£ , let x y ∈ O, then there exists U ∈ ω such that U [a b] ⊆ O and there exists A = (μP , μN ) ∈ I such that UA ⊆ U . We claim that UA[x]  UA[y] ⊆ UA[x y]. Indeed,
A	A
let z q ∈ UA[x]  UA[y], then z ∈ UA[x] and q ∈ UA[y], thus z ≡A x and q ≡A y, and
so (x y) ≡A (z q). It follows that (x y, z q) ∈ UA ⊆ U , hence z q ∈ UA[x y], this means that the claim holds. Taking O1 = UA[x] and O2 = UA[y], then we can obtain that O1, O2 ∈ τ£ ,x ∈ O1,y ∈ O2 and O1 O2 = UA[x] UA[y] ⊆ UA[x y] ⊆ O. The proof is completed.	2
