Abstract
Stochastic algebraic topology studies random or partly known spaces depending on many random parame- ters. Such spaces typically arise in applications as configuration spaces of large systems. The paper surveys several recent developments of stochastic algebraic topology focusing on three major themes: random 2- dimensional complexes, random Artin and Coxeter groups, and configuration spaces of linkages (known also as polygon spaces) with random length parameters.
Keywords: stochastic topology, random manifold, random complex, random group.


Introduction

Problems of mathematical modeling of large systems of various nature (economical, mechanical, ecological, etc) motivate studying random geometric, topological and algebraic objects. For a system of great complexity, it is unrealistic to assume that one may have a precise description of its configuration space which can rather be viewed as a partially known or random space.
Studying random topological and algebraic objects instead of their determinis- tic analogues has several major advantages. Firstly, random mathematical objects in many cases more adequately reflect reality. Secondly, random objects are often simpler mathematically since exotic and most complicated examples can be ignored

if they are rare, i.e. appear with very small probability. Finally, random mathe- matical objects have sometimes a combination of properties which are difficult to arrange in specific examples.
The most developed stochastic–topological object is a random graph. The theory of random graphs, initiated circa 1959 by Erd¨os and R´enyi [15], is nowadays a fast growing branch of applied mathematics, offering a plethora of spectacular results and predictions for various engineering and computer science applications, see [1], [4], [24].
A model for random simplicial complexes of higher dimension was recently in- troduced and studied by Linial, Meshulam and Wallach, see [27], [28]. The funda- mental groups of random 2-complexes are random groups of a fairly general type. Important progress in understanding this model of random groups was made re- cently by Babson, Hoffman and Kahle [3].
The theory of random groups was initiated by M. Gromov [21], [22]. His model has a density parameter 0 ≤ d ≤ 1, and it is known that for d < 1/2 a random group is infinite and hyperbolic, while it is trivial for d > 1/2, see [21], page 273. Similar results hold for the random groups produced by the Linial - Meshulam model, see [3]. We refer the reader to [35] and [32] for more details. The article [34] is a recent survey of probabilistic group theory. A different mechanism producing random groups was introduced in [9] and in [6]; it consists in studying right angled Artin and Coxeter groups associated to random graphs.
Configuration spaces of mechanical linkages with random bar lengths were first studied in the papers [16], [20]. These are closed smooth manifolds depending on a large number of independent random parameters. Although the number of homeomorphism types of these manifolds grows extremely fast with the number of bars in the linkage, their topological characteristics can be predicted with high probability when the number of bars tends to infinity.
In this article we survey recent results of stochastic algebraic topology which develop the following three topics: (a) random 2-dimensional complexes; (b) spaces and groups associated to random graphs; (c) configuration spaces of random linkages (random polygon spaces).
Random 2-dimensional complexes
The Linial - Meshulam model

Random two-dimensional complexes of Linial and Meshulam [27] are two-dimensional analogues of Erd¨os - R´enyi random graphs, [15]. The probability space G(∆(2), p) of the Linial–Meshulam model is defined as follows. Let ∆n denote the (n − 1)- dimensional simplex with vertices {1, 2, . . . , n}. Then G(∆  , p) denotes the set of
all 2-dimensional subcomplexes
∆(1) ⊂ Y ⊂ ∆(2),

containing the one-dimensional skeleton ∆(1). The probability function P : G(∆(2), p) →
n	n
R is given by the formula
n
f (Y )	3 −f (Y )	(2)
n
where f (Y ) denotes the number of faces in Y . In other words, each of the 2- dimensional simplexes of ∆(2) is included in a random 2-complex Y with probability p, independently of the other 2-simplexes. As in the case of random graphs, 0 < p < 1 is a probability parameter which may depend on n.
Clearly, the model G(∆(2), p) includes all finite 2-dimensional simplicial com- plexes containing the full 1-skeleton ∆(1); however, the probability of various topo- logical phenomena is dependent on the value of p.
Note that the theory of deterministic 2-complexes itself is a rich and active field of current research with many challenging open questions, see [23].
Random groups
The fundamental group of a random 2-complex Y ∈ G(∆(2), p) was investigated by
Babson, Hoffman, and Kahle [3]. They showed that for 4
p ≫ n−1/2 · (3 log n)1/2,
the group π1(Y ) vanishes asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s) 5 . These authors use notions of negative curvature due to Gromov and prove the nontriviality and hyperbolicity of π1(Y ) for
p ≪ n−1/2−ǫ.


The results of [3] carry a strong philosophical message which is very useful for applications: since “a random group is either trivial or hyperbolic” it follows that for random groups many delicate algorithmic problems of group theory (such as the word and isomorphism problems) have positive solutions.
Random complexes in the range p ≪ n−1

The paper [12] based on preprints [10] and [11], studies random 2-complexes with probability parameter p satisfying p ≪ n−1. It was shown that in this range the fundamental group of a random 2-complex is free; this statement complements the results of [3]:
Theorem 2.1 [11], [12] If the probability parameter p satisfies p ≪ n−1 then a random 2-complex Y ∈ G(∆(2), p) collapses simplicially to a graph, a.a.s. In partic- ular, the fundamental group π1(Y ) is free and for any coefficient group G one has H2(Y ; G) = 0, a.a.s.

4 Recall that the symbol an ≪ bn means that an/bn → 0 as n → ∞.
5 We use the symbol a.a.s. as an abbreviation for the phrase “asymptotically almost surely”.

Vanishing of the 2-dimensional homology H2(Y ; G) = 0 of a random 2-complex Y , in the range p ≪ n−1, was established by Kozlov [26]. The result of Kozlov was strengthened in a recent preprint of Aronshtam, Linial, Luczak, and Meshulam [2]. Next we remind the concept of simplicial collapse which appears in Theorem
2.1. Let Y be a finite 2-dimensional simplicial complex. An edge of Y is called free
if it is included in exactly one 2-simplex. The boundary ∂Y is defined as the union of free edges. We say that a 2-complex Y is closed if ∂Y = ∅.
A 2-simplex of Y is called free if at least one of its edges is free. Let σ1, . . . , σk be all free 2-simplexes in Y , and let e1, . . . , ek be free edges with ei ⊂ σi. We say that the complex
Y j = Y − ∪k  int(σi) − ∪k  int(ei)
is obtained from Y by collapsing all free 2-simplexes. Clearly Y j ⊂ Y is a deforma- tion retract. The operation Y ց Y j is called a simplicial collapse. Note that Y j is not uniquely determined if one of the free simplexes of Y has two free edges; however the pure part of Y j (i.e. the union of 2-simplexes of Y j) is uniquely determined. This process can be iterated Y j	Y jj, Y jj	Y jjj, etc. We denote Y = Y (0),
Y j = Y (1), Y jj = Y (2) etc. The sequence of subcomplexes Y (0)  Y (1)  Y (2)  . . .
is decreasing and there are two possibilities: either (a) for some k, the complex Y (k) is one-dimensional (a graph), or (b) for some k, the complex Y (k) is 2-dimensional and closed, i.e., ∂Y (k) = ∅.
Definition 2.2 We say that Y is collapsible to a graph in at most k steps if Y (k) is a graph. We say that Y is collapsible to a graph in k steps if Y (k) is a graph and dim Y (k−1) = 2.
A result proven in [11], [12] states:
Theorem 2.3 If p > cn−1 where c > 3 is a constant, then a random 2-dimensional complex Y ∈ G(∆(2), p) satisfies H (Y ; Z) /= 0, a.a.s.
Loosely speaking, Theorems 2.1 and 2.3 combined suggest that a random 2- complex with vanishing 2-dimensional homology is homotopically one-dimensional.
The main result of [10] (see also [12]) can be stated as follows:
Theorem 2.4 (a) If for some k ≥ 1 the probability parameter p satisfies
−1−  2 

p ≪ n
k+1 ,

then a random 2-complex Y ∈ G(∆(2), p) is collapsible to a graph in at most k steps,
a.a.s. (b) If for some k ≥ 1 the probability parameter p satisfies
−1− 	1	

p ≫ n
3·2k−1 −1 ,

then Y is not collapsible to a graph in k or fewer steps, a.a.s.

The method used in [10], [11], [12] is based on studying simplicial embeddings and immersions of polyhedra into random 2-complexes.

Simplicial embeddings and immersions

The containment problem for subcomplexes of random 2-dimensional complexes is similar to the containment problem for random graphs, see [24], chapter 3. In [11],
[12] we also study simplicial immersions, which are more general than simplicial embeddings.
Let S be a 2-dimensional finite simplicial complex. We assume that S is fixed,
i.e. independent of n. The set of vertices of S is denoted by V (S).
Definition 2.5 A simplicial embedding g : S ֒→ Y , where Y ∈ G(∆(2), p) is a random 2-complex, is defined as an injective map of the set of vertices V (S) of S into the set of vertices {1, . . . , n} of Y satisfying the following condition: for any triple of distinct vertices u1, u2, u3 ∈ V (S) which span a simplex in S, the corresponding points g(u1), g(u2), g(u3) ∈ {1, . . . , n} span a face of Y .
The following definition describes a more general notion.
Definition 2.6 A simplicial immersion g : S R Y into a random 2-complex Y G(∆(2), p) is defined as a map of the set of vertices V (S) of S into the set of vertices
{1, . . . , n} of Y satisfying the following two conditions:
for any triple of distinct vertices u1, u2, u3 ∈ V (S) which span a 2-simplex in S, the corresponding points g(u1), g(u2), g(u3) ∈ {1, . . . , n} are pairwise distinct and span a face of Y ;
for any pair of distinct 2-simplexes σ and σj of S, the corresponding 2- simplexes g(σ) and g(σj) of Y are distinct.
Definition 2.7 For a simplicial 2-complex S let µ(S) denote
v
µ(S) = f ∈ Q,
where v = vS and f = fS are the numbers of vertices and faces in S.
Definition 2.8 Let S be a finite 2-dimensional simplicial complex. Define
µ˜(S) = min µ(Sj),	(1)
S′⊂S
where the minimum is formed over all subcomplexes Sj ⊂ S or, equivalently, over all pure subcomplexes Sj ⊂ S.
Note that the invariant µ˜ is monotone decreasing: if S is a subcomplex of T
then µ˜(S) ≥ µ˜(T ).
Theorem 2.9 [11], [12] Let S be a finite simplicial complex.
If p ≪ n−µ˜(S) then the probability that S admits a simplicial immersion into a
random 2-complex Y ⊂ G(n, p) tends to zero as n → ∞.
If p ≫ n−µ˜(S) then the probability that S admits a simplicial embedding into a
random 2-complex Y ⊂ G(n, p) tends to one as n → ∞.
The proof uses the first and the second moment methods.

Balanced and unbalanced triangulations
Definition 2.10 A finite simplicial 2-complex S is called balanced if µ(S) = µ˜(S),
i.e. if the quantities defined in Definitions 2.7 and 2.8 coincide. In other words, S
is balanced if µ(S) ≤ µ(Sj) for any subcomplex Sj ⊂ S.
Definition 2.10 is similar to the corresponding notion for random graphs, see [24].
Example 2.11 Let S = Σg be a triangulated closed orientable surface of genus g ≥ 0. Then χ(S) = 2 − 2g = v − e + f where v, e, f denote the numbers of vertices, edges and faces in S correspondingly. Each edge is contained in two faces which gives 3f = 2e and therefore

µ(Σ ) = 1 + 2 − 2g .	(2)
g	2	f
Similarly, if S = Ng is a triangulated closed nonorientable surface of genus g ≥ 1 then χ(Ng) = 2 − g and

µ(N ) = 1 + 2 − g .	(3)
g	2	f
Formulae (2) and (3) give the following:
Corollary 2.12 The invariant µ(Σg) of an orientable triangulated surface Σg sat- isfies:
1/2 < µ(Σg) ≤ 1 for g = 0 (since f ≥ 4);
µ(Σg) = 1/2 for g = 1 (the torus);
µ(Σg) < 1/2 for g > 1;
If f → ∞ (i.e. when the surface is subsequently subdivided) then µ(Σg) → 1/2. Corollary 2.13 The invariant µ(Ng) of a nonorientable triangulated surface Ng satisfies:
1/2 < µ(Ng) ≤ 3/5 for g = 1 (since f ≥ 10);
µ(Ng) = 1/2 for g = 2 (the Klein bottle);
µ(Ng) < 1/2 for g > 2;
If f → ∞ (i.e. when the surface is subsequently subdivided) then µ(Ng) → 1/2. Example 2.14 Let S be a triangulated disc. Then χ(S) = v − e + f = 1 and 3f = 2e − e0 where e0 is the number of edges in the boundary ∂S. Substituting e = (3f + e0)/2, one obtains
µ(S) = 1 + e0 + 1 .	(4)
2	2f	f
As a specific example consider the regular n-gon S shown on the figure on the left. Then v = n + 1, f = n, e0 = n and

µ(S) = 1 + .

In figure 2.14, on the right we have e0 = 4 and the number of faces f equals
f = 2n + 4. Thus

converges to 1 as n → ∞.
µ(T ) =

2	2n + 4

Corollary 2.15 For any triangulation S of the disk one has µ(S) > 1/2. There
exist triangulations S of D2 with µ(S) arbitrarily close to 1/2.
Example 2.16 Let Sj be such that µ(Sj) < 1 and suppose that S is obtained from Sj by adding a triangle ∆ such that Sj ∩ ∆ is an edge. Then S is not balanced. Indeed, vS = vS′ + 1 and fS = fS′ + 1 and

µ(S) = vS′ + 1 > vS′
= µ(Sj).

fS′ + 1	fS′
Corollary 2.17 There exist unbalanced triangulations of the disk.

Proof. Start with a disk triangulation Sj with µ(Sj) < 1 (for instance, Sj can be the square with implanted n-gon, see Example 2.14) and add a triangle S = Sj ∆ such that Sj ∆ is an edge lying in the boundary ∂Sj. Then µ(S) > µ(Sj) (see Example 2.16) and S is unbalanced. Clearly, S is homeomorphic to the 2-dimensional disk.✷ Theorem 2.18 [11], [12] Any closed connected triangulated surface S is balanced.
Surfaces in random 2-complexes

In the following statement we consider “small surfaces”, i.e. triangulated surfaces which do not depend on n. Theorems 2.9, 2.18 and Corollaries 2.12 and 2.13 imply, see [11], [12]:
Corollary 2.19 One has:
If p ≪ n−1 then a random 2-complex Y ∈ G(∆(2), p) contains 6 no small 7
closed surfaces, a.a.s.
If n−1 ≪ p ≪ n−3/5 then a random 2-complex Y contains small spheres but no small closed surfaces of other topological types, a.a.s.

6 In this Corollary the word “contains” means “contains as a simplicial subcomplex.”
7 In this statement one may remove the word “small” as follows from the proof of Theorem 2.1.

If n−3/5 ≪ p ≪ n−1/2 then a random 2-complex Y contains small spheres and projective planes but no small closed surfaces of higher genera, a.a.s.
If p ≫ n−1/2 then a random 2-complex Y contains all small spheres, projective planes, tori and Klein bottles, a.a.s.
If p ≫ n−1/2+ǫ for some ǫ > 0 then, given a topological type of a closed surface, there exists f0 = f0(ǫ), such that any triangulation of the surface having more than f0 2-simplexes will be simplicially embeddable into a random 2-complex
Y , a.a.s. In particular, if p ≫ n−1/2+ǫ, a random 2-complex Y contains small closed orientable and nonorientable surfaces of all possible topological types, a.a.s.
Corollary 2.20 For a random 2-complex Y ∈ G(∆(2), p) with p ≫ n−1 one has
π2(Y ) /= 0,  and H2(Y ; Z) /= 0	(5)
a.a.s.

Aspherical spaces and groups associated to random graphs
Given a finite graph Γ with vertex set V and with the set of edges E, one associates to it a right angled Artin group (also known as a graph group)
AΓ = ⟨v ∈ V ; vw = wv	iff	(v, w) ∈ E⟩,
see [5], [31]. In the case when Γ is a complete graph AΓ is a free abelian group of rank n = |V |; in the other extreme, when Γ has no edges the group AΓ is the free group of rank n. In general AΓ interpolates between the free and free abelian groups.
We are interested in right angled Artin groups associated to random graphs Γ. We adopt one of the basic Erd˝os - R´enyi models of random graphs in which each edge of the complete graph on n vertices is included with probability 0 < p < 1 independently of all other edges. In other words, we consider the probability space
G(∆(1), p) of all 2( ) subgraphs
n	2
∆(0) ⊂ Γ ⊂ ∆(1)
of the complete graph on n vertices {1, 2, . . . , n} and the probability that a specific graph Γ ∈ G(∆(1), p) appears as a result of a random process equals
P(Γ) = pEΓ (1 − p)(2 )−EΓ ,	(6)
where EΓ denotes the number of edges of Γ, see [24].
(1)
The function Γ '→ AΓ where Γ ∈ G(∆	, p) is a new mechanism producing
random groups. In Gromov’s model a random group is given by a presentation with
randomly generated relations where each of the relations has a fixed length and the total number of relations is also fixed (it depends on the density d). In the case

of random right angled Artin groups one generates randomly relations of a special type (namely, the commutation relations). One wants to translate the evolution theory of random graphs to the language of random right angled Artin groups. In
[9] we examine statistics of various topological invariants of the group AΓ associated to a random graph. Each of such invariants is a random function and it is quite natural to ask about its mathematical expectation and distribution function. We assume that n → ∞ and seek results of asymptotic nature.
It is clear that basic properties of Γ are reflected in properties of the group. For example, AΓ decomposes as a free product if and only if Γ is disconnected. For Γ ∈ G(∆(1), p), Erd˝os and R´enyi [15] showed that this holds asymptotically almost surely if p = log n−ω(n) , where ω : N → R is a function such that limn→∞ ω(n) = ∞.
Likewise, AΓ decomposes as a direct product if and only if the complementary graph is disconnected, which holds a.a.s. if 1 − p = log n−ω(n) .
The Eilenberg-MacLane space KΓ associated to the right angled Artin group AΓ of a random graph Γ is a random aspherical space. The spaces KΓ are closely related to the configuration spaces of braid groups of graphs (see [13]) which indicates the relevance of this study to topological robotics.
Betti numbers of random graph groups
The cohomology algebra of KΓ with integral coefficients is the quotient
H∗(KΓ; Z) ≃ E(v1, . . . , vn)/JΓ	(7)
where E(v1, . . . , vn) is the exterior algebra generated by degree one classes corre- sponding to the vertices V = {v1, . . . , vn} of Γ and the ideal JΓ is generated by the degree two monomials vw such that the corresponding vertices v, w are not connected by an edge.
In particular any product vi1 vi2 · · · vir vanishes iff the corresponding vertices
{vi1 , vi2 , . . . , vir } do not form a complete subgraph of Γ. For an integer r ≥ 2 the
r-th Betti number br(AΓ) = br(KΓ) equals the number of complete subgraphs of
size r in Γ. The expectation of the r-th Betti number of the group AΓ of a random
graph Γ, where r ≥ 2, equals E(b (A )) =  n p(r). Note that b (A ) = 1 and
r	Γ	r	2	0	Γ
b1(AΓ) = n for any graph Γ.
Now we assume that r (the dimension) is fixed and p may depend on n. Asymp-
totically, the expectation of br(AΓ) can be written as
E(b (A )) ∼	hnp	ir .
1	r−1
The expectation has a positive limit for n → ∞ if and only if
r−1
np 2  → c > 0.	(8)
cr

Under this condition the expectation E(br(AΓ)) converges to
 = λ.
r!

Theorem 3.1 is an interpretation of a theorem of Schu¨rger [33] about complete subgraphs in random graphs.

Theorem 3.1 Fix an integer r > 1 and consider the r-th Betti number of the associated graph group,
br : G(∆(1), p) → Z,	br(Γ) = br(AΓ),
as a random function of a random graph. If the limit (8) exists and is positive then
for any integer k = 0, 1, . . . , the probability P(br(AΓ) = k) converges (as n → ∞)
−λ  λk	cr
to e	· k! , where λ = r! .
In other words, the limiting distribution is Poisson with mean λ.
Cohomological dimension of random graph groups

The cohomological dimension of AΓ equals the size of the maximal clique in Γ. Recall that a clique in a graph is defined as a maximal complete subgraph. The clique number cl(Γ) of a graph Γ is the maximal order of a clique in Γ.
There are many results in the literature about the clique number of random graphs; we may interpret these results as statements about the cohomological di- mension of graph groups build from random graphs. Matula [29], [30] discovered that for fixed values of p the distribution of the clique number of a random graph is highly concentrated in the sense that almost all random graphs have about the same clique number. These results were developed further by Bollob´as and Erd˝os; see the monographs of B. Ballob´as [4] and of N. Alon and J. Spencer [1].
We restate a result of Matula [30] as a statement about cohomological dimension of random graph groups. Denote
z(n, p) = 2 logq n − 2 logq logq n + 2 logq (e/2) + 1,	(9) where q = p−1. We assume that p is independent of n.
Theorem 3.2 Fix an arbitrary ǫ > 0. Then
⌊z(n, p) − ǫ⌋ ≤ cd(AΓ) ≤ ⌊z(n, p) + ǫ⌋,	(10)
asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s). In other words, the probability that a graph
Γ ∈ G(∆(1), p) does not satisfy inequality (10) tends to zero when n tends to infinity.
Here ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer not exceeding x. We may assume that ǫ < 1/2; then the integers ⌊z(n, p) − ǫ⌋ and ⌊z(n, p) + ǫ⌋ either coincide or differ by 1.
Thus, according to Theorem 3.2, the cohomological dimension cd(AΓ) for a random graph Γ takes on one of at most two values depending on n and p, with probability approaching 1 as n → ∞.
Topological complexity of random graph groups

The concept of topological complexity TC(X) was introduced in [16]; it is motivated by the motion planning problem of robotics, see [18]. TC(X) is a homotopy invariant associating an integer to a path-connected topological space X. The paper [9]

studies the topological complexity TC(KΓ) of the Eilenberg- MacLane space KΓ
associated to a random graph Γ.
Theorem 3.3 [9] Fix an arbitrary 0 < ǫ < 1/2 and assume that the probability parameter 0 < p < 1 is independent of n. Then for a random graph Γ ∈ G(∆(1), p)
one has
2 · ⌊z(n, p) − ǫ⌋ + 1 ≤ TC(KΓ) ≤ 2 · ⌊z(n, p) + ǫ⌋ + 1,	(11)
asymptotically almost surely, where z(n, p) is given by (9).
Automorphism groups of random right-angled Artin groups

Automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups have been extensively studied in recent years, see, for example, [7,8]. In [6] the authors consider automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups associated to random graphs.
Theorem 3.4 [6] Let Γ ∈ G(∆(1), p) be a random graph where the probability pa- rameter p is independent on n and satisfies
1
1 − √2 < p < 1.	(12)
Then the right-angled Artin group AΓ determined by Γ has a finite outer automor- phism group Out(AΓ), a.a.s.

Note that 1 − 1/√2 ∼ 0.2929. It would be interesting to know if Theorem 3.4 holds outside the range (12).
Hyperbolicity of random Coxeter groups

Given a graph Γ with vertex set V and with the set of edges E one associates to it a right angled Coxeter group
WΓ = ⟨v ∈ V ; v2 = 1, vw = wv	iff	(v, w) ∈ E⟩.
Assuming that Γ ∈ G(∆(1), p) is a random graph of Erd˝os and R´enyi [15], the function Γ '→ WΓ gives another mechanism producing random groups.
Theorem 3.5 [6] The right-angled Coxeter group WΓ corresponding to a random Erd˝os - R´enyi graph Γ ∈ G(n, p) is hyperbolic a.a.s. if either (1 − p)n2 → 0 or pn → 0. If however pn → ∞ and (1 − p)n2 → ∞ then the random right-angled Coxeter group WΓ is not hyperbolic, a.a.s.
In [6] a more general theorem of this kind is proven.
We observe that for random Coxeter groups the hyperbolicity is quite a rare phenomenon unlike for random group models of Gromov and Linial-Meshulam.

Statistical theory of linkages and polygon spaces

Interesting examples of random topological spaces are provided by configuration spaces of mechanical linkages and polygon spaces. Recall that a linkage is a simple mechanism consisting of n bars in R3 having fixed lengths l1, . . . , ln which are cyclically connected by revolving joints forming a closed polygonal chain. Angles between bars of the linkage may vary, the only condition is that the links do not become disconnected from each other. We consider a pair of configurations of the
linkage as being identical if one can be obtained from the other by a rigid motion of the space R3. The configuration space of the linkage
n
Nℓ = {(u1, . . . , un) ∈ S2 × · · · × S2;	liui = 0 ∈ R3} / SO(3),
i=1
parameterizes all possible configurations. Here ℓ = (l1, l2, . . . , ln) ∈ Rn is the
n-tuple of the bar lengths, called the length vector. Spaces Nℓ are also known as polygon spaces as they parameterize shapes of all n-gons in R3 having sides of length l1, . . . , ln.
The spaces Nℓ appear in molecular biology where they represent shapes of long molecules. Clearly, information about topological properties of these spaces may lead to interesting new effects in molecular and chemical design. Statistical shape theory is another area where the spaces Nℓ play an interesting role: they describe the space of shapes having certain geometric properties with respect to the central point. Having in mind these applications it is quite natural to assume that the number of links n is large, n → ∞, and that the numbers li > 0 are not entirely known or are known with some random error.
Let us now recall some basic facts concerning the topology of Nℓ and its de- pendence on the length vector ℓ ∈ R3 . For a generic ℓ the space Nℓ is a closed smooth manifold of dimension 2(n − 3). If ℓ is not generic then Nℓ is a compact manifold with finitely many singularities. Clearly, Nℓ = Ntℓ for any t > 0. Hence we
may consider ℓ as lying in the quotient space An−1 of Rn modulo the action of R+
by scalar multiplication. An−1 can be identified with the interior of the standard simplex, i.e. the set given by the inequalities l1 > 0, . . . , ln > 0 and	li = 1.
We know that Nℓ is diffeomorphic to Nℓ′ if ℓj is obtained from ℓ by permuting coordinates. Let Σn denote the permutation group of n symbols. Clearly Σn acts on

Rn and on An−1 by permuting coordinates and the manifold Nℓ depends only on the Σn-orbit of the vector ℓ. To explain further the character of the dependence of Nℓ
on ℓ we need to recall the concept of a chamber (see [19]). A chamber is a connected
component of the complement Rn − S HJ , where for any subset J ⊂ {1, . . . , n}
we denote by HJ ⊂ Rn the hyperplane i∈J li = i∈/J li. Generic length vectors are defined as those lying in chambers, not on hyperplanes HJ .
It was proven in [19] that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the orbits of chambers and diffeomorphism type of manifolds 8 Nℓ.
The following picture summarizes our description of the field of topological spaces ℓ '→ Nℓ viewed as a single object. The open simplex An−1 is divided into a huge number of tiny chambers, each representing a diffeomorphism type of manifolds Nℓ. The symmetric group Σn acts on the simplex An−1 mapping chambers to chambers and, for n /= 4, two manifolds Nℓ and Nℓ′ are diffeomorphic if and only if the vectors ℓ, ℓj lie in chambers belonging to the same Σn-orbit.
The main idea (first proposed in [20]) is to use methods of probability theory and statistics in dealing with the variety of diffeomorphism types of configuration spaces Nℓ for n large. We may view the length vector ℓ ∈ An−1 as a random variable whose statistical behavior is characterized by a probability measure νn. Topological invariants of Nℓ become random functions; for example one may consider the average
or expected Betti numbers 9

E(b2p(Nℓ)) = ∫
b2p(Nℓ)dνn	(13)
An−1

where the integration is understood with respect to ℓ. One of the main results (see below) states that for p fixed and n large this average 2p-dimensional Betti number can be calculated explicitly up to an exponentially small error. More precisely, we
prove that

E(b2p(Nℓ)) =
n−1 b2p(Nℓ)dνn ∼
Σi=0
 n − 1 ;

see Theorem 4.2 below for a precise statement. It might appear surprising that the asymptotic value of the average Betti number b2p(Nℓ) does not depend of the sequence of probability measures νn which are allowed to vary in an ample class of admissible probability measures described below.
One may also study the average Betti numbers bp(Mℓ) of configuration spaces of planar polygon spaces. Recall that the space of planar n-gons with a fixed length vector is defined as
n
Mℓ = {(u1, . . . , un) ∈ S1 × · · · × S1;	liui = 0 ∈ R2} / SO(2).

for two different sequences of probability measures νn on Rn . It was discovered in
[20] that for large n the answers for these two distinct measures were equal. In [17] a universality phenomenon was established for a large class of admissible probability measures.
Admissible sequences of probability measures

For a vector ℓ = (l1, . . . , ln) we denote by |ℓ| = max{|l1|, . . . , |ln|} the maximum of the absolute values of coordinates. The symbol A   denotes the open unit simplex,
i.e. the set of all vectors ℓ = (l1, l2, . . . , ln) ∈ Rn such that li > 0 and l1+· · ·+ln = 1. Let µn denote the Lebesgue measure on An−1 normalized so that µn(An−1) = 1. For an integer p ≥ 1 we denote by
Λp = {ℓ ∈ A  ; |ℓ| ≥ (2p)  }.	(15)
Clearly, Λp ⊂ Λq for p ≤ q and Λp = An−1 for 2p ≥ n.
It will be helpful to think of p being fixed and of n being large, say, tending to
∞. The set Λp is shown on the picture on the left. It is the union of n domains Λi

defined as
Λi = {ℓ = (l1, . . . , ln) ∈ An−1; li ≥ (2p)−1},

where i = 1, . . . , n. Each Λi is homothetic to An−1 with factor (1 −  1 ) and hence
µn(Λi ) = (1 −  1 )n−1. It follows that
p	2p
µ (Λ ) ≤ n · (1 −  1  )n−1.	(16)
We see that the normalized Lebesgue measure of Λp is exponentially small for large
n.

Definition 4.1 Consider a sequence of probability measures νn on An−1 where
n = 1, 2,	It is called admissible if
νn = fn · µn
where fn : An−1 → R is a sequence of Lebesgue measurable functions satisfying:
fn	0,
∫An−1 fndµn = 1,

for any p ≥ 1 there exist constants K > 0 and 0 < b < 2 such that
fn(ℓ) ≤ K · bn	(17)
for any n and any ℓ ∈ Λp ⊂ An−1.
Examples. It is obvious that the sequence νn = µn is admissible.
As another example of an admissible sequence of measures can be constructed
as follows. Consider the unit cube  n ⊂ Rn given by the inequalities 0 ≤ li ≤ 1
for i = 1, . . . , n. Let χn be the probability measure on Rn supported on  n ⊂ Rn
such that the restriction χn| n is the Lebesgue measure, χn( n) = 1. Consider the sequence of induced measures
νn = q∗(χn)	(18)
on simplices An−1 where
q : Rn → An−1,	q(ℓ) = 	1	 · ℓ	(19)
l1 + · · · + ln
is the normalization map The measures νn have a very clear geometric meaning: it is the probability distribution in the case when the bar lengths li are independent and are uniformly distributed in the unit interval [0, 1], see [20].
Expectations of Betti Numbers

The next Theorem describes the asymptotic values (as n → ∞) of the expectations of the Betti numbers of polygon spaces in R :
Theorem 4.2 [17] Fix an admissible sequence of probability measures νn and an integer p ≥ 0, and consider the 2p-dimensional Betti number (13) of polygon spaces constants C > 0 and 0 < a < 1 (depending on the sequence of measures νn and on Nℓ in R3 as a random variable on An−1, for large n → ∞. Then there exist
the number p but independent of n) such that the average Betti numbers (13) satisfy

The following theorem describes the asymptotic values of the expectations of Betti numbers in the case of the planar polygon spaces Mℓ.
Theorem 4.3 [17] Fix an admissible sequence of probability measures νn and an integer p ≥ 0, and consider the average p-dimensional Betti number (14) of planar polygon spaces for large n → ∞. Then there exist constants C > 0 and 0 < a < 1 (depending on the sequence of measures νn and on the number p but independent of
n) such that

Expectations of middle-dimensional and total Betti numbers

C. Dombry and C. Mazza in their paper [14] studied the average Betti numbers of unbounded dimension, the average total Betti numbers as well as the average Poincar´e polynomials of the polygon spaces Mℓ and Nℓ.
The main assumption concerning the probability measure µn on the simplex An−1 made in the work [14] is the following. Let µ be a diffuse probability measure on R+ = (0, ∞) such that
∫ eηxdµ(x) < ∞	for some	η > 0.
Recall that a measure is said to be diffuse if it satisfies µ({x}) = 0 for all x ∈ R+.
The product measure µ⊗n on Rn describes the situation when each of the compo-
nents li of the length vector is distributed according to the measure µ, independently of all other components. Then µn is the push-forward measure
µn = q∗(µ⊗n) where q : Rn → An−1 is the central projection (19).
Theorem 4.4 [14] Let (pn)n≥3 be a sequence of integers satisfying 0 ≤ pn ≤ n − 3.
If lim sup n−1pn < 1/2, then 10

If lim n−1/2(pn − n/2) = α, then

where m = E(ℓ), σ2 = Var(ℓ), and Z is standard normal.
Finally we mention results concerning the average total Betti numbers of polygon spaces. We denote them by
n−3	n−3
B(Mℓ) = Σ bp(Mℓ),	B(Nℓ) = Σ b2p(Nℓ),

correspondingly. Dombry and Mazza [14] proved that the average total Betti num- bers satisfy the following asymptotic formulae
∫An−1 B(Mℓ)dµn ∼ 2n−1,

∫An−1 B(Nℓ)dµn ∼ n2n−2.
(25)

We know that for the equilateral planar linkage one has B(M(1,1,...,1)) ∼ 2n−1. Thus the first asymptotic formula in (25) states that in the planar case the average total Betti number is asymptotically achieved on the total Betti number of the equilateral linkage. However the total Betti number for equilateral linkage in the space R3 for n = 2r + 1 odd 11 equals

B(N(1,1,...,1)) =
r−1

k=0
(r − k) 2r  ∼

This deviates from the second asymptotic formula in (25), i.e. the average total Betti
number for spatial linkages is less than the total Betti number of the equilateral linkage.
