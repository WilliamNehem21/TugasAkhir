Abstract
In this paper we propose a Chomsky-Schu¨tzenberger type characterization of k- poly-slender context-free languages, as the homomorphical image of an intersec- tion of a Dyck language and a (2k + 1)-poly-slender regular language. A stronger result is provided, namely the homomorphism and the Dyck language are deter- mined irrespective of the given poly-slender context-free language, when consid- ering the family of all poly-slender context-free languages. A similar characteri- zation is obtained for Parikh slender context-free languages.

Introduction
Considerations concerning the length of words in languages have been in the focus of interest of many researchers for a long time. Thus, in [5] (see also [3,14]) for a given language L, one associates with each nonnegative integer n, the number of words of length at most n in L, denoted by #L(n).
Then one defines the “generating function” of L by
fL(z) = X #L(n)zn
n>0
and proves that this function is an algebraic function over the field of ratio- nals, provided that L is an unambiguous context-free language. Moreover, the transcendentality of generating function is the main tool in the study of inherent ambiguity of context-free languages in [7].
Also deep results involving words length considerations in Lindenmayer systems have been reported in a series of papers [6,9,15,20].
Motivated by some problems arising in cryptography, [1] introduces slender languages as being those languages which contain at most a con- stant number of words of any length. Roughly speaking, the following for- mal language approach of the Richelieu cryptosystem is considered in [1]: a plaintext is encripted using an encription key of length n yielding a cryp- totext of the same length of the encription key. If the legal receiver knows the key, then it can easily recover the original text. The problem appears when transmitting all possible keys to the legal receiver. In order to de- crease the recovering complexity, the keys should come from a slender language such that the receiver may test a limited number of keys for each cryptotext. The reader interestead in further details may consult [1].
Characterizations of slender regular and context-free languages have been reported in [18,21] and [11], respectively. Many aspects of different types of slender languages have been investigated in a series of papers [16,17]
Raz extends in [19] the concept of slenderness to poly-slenderness, a poly-slender language being a language whose number of words of length n is bounded by the value of a polynomial in n for all n  0. A character- ization of poly-slender regular languages has been provided in [21] while a characterization of poly-slender context-free languages has been pro- posed in [12].
In this paper we propose a characterization of k-poly-slender context- free languages in the Chomsky-Schu¨tzenberger type [5], as the homomor- phical image of an intersection of a Dyck language with a (2k + 1)-poly- slender regular language. When dropping k, a stronger result is provided, namely the homomorphism and the Dyck language are determined irre- spective of the given poly-slender context-free language. Moreover, the converse assertion is also true. A similar characterization is obtained for


Parikh slender context-free languages, namely each Parikh slender context- free language is the homomorphical image of an intersection of a Dyck language with a Parikh slender regular language, but the converse does not hold.

Basic Definitions and Previous Results
The set of all words over the alphabet V is denoted by V  , while V + =
V  n f"g, where " is the empty word. For each word x 2 V +, whose length is denoted by jxj, jxja delivers the number of occurrences of the letter a in
x. Any subset of V  is called a language over V . For a nonnegative integer
k a language L  V  is called k-bounded if there are the words x ;x ;::: ;x 
1	2	k
over V  such that L  fx g fx g  ::: fx g . L is bounded if it is k-bounded for some k  0. For basic notions and results of combinatorics on words the reader is refered to [4,13].
Given a language L the mapping #L(n) gives the number of all words of length n in L for every n. Formally, #L(n) = card(fx 2 L j jxj = ng): For a nonnegative integer k, the language L is said to be k-poly-slender if #L(n) 2 O(nk): Furthermore, L is poly-slender if it is k-poly-slender for some k  0. Any 0-poly-slender language is called also slender.
The following result appears in [19].
Theorem 2.1 The class of poly-slender context-free languages is exactly the class of bounded context-free languages.
Moreover, a direct consequence of the proof of Proposition 1 in [19] useful in the sequel is
Proposition 2.2 A k-bounded language is (k-1)-poly-slender for any k   1.
For an alphabet V we denote by V  = fa j a 2 V g. The language over
(V [ V ) generated by the context-free grammar having the set of rules fS ! SS; S ! "g[ fS ! aSa j a 2 V g is called the Dyck language over V denoted DV . We write w  = a 1a 2 ::: a n for w = a1a2 ::: an, ai 2 V , 1  i  n.
Now we recall the definition of Dyck loops following [12]. Let Vk = fa1; a2;::: ; akg and z = z1z2 ::: z2k 2 DVk be a word with zj 2 Vk [ V k , 1 j  2k, jzjai = jzja i = 1 for all 1  i  k, and U be an alphabet disjoint from
Vk [ V k. For a homomorphism h : (U [ Vk [ V ) ! U and some integers
 	 

ni  0, 1  i  k, we define the homomorphism


hn1;n2;:::;nk
by
: (U [ Vk
[ V  )  ! U 

hn1 ;n2 ;:::;nk (a)= a for all a 2 U;
h	(a )= uni ; 1  i  k
n1;n2;:::;nk	i	i
h	(a  )= vni ; 1  i  k;
n1;n2;:::;nk	i	i



for some u ;v 
2 U  , 1   i   k. Then for some words w ;w ;::: ;w

D = fhn1;n2;:::;nk (w0z1w1z2w2 ::: z2kwk) j ni   0; 1  i   kg
is called a k-Dyck loop. Clearly, the same set D can be obtained by chang- ing the homomorphism h1;1;:::;1 or the Dyck word z. We say that z is a un- derlying word of D and h = h1;1;:::;1 is a underlying homomorphism of D.
According to the above notations, the main results of [11] and [12] can be written as
Theorem 2.3 A context-free language is k-poly-slender if and only if it is a finite union of (k+1)-Dyck loops.

Characterizations ofPoly-Slender Context-Free Languages
We say that the class of languages L1 is weakly characterized in the Chomsky- Schu¨tzenberger type with the class of languages L2 if for any language
L1 2 L1 over an alphabet V , there exist an alphabet U ,a language L2 2 L2
over U and a homomorphism h from U into V with L1 = h(DU \ L2). Fur- ther, if h(DU \ L2) 2 L1 for any homomorphism h from U into an alphabet
V , and any language L2 2 L2 over U , then we say that the class of lan-
guages L1 is strongly characterized in the Chomsky-Schu¨tzenberger type with the class of languages L2.
Such a strong characterization is well known for one of the most inves- tigated families of languages in the formal language theory [5].
Theorem 3.1 The family of context-free languages is strongly characterized in the Chomsky-Schu¨ tzenberger type with the family of regular languages.
Now we are ready to prove the main result of this section.
Theorem 3.2 For each k 0, the family of k-poly-slender context-free lan- guages is weakly characterized in the Chomsky-Schu¨tzenberger type with the family of (2k+1)-poly-slender regular languages.
Proof. Let V be a given alphabet and L be a k-poly-slender context-free language over V . By Theorem 2.3, L can be written as a finite union of
(k+1)-Dyck loops. Let us denote these (k+1)-Dyck loops by D1; D2;::: ; Dm
for some m  1. Further, assume that

D = fh(Di )
(w(Di)z(Di)w(Di)z(Di)w(Di) ::: z(Di) w(Di) )

with w(Di ); w(Di );::: ; w(Di ) 2 V  for any 1  i  m, and
0	1	2k+2
V (Di) [ V (Di) = fz(Di); z(Di);::: z(Di) g;

for all 1  i  m. Moreover, all alphabets V (Di ) may be supposed mutually
disjoint.
We consider the alphabet

where cj , 1  i  m; 0  j   2k + 2, are new letters not in Si=1(Vk+1 [

Now we define the regular language

R = [fc(i)c (i)gfz(Di )g fc(i)c (i)gfz(Di )g fc(i)c (i)g ::: fz(Di ) g fc(i)

c (i)	g;

and the homomorphism g : (U [ U  )  ! V   defined by
g(c(i))= w(Di );

g(z(Di))= h(Di)


(z(Di ));

j	1;1;:::;1	j
for all 1   i   m and 1   j   2k + 2. Clearly, for each 1   i   m the following relation holds:
D = g(D \ fc(i)c (i)gfz(Di )g fc(i)c (i)gfz(Di )g fc(i)c (i)g ::: 
i	U	0	0	1	1	1	2	2	2

Consequently, L = g(DU \ R) holds as well. By Proposition 2.2 it follows that the regular language R from above is (2k +1)-poly-slender which con- cludes the proof.	2
Since the homomorphical image of every k-Dyck loop is a k-Dyck loop, it follows that all families of k-poly-slender context-free languages, k  0, are closed under homomorphisms. We do not know whether the family of (2k + 1)-poly-slender regular languages in the above characterization can be replaced by the family of k-poly-slender regular languages. This would imply a strong characterization of the class of k-poly-slender context-free languages for each k	0. Another related problem regards the minimal
value of m  k such that each class of k-poly-slender languages can be weakly characterized in the Chomsky-Schu¨tzenberger type with the fam- ily of m-poly-slender regular languages. We conjecture that this minimal value is exactly 2k + 1, so that the previous result is optimal in this respect. Several decidability problems, which remain open in this paper, natu-
rally arise if our conjecture is false:
Given a k-poly-slender language, is the minimal value of m from above computable?


Are there k-poly-slender languages, which are not (k 1)-poly-slender, such that the aforementioned minimal value is k? In the affirmative, can we decide whether a given k-poly-slender language has this property, namely does it admit a Chomsky-Schu¨tzenberger characterization with a k-poly- slender regular language?
However, it is obvious that
Theorem 3.3 The class of poly-slender context-free languages is strongly characterized with the class of poly-slender regular languages.
As one can easily see, in the above Chomsky-Schu¨tzenberger type char- acterizations, the alphabet of the regular and the Dyck language, together with the homomorphism depend on the given poly-slender context-free language. This result can be still improved such that all the aforemen- tioned objects can be determined irrespective of the given poly-slender context-free language. This improvment is based on the same characteri- zation of poly-slender context-free languages, by [8] via Theorem 2.1.
A family of languages L is closed under paired loop if for any language
L 2 L and any two words x; y, the language S   fxngLfyng is in L.
Theorem 3.4 The family of poly-slender context-free languages is the small- est family which contains all singleton languages and is closed under the following operations:
union,
concatenation,
paired loop.
We call the minimal number of the above operations needed for ob- taining a poly-slender context-free language L by the order of L. Now we state
Theorem 3.5 Let V be an alphabet; a new alphabet U and a homomor- phism h from U into V can be determined such that for each poly-slender context-free language L over V there exists a poly-slender regular language R over U such that L = h(DU \ R). Moreover, h(DU \ R) is a poly-slender context-free for any homomorphism h from U into V and any poly-slender regular language R.
Proof. For the given alphabet V we construct the alphabet W = V [f#g[ 
V 0; where V 0 = fa0 j a 2 V g, and # is a new symbol. For w = a1a2 ::: an, ai 2 V , 1  i  n, we denote by w0 the word a0 a0 ::: a0 . Put U = W [ W  .

The homomorphism h is defined by
1  2	n


h(a) = h(a 0) = a; a 2 V; and h(a) = "; a 2 U n (V [ V 0):
Let L be a poly-slender context-free language over V . We prove the state- ment by induction on the order of L, say k. If k = 0, then L is a singleton


language, L = fxg. One takes the singleton regular language R = fxx R g, where xR delivers the mirror image of x. Clearly, L = h(D \ R).
Let L1; L2 be two poly-slender context-free languages over V of orders smaller than k. By the induction hypothesis,
Li = h(DU \ Ri );i = 1; 2:

If L = L1 [ L2, then L = h(DU \ (R1 \ R2)) trivially holds. If L = L1L2, then L = h(DU \ (R1f#gR2f# g)) holds.

If L = S
i 0
fxi gL fyig, then L = h(D
\ (fxy0Rg R fy 0x R g )) holds.

Consequently, the first part of the theorem is proved. The second part is
obvious.	2

Characterizations ofParikh Slender Languages
Instead of words of length n, in [10] one counts the number of words with the same Parikh vector. In particular, a very nice and simple proof of the result of Autebert, Flajolet, and Gabarro [2] concerning the inherent am- biguity of coprefix languages of infinite words is obtained.
By definition, if V = fa1; a2;::: ; amg is an alphabet and w 2 V is a word, the Parikh vector  V (w) is defined by
 V (w) = (jwja1 ; jwja2 ;::: ; jwjam ):
A language L   V  is termed Parikh slender if there is a positive integer k such that for each vector of positive integers (i1; i2;::: ; im ) there are at most k words in L with the Parikh vector (i1; i2;::: ; im ). A natural ques- tion asks whether or not the family of Parikh slender context-free lan- guages admits a Chomsky-Schu¨tzenberger type characterization. As we have seen, this problem has been left open for slender languages in the previous section.
A language L  V  is said to be a multiple loop language if there exist k  1 and the strings u1; v1; u2; v2;::: ; uk; vk ; uk+1 2 V  such that the follow- ing two conditions are satisfied:
(i) L = u1v u2v ::: uk v uk+1
1	2	k
(ii) V (v1); V (v2);::: ; V (vk ) are linearly independent over Q:
The following characterization of Parikh slender regular languages ap- pears in [10].
Theorem 4.1 A regular language is Parikh slender if and only if it is a finite union of disjoint multiple loop languages.
It is quite easy to notice that each Parikh slender context-free language is poly-slender and the regular language from the proof of Theorem 3.2 is Parikh slender in accordance with Theorem 4.1.  Therefore, we have


just got a Chomsky-Schu¨tzenberger type characterization of Parikh slen- der context-free languages.
Theorem 4.2 The family of Parikh slender context-free languages is weakly characterized with the family of Parikh slender regular languages.
However, the family of Parikh slender languages cannot be strongly characterized with the family of Parikh slender regular languages as shown by the following example. We take the Dyck language DV over the alphabet
V = fa; b; cg, the Parikh slender regular language R = a+a + b+ b+ c+c + and
the homomorphism h from (V [V ) into fa; bg defined by h(a) = h(c) = a, h(b) = b, and h(x ) = ", x 2 V . We have
h(D \ R) = a+ b+a+
which is not a Parikh slender language.
