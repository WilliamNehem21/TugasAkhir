a b s t r a c t 

The present study aims to survey exopolysaccharides (EPSs) production in 29 bacterial strains isolated from the sediments around the mangrove trees in Ras Mohamed area, Red Sea Coast, Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. Two of the strains were able to produce EPSs. A higher yield of EPS was obtained from isolate No. 12. Strain identification resulted in a close similarity with Bacillus altitudinis. The produced EPS was characterised as a heteropolysaccharide containing mannouronic acid, glucose, and sulphate. A gel permeation chromatography was used to estimate the EPS molecular weight which found to be
4.23 × 105 Dalton. The typical pattern of polysaccharide absorbance was supported by the infrared
spectrum. The EPS appears significant in vitro antitumor activities against two cancers cells EACC and lung cancer A-549. Furthermore, a broad range of bacteria and fungi were inhibited with purified EPS.

Introduction

Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) are long chains of high molecular mass polymers produced by different microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi and blue green algae [1]. EPSs produced by bacteria exhibit significant structural diversity with novel biological prop- erties are considered as valuable sources of natural polymers with multiple biotechnological applications. Microbial EPSs are preva- lent in the extreme marine environment where they are essential for microbial existence. Most of the functions attributed to EPSs are of a protective nature and their accurate roles are dependent on the ecological functions in which the microorganisms live. They could support the microbial communities to suffer extremes of temperature, salinity and nutrient accessibility, construct a bound- ary between the bacterial cell and its included environment.
Bacteria in marine environments were forced with osmotic stress to produce EPSs with unique composition were studied for prospective application in various sectors [2] and for discovery of novel macromolecules [3]. Recently, evidences for antioxidant, immune-modulation, antitumor and antimicrobial properties of EPSs producing microorganisms have increased [4,5].
Serious side effects of clinically used antitumor drugs direct the attention towards investigation of novel agents with a higher

potency and fewer effects [6]. Human pathogens, as well, have resistance formed from the abnormal use of commercial antimicro- bial drugs. This resistance with the undesirable side effect of cer- tain antibiotics motivated the scientists to look for new antimicrobial substituent from many sources [7].
The aim of this study is to deal with the isolation and character- isation of EPS producing bacteria from the marine sediments around the mangrove trees in Ras Mohamed area, Red Sea Coast. The in vitro activities of purified EPS as antitumor agent against Ehrlich Ascites carcinoma and lung cancer cell lines as well as the antimicrobial activities against Gram positive and Gram nega- tive bacteria, yeast and fungi were also studied.


Materials and methods

Isolation of bacteria and production of EPSs

Marine sediment was collected from the rhizosphere of a man- grove trees (Avicennia marina) from Ras Mohamed, Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. The sample was serially diluted in 90 ml sterile water and plated on a medium containing (in g/l) [glucose (20); yeast extract (0.1); NH4NO3 (0.8); CaCO3 (1); K2HPO4 (0.6); KH2PO4 (0.5);
MgSO4·7H2O (0.05), MnSO4·4H2O (0.1) and agar (15)] which dis-
solved in 750 ml seawater and 250 ml distilled water [8]. EPSs pro-
ducing bacterial isolates were selected based on colonies phenotype (smooth and mucoid).

Pure strains were then inoculated in 250 ml conical flasks con- tain 50 ml of previous medium and incubated at 37 °C in a rotary shaker at 120 rpm for 48 h. After centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 min, supernatant was mixed with four volumes of chilled etha- nol, while the collected pellets were washed twice with acetone and diethyl ether [5] and then drying at 50 °C to obtain constant weight. EPSs formation were estimated by the phenol-sulphuric acid method [9].

Identification of the strain

The strain with the highest EPS production was identified according to their morphology, physiology and biochemistry fea- tures such as nitrate reduction, catalase, oxidase, Voges- Proskauer test, acid production from glucose [10] and 16S rRNA sequence. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using universal primers described by Weisburg et al. [11]. The sequences were compared with the GenBank data base using BLAST [12].

Extraction and purification of EPS

The selected strain was grown in a fermentation medium con- taining (g/l) [peptone (4.0), yeast extract (2.0), and sucrose (20.0)] which dissolved in 750 ml seawater and 250 ml distilled water (pH 7–7.5) at 37 °C for three days in an incubator shaker at 120 rpm to produce EPS [13]. To precipitate proteins, 5% tri- chloroacetic acid was added to cell free culture supernatant and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. After centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 min, supernatant pH was adjusted to 7 and dialyzed against dis- tilled water using dialysis tube (MWCO 2000). After dialysis, abso- lute ethanol were added to supernatant and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. The precipitated EPS was dissolved, dialysed against deion- ized water and filtered using 0.45 mm filter, then applied to a
DEAE-cellulose column (1.5 cm × 70 cm). Elution was carried out
using continuous gradient NaCl solution (0.2–3.0 M). Subse-
quently, a further purification step was carried out for the collected fractions using a Sephadex G-200 column (2 cm × 80 cm) which was eluted with 0.1 M NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The frac-
tions with EPS were collected in one fraction which dialyzed and lyophilized for further analysis.

Chemical analyses of EPS

Protein, uronic acid and monosaccharide sulphate were esti- mated for the produced EPS according to methods described by many authors [10,14–16] respectively. A high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to analyse the monosaccharide
content using a Shimadzu Shim-Pack SCR-101N column (7.9 mm ×
30 cm) and deionized water as mobile phase at flow rate
0.5 ml/min utilizing acid hydrolysis technique [17].

Molecular weight estimation

The molecular weight of EPS was estimated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a Sephadex G-200 column (80 cm × 2 cm). Standard dextrans (40,000; 500,000 and 2,000,000) Daltons
were used for calibration and the molecular weight was deter- mined by plotting against standard graph [18].

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)

The dried EPS was mixed to KBr powder, ground and pressed into a 1 mm pellets for FT-IR measurements in the range of
400–4000 cm—1 using Bruker scientific FT-500-IR spectrophotome-
ter [19].
Periodate oxidation and Smith degradation

Periodate oxidation and Smith degradation were determined by dissolving desulfated EPS (16 mg) in distilled water (6 ml) and then added to 0.1 M NaIO4 (50 ml) in round bottom flasks which kept at 4 °C in dark [20]. Aliquots (0.1 ml) were taken every 24 h and diluted with distilled water (25 ml) which read in spectropho- tometer at 223 nm.
Periodate consumption was calculated based on absorbance change [21] and formic acid products were monitored by the phenol-sulphuric acid method [9]. Ethylene glycol (2 ml) was added and the solutions were dialyzed against distilled water for 48 h. After that NaBH4 (100 mg) is added and the mixture was left for 24 h temperature and then ice cold acetic acid (4N) is added to stop the reaction. The solutions were again dialyzed as described above and lyophilized [22]. The resulting polyalcohol was hydro- lyzed with HCOOH 90% for 5 h and the produced sugars and sugar alcohols were analyzed by HPLC.

Biological activity of EPS

Radical scavenging activity of EPS towards DPPH radical
The free radical scavenging activity of EPS was estimated according to method describing by Yang et al. [23] using 1,1- diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH). Five ml of DPPH in ethanol
was added to 1 ml of purified EPS with concentrations (50–300 m g/ml). The mixture was incubated in dark for 30 min. and measured at 517 nm using spectrophotometer UV–Visible 2401PC (Shimadzu, Japan).
The DPPH absorbance goes down with a high free radical scav- enging ability. The free radicals scavenger capacity was calculated based on this equation: Scavenging ability (%) = [(A517 of control
— A517 of sample)/A517 of control] × 100. The EC50 value is con-
sidered as the effective concentration (mg) of EPS at which the
DPPH absorbance was reduced by 50%.

Antitumor activity against Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma Cells (EACC)
Tumor cells viability was measured with modified cytotoxic trypan blue exclusion technique as described by Yang et al. [23]. Tumor cells proliferation inhibition was calculated based on this
equation: [(A—B/A] × 100%, where A and B are the average number
of viable tumor cells of the control and the samples, respectively.

Antitumor activity against lung cancer cell line A-549
Cytotoxicity of purified EPS was measured against A-549 cell line using the MTT cell viability assay [24]. Percentage of relative viability was calculated using the equation (Absorbance of treated
cells/Absorbance of control cells × 100). Then the half maximal
inhibitory concentration IC50 was calculated from the graph and
BJ-1 normal human cell line was used as control.

Antimicrobial activity
The antimicrobial potential of the purified EPS was tested against a wide set of microorganisms including: (i) Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis NRRL B-941 and Staphylococcus aureus NRRL B-767), (ii) Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa NRRL B-23 and Escherichia coli NRR-B 210), (iii) yeast (Saccha- romyces cerevisiae Y-2034 and Candida albicans NRRL Y-477) and
(iv) fungi (Aspergillus niger NRRL-3 and Fusarium oxysporum NRRL 26406). The inhibition zones produced by different concentration of EPS (75, 100, 150, and 200 lg/disc) were determined. Rimactane
as antibacterial (200 lg/disc) and flucoral as antifungal (200 lg/
disc) were used as control [25].



Results and discussion

Isolation, screening, and identification of the EPS producing bacteria

Many marine bacteria produce EPSs for their growth to adhere to solid surfaces and to overcome extreme conditions. In the pre- sent study, 29 bacterial strains were isolated from the rhizosphere sediment of mangrove trees in Ras Mohamed area, Red Sea; Sinai, Egypt. Two of them had the ability to produce EPSs. The highest production of EPS (10.33 g/l) was detected at strain No. 12. Liu et al. [26] reported in a study that 19 strains of bacteria produced EPSs in 2.28–9.02 g/l, where they selected a strain because of its highest EPS production and identified it as Bacillus licheniformis.
Colonies of strain No. 12 showed mucoid appearance on solid medium. The cells were Gram positive, rod shaped, motile and spore forming when observed under phase contrast microscope. In nitrate reduction, Voges-Proskauer tests and acid production from glucose, catalase and oxidase testes, the strain was positive, while negative for gas production from glucose. Hence, strain No. 12 was temporary identified as Bacillus sp. particularly, the par- tially sequenced 16S rRNA genes showed 99% similarity with Bacil- lus altitudinis, so strain No. 12 was identified as Bacillus altitudinis MSH2014 with accession No. (KY550404) (Fig. 1).
Characterisation of EPS

Purification of EPS
The crude EPS produced from Bacillus altitudinis MSH2014 were purified using DEAE-cellulose anion exchange chromatography column (Fig. 2). Elution profile showed one major peak (fraction 100–120). Such fraction was collected, dialyzed and lyophilized to get EPS which applied for further analysis.

Molecular weight determination of EPS
The molecular weight of the EPS produced by Bacillus altitudinis MSH2014 determined by a gel filtration technique was 4.23 × 105 Da. EPS appeared as a single symmetrical narrow peak (Fig. 3),
which represent the homogeneity of EPS. Previous reports of the molecular weight of the EPS produced by Bacillus licheniformis
was 2.826 × 104 Da [26].

Chemical composition of EPS
The purified EPS produced a negative response by Bradford test indicating the absence of protein. Monosaccharide analysis by HPLC revealed that EPS composed of mannuronic acid and glucose with molar ratio 1:2.2. The chemical composition of EPS indicated the presence of uronic acid (14.26%) and sulphate (15.47%).

It was found that bacteria isolated from deep sea which pro- duced EPS was typically acidic due to containing 10–40% uronic acid [27] and polyanionic due to uronic acids, ketal-linked pyru-

According to the literatures, the presence of SO— group enhanced
the medical potential of EPS [29]. The sugar composition had an
important role in the biological activities [30].
The FT-IR spectrum of EPS from Bacillus altitudinis MSH2014 showed a typical pattern for polysaccharide absorbance (Fig. 4).
The broad band at 3435.6 cm—1 is due to AOH groups of carbo- hydrate residues stretching vibration [31]. The 2360.0 cm—1
band is due to CAH stretching vibration. The weak absorbance peak at 1630 cm—1 was due to the stretching vibration of C@O that may be associated with the mannuronic acid and internal hydrogen bonds [32]. Band at 1340 cm—1 is due to the presence
of S@O and/or CAOAS bonds [33] and the band at 863 cm—1
indicates the a-configuration which is simultaneously present
in EPS.


Periodate oxidation and Smith degradation

Periodate oxidation was done to both sulphated and desul- phated EPS where in case of sulphated EPS did not produce for- mic acid and consumed periodate due to the presence of sulphate groups on the carbon atom 2 or 3 which impede the
and erytheric acid presence (Table 1). The presence of a small amount of glycerol and free erythritol in large amount partially demonstrate existence of (1 ? 4) linkages between monosaccha- rides units and sulphate groups on the C2 and/or C3 in EPS. Erythritol was produced from C3, C4, C5 and C6 of the (1 ? 4) glycosidic linkages of glucose after hydrolysis of the backbone, while erytheric acid was liberated from C3, C4, C5 and C6 of the (1 ? 4) glycosidic linkage of mannouronic acid. The presence of relatively small quantities of glycerol from the glucose units and erytheric acid from the mannouronic unit in the hydrolysis of polysaccharides, gave the information that glucose may be found at the non-reducing end. These outcomes are in good agreement with those mentioned by other workers [34,35].

Free radical scavenging activities of EPS
The free radical scavenging activity was estimated with DPPH [36]. The scavenging activity of EPS illustrates in Fig. 5 showed a concentration-dependent manner, with an EC50 value of 150 (mg/ml). It was reported that EPS was isolated from Bacillus coagu-
lans RK-02 and purified by size exclusion chromatography which
showed in vivo antioxidant activities [37]. Agili and Mohamed [38], also, mentioned that EPSs from Padina pavonica had antioxi- dant activities. The antioxidant properties of polysaccharides are mainly correlated to their confirmation, structure, molecular mass and their monosaccharides components [39].

Antitumor activity
Antitumor activity against Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma Cells (EACC). As shown in Fig. 6, the EPS exerted inhibitory activity on EACC in concentration dependent manner. The viability of tumor cells after incubation with purified EPS drastically decreased from 47 to 20% and then gradually decreased further to 10% by increas- ing the concentration of EPS from 100 to 500 till 1500 mg/ml
respectively, which is in agreement with the results obtained by
Ahmed and Ahmed [40].

In vitro antitumor activity against lung cancer cell. Lung cancer cell line A-549 was treated with the purified EPS at different concentrations (12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mg/ml) and showed in Fig. 7. The data shows a gradual decrease in tumor cells viability with
high concentrations of EPS. The highest cells viability (71%) was found at 12.5 mg/ml which decreases to 63%, 51% and 39% at 25 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, 100 mg/ml of EPS, respectively, and IC50 was
51.94 mg/ml. While in case of normal cell line the viability of cells
reached 95%, 90%, 88% and 77% when treated with the different
concentrations of EPS 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mg/ml respectively.
The differences in the antitumor activities of EPS may be due to their different physicochemical properties such as chain shape, molecular weight and monosaccharide composition [41]. EPS molecular weight may affect its bioactivities, as the high molecular weight showed more antitumor activity [42].

Antimicrobial activities
The antimicrobial activities (Table 2) demonstrate that the puri- fied EPS possessed antimicrobial activities against all of the tested microorganisms and by increasing the concentration of EPS the inhibition zone increased which ranged from 6.3 to 24.9 mm. Orsod et al. [43] isolated two EPSs producers marine bacteria and screened their antimicrobial activities against both Gram positive bacteria (Lysinibacillus and Paenibacillus sp.) and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas sp., Escherichia coli) had shown presence of inhibition zones.
The mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of the purified EPSs were studied by various investigators and they mentioned that the

antimicrobial activity of anionic polysaccharides such as sulphated polysaccharide occurs by several mechanisms through its chelation activities and the deprivation of metal, trace elements or essential nutrients which limit the growth of microorganisms [44].

Conclusion

Although EPSs are one of the abundant bioactive components, their study still remains an interesting scope for their high molec- ular diversity, complexity and high capability for drugs design and preparation. In addition, microorganisms producing EPSs are promising sources that meet actual industrial demand, especially, marine microorganisms which offer great opportunities for new bioactive compound discovery.
