Abstract The study is dedicated to the development of shape preserving interpolation scheme for monotone and convex data. A rational bi-cubic function with parameters is used for interpolation. To preserve the shape of monotone and convex data, the simple data dependent constraints are developed on these parameters in each rectangular patch. The developed scheme of this paper is confined, cheap to run and produce smooth surfaces.

1. Introduction

Monotonicity is a key tool for the specification of Digital to Analog Converters (DACs), Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) and sensors. These devices are enormously used in control system applications. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in cancer patients, uric acid level in patients suffering from gout, approximation of couples and quasi couples in sta- tistics are a few other monotone quantities. Convexity arises in the data generated in nonlinear programming, scientific appli- cations such as design, optimal control, parameter estimation and approximations.

A fine quantity of work [1–9] has been published in previ- ous years that emphasized on the shape preservation of curves and surfaces. Beatson and Ziegler [2] developed a shape pre- serving interpolation scheme for regular monotone data. The rectangular patches were joined by C1 quadratic spline. Suffi- cient conditions were derived on data values and derivatives arranged on the rectangular grid to ensure monotonicity. Carl- son and Fritsch [3] developed a bi-cubic polynomial interpola- tion scheme for shape preservation of monotone data. The conditions were worked out on derivatives. These conditions were sufficient to establish monotone bi-cubic polynomial over all rectangular elements. Sarfraz, Butt and Hussain [8] con- structed a rational interpolation scheme for monotone data. The scheme was cubic in each co-ordinate parameter. The ra- tional interpolant had one free parameter in each subinterval. Monotonicity was assured by establishing automotive con- straints on the free parameter.
Asaturyan [1] proposed a subdivision scheme for convex surface data interpolation. The rectangular patches in which convexity was lost were identified and divided into nine sub- rectangles. Convexity preserving interpolation scheme was applied on these sub-rectangles. It was observed that change in a sub-rectangle affected the whole domain thus established

semi global. Floater [5] derived sufficient conditions on the control points of Be´zier surfaces to raise convex surface from convex data. Hussain, Sarfraz and Shaikh [7] developed a C2 rational scheme for shape preservation of positive and convex data.
The paper underlines the problem of monotone and convex data interpolation. The data values are interpolated by ra- tional bi-cubic function. This rational bi-cubic function enjoys eight parameters in each rectangular patch. The range of these parameters is determined to ensure shape preservation of data. The developed schemes of this paper deal positively to both data and data with derivatives, assure local command on the surface and promise C1 smoothness.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The Section 2 reviews [9]. Section 3 details the rational bi-cubic function [6] used for surface data interpolation. The shape preserving inter- polation schemes for monotone and convex data are developed


The proofs of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 can found in [9].

Rational bi-cubic function

In this section, the extension of rational cubic function (1) to the rational bi-cubic function S(x, y) for the interpolation of regular data is described. Let the regular data be arranged over
the rectangular domain D = [a; b]× [c; d]. The partition of the intervals  [a; b]  and  [c; d]  are  p : a = x0 < x1 < x2 < ··· 
< xm  b and p~ : c  y0 < y1 < y2 <  < yn  d. The repre-
sentation of rational bi-cubic function over the rectangular patch I = [xi; xi+1]× [yj ; yj+1] is
S(x; y)= a0(a)S(xi; y)+ a1(a)S(xi+1; y)— S(x; yj)b0(b)
— S(x; yj+1 )b1(b)
— a (a) b (b)S(x ; y )+ b (b)S(x ; y  )}


2. Rational cubic function

This section details the rational cubic function developed by Sarfraz and Hussain [9].
Let the planar data under consideration be {(xi; fi) :
i = 0; 1; 2; ... ; n} and the partition of knot be xi < xi+1;
— a1(a) b0(b)S(xi+1; yj)+ b1(b)S(xi+1; yj+1) ;	(2)
ai(a) and bi(b), i = 0, 1 are the cubic Hermite blending func- tions defined as:
a (a)= (1 — a)2(1 + 2a); a (a)= a2(3 — 2a); b (b)

Demonstration
In this section two monotone data sets are considered. These data sets are interpolated by bi-cubic Hermite (Figs. 1–3 and 7–9) and monotonicity preserving scheme (Figs. 4–6 and 10– 12) developed in Section 4.1. It is observed that bi-cubic Her- mite although C1 is unable to preserve the monotone shape of data, whereas, the monotonicity preserving scheme of Sec- tion 4.1 preserves the shape of data.

Example 1. The surface in Fig. 1 represents the bi-cubic Hermite interpolation of monotone data considered in Table 1.






Figure 3	yz-view of Fig. 1.
The xz-view and yz-view of this figure is provided in Figs. 2 and 3 respectively. It is clear from Fig. 3 that the bi-cubic Hermite loses the monotone shape of data for y e [100, 200]. The same data set is interpolated in Fig. 4 by C1 monotone rational bi-cubic function developed in Section 4.1. Figs. 4–6 establish that monotonicity preserving scheme (developed in Section 4.1) works well.

convex boundary curves are obtained by computing the constraints on the parameters (vi;j; wi;j; vi;j+1; wi;j+1; v^i;j; w^i;j; v^i+1;j; w^i+1;j) in the following way.

The paper deals with the problem of shape preservation of sur- face data. The rational bi-cubic function [6] can proficiently interpolate the data organize over rectangular grids. The mono- tonicity and convexity preservation of data is assured by com- puting constraints on free parameters. All these constraints involve data and derivatives. The shape preserving interpola- tion schemes developed in this paper works well for data with derivative; maintains smoothness and are local. The shape pre- serving interpolation schemes for convex [5] and monotone [2– 4] data are futile for data with derivatives. The monotone data interpolation scheme [8] does enable derivative specification, but fails to maintain smoothness of surface. Moreover, the con- vex data interpolation schemes developed in [1,4] are global.

Demonstration

Example 3. The convex data in Table 3 is computed from the convex function F(x, y)= x4 + y2. The domain is restricted to [—3, 3] · [—3, 3].
The convex data in Table 3 is interpolated by bi-cubic Hermite (Figs. 11 and 12). It is clear from these figures that bi- cubic Hermite loses convexity for x e [ 1, 1]. Hence bi-cubic Hermite is unable to preserve the convex shape of data. The convex surface in Fig. 13 is computed by interpolating the same data by convex interpolation scheme of Section 4.2.
