In this article, a mathematical model has been developed for the generalized time fractional eorder biological population model (GTFBPM). The fractional derivative has been described in the Caputo sense. The model has been solved by a recent approximate analytic method so called the fractional reduced differential transform method (FRDTM). Using this method, it is possible to find the exact solution as well as closed approximate solution of a differential equation. Three numerical examples of GTFBPM have been provided in order to check the effectiveness, accuracy and convergence of the method. The special advantage of using this computational technique is that it is very easy to implement and takes small size of computation contrary to other numerical methods while dealing complex and tedious physical problems arising in various branches of natural sciences and engineering.

Introduction

Various physical phenomena in natural sciences and engineer- ing can be explained successfully by developing models using the fractional calculus theory. Fractional differential equations have achieved much more attention because fractional order system response ultimately converges to the integer order

equations. The use of fractional differentiation for the mathe- matical modeling of real world physical problems such as the earthquake modeling, the traffic flow model with fractional de- rivatives, measurement of viscoelastic material properties, etc. has been widespread in the recent years. Before the nineteenth century, no analytical solution method was available for such type of equations even for the linear fractional differential

equations. Recently, Keskin and Oturanc [1] developed the fractional reduced differential transform method (FRDTM) for the fractional differential equations and showed that FRDTM is the most easily implemented analytical method and gives the exact solution for both the linear and nonlinear differential equations. FRDTM is very reliable, efficient and effective powerful computational technique for solving physical prob- lems; see references [2e5].

Generalized time fractional-order biological population model (GTFBPM)

Biological scientists believe that the dispersal or emigration plays a crucial role in the regulation of population of the species. The diffusion of a biological species in a region C is described by the three functions of position →x = (x; y) in region C and time t
[6] namely population density p(→x ; t), diffusion velocity v(→x ; t),
and the population supply, f (→x ; t). The population density p(→x ; t) gives the number of individuals, per unit volume, at po- sition →x and time t; it’s integral over any sub region D of region C gives the total population of D at time t. The entity f (→x ; t) gives the rate at which individuals are supplied, per unit volume, at position →x by births and deaths. The diffusion velocity v(→x ; t) represents the average velocity of those individuals who occupy
rectangular mesh, in which at each step an animal may either stay at its present location or may move in the direction of the lowest population density. The probability distribution among these two possibilities being determined by themagnitude of the population density gradient at the mesh side concerned. This model leads to Eq. (3) with ɸ (p)=p2, to the following equation
vap  v2p2  v2p2
vta = vx2 + vy2 + f (p);  t ≥ 0; x; y˛R;	(4)
with the given initial condition p(x,y,0). For a = 1, Eq. (4) re- duces to the normal biological population model (NBPM)
vp  v2p2  v2p2
vt = vx2 + vy2 + f (p);  t ≥ 0; x; y˛R.	(5)
Some properties of Eq. (4) such as Holder estimates and its solutions have been studied in [8].
Three examples of constitutive equations for f(p) can be given as

f(p) = cp, c = constant, Malthusian Law [6].
f(p) = c1p — c2p , c1,c2 = positive constants, Verhulst Law [8].
f(p) = cp , (c > 0, 0 < q < 1), Porous media [9,10].

Let  us  consider  a  more  general  form  of  f(p)  as
f(p) = hpa(1 — lpb), so that Eq. (4) becomes

the position →x at time t, and it describes the flow of population

with the following law of population balance, for every regular sub region D of C and for all time t
where h, a, l, b, are real numbers. If h = c, a = 1, l = 0 and h = c1, a = b = 1, l = c2/c1, then Eq. (6) leads to Malthusian Law and Verhulst Law. The reason behind using the fractional-order

differential equation is that it is naturally related to systems with memory which exists in most of the biological systems.

where n is the outward unit normal to the boundary vD of D. The derivative in Eq. (1) has been taken in the Caputo deriv- ative sense. From the Eq. (1), it is obvious that the rate of change of population of D plus the rate at which the in- dividuals leave D across its boundary must be equal to the rate at which the individuals are supplied directly to D. By making the assumptions [8]
f = f (p);  →v = —l(p)Vp;	(2)
where l(p) > 0 for p > 0, and V is the Laplace operator, the following two-dimensional nonlinear degenerate parabolic partial differential equation for the population density p can be obtained as
Also they are closely related to fractals which are abundant in biological systems. The linear and nonlinear population sys- tems were solved in [11,12] using variational iteration method (VIM), adomian decomposition method (ADM), homotopy analysis method (HAM), and homotopy perturbation method (HPM). The major disadvantage of these methods is that they require complex and large size of computations. To overcome from the complex computational efforts, FRDTM has been employed for solving the problem.
The purpose of this work is to solve the generalized time fractionaleorder biological population model (GTFBPM) using the fractional reduced differential transformation method. The obtained results are compared well with those obtained
by VIM, ADM, HPM and HAM.

Eq. (3) is known as the time fractional-order biological popula- tion model (TFBPM). Gurney and Nisbet [7] employed ɸ (p), as a special case for the modeling of the population of animals. The movements are made generally either by mature animalsdriven by mature invaders or by young animals just reaching maturity moving out of their parental territory to establish breeding ter- ritory of their own. In both cases, it is much more plausible to assume that they will be directed towards nearby vacant terri- tory. Therefore, in this model, movement takes place almost exclusively down the population density gradient and will be more rapid at high population densities than at low ones. To model this scenario, they considered a walk through a
Fractional calculus theory

In this section, we present some notations, definitions and preliminary facts that will be used further in this study. Fractional calculus theory is more than 200 years old theory present in the literature. Several definitions of fractional in- tegrals and derivatives have been proposed but the first major contribution to give proper and most meaningful definition is due to Liouville as follows.

Definition 3.1. A real function f(x), x > 0 is said to be in the space Cm, m ˛ ℝ if there exists a real number q (>m), such that

Fractional reduced differential transform method (FRDTM)

In this section, the basic definitions and properties of the fractional reduced differential transform method have been described.
here we notice that the Gama function is the continuous extension to the factorial function [3].
The recursive relationship G(z + 1) = zG(z), z > 0 can be used
to compute the value of the gamma function of all real numbers (except the non-positive integers) by knowing only the value of the gamma function between 1 and 2.

Consider a function of two variables w(x,t), and assume 	
that it can be represented as a product of two single-variable functions, i.e. w(x,t) = F(x)G(t). On the basis of the properties of the one-dimensional differential transform, the function w(x,t) can be represented as

which is the same exact solution obtained by Roul [12] using HPM, and also by Shakeri et at [11]. using VIM and ADM.


Conclusions

In this work, the fractional reduced differential transform method has been implemented for a degenerate Caputo time- fractional order parabolic partial differential equation arising in the spatial diffusion biological populations. The solution obtained by the FRDTM is an infinite power series for appro- priate initial condition which finds the solution without any discretization, transformation, perturbation, or restrictive conditions. We have also illustrated three numerical exam- ples considering the situations of both linear as well nonlinear phenomenon of GTFBPM to study the effectiveness and accurateness of the method. The solutions obtained by the FRDTM are in excellent agreement with those obtained by the HPM, HAM, VIM and ADM. However, computations show that the FRDTM is very easy to implement and needs small size of computation contrary to HPM, HAM, VIM and ADM.
