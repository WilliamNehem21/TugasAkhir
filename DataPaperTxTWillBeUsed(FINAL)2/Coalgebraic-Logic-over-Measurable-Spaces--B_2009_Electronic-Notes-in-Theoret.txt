Coalgebraic Logic over Measurable Spaces: Behavioral and Logical Equivalence

Chair for Software Technology Technische Universit¨at Dortmund, Germany

Abstract
We study the relationship between logical and behavioral equivalence for coalgebras on general mea- surable spaces. Modal logics are interpreted in these coalgebras using predicate liftings. Prominent examples include stochastic relations and labelled Markov transition systems and corresponding Hennessy–Milner type logics. Local versions of logical and behavioral equivalence are introduced and it is shown that these notions coincide for a wide class of functors. We relate these notions to the corresponding global ones common in model checking. Throughout, we work in general measurable spaces. In contrast to previous work, no topological assumptions on the state spaces are needed.
Keywords: coalgebraic logic, measurable space


Introduction
Coalgebras for an endofunctor provide a uniform framework for the study of reactive systems. In this article, we will study coalgebras for functors on the category Meas of measurables spaces and maps. The subprobability functor S will play a role similar to the powerset functor in that it allows us to treat stochastic aspects instead of non-deterministic ones.
Prominent examples include stochastic relations as coalgebras for the sub- probability functor S and so-called Markov transition systems [4], which arise as coalgebras for the functor X '−→ (SX)A for some set A of actions.

Modal logic, on the other hand, seems to be an appropriate language to talk about properties of coalgebras, and hence of reactive systems.
Modal operators for coalgebras are introduced using predicate liftings for the functor T [10], that is, natural transformations Bn −→ B · T . Here, B is the functor Measop −→ Set which sends every measurable space to its set of measurable subsets.
Two states in two coalgebras are called logically equivalent (with respect to a given family of predicate liftings) if they satisfy exactly the same formu- las. As usual, the two states are called behaviorally equivalent if we can find two morphisms whose domains are the given coalgebras, whose codomains coincide, and which map the two given states to the same state.
We show that under condition on the set of predicate liftings, the two no- tions of equivalence of states mentioned above coincide. This generalizes pre- vious results in this area in that we do not require surjectivity of the coalgebra morphisms, which leads us to local versions of the two notions of equivalence. This seems to be more akin to usual coalgebraic modal logic (over Set). We show how to deduce the previous, global, results from ours.
The main technical difficulty is in proving that the logic is expressive, that is, that logical equivalence implies behavioral equivalence. This is shown using quite a simple factoring technique. To ensure applicability of this technique, we have to rely on a somewhat technical concept which was—in lack of a better name—called admissibility.
In contrast to previous work, we do not impose any topological assumptions on the underlying spaces of the coalgebras. We believe that this makes the exposition more accessible.

Related Work
Expressivity of modal logics for coalgebras over suitable measurable spaces have been studied quite extensively in recent years. The works can be divided into two groups. One deals with coalgebras over measurable spaces which satisfy some topological properties [3,4,6,12].
Results for general measurable spaces have been established in [2,8,5], but only for coalgebras for the subprobability functor S or for SA. We try to reunite this two groups by establishing expressivity results for general endo- functors on Meas.
The basic factoring technique used here stems from [6] and was used in [12] for coalgebras for a general endofunctor on the category of analytic spaces. In
[13] the existence of final coalgebras based on Standard Borel spaces was used to extend the expressivity results from [12] to general measurable spaces.
The insight that it might be useful to consider a quotient-structure custom-

made to the logic at hand (and not the canonical one as used in [6,12]) was first used in [5] and is somewhat hinted at in [2].

Preliminaries
We collect here some basic definitions and results from measure theory for the reader’s convenience and for easier reference. Nearly all results are well-known.

Measurable spaces
Recall that a measurable space X consists of a set |X| and a σ-algebra BX on X, that is: a family of subsets of |X| which is closed under comple- mentation, countable intersections, and countable unions. For each family A of subsets of a set M there is a smallest σ-algebra on M containing A, which we denote by σ(A). If B(X) = σ(A) then A is called a generator of B(X). A measurable function X → Y is given by a function f : |X| → |Y | such that f−1[B] ∈ BX for all B ∈ B(Y ). In case BY = σ(A), measurability of f is guaranteed by f−1[A] ∈ BX for all A ∈ A. The category of measurable spaces with measurable functions as morphisms is denoted by Meas. Observe that we do not notationally distinguish between a Meas-morphisms and its underlying function. Often we will just write X in place of |X|.
The assignment X '→ XB defines a functor Measop −→ Set with its action on morphisms given by the restriction of the inverse-image function, thus Bf = f−1 : BY −→ BX for f : X −→ Y . Observe that B is naturally isomorphic to the hom-functor Meas(−, 2), with 2 the two-point space in which every subset is measurable. In particular, we obtain:
Lemma 2.1 B : Measop −→ Set preserves limits and Bf is injective pro- vided f is surjective.	 
Lemma 2.2 We have σ(f−1(A)) = f−1(σ(A)).	 

Special morphisms
Given a family (Yi)I of measurable spaces and a family (fi : A → |Yi|)I of functions with common domain, we define the initial σ-algebra with respect
this data to be A = σ(  I f	[B(Yi)]). It is characterized by the following
−1

property: a function g : |X| → A is measurable with respect to BX and A if and only if all fi · g : X → Yi are measurable. In case I = {∗}, we have A = f−1[B(Y∗)].

Lemma 2.3 Let (A −f→i
|Yi|)I be a family of functions and assume that each

Yi has a generator Gi. Then the initial σ-algebra with respect to the fi is

σ  I
f−1[Gi] .

Proof. See [7, Satz 5.2].	 

Dually, we define the ﬁnal σ-algebra for (|X | →gi
B)I
by { E ⊆ B | ∀i ∈

I : g−1[E] ∈ B(Xi) }. It is characterized by the property that measurability of h : B → |Y | is guaranteed by the measurability of all h · gi.
This can be used to show that Meas is complete and cocomplete. Lim- its are constructed as follows: construct the limit (L, (li)) of the underlying diagram in Set and equip L with the initial σ-algebra with respect to the projections li, thus, with the σ-algebra generated by  l−1[BXi]. Colimits are
formed dually using final σ-algebras.
Equivalence relations and invariant sets
Let α be an equivalence relation on a set X. Let ηα : X −→ X/α denote the projection. We obtain an adjunction:

	ηα[−]  
PX ¸,	 P (X/α) ,
η−1[−]
where PX denotes the powerset of X, ordered by inclusion. Since ηα is sur- jective, every B ∈ P (X/α) is a fixpoint of the above adjunction. On the other hand, the fixpoints of η−1 · ηα[−] are easily characterized as the α-invariant subsets of X. Here, A ⊂ X is α-invariant provided x ∈ A and xα x' imply x' ∈ A for each x, x' in X. Write Inv(α) for the α-invariant subsets of X. The adjunction restricts to a pair of mutually inverse functions


	ηα[−]  
Inv(α) ¸,	 P (X/α).
η−1[−]
(1)

Fix a family A of subsets of a set X. Define an equivalence relation Eq(A) by:
(x, x') ∈ Eq(A) ⇐⇒ ∀A ∈A : [x ∈ A ⇐⇒ x' ∈ A].
Obviously, every A ∈A is Eq(A)-invariant.
Lemma 2.4 We have Eq(A)= Eq(σA).	 

Separable Measurable spaces
We say that a family A of subsets of a set X separates points if whenever
x /= x' then there exists A ∈A with x ∈ A, x' ∈/ A, or vice versa.

Lemma 2.5 A separates points if, and only if, σ(A) separates points. 
Definition 2.6 A measurable space X is called separable if BX separates points. The full subcategory of Meas spanned by the separable objects is denoted by Sep.
Proposition 2.7 Sep is closed under mono-sources and coproducts in Meas Proof. Let (fi : X −→ Yi)I be a mono-source in Meas and assume x /= x'
in X. There exists i ∈ I with fi(x) /= fi(x'), hence B ∈ BYi with (say)

fi(x) ∈ B, fi(x') ∈/
B. Hence x ∈ f−1[B], x' ∈/ f−1[B], and f−1[B] ∈ BX

i	i	i
since fi is measurable. Closure under coproducts is obvious.	 


Subprobability measures
A subprobability measure on a measurable space X is a σ-additive func- tion BX → [0, 1]. The set of all subprobability measures on X becomes a measurable space SX when equipped with the initial σ-algebra with respect to (evA)A∈BX with evA : SX → [0, 1], μ '→μ(A). Here, [0, 1] is equipped with the σ-algebra generated by the open subsets. Another generator of this σ-algebra is { [r, 1] | r ∈ Q ∩ [0, 1] }.
This subprobability construction gives rise to a functor S : Meas → Meas
by setting
Sf (μ)(B)= μ(f−1[B])
for f : X → Y in Meas, μ ∈ SX, B ∈ BY .
Lemma 2.8 Each SX is separable.
Proof. Observe that (evA)A∈BX is a mono-source. Thus the claim follows from Proposition 2.7	 
Lemma 2.9 Let A ⊂ BX be closed under ﬁnite intersections with σ(A) = 
BX. Then B(SX) is generated by the set { ev−1[r, 1] | A ∈ A,r ∈ Q ∩ [0, 1] }.
Proof. Combine Lemma 3.6 from [14] with Lemma 2.3.	 

Coalgebras and Models
Let T : Meas −→ Meas be a functor. A T-coalgebra A = (A, d) is given by measurable space A and a Meas-morphism d : A → T A, called the dynamics. A morphism of coalgebras (A, d) → (A', d') is given by a Meas-morphism

f : A → A' such that
f	 '
A	A
d	d'
J	J 
TA  Tf  T A'
commutes. This leads to the category Coalg T of T -coalgebras and mor- phisms.
Examples 1	(i) Coalgebras for the subprobability functor are stochastic re- lations.
(ii) Coalgebras for the functor on Meas given by X '→(SX)Act for some set
Act are labelled Markov processes.
We fix a set Var of variables, and define models with respect to T and Var
as follows:
Definition 3.1 A (T, Var)-model consists of a T -coalgebra (A, d) together with a valuation; that is, a function Var −V→ B(A). A morphism (A, d, V ) −f→ (A', d',V ') is given by a coalgebra morphism (A, d) −f→ (A', d') which satisfies B(f ) · V ' = V .
This leads us to a category Mod(T, Var) of models. Observe that we have an isomorphism Mod(T, ∅) ∼= Coalg T .
From now on we fix functor T , and the set of variables; Mod(T, Var) will simply be denoted by Mod.
It is well-known that the obvious forgetful functor Coalg T −→ Meas creates colimits; see [1]. Thus, Coalg T is cocomplete since Meas is so. This generalizes to models:
Proposition 3.2 The obvious forgetful functor Mod −→ Coalg T creates colimits. Hence also the forgetful functor Mod −→ Meas creates colimits.
Proof. Let D : D −→ Mod be a (small) diagram. Write D(i)= (Xi, di, Vi) and let ((X, d), ci) denote the colimit of the (Xi, di) in Coalg T . Observe that (BX, Bci) is a limit in Set. Since Dd is a model morphism for each d : i → j in D the collection (Vi) of valuations forms a natural cone, hence there is a unique V : Var −→ BX with Bci · V = Vi for each i. We claim that (X, d, V ) is a colimit of D in Mod. Let (fi : Di −→ (Y, e, W )) be a natural cocone, and let f : X −→ Y be the induced Coalg T -morphism. Thus, f · ci = fi holds. We have
Bci · Bf · W = Bfi · W = Vi = Bci · V,
where the first equation holds since fi is a model morphism. Thus, Bf · W =
f
V follows from the fact that (Bci) is a limit-source, that is: (X, d.V ) −→

(Y, e, W ) is a model-morphism.	 
Corollary 3.3 Mod is cocomplete.	 


Predicate Liftings
Let T : Meas → Meas be a functor. An n-ary predicate lifting for T is a natural transformation λ : Bn →B · T . We write n = ar(λ).
Examples 2	(i) Let r be a rational number and deﬁne λr : BX −→ BSX

via:

λr (B)= { μ | μ(B) ≥ r } = ev−1[r, 1].

X	B
(λr) is easily seen to be natural. We write Λ1 = { λr | r ∈ Q ∩ [0, 1] }.
Let Act be a countable set of “actions”. For each rational r and each
a ∈ Act, we deﬁne a predicate lifting λr,a for SAct via
λr,a(B)= { (μi)i∈Act | μa(B) ≥ r }.
We write ΛAct = { λr,a | a ∈ Act,r ∈ Q ∩ [0, 1] }.
Let T denote the functor given by X '→S(X ×X) with its obvious action on morphisms. We deﬁne a family (κq)q∈Q∩[0,1] via


κq (A, B)= { μ ∈ S(X × X) | μ(A × B) ≥ q } = ev−1
[q, 1].	(2)

X	A×B


The Logic Induced by a Family of Predicate Liftings
Fix a set Λ of predicate liftings. We define the logic induced by Λ (and
Var) by the following grammar:
φ ::= T| φ1 ∧ φ2 | v | ⟨λ⟩(φ1,..., φar(λ))
for v ∈ Var, λ ∈ Λ.
Remark 4.1 It is possible to enrich the logic by using further Boolean connec- tives (modelled by natural transformations Bn −→ B) and fixpoint-operators (modelled by natural transformations Bω −→ B); see [6] for a discussion. We refrain from doing so, the result go through verbatim.

Interpreting the Logic in a Model
Given a model M = (A, d, V ), we may interpret L(Λ) by assigning a set
 φ) ∈ BA to every formula φ as follows:
 T)M = A
 φ1 ∧ φ2)M = φ1)M ∩ φ2)M
 v)M = V (v)
 ⟨λ⟩(φ1,..., φar(λ)))M = Bd · λA( φ1)M,..., φar(λ))M) For a state x of M we write ThM(x)= { φ ∈L| x ∈ φ)M }.
Proposition 4.2 If f : M −→ N is a model morphism, then we have
Bf ( φ)N )= φ)M for each φ.
Proof. The proof proceeds by structural induction on formula φ and makes use of the naturality of the predicate liftings. For details see [6], where the unimodal case was treated.	 
Corollary 4.3 If M −→ N, then ThM(x)= ThN (f (x)).	 

An equivalence relation
Fix a model M = (A, d, V ). Let l denote the equivalence on A which is determined by the extensions of the formulas. Thus,
xlx' ⇐⇒ ∀φ : [x ∈ φ) ⇐⇒ x' ∈ φ)],
or, more compressed, l = Eq({ φ) | φ ∈ L}). Observe that we have xlx' ⇐⇒
ThM(x)= ThM(x').
We write EM = σ({ ηl[ φ)M] | φ formula }).
Lemma 4.4 We have { ηl[ φ)] | φ formula } = { A ⊂ X/l | η−1[A]= φ) for
some φ }. Both sets are closed under ﬁnite intersections.
Proof. Just use the fact that each φ) is l-invariant and apply the bijec- tions from (1). The second claim follows since the set of validity-sets is closed under finite intersection and the inverse image function preserves finite inter- sections.	 
Lemma 4.5 ηl : X −→ (X/l, EM) is measurable.
Proof. Obvious by Lemma 4.4.	 
In general, EM will not be the ﬁnal σ-algebra with respect to BX and ηl. In the following, ηM will always denote the measurable function whose domain is (X/l, EM).

Lemma 4.6 Fix a measurable space Y and a generator A of BY . A function f : X/l −→ |Y | is measurable if for each A ∈ A there exists φ such that η−1 · f−1[A]= φ).
Proof. Obvious since it suffices to check measurability on a generator. 
We will introduce two technical conditions on sets of predicate liftings: separability and admissibility. Our notion of separable predicate liftings is a specialization of the one used in coalgebraic logic over Set, cf. [11]. It was first introduced in [6] for sets of unary predicate liftings.
Admissibility is another technical condition which we need to impose in order to prove measurability of an induced function. It is introduced below and related to separability.

Separating Predicate Liftings
Let λ : Bn −→ B· T be an n-ary predicate lifting. We define an equivalence

relation ≡λ
on TX by setting

λ  = Eq ({ λX( φ1)M,..., φn)M) | φ1,..., φn ∈ L}) .
Definition 4.7 A set Λ of predicate liftings is said to separate a model M if we have

   ≡λ
⊆ ker T (ηM).

λ∈Λ
Λ is said to be separating if it separates every model M.
Examples 3 The sets Λ1 and ΛAct are separating. This follows from Lemma
4.9 (below) and Proposition 4.11.

Admissible predicate liftings
Definition 4.8 We call a set Λ of predicate liftings admissible if the set
{ λX/l(η φ1),..., η φar(λ))) | λ ∈ Λ, φ1,..., φar(λ) ∈ L}
generates B(T (X/l, EM)) for every model M.
Lemma 4.9 For each set Act, the family ΛAct is admissible.
Proof. Write Q = (X/l, EM). First consider the case Act = {∗}. We know from Lemma 2.9 and Lemma 4.4 that BSQ is generated by


D = { ev−1
[r, 1] | φ ∈ L,r ∈ Q ∩ [0, 1] }.

Since ev−1 [r, 1] = λr (η φ)) holds, this is just the condition for admissibility.
For a general set Act, observe that we have
C = { λr,α(η φ)) | a ∈ Act,r ∈ Q ∩ [0, 1],φ ∈ L}
=   { λr,α(η φ)) | r ∈ Q ∩ [0, 1],φ ∈ L}

α∈Act
=
π−1 { λr (η φ)) | r ∈ Q ∩ [0, 1],φ ∈ L} 

α∈Act
=
α∈Act
α	Q

π−1(D)

holds, where πα : SQAct −→ SQ is the ath projection. Since D generates
BSQ, C generates B(SQAct) by Lemma 2.3.	 
Lemma 4.10 The set (κr)r∈Q∩[0,1] is admissible.
Proof. For measurable spaces X and Y the set { A × B | A ∈ BX, B ∈ BY } is a closed under finite intersections and a generator for B(X × Y ). Thus, the claim follows from Lemma 2.9.	 
Proposition 4.11 If each TX is separated then every admissible set of pred- icate liftings is separated.
Proof. Fix a model M = (X, d, V ), λ ∈ Λ of arity n and φ1,..., φn ∈ L. We have, for each t ∈ TX:
Tη(t) ∈ λX/l(η φ1),..., η φn)) ⇐⇒ t ∈ BTη · λX/l(η φ1),..., η φn))
⇐⇒ t ∈ λX · (Bη)n(η φ1),..., η φn))
⇐⇒ t ∈ λX( φ1),..., φn))
where the last equality holds since each φi) is invariant.
Take t, t' ∈ TX with t ≡λ	t' for all λ ∈ Λ. We need to show Tη(t) = 
Tη(t'). By separability of T (X/l, EM) and Lemma 2.5, it suffices to show
(Tη(t),Tη(t')) ∈ Eq { λX/l(η φ1),..., η φar(λ))) | λ ∈ Λ, φ1,..., φar(λ) ∈ L} .
From the above calculation it follows that this last condition is equivalent to
(t, t') ∈ ≡λ .	 

The congruence theorem
Theorem 4.12 Let Λ be a separating and admissible set of predicate liftings. For every model M there exists a model structure M/l over X/lM such that ηM : M −→ M/lM is a model morphism.

Proof. We write M = (X, d, V ), l for lM, and Q for (X/lM, EM). We claim that xlx' implies (d(x), d(x')) ∈ ker Tη. By separatedness of Λ it suffices to
show that we have d(x) ≡λ  d(x') for each λ ∈ Λ.
Take λ ∈ Λ, write n = ar(λ) and fix φ1,..., φn ∈ L. We obtain:
d(x) ∈ λX( φ1),..., φn)) ⇐⇒ x ∈ Bd · λX( φ1),..., φn))
⇐⇒ x ∈ ⟨λ⟩(φ1,..., φ1))
hence (d(x), d(x')) ∈ ≡λ	follows from xlx'.  Hence, there exists a unique

function q : Q −→ TQ for which

X	y	 Q 

d	q
J	J 
TX  Ty  T Q 
commutes. We need to show that q is measurable.
Fix any λ of arity n and φ1,..., φn ∈L and observe:
η−1 · q−1 · λQ(η φ1),..., η φn))= Bd · BTη · λQ(η φ1),..., η φn))
= Bd · λX · (Bη)n(η φ1),..., η φn))
= Bd · λX(η−1[η φ1)],... η−1[η φn)])
†
= Bd · λX( φ1),..., φn))
= ⟨λ⟩(φ1,..., φn)),
where (†) holds by invariance of φi). Measurability of q follows from admis- sibility of Λ and Lemma 4.6.
We are left to define a valuation W on Q. For v ∈ Var we set W (v) = η v)M ∈ EM. By l-invariance of v)M we obtain Bη · W (v) = η−1[ηV (v)] = V (v), thus W makes η a model morphism. Uniqueness of W with this property holds by injectivity of Bη.	 
Definition 4.13 The reduct Red(M) of M is the model (Q, q, W ) constructed in Theorem 4.12.
Thus, the underlying set of Q is given by X/lM and we have BQ = EM =
σ({ η[ φ)M] | φ ∈ L}).
Over analytic spaces
Recall that a measurable space is called analytic if its measurable subsets arise as the Borel sets of a topological space which is the continuous image of a metrizable topological space with a countable base.

In case the underlying measurable space of the model M is analytic— which is the blanket assumption in [4,6,12]—we can form the reduct Red(M) without relying on admissibility of Λ.
Lemma 4.14 Let M = (A, d, V ) be a model with A analytic and assume that L is countable. Then EM is the ﬁnal σ-algebra with respect to the projection ηlM .
Proof. See [5, Corollary 3].	 
Observe that L is countable provided both Λ and Var are countable.
Theorem 4.15 Let Λ be a countable, separating set of predicate liftings and let Var be countable. For every model M = (A, d, V ) with A analytic there exists a model structure M/l over A/l such that η : M −→ M/l is a model morphism.
Proof. We proceed as in the proof of Theorem 4.12 to define the quotient dynamics q. Observe that well-definedness of q just makes use of separatedness of Λ. Measurability of q follows immediately from Lemma 4.14 since we have q · η = Tη · d and the latter function is measurable.	 

Logical and Behavioral Equivalence
Definition 5.1 We fix models M, M' and states a in M, a' in M'.
We say that the states a and a' are logically equivalent if ThM(a) =
ThM' (a ).
We say that the models M and M' are logically equivalent if { ThM(a) |
a ∈ A } = { ThM' (a ) | a ∈ A }.
We say that the states a and a' behaviorally equivalent if there exists a model N and a cospan
M −f→ N ←g− M'	(3)
of model morphisms such that f (a)= g(a') holds;
We say that the models M and M' are behaviorally equivalent if there exists a cospan (3) with f and g surjective model morphisms.
Observe that the notions of equivalence introduced above naturally divide themselves into two groups: local or state-based notions (1,3), and global notions (2,4). Proposition 4.2 and Corollary 4.3 entail that:
(local) behavioral equivalence of states implies their (local) logical equiva- lence.

(global) behavioral equivalence of models implies their (global) logical equiv- alence;
We will now show that under suitable conditions, all four implications can be reversed. So far, work on modal logics for stochastic relations was somewhat concentrated on the global aspects. We think that the local notions (as cus- tomary for coalgebras on Set) are more in the spirit of classical modal logic, which is intrinsically local.
Theorem 5.2 Assume that Λ is separating and admissible. Fix models M and N. If states of x of M and y of N are logically equivalent, then they are behaviorally equivalent.
Proof. We form first the coproduct M + N of M and N and then the reduct Red(M + N ) according to Theorem 4.12. Thus, we obtain the following diagram of model morphisms


M 	iM  M  + N ¸iN,	N
y
J 
Red(M + N )
(4)

By Corollary 4.3, we have ThM+N (iM(x)) = ThM(x)= ThN (y)= ThM+N (iN (b)). Therefore, η · iM(x)= η · iN (y); that is, Red(M + N ) witnesses that a and b are behaviorally equivalent.	 
The following result on the equivalence of the global properties is in fact an easy consequence of Theorem 5.2:
Theorem 5.3 Assume that Λ is separating and admissible.	Then logical equivalence of models implies behavioral equivalence of models.
Proof. Let M and N be logically equivalent and form the diagram (4). We claim that η · iM and η · iN are surjective. Consider η · iM and take any state
[z] in Red(M + N ). In case z is in the image of iM, we are done. Otherwise, z = iN (y) for some state of N . We find a state x of M with ThM(x)= ThN (y), hence ThM+N (iM(x)) = ThM+N (iN (y)), that is η · iM(x)= η · iN (y)= η(z)= [z].	 

Conclusion and Further Work
We have established expressivity-results for coalgebraic logic over general mea- surable spaces. In doing so, we have improved over previously published work in this area in three aspects:

we were able to work without any topological assumptions on the state space;
we work with a general functor on the category of measurable spaces without relying on what was called left or right coalgebras [6];
we considered local versions of behavioral and logical equivalence which deal with single states as opposed to the whole models. This seems to be in the spirit of coalgebraic modal logic over the category of sets. In fact, the global properties are simple consequences of the local ones.
One obvious extension of the work presented here would be to include a discussion of bisimilarity as well. This is hindered by the fact that the subprobability functor does not preserve weak pullbacks.
Another possible extension of the results presented here stems from the observation that a measurable space can be seen as a set equipped with a basis for a zero-dimensional topology on it. In particular, the technical notion of admissibility can be rephrased as a continuity condition for these topolo- gies. This hints at a possible unification of our work and the work on Stone coalgebras [9].
