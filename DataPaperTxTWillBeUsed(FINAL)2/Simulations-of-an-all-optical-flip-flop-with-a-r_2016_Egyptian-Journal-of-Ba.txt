All-optical flip-flop DFB laser
Optical nonlinearity Urbach tail
An all-optical flip-flop based on a nonlinear multi-section DFB semiconductor laser struc- ture is proposed. Holding beam is not required for device’s operation. A section of the DFB structure is detuned to prevent lasing in the “OFF” state, and it is accompanied with a nega- tive nonlinear coefficient that is due to partial absorption of photons at Urbach tail. At a high light intensity in the structure the nonlinear coefficient reduces the detuning, and the device is in lasing state; “ON” state. The device is reset by an optical pulse at a shorter wave- length through cross gain modulation. The reset pulse is absorbed in a middle section in the device before reaching the detuned nonlinear section. The switching times between the states are in nanoseconds time scale.

Introduction

All optical Internet requires all optical devices to process optical data directly (without conversion to electrical signal) in the optical domain. Particularly, all-optical flip-flops have roles as all optical memory elements, and these memory elements could be used in all optical data routing [1]. The all-optical flip-flop could be used for other applications such as optical shift reg- ister, optical random access memory and other applications [2]. Several schemes/devices are suggested for all-optical flip- flop devices. In [3], a device that is based on two coupled laser diode is presented. A device that is constructed from ring laser is presented in [4]. A device with two states of a clockwise and an anti-clockwise laser mode is introduced in [5]. Devices that are based on a semiconductor distributed feedback (DFB) laser, and on vertical cavity semiconductor optical amplifier (VCSOA)
are shown in [6] and [7] respectively. All these devices require a holding beam or show output power in both states of the flip flop. Devices that have bistable optical output and do not require a holding beam are discussed in [8,9]. These devices have a satu- rable absorber in the laser cavity which has large optical loss at low light intensity in the laser cavity, and optical loss is reduced at high optical power intensity in the cavity.
In [10], a chirped DFB laser structure that behaves as an all- optical flip-flop is simulated. The flip-flop has a bi-stable output optical power behavior. The operation of the device does not require a holding beam. The chirped grating is accompanied by a linearly increasing negative nonlinear coefficient that is due to partial absorption of photons at the Urbach tail (The absorbed photons produce electron-hole pairs density that reduce the refractive index close to the band-gap energy). In the “OFF” state the chirp prevents constructive feedback from the grating and lasing does not occur. At high light intensity,

the chirp is reduced due to negative nonlinearity, and the laser mode builds up. The device is switched “OFF” by cross gain modulation. An optical pulse of a wavelength longer than the operating wavelength reduces the gain of the active layer, and in the same time does not produce much change in the re- fractive index (lower absorption coefficient at a longer wavelength).
In this work, a new design for an all-optical flip-flop is simu- lated. Instead of the chirped grating accompanied with a linear increasing negative nonlinear coefficient, a part of the wave- guiding grating of the suggested device is detuned from the rest of the grating. The detuned part has a slightly higher re- fractive index than the rest of the grating and has a negative nonlinear coefficient. The negative nonlinear coefficient is due to partial absorption of photons at the Urbach tail. The struc- ture investigated in this work is easier to fabricate than the structure mentioned in [10] because only one nonlinear section is needed to achieve optical bistability in the laser device. The switch OFF (“Reset”) mechanism is done by cross gain modu- lation (XGM), and a “Reset” pulse at a wavelength shorter than the wavelength of the “Set” pulse is used. The “Reset” pulse has a higher frequency (shorter wavelength) than the “Set” pulse and the operating frequency, which produces more design flex- ibility. This is in contrast to the device in [10], where the the “Reset” pulse has to be at a lower frequency than the operat- ing frequency. In the next section the device schematic is presented and the flip-flop design is discussed.


Device schematic and description

The suggested device consists of a nonlinear DFB laser struc- ture. The refractive index distribution along the wave- guiding layer of the device is shown in Fig. 1. The grating

period is adjusted as 2nd  G, where n is the average refrac- tive index along the grating, d is the grating period, λG is the wavelength at the center of the reflection band of the grating. The device has a phase shift section in the middle of the grating. The optical gain is provided by electrical current injected into the active layer along the wave-guiding layer. The negative nonlinear coefficient is due to direct absorption of photons at the Urbach tail at a photon energy slightly less than the semiconductor band-gap energy in the nonlinear
section. The loss coefficient at the Urbach tail is expressed as:     0  exph  hg E0  [11,12], hg  Eg is the band gap energy, h is the Plank’s constant (The energies are ex-
pressed in electron volt). The absorbed photons produce electron-hole pairs that reduce the refractive index at a photon energy slightly less than the semiconductor band-gap. At low optical power intensity in the structure, the detuned part of the wave-guiding layer reduces the available optical feed- back to the laser mode, and the laser mode does not build up. To set the flip-flop “ON”, an optical pulse of wavelength
λ = λ1 is injected, at z = 0, where λ1 = λG. The semiconductor
band gap energy Eg in the nonlinear section is adjusted such that the photons energies at λ = λ1 is slightly less than Eg. Fig. 2 shows the gain spectrum of the device [13], the “Set”
and “Reset” pulses frequencies (wavelengths), and the optical loss at Urbach tail. The injected “Set” pulse induces electron- hole pair densities in the nonlinear section and reduces its refractive index and its detuning; hence it provides extra
optical feedback to photons of wavelength around λ = λ1, the optical mode builds up and provides optical power (photons)
that produce electron-hole pairs in the nonlinear section and maintain the reduction in the detuning in that section.
To reset the flip-flop, an optical pulse at λ = λ2 is injected
at z = 0. In this work we choose λ2 < λ1, which means that the reset pulse will be absorbed in the nonlinear section and may
prevent the flip-flop from switching “OFF” properly. At L2  z  3L4 along the wave-guiding layer, the band-gap of the wave-guiding layer is altered to provide large absorption
to photons of wavelength λ = λ2 (Fig. 3). In Section “1”, the band gap energy is higher than “Set/Reset” pulse photons ener-
gies. In section “2”, the “Reset” pulse will be absorbed because the band gap energy is lower than the “Reset” pulse photon energy. The “Reset” pulse energy is totally absorbed in section “2” before it reaches section “3”. Section “3” is the detuned

the structure [14]. The optical modes are coupled with rate  equations.  The  total  optical  field  is  expressed as: Ez, t  E z, texpiz  it  E z, texpiz  it  c.c.. The optical laser mode is modeled at ω = ω1.   2n G .
The “Reset” pulse angular frequency ω2 is far detuned from reflection band of the grating. The “Reset” pulse optical field in
the structure has only a propagating component in the +ve z direction and is expressed as EReset  Ez, tR  expiz  it  c.c., and ω = ω2. It is assumed that the reset pulse is amplified in the first section (0 < z < L/2), and it is attenuated in the second section ( L2  z  3L4 ). Due to large attenuation constant in the
second section (compared to optical gain provided by the active layer), only loss coefficient is applied to the “Reset” pulse in the second section. In section “2”, it is assumed the propagating reset

Other simulation parameters are shown in Table 1.
The structure is divided into 80 sections. In each section, the forward and backward fields are calculated using Rung- Kutta methods. The electron hole densities in the wave- guiding layer and the active layer are calculated with the same methods. In each step, random fields are added to the back- ward and forward mode to model the spontaneous emissions. To reduce the simulation time, the simulations are per- formed on a general purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU). In each time step, the calculation load is distributed among 80 parallel threads; a thread per each section along the length of the structure (one can assign more threads per section). The integration step along the z axis is L/80, and the time step is nLc80. The work is performed on a PC machine 32 GB, pro- cessor: Intel Core i3-4130 CPU @ 3.40 GHz × 4, GPGPU: Geforce GTX 670. The simulation code is written using CUDA C [17]. The simulation’s time on PC is reduced 20 times by using GPGPU computing. In the following sections results and numerical simulations of the device are shown.

Numerical simulations and results

In the following simulation the output optical field is normal- ized to P0  0.05  103 watt . Ng is normalized to Nth. Nc is normalized to N0  1023 m3.
Optical bi-stability loop

To determine the required injected current to obtain two stable optical level output (at the same injected current) a numeri- cal experiment is performed. The injected current is increased linearly from zero to 0.122 Ampere in 75 ns, then the injected current is reduced again to 0 linearly in 75 ns. At part of the current versus optical output relation is plotted in Fig. 5. In the following simulations, the injected current I = 95.523 mA is assumed. It insures bistable operation of the device.

“OFF” state and “ON” state

The output optical power in the “OFF” state at z = L is simu- lated in time domain for 75 ns, Fig. 6(a). The “ON” state is
triggered by an input pulse injected at z = 0, of power P = P0 and time width t = 187.5 picosecond ( 9.375  103 picojule). The device is triggered at t = 7.5 ns from the start of the simula- tion time, the output optical power at z = L is shown in Fig. 6(b). The injected pulse at ω = ω1 is amplified along the structure

and a part of photons is absorbed at the Urbach tail in the third section (the nonlinear section). The absorbed photons gener- ate electron-hole pairs that reduce the refractive index of that section. As the detuning of this section decreases, the grating in this section starts to reflect back more photons back to the device and decreases the number of photons leaving the device
at ω = ω1. The optical feedback along the structure increases
and the laser mode at ω = ω1 builds up. As the optical power of the laser mode builds up, it maintains the number of photons
in section 3 that are required to generate the electron hole density needed to set the detuning of this section to a low value.
The electron hole density Nc normalized to N0 in the non- linear section (Section 3) at (z = 7L/8), is shown in Fig. 7. The electron hole density in the active layer Ng normalized to Nth

“ON/OFF” transitions are simulated in time domain. A “Set”
pulse followed by a “Reset” pulse are injected to the structure	at z = 0, and the optical fields are simulated for 5.625 ns. A “Set”
pulse of power P = P0 and width 0.1875 ns (9.375  103 picojule), at ω = ω1 and t = 0.5625 ns switches the flip-flop “ON”. Another pulse at t = 2.8125 ns, of power P = P0, pulse width 0.9375 ns (ω = ω2, 46.875  103 picojule) switches the Flip-Flop “OFF”. The output field at z = L is shown in Fig. 10. The evolution of Nc/ N0, and Ng Ntr with time at z = 7L/8 are shown in Figs. 11 and 12 respectively.
The “Reset” pulse at ω = ω2 is amplified in the first half of the device. In section “2”, the pulse is absorbed almost
completely due to large attenuation coefficient. The amplifi- cation of pulse in that section is neglected compared to the large attenuation by the semiconductor of band gap Eg  h2 . The “Reset” pulse reduces the gain of the optical laser mode
at ω = ω1 by XGM. When the optical gain of the laser mode is reduced, the photons absorbed in section “3” are reduced, and
also the electron hole pairs generated in the wave-guiding layer in that section are reduced, the refractive index increases and

“Reset” pulse at ω = ω2 is totally absorbed in section “2”, it does not reach section “3”, and does not affect the electron hole den-
sities in section “3”. As the “Reset” pulse is absorbed in section “2”, it generates electron hole pairs that changed the detuning for the laser mode along that section. The refractive index dis- tributions during “Set/Reset” operation in both sections “2” and “3” at successive time frames are shown in Fig. 13.

Multiple “Set/Reset” operations

Multiple “Set/Reset” operations are simulated in the time domain for 45 ns. The input pulses at z = 0 are shown in Fig. 14. Each “Set” pulses is followed by a “Reset” pulse after 9 ns. “Reset” pulse is followed by a “Set” pulse after 6 ns. The input “Set” pulse of
P = P0 has pulse width 0.1875 ns (9.375  103 picojoule at ω = ω1). The “Reset” pulse of P = P0  has pulse width 0.9375 ns ( 46.875  103 picojoule at ω = ω2) switches the Flip-Flop “OFF”. The output optical power at z = L is shown in Fig. 15. The time evolution of Nc/N0 z = 7L/8 during multiple “Set/Reset” opera- tions is shown in Fig. 16.

Discussion

The device operation requires altering the band gap of the semi- conductor material in the wave-guiding layer. This could be done as the device is fabricated from InGaAsP alloy on InP sub- strate. By changing the percentage of the InGaAsP alloy ingredient, the band gap could be changed [18]. The extinc-
tion ratio is Log10 PON POFF  ≃ 15, and no holding beam is
required for bi-stable operation. During “Set” operation the output optical field takes 0.5 ns to stabilize; however Nc takes about 10 ns to reach its steady state value ( Nc  N0  3.5) (Fig. 7); however, an input pulse with higher energy can lead Nc to reach steady state in a shorter time. During “Set/Reset” operation (Fig. 10), a “Reset” pulse of width 0.9375 ns is injected to the device; however, the output optical output power takes about 2 ns to reach the optical level of the “OFF” state. The “Reset” dynamics in time domain are shown during Nc transition state (before Nc reaches transition state) in case of single “ON/OFF” (or “Set/Reset”) operation (Figs. 10–12) and at the end of Nc tran- sition state (9 ns after “Set” pulse) during multiple “Set/Reset” operation (Figs. 15–17).
Conclusion

In this work, an all-optical flip-flop based on a non-linear semi- conductor DFB laser structure is introduced.The “Reset” mecha- nism uses an optical pulse of a shorter wavelength than the “Set” pulse wavelength. The device could be built using InGaAsP alloy. Simulations show that a “Set” pulse of 0.1875 ns pulse width switched the device “ON” and optical mode stabilizes in
0.5 ns. A “Reset” pulse of 0.9375 ns pulse width switches the de- vice “OFF” in 2 ns. The switching dynamics are in nanoseconds time scale and it is suitable for all optical data packets routing.
