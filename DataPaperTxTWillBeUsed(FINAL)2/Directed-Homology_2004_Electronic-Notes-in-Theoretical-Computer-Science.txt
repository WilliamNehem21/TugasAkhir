Abstract
We introduce a new notion of directed homology for semicubical sets. We show that it respects directed homotopy and is functorial, and that it appears to enjoy some good algebraic properties. Our work has applications to higher-dimensional automata.
Keywords: Directed homology, directed topology, directed homotopy, cubical sets, ω-categories, higher-dimensional automata

Introduction
One can gain valuable insights in concurrency theory by exploring the ge- ometry of concurrent systems. This point of view has been promoted for some time, and it appears that it is gaining territory. In this paper, we are introducing a notion of directed homology for semicubical sets, which should hopefully have various applications as a strong invariant of higher-dimensional automata [11], systems of weakly synchronizing PV processes [1], and other related formalisms for concurrent systems.
One of the characteristic features of algebraic topology is the interplay of homotopy and homology as invariants of topological spaces. For the directed topological spaces [2,5] used for the geometric modeling of concurrent systems, one has good notions of directed homotopy [6,12], but the concept of directed homology has hitherto been lacking.
In his recent papers [7,8], M. Grandis is working with a notion of directed combinatorial homology of cubical sets. What we define in the present paper differs considerably from his notion, and the relationship between the two is

yet to be explored.
Exposition
We set out by introducing semicubical sets and relating them to the formalism of higher-dimensional automata. Then we define the central notion of this paper, the chain ω-category of a semicubical set. Our exploration benefits considerably from the ω-categorical viewpoint made possible by this.
We define three (graded) equivalence relations on semicubical sets; (di- rected) homotopy, weak homotopy, and homology, and we show some exam- ple calculations. All three equivalences give rise to graded quotients, which themselves are multiple categories. We end the paper by exploring some ways of extracting information from these quotients.
Cubical Sets and Their Morphisms
A semicubical set is a graded set X = {Xn}n∈N together with mappings (face maps) δα : Xn → Xn−1 (i = 1,..., n, α = 0, 1) 1 satisfying the semicubical

A cubical set is a semicubical set together with mappings (degeneracies)

Cubical sets were introduced by Serre in [13]; they can be enriched with various other mappings; connections, compositions, and reflections, see [9] for an overview. The standard example of a cubical set is the singular cubical complex of a topological space [10]: If X is a topological space, let SnX = Top(In,X), the set of all continuous maps In → X, where I is the unit interval.
If the faces and degeneracies are given by
δαf (t1,..., tn−1)= f (t1,..., ti−1, α, ti,..., tn−1)
εif (t1,..., tn)= f (t1,..., tˆi,..., tn)
then SX = {SnX} is a cubical set.

1 We always use α to mean one of 0 or 1, or + or −. Also, the set N of natural numbers includes 0.

Higher-Dimensional Automata
Higher-dimensional automata were introduced by Pratt [11], and their relation to cubical sets was established in [3,4]. In our notation, a higher-dimensional automaton over an alphabet Σ is a cubical set X = {Xn} together with a specified initial state I ∈ X0 and a labeling mapping l : X1 → Σ satisfying the condition that l(δ0x)= l(δ1x) and l(δ0x)= l(δ1x) for all x ∈ X2.

Higher-dimensional automata are a generalization of finite automata that
allow for the specification of true concurrency. As an example, consider fig- ure 1, picturing two simple higher-dimensional automata over the alphabet
{a, b}. In the left automaton, the interior of the rectangle is empty, specifying that there is a choice between executing a.b or b.a. In the right automaton, there is a 2-cube connecting a.b and b.a, with the semantics that a and b can be executed simultaneously. That is, the left automaton expresses a choice between two sequential behaviours, the right expresses that a and b are truly concurrent.
For a thorough treatment of higher-dimensional automata as a model of concurrent systems we refer to [4].
An Example
We introduce here a simple example of a semicubical set, which we shall refer to occasionally later. It consists of five 2-cubes glued together to form a hollow 3-cube without bottom face, a “turned-over open box.” Figure 2 shows an image; for clarification we list the face maps from X2 to X1, the others should be obvious from the figure:
δ0f1 = e5	δ1f1 = e6	δ0f1 = e1	δ1f1 = e9

δ0f2 = e6	δ1f2 = e7	δ0f2 = e2	δ1f2 = e10

δ0f3 = e8	δ1f3 = e7	δ0f3 = e3	δ1f3 = e11

The Chain ω-Category
We define an analogue of the chain complex of a cubical set. Our “directed chain complexes” are, in fact, strict globular ω-categories.
Let X = {Xn} be a semicubical set. For x ∈ Xn, define d−x, d+x by
n	n
d−x = Σ δ(k+1) mod 2x	d+x = Σ δk mod 2x

This gives mappings d−, d+ : Xn → N · Xn−1, where N · Xn−1 denotes the free abelian monoid on Xn−1. Extend these boundary mappings to be defined on N · Xn by
dα	αjxj  =	αj dαxj
Our mappings satisfy a weak version of the globular equality dαd− = dαd+; the proof is by direct calculation.
Lemma 3.1 d+d++ d−d− = d+d− + d−d+.
Our basic objects of study will not be (formal sums of) cubes, but rather formal sums of cubes with speciﬁed lower boundaries. So instead of studying, say, a “pure” element x ∈ N · X2, we will consider “enriched versions” of x, which are 5-tuples (x, xˇ1, xˆ1, xˇ0, xˆ0), where xˇ1 is to be thought of as a specified lower 1-boundary of x, xˆ1 as a specified upper 1-boundary, etc.
Formally, we define our sets of ﬁltered cubes CnX as follows:
C0X = N · X0
C1X = {(x1, xˇ0, xˆ0) ⊆ N · X1 × (N · X0)2 | xˇ0 + d+x1 = xˆ0 + d−x1}
CnX = {(xn, xˇn−1, xˆn−1,..., xˇ0, xˆ0) ∈ N · Xn × (N · Xn−1)2 ×· · ·× (N · X0)2 |
xˇn−1 + d+xn = xˆn−1 + d−xn, ∀i = 0,...,n − 2: xˇi + d+xˇi+1 = xˆi + d−xˇi+1}

Fig. 3. The filtered cubes (x + y, a, c) and (x + y, a + b, b + c).
The intuition behind enriching (formal sums of) n-cubes with specified lower boundaries is that the same sum of cubes can have many different inter- pretations. This is inspired by a suggestion of Marco Grandis; here is a simple example:
Let x, y ∈ X1, with δ0x = a, δ1x = b, δ0y = b, δ1y = c (cf. figure 3). Then
0	0	0	0
x + y can be “used” for connecting a to c, or for connecting a + b to b + c. The
former interpretation is expressed by the filtered cube (x + y, a, c), the latter by (x + y, a + b, b + c).
It is not difficult to show that the last condition in the definition of CnX is equivalent to demanding that xˇi + d+xˆi+1 = xˆi + d−xˆi+1, i.e. with the second and last “checks” replaced by “hats.”
Now define mappings d−, d+ : CnX → Cn−1X, e : CnX → Cn+1X by
d−(xn, xˇn−1, xˆn−1,..., xˆ0)= (xˇn−1, xˇn−2, xˆn−2,..., xˆ0)
d+(xn, xˇn−1, xˆn−1,..., xˆ0)= (xˆn−1, xˇn−2, xˆn−2,..., xˆ0)
e(xn,..., xˆ0)= (0, xn, xn,..., xˆ0)
then these satisfy dαd− = dαd+ and dαe = id, that is, the graded set CX =
{CnX} together with these mappings has a structure of reflexive globular set.
For m < n ∈ N let
CnX ×m CnX = {(x, y) ∈ CnX × CnX | (d+)n−mx = (d−)n−my}
that is, (x, y)= ((xn,..., xˇm, xˆm,..., xˆ0), (yn,..., yˇm, yˆm,..., yˆ0)) ∈ CnX ×m
CnX if and only if xˆm = yˇm, and xˇi = yˇi and xˆi = yˆi for all i = 0,...,m − 1.
Define operations ◦m : CnX ×m CnX → CnX by
(xn,..., xˆ0) ◦m (yn,..., yˆ0)= 
(xn + yn,..., xˇm+1 + yˇm+1, xˆm+1 + yˆm+1, xˇm, yˆm, xˇm−1, xˆm−1,..., xˆ0) Note that the operations ◦m are not commutative: Given x, y ∈ CnX, only


one of x ◦m y, y ◦m x might be defined, or they both may be defined, but have different values.

Proposition 3.2 CX with operations ◦m and mappings d−, d+, e is a strict globular ω-category, that is, dαd− = dαd+ and dαe = id, and if m < n ∈ N, (x, y) ∈ CnX ×m CnX, then ex ◦m ey = e(x ◦m y) and

—	 d−x	+	 d+y	if m = n − 1

For any z ∈ CnX,

en−m((d−)n−mz) ◦m z = z ◦m en−m((d+)n−mz)= z

and if also (y, z) ∈ CnX ×m CnX, then

(x ◦m y) ◦m z = x ◦m (y ◦m z)

Also, if (x', y') ∈ CnX ×m CnX such that (x, x'), (y, y') ∈ CnX ×p CnX for some p < n, then
(x ◦m y) ◦p (x' ◦m y')= (x ◦p x') ◦m (y ◦p y') The proof is straight-forward.
In addition to the operations ◦m, 0 ≤ m < n, as defined above, we also
have an operation ◦−1 defined for all pairs (x, y) ∈ CnX × CnX → CnX and given by (xn,..., xˆ0) ◦−1 (yn,..., yˆ0)= (xn + yn,..., xˆ0 + yˆ0). With this operation, CX is a monoidal ω-category.
We can turn the object mapping SCub → ωCat defined above into a functor the following way: Let f : X → Y be a morphism of semicubical sets, i.e.
Σi αif (xi), and define f˜ : CX → CY by f˜(xn,..., xˆ0) = (fxn,...,f xˆ0).
f xˆi + d−f xˇi+1, so f is in fact a mapping CX → CY . Also, f˜dα = dαf˜,
f˜e= ef˜, and f˜(x ◦m y)= f˜x ◦m f˜y, so f˜ is a morphism of ω-categories.

Minimal Representatives
Given an n-cube x ∈ Xn, define its minimal representative Cx = (x, xˇn−1,..., xˆ0) ∈
CnX by

xˇ = Σ Σ ··· Σ

(where the superscripts are to be understood modulo 2). The minimal repre- sentative owes its name to the following proposition, whose proof is a tedious but routine application of the semicubical identity (1):
Proposition 3.3 Given y = (yn,..., yˆ0) ∈ CnX such that yn ∈ Xn, then there exists z ∈ Cn−1X such that y = Cyn ◦−1 z.

boundaries of its minimal representative.

Weak Homotopy in ω-Categories
We shall define three (graded) equivalences on the chain ω-category of a semicubical set; (directed) homotopy, weak homotopy, and homology. We shall see that homotopy implies weak homotopy, which in turn implies homol- ogy, and that homotopy is essentially the same as the combinatorial dihomo- topy relation of [2]. Weak homotopy applies to general ω-categories, so we start with that one.
Note that there are some differences between our notion of homotopy and what one would call “standard” homotopy, in that what we are studying is a relation not between cubes, but rather between formal sums of cubes.
Given an ω-category C = {Cn}, with boundary mappings dα, identity mappings e, and compositions ◦n, let ∼n⊆ Cn ×Cn be the equivalence relation generated by the n + 1-cells. That is, ∼n is the transitive, symmetric closure of the elementary relation Rn defined by “xRny if and only if there exists A ∈ Cn+1 such that x = d−A, y = d+A.”
Lemma 4.1 Assume x ∼n y ∈ Cn. Then dαx = dαy, and if x' ∼n y' ∈ Cn are such that (x, x') ∈ Cn ×m Cn for some m < n, then also (y, y') ∈ Cn ×m Cn, and x ◦m x' ∼n y ◦m y'.
Note that taking the symmetric closure of Rn amounts to formally inverting
n + 1-cells. Let Cˆn+1 = Cn+1 ∪ Cop denote Cn+1 with formal inverses added
for all cells; then x ∼n y if and only if there exist A1,..., Ak ∈ Cˆn+1 such that
d−A1 = x, d+Ai = d−Ai+1 for all i = 1,...,k − 1, and d+Ak = y.
Proof. Let A1,..., Ak ∈ Cˆn+1 be a sequence of n + 1-cells connecting x and
y. Then
dαx = dαd−A1 = dαd+A1 = dαd−A2 = ··· = dαd+Ak = dαy	(2)


Let A' ,..., A'
∈ Cˆn+1 be a sequence of n + 1-cells connecting x' and

1	l

y', then similarly dαx' = dαd−A'
= dαd+A'
= dαy'.  Hence (d+)n−my =

(d+)n−mx = (d−)n−mx' = (d−)n−my', and therefore (y, y') ∈ Cn ×m Cn. Define
B1,..., Bk+l ∈ Cˆn+1 by
 Ai ◦m ex'	for i = 1,...,k 
We claim that B1,..., Bk+l is a sequence of n + 1-cells connecting x ◦m x' to
y ◦m y'.
First we need to check that all (Ai, ex'), (ey, A' ) ∈ Cn+1 ×m Cn+1, however

as n +1 − m ≥ 2, we can use (2) to show that
(d+)n+1−mAi = (d+)n−md+Ai = (d+)n−mx = (d−)n−mx' = (d−)n+1−mex'

and similarly for showing that (d−)n+1−mA' = (d+)n+1−mey.
Now as n +1 − m ≥ 2, we have d−B1 = d−A1 ◦m d−ex' = x ◦m x' and
d+Bk+l = d+ey ◦m d+A' = y ◦m y'. The last condition, d+Bi = d−Bi+1 for
all i = 1,...,k + l − 1, is easily seen to be true for i = 1,...,k − 1 and
i = k + 1,...,k + l − 1. For i = k, d+Bk = d+Ak ◦m d+ex' = y ◦m x' and
d−Bk+1 = d−ey ◦m d−A' = y ◦m x'.	 
Let Dn = Cn/∼n, and define dα[x] = dαx, [x] ◦m [y] = [x ◦m y]. The degeneracies e : Cn−1 → Cn can be composed with the quotient mappings Cn → Dn, yielding new degeneracies e : Cn−1 → Dn. For each n ∈ N we define the weak homotopy quotient in dimension n of C by
dα	dα	dα	,

which, with operations ◦m as above, is seen to be an n-category for all n ∈ N.
We can turn the described object mappings π˜n : ωCat → nCat into functors as follows: Let f = {fn} : C → D be a morphism of ω-categories, i.e. fulfilling dαf = f dα, ef = f e, and f (x ◦m y) = fx ∗m fy. Then it can be shown that x ∼n y ∈ Cn implies fnx ∼n fny ∈ Dn, hence fn induces a mapping f : Cn/∼n → Dn/∼n.
We then have dαf = fn−1dα and f ([x]◦m[y]) = f [x]∗mf [y], hence f can
n	n	n	n	n
be assembled with the fn−1,..., f0 to yield an n-morphism f : π˜nC → π˜nD.
Directed Homotopy of Semicubical Sets
If X is a semicubical set, weak homotopy as above defines equivalence relations
∼n on the CnX, where CX = {CnX} is the chain ω-category associated with
X. We can obtain finer relations by restricting the generating relations to single cubes instead of formal sums of these:
Let Rn ⊆ CnX ×CnX be the relation defined by “xRny if and only if there
exist A ∈ Xn+1, z ∈ CnX such that d−(CA ◦−1 z) = x, d+(CA ◦−1 z) = y.” Note that this amounts to saying that x = (xn,..., xˆ0), y = (yn,..., yˆ0) are
such that dαx = dαy and (A, xn, yn,..., xˆ0) ∈ Cn+1X.
We define directed homotopy ≈n⊆ CnX × CnX to be the equivalence relation generated by the Rn, and we prove below that in dimension 1, our directed homotopy is essentially the same as the combinatorial dihomotopy relation of [2]. Note that x ≈n y implies x ∼n y, hence we can form directed



homotopy quotients (n-categories)

In order to state the next proposition, we need some definitions from [2]: A dipath in a cubical set X = {Xn} is a sequence x = (x1,..., xk) ⊆ X1 of 1-cubes such that for all i = 1,...,k − 1, δ1xi = δ0xi+1. If y = (y1,..., yk)
1	1
is another such dipath (of the same length), then x and y are said to be
elementarily dihomotopic if there exist j ∈ {1,...,k − 1} and A ∈ X2 such that xi = yi for all i /= j, j + 1, d−A = xj + xj+1, and d+A = yj + yj+1. The relation of combinatorial dihomotopy is defined to be the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive closure of the elementary-dihomotopy relation.
Proposition 5.1 Let x = (x1,..., xk), y = (y1,..., yk) be dipaths in X1, and write Cx = Cx1 ◦0 ··· ◦0 Cxk, Cy = Cy1 ◦0 ··· ◦0 Cyk, then x and y are combinatorially dihomotopic if and only if Cx ≈1 Cy.
Proof. It it enough to prove this for the generating relations. So let A ∈ X2
be an elementary dihomotopy from x to y. Note that
Cx = (x1 + ··· + xn, δ0x1, δ1xn)	Cy = (y1 + ··· + yn, δ0y1, δ1yn)
1	1	1	1
and that we by the elementary dihomotopy know that δ0x1 = δ0y1, δ1xn =
1	1	1
δ1yn. Also, as A is an elementary dihomotopy, we have d−A + y1 + ··· + yn = d+A + x1 + ··· + xn, hence the filtered cube
(A, x1 + ··· + xn, y1 + ··· + yn, δ0x1, δ1xn) ∈ C2X
1	1
provides a directed homotopy from Cx to Cy.
For the other direction, assume that Cx ≈1 Cy, that is, there exists A ∈ X2
such that (A, x1 + ··· + xn, y1 + ··· + yn, δ0x1, δ1xn) ∈ C2X. Then
1	1
δ0A + δ1A + y1 + ··· + yn = δ1A + δ0A + x1 + ··· + xn
1	2	1	2
hence after cancellation we have indices i, j, k, l such that δ0A = xi, δ1A = xj,
1	2
δ0A = yk, δ1A = yl, cf. figure 5.
2	1
As this implies that δ0xi = δ0yk, δ1xi = δ0xj, δ1yk = δ0yl, and δ1xj = δ1yl,
1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1
the x1,..., xn, y1,..., yn can be rearranged in such a way that i = k and
j = l = i + 1, hence A provides an elementary dihomotopy from x to y.	 
The fundamental category Π→ 1X of a semicubical set X, cf. [12], is the category with object set X0 and morphisms dihomotopy classes of dipaths,

Fig. 5. An elementary dihomotopy.
i.e.
Π→ 1X(a, b)= {[(x1,..., xk)] | (x1,..., xk) is a dipath from a to b}
The following is an easy consequence of the preceding proposition:

Proposition 5.2
Π→ 1X is isomorphic to the full subcategory of π1X induced

by the inclusion X0 ⊆ C0X = N · X0.
Example
Continuing the example from section 2.2, we see that the dipath e1 + e2 + e7
is homotopic to the dipath e3 + e4 + e7, by the following elementary relations:

Note that in the relation e1 + e2 + e7 ≈1 e3 + e4 + e7, the edge e7 cannot be canceled: There is no directed homotopy between e1 + e2 and e3 + e4.
Directed Homology of Semicubical Sets
Directed homology provides yet other equivalences on the chain ω-category of a semicubical set X, which are coarser than weak homotopy and have better algebraic structure:
Let Z · Xn denote the free abelian group on Xn, define boundary mappings dα : Z · Xn → Z · Xn−1 by dα(  αjxj) =  αj dαxj, and introduce sets

C¯nX ⊇ CnX by
C¯nX = {(xn, xˇn−1,..., xˆ0) ∈ Z · Xn ×  n  (N · Xn−i)2 | xˇn−1 + d+xn =
xˆn−1 + d−xn, ∀i = 0,...,n − 2: xˇi + d+xˇi+1 = xˆi + d−xˇi+1}


So for an element x = (xn,..., xˆ0) ∈
C¯nX, the “cube itself” xn can have

negative components, but all its boundaries are positive.
We define boundary mappings dα and operations ◦m on the C¯n by the same formulas as in section 3. It is then easily seen that the graded set
{C¯nX, Cn−1X,..., C0X} with these mappings and operations has a structure
of n-category.
Given x, y ∈ CnX, say that x n y if there exists A ∈ C¯n+1X such that d−A = x, d+A = y. This defines equivalence relations n ⊆ CnX × CnX which we shall refer to as directed homology.
Proposition 6.1 Given x, y ∈ CnX; if x ∼n y, then x  n y.
Proof. Let A1,..., Ak ∈ Cn+1X ∪ (Cn+1X)op be a sequence of n + 1-cells con- necting x to y. The elements of (Cn+1X)op are sequences (an+1, aˇn,..., aˆ0) ∈
N·Xn× n (N·Xn−i)2 satisfying aˇn + d−an+1 = aˆn + d+an+1 and ai+ d+aˇi+1 =
aˆi + d−aˇi+1, so the set (Cn+1X)op is in one-to-one correspondence with


'
n+1
X = {(an+1, aˇn,..., aˆ0) ∈ (−N · Xn+1) ×  n
(N · Xn−i)2 | aˇn + d+an+1 =


Now C'
aˆn + d−an+1, ∀i = 0,...,n − 1: aˇi + d+aˇi+1 = aˆi + d−aˇi+1}
X ⊆ C¯n+1X, so (Cn+1X)op can be included in C¯n+1X, and we

can think of the Ai as elements of C¯n+1. Write Ai = (An+1,..., Aˆ0) and define
i	i
A = A1 ◦n ··· ◦n Ak = (Σk	An+1, Aˇn, Aˆn, xˇn−1,..., xˆ0)
then A ∈ C¯n+1X, d−A = d−A1 = x, and d+A = d+Ak = y.	 
Lemma 6.2 Assume x  n y ∈ CnX. Then dαx = dαy, and if x'  n y' ∈ CnX are such that (x, x') ∈ CnX ×m CnX for some m < n, then also (y, y') ∈ CnX ×m CnX, and x ◦m x'  n y ◦m y'.
The proof is similar to the one of lemma 4.1.
So we can again define mappings dα : CnX/ n → Cn−1X and opera- tions ◦m on CnX/ n, and we assemble these to introduce directed homology quotients
dα	dα	dα	,
			
which, with operations ◦m as above, are seen to be n-categories for all n ∈ N.


Functoriality of this construction is obtained the same way as for directed homotopy; if f : X → Y is a morphism of semicubical sets, and f˜ : CX → CY is the induced morphism of ω-categories, then x  n y ∈ CnX implies
f˜nx  n f˜ny ∈ CnY , hence we have an induced mapping f˜∗ : CnX/ n →
CnY / n, which can be assembled with the other functions f˜n−1,..., f˜0 to
yield a mapping f∗ : HnX → HnY .
Example
For the example introduced in section 2.2, we have a directed homology be- tween (the minimal representatives of) e1 + e2 + e7 and e3 + e4 + e7, mediated by the 2-cell
(f1 + f2 − f3 − f4 + f5, e3 + e4 + e7, e1 + e2 + e7, v1, v7)
However the edge e7 can be canceled, arriving at a new 2-cell (f1 + f2 − f3 − f4 + f5, e3 + e4, e1 + e2, v1, v3)
and hence also e1 + e2 and e3 + e4 are homologous. By looking at certain “fibres over 0-cells” we hope to obtain restricted dihomology relations which would disallow such cancellation (note that the end point v7 has been replaced by v3 in the second 2-cell). This is subject to further research.
Properties
The notion of directed homotopy introduced in section 5 seems to have some unusual properties, one of them being that the “Hurewicz mappings” πnX → HnX are surjective: By proposition 6.1, the homology quotient mappings CnX → CnX/ n pass to the homotopy quotient CnX/≈n, hence the identity induces mappings hn : πnX → HnX, and these are indeed surjective.
Also, as the HnX are n-categories, we can extract various kinds of infor- mation from them by restricting our attention to certain fibres. One example of such restriction are the sets
H1Xb = {x ∈ H1X | d−x = a, d+x = b}
for a, b ∈ X0. The operation ◦0 then provides a mapping H1Xb × H1Xc →
a	b

H Xc; moreover, if a 
a' and b 
b', then H Xb and H Xb' are isomorphic.

1  a	0
1  a
a'

Restriction to fibres can also be applied before taking homology quotients; an interesting example are the categories
C2Xb = {x ∈ C2X | d−d−x = a, d+d+x = b}


again for a, b ∈ X0. This is what should lead to the “restricted dihomology relations” hinted at in section 6.1; note that, with the notation of the running example, within C2Xv3 there is no equivalence of e1 + e2 with e3 + e4.
Future Work
It appears that our chain ω-categories and dihomology quotients have just enough algebraic structure to make possible a meaningful notion of the quo- tient chain ω-category induced by a semicubical subset, and to fit this quotient into an exact sequence. This in turn should make possible some Mayer-Vietoris like arguments, which should open up for actual computations of directed ho- mology quotients. We plan to do this in a sequel paper.
With a look to applications, we note that higher-dimensional automata have symmetries (reflections, cf. [9]) in dimensions ≥ 2, which essentially mean that for any x ∈ Xn, n ≥ 2, there exists x' ∈ Xn such that δαx = δ1−αx'
1	i
for all i = 1,..., n. This suggests that the sets
HnXa = {x ∈ HnX | d−x = d+x = a}
for n ≥ 2 and a ∈ Xn−1 should capture much of the information in the HnX, and there should also be a strong relationship to “usual” homology.
