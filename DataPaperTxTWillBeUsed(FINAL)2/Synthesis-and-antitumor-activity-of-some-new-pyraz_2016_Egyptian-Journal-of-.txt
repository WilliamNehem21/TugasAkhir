A new series of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-3-carbonitrile and pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-3- carbonitrile derivatives was synthesized by the reaction of 5-amino-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazole- 3,4-dicarbonitrile as a key starting material with various electrophilic and nucleophilic reagents. All the newly synthesized compounds were structurally confirmed by various modern ana- lytical methods (IR, 1H NMR and MS). All the title compounds have been evaluated for their potential cytotoxicity against human laryngeal epidermoid carcinoma cells (Hep2). Among the screened compounds, 3 and 4 exhibited the highest significant effect.

Introduction

Pyrazole derivatives are characterized by their biological and pharmacological activities as potential inhibitors of HIV-1 [1], pesticides [2], fungicides [3], antihypertensive agents [4] and anticancer activity [5]. They are also important and useful pre- cursors for the synthesis of other fused heterocyclic systems, among these pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives [6], which have a considerable chemical and pharmacological importance as purine analogues [7–9]. In the literature, it was found that
the replacement of 1H of pyrazole of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine ring system by some other bioactive moieties drastically alters its pharmacological properties [10]. Also, the pyrazolo[3,4- b]pyridine derivatives represent important building blocks in both natural and synthetic bioactive compounds [11]. They show anxiolytic activity along with xanthine oxidase inhibitors, cho- lesterol formation inhibitor, and anti-Alzheimer [12]. Moreover, fused heterocyclic containing pyrazolopyridine systems have been described to be associated with several biological and me- dicinal activities [13–16]. In the present work, some new 1-tosyl- pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine and 1-tosyl-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine

derivatives incorporating the tosyl moiety were synthesized to evaluate their potential cytotoxicity against epidermoid car- cinoma of the larynx (Hep2).

Experimental

Materials and methods

All melting points (uncorrected) were determined on an elec- trothermal Gallenkamp melting point apparatus. The IR spectra were recorded in KBr disks on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS 50 FT-IR spectrometer (not all frequencies are reported). The NMR spectra were acquired using a Bruker WP 300 spectrom- eter at 300 MHz using TMS as an internal standard and DMSO- d6 as solvent. The mass spectra were performed using a LC-MS (Shimadzu-Mass spectrometer) at 70 eV. Elemental analy- ses were carried out at the Microanalytical Unit, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt; the results were in satisfactory agreement with the calculated values.

Chemistry

The key starting material 5-amino-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazole-3,4- dicarbonitrile (2) was synthesized in 80% yield by refluxing p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (1) with tetracyanoethylene in ab- solute ethanol [17]. The ease synthesis and expected biological activity of the starting compound prompted us to prepare some 3-cyano-1-tosyl-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine and 3-cyano-1-tosyl- pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine derivatives starting from available and inexpensive compounds such as carbon disulfide, thiourea, formic acid and ethyl acetoacetate. Thus, heating of the pyrazole compound 2 with carbon disulfide in pyridine for 12 hours fur- nished the corresponding 4,6-dithioxo-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4- d]pyrimidine derivative 3 in good yield (Scheme 1). The chemical structure of 3 was secured by its correct elemental analysis and spectral data. Its IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3437 and 2221 cm−1 for the imino (NH) and nitrile (C—N) func- tions. The 1H NMR spectrum revealed singlet signal at 2.25 ppm
for methyl protons (CH3), two doublet signals at 7.10 and
7.50 ppm for para-disubstituted benzene ring, and two singlet signals at NH at 11.22 and 13.69 ppm for two imine protons (NH). The reaction of pyrazole compound 2 with phenyl isothiocyanate proceeded by heating under reflux in di- methyl formamide to afford the corresponding 4-imino-5- phenyl-6-thioxo-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine derivative
The chemical structure of 4 was established on the basis of elemental and spectroscopic analyses. The IR spectrum showed two absorption bands at 3374 and 3180 cm−1 for two (NH)
spectrum showed the molecular ion peak at m/z = 422 corre- sponding to the molecular weight of its chemical formula
C19H14N6O2S2.
Fusion of pyrazole 2 with thiourea furnished one product on TLC, which identified as 4-amino-6-thioxo-1-tosyl-6,7- dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine-3-carbonitrile (5) on the basis of its elemental analysis and spectral data. The IR spec- trum showed absorption bands at 3337 and 3193 cm−1 for the
amino function (NH2) and 2221 cm−1 for the nitrile function (C—N). The 1H NMR spectrum exhibited singlet signal at
2.35 ppm referring to three protons of methyl group (CH3), singlet signal at 6.40 ppm for two protons of amino group (NH2), two doublet signals at 7.25 and 7.65 ppm for para-disubstituted benzene ring, and a further singlet signal appear downfield at
11.25 ppm corresponding to (NH) proton.
In the same way with compound 5, 4,5-diamino-6-thioxo- 1-tosyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivative 6 was prepared by fusion of the starting compound 2 and thiosemicarbazide. The IR spectrum showed absorptions bands at 3417, 3332, and
3195 cm−1 referring to (NH) and (NH2) groups, 2218 cm−1 for the nitrile function (C—N), and absorption band at 1632 cm−1 for the (C—N) function. The 1H NMR spectrum revealed singlet
signal at 2.35 ppm for methyl protons (CH3), singlet signal at
5.20 ppm for (CH) proton, two singlet signals of two amino (NH2) groups at 6.15 and 8.35 ppm, two doublet signals at 7.25 and
7.70 ppm for the aromatic protons, and singlet signal at
11.10 ppm corresponding to imino (NH) group.
When compound 2 reacted with formic acid at reflux tem- perature afforded 4-oxo-1-tosyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4- d]pyrimidine-3-carbonitrile 7 (Scheme 2). The structure of 7 was

confirmed by elemental analysis and spectral data. IR spec- trum showed absorption band at 3253 cm−1 referring to imino group (NH), band of nitrile group (C—N) was detected at 2240 cm−1, and a sharp peak appeared at 1668 cm−1 for the amidic carbonyl group (C—O). The 1H NMR spectrum of 7 re- vealed singlet signal at 2.40 ppm corresponding to protons of
methyl group (CH3), two doublet signals at 7.23 and 7.64 ppm for the para-disubstituted benzene ring, singlet signal at
8.20 ppm referring to proton of (CH—N) function, and singlet signal at 9.45 ppm for imino (NH) group proton.
Heating of pyrazole compound 2 with formamide in dimethyl formamide (DMF) as a solvent afforded the corre- sponding 4-amino-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-3- carbonitrile (8). The structure of 8 was established on the basis of elemental analysis and spectral data. The IR spectrum
showed absorption bands at 3323 and 3166 cm−1 referring to
the amino (NH2) group, 2235 cm−1 for the nitrile group (C—N) and 1636 cm−1 for the (C—N) function. The 1H NMR spectrum of 8 revealed singlet signal at 2.35 ppm for three protons of
methyl group (CH3), and two doublet signals at 7.30 and
7.55 ppm for the aromatic protons, in addition to singlet signal at 8.25 ppm characteristic to the pyrimidine proton (CH—N). Heating of compound 2 with triethyl orthoformate in acetic anhydride afforded ethyl N-(3,4-dicyano-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazol- 5-yl)formimidate 9, which underwent heterocyclization with hydrazine hydrate in absolute ethanol, afforded 5-amino-4- imino-1-tosyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-3-    carbonitrile 10 in good yield. The IR spectrum showed
absorption bands at 3342 and 3216 cm−1 for the (NH and NH2) groups, 2236 cm−1 due to the presence of nitrile (C—N) func- tion and 1635 cm−1 for the (C—N) group. The 1H NMR of 10 showed singlet signal at 2.35 ppm for three protons of methyl
group (CH3), two doublet signals of the aromatic protons at 7.30 and 7.80 ppm, and singlet signal at 8.15 ppm due to pyrimi- dine C-2 proton, and it also revealed two singlet signals of NH2 and C—NH protons at 7.45 and 11.35 ppm respectively.
Heating of compound 2 with ethyl acetoacetate in di- methyl formamide in the presence of an equimolar amount of potassium carbonate gave one spot on TLC using ethyl acetate:petroleum ether mixture (2:3) as eluent, the obtained product was identified as 5-Acetyl-4-amino-6-hydroxy-1-tosyl- 1H-pyrazolo-[3,4-b]pyridine-3-carbonitrile (12) on the basis of elemental and spectral analyses (Scheme 3). The formation of 12 was proposed to be continued through heterocyclization of the expected intermediate 5-acetyl-4-amino-6-hydroxy-1- tosyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-3-carbonitrile (11). The IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3293, 3201 and 3140 cm−1
for (OH and NH2) groups, 2240 cm−1 corresponding to nitrile func- tion (C—N), 1702 cm−1 due to C—O group and 1648 cm−1 referring to (C—N) function. The 1H NMR revealed two singlet signals at
2.35 and 2.50 ppm for six protons of two methyl groups (2CH3), singlet signal at 6.02 ppm referring to the (NH2) protons, two doublet signals at 7.35 and 7.75 ppm for para-disubstituted benzene ring protons, and singlet signal at 11.55 ppm corre-
sponding to (OH) proton. The mass spectrum showed the molecular ion peak at m/z = 371 corresponding to the molecu- lar weight of the molecular formula C16H13N5O4S.
Heating of compound 2 with malononitrile in refluxing DMF containing piperidine produces a sole product that iden- tified as 4,6-diamino-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-3,5- dicarbonitrile 13, in 67% isolated yield. Presumably, ionized malononitrile attacks the cyano group in compound 2 before the amino group of the latter attacks one of the malononitrile cyano groups resulting in ring formation. The IR spectrum
showed absorption peaks at 3410, 3335 and 3245 cm−1 due to
the presence of amino groups (NH2), 2216 cm−1 due to the nitrile function (C—N) and 1651 cm−1 corresponding to (C—N) func- tion. The 1H NMR spectrum exhibited singlet signal at 2.40 ppm
corresponding to the methyl protons (CH3), two singlet signals at 6.42 and 8.47 ppm for the two amino groups (NH2), while the doublet signals at 7.42 and 7.61 ppm were assigned for the aro- matic protons.

3.2.	In vitro antitumor activity

The antitumor activity of the synthesized compounds were evaluated against human laryngeal epidermoid carcinoma cell line (Hep2) using the MTT assay method. The results ac-
quired in Table 1 demonstrated that compounds 3 (IC50 36.9 μM)
and 4 (IC50 21.3 μM) have the highly significant effect com- pared to the standard anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (IC50 41.5 μM). This may be because of the presence of such NH- C—S moiety in addition to the N-tosyl-pyrazolo-pyrimidine
moiety in the two compounds. The other compounds showed low impact against epidermoid carcinoma (Hep2).
