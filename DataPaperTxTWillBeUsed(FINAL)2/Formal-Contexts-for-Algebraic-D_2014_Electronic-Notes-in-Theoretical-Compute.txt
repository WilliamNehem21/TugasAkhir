Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the representation of algebraic domains by means of Formal Concept Analysis. For a formal context, we can define a large number of consistent sets. Associated with each consistent set, there is a set of F -approximable concepts which are selected from the well known approximable concepts. By virtue of F -approximable concepts, formal contexts and algebraic domains are able to interpret each other. Moreover, by analyzing the finitely consistent sets, the algebraic bifinite domains, algebraic L−domains are exactly located at the corresponding formal contexts, respectively.
Keywords: formal context, F -approximable concept, algebraic domain, categorical equivalence.


Introduction
Domain theory was introduced by Dana Scott [5] in the 1970s and has become an important branch of order theory. As the theory of ordered topological structures used in denotational semantics, it has major applications in computer science, where it is used to specify denotational semantics, especially for functional programming languages.
In order to provide a more concrete way for the usual domain-theoretical ap- proach to the semantics of programming languages, the notion of information sys- tem was first developed in [6]. By the notion of information elements, information systems provide a concrete representation of Scott domains. During the last few

decades, many other kinds of information systems have been developed to repre- sent various kinds of domain structures, such as continuous domains [15], algebraic domains [7], L-domains [8], bifinite domains [2] and so on.
Another research field which is closely related to information systems, and thus related to domain theory, is formal concept analysis (for short, FCA). It was pio- neered by Wille [4] and was built on applied lattice and order theory [3]. The core idea of classical FCA is to extract the hierarchy structure of concepts inherent in relational data.
Recently, in [10,13], G-Q. Zhang, etc. studied in detail the connections be- tween information systems and FCA. In their work, based on the observation of the mismatch between the formal concepts and information element of the associ- ated information systems, they initially proposed the notion of formal approximable concept which is a generalization of classical formal concepts. It has been verified that approximable concepts exactly capture the class of algebraic lattices which are special domain structures. Subsequently, P. Hitzler and G-Q Zhang [13] further established the categorical equivalence between a specified category of formal con- texts and the category of algebraic lattices. These results indicate the significant potential capability of FCA in characterizing domain structures. However, we have not seen any work on representing domain structures other than algebraic lattices by the tool of FCA in the literature.
In this paper, we investigate the representation of algebraic domains by means of FCA. For this purpose, we propose a new notion of F -approximable concept, which can be viewed as a selection of approximable concepts under the constraint of a consistent set employed on a formal context. We further explore the connection between F -approximable concepts and algebraic domains. It is shown that all F - approximable concepts of a formal context form an algebraic domain, and conversely, every algebraic domain is isomorphic to the set of F -approximable concepts of some special formal context.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly recall some necessary preliminaries of domain theory. In Section 3, we develop the no- tion of F -approximable concept based on G-Q. Zhang’s approximable concepts and obtain the representation theory of algebraic domains via F -approximable concepts. In Section 4, we propose a new type of morphism, named conditional formal context morphisms, and study the associated category of formal contexts (denoted as Cct). We eventually obtain the equivalence of Cct and the category of algebraic
domains.
Section 5 additionally investigates the corresponding formal contexts of some special algebraic domains. In particular, we present sufficient and necessary condi- tions of formal contexts to represent algebraic bifinite domains, algebraic L-domains. Section 6 gives conclusions.

Preliminaries: Domains
For the convenience of the reader, we recall some notions in domain theory. Let T be a poset. Given a subset A of T , we write ↓A for the set {t | t ∈ T∃a ∈ A(t ≤ a)} (without confusion, ↓x for ↓ {x}), and dually, ↑A for {t | t ∈ T∃a ∈ A(a ≤ t)}. We denote by ub(A) the set of all upper-bounds of A and the minimal elements of ub(A) are called minimal upper-bounds of A. T is said to be a complete lattice if every subset A (include empty set) of T has a least upper-bound in T . T is called bounded complete if each subset which has an upper-bound has a least upper-bound.
A nonempty subset D of T is said to be directed if for two arbitrary elements d1 and d1 of D, there exists a d3 ∈ D such that d1 ≤ d3 and d2 ≤ d3. A dcpo is a poset such that each directed set of it has a least upper bound. If a dcpo has a least element, we call it pointed. A dcpo T with a least element is called a pointed L−domain if for every x ∈ T , ↓x is a complete lattice.
Let x, y ∈ T , x is said to approximate y (in symbol x  y) if and only if for every directed set D ⊆ T , y ≤ W D means that there is a d ∈ D such that x ≤ d.
Let ⇓ x denote the set {t ∈ T | t   x}. x is compact if x   x (We use κ(T )
to denote the set of all compact elements of T ). A subset β of T is said to be a basis of T if for every x ∈ T , ⇓x ∩ β is a directed set and x = W(⇓x ∩ β). A
dcpo is called a continuous domain if it has a basis. In particular, a dcpo is called
an algebraic domain if all compact elements of it form a basis. A complete lattice is called an algebraic lattice if it is also an algebraic domain. This paper mainly discusses algebraic domains. Bounded complete algebraic domains are called Scott domains.
A monotonic function f between two posets T1 and T2 is Scott continuous if f
preserves all joins of directed sets, that is, for all directed sets D of T , the existence of W D implies f (W D) = W f (D). We use [T1 → T2] to denote the set of Scott
continuous functions from T1 to T2. The function space [T1 → T2] naturally form a
poset under the pointwise order.
Definition 2.1 An approximate identity for a dcpo T is a directed set D ⊆ [T → T ] satisfying W D = iT , the identity on T .
Definition 2.2 An algebraic domain is called a bifinite domain if it has an approx- imate identity consisting of maps with finite range.
Theorem 2.3 ([2]) For an algebraic domain T with a least element, the following statements are equivalent:
T is an algebraic L−domain.
For each upper-bound x of a ﬁnite subset A of κ(T ) there is a unique minimal upper-bound of A below x.
For each upper-bound x of a pair A of compact elements of κ(T ) there is a unique minimal upper-bound of A below x.
All pointed algebraic domains and the Scott continuous functions between them form a category ALG⊥. The category ALG⊥ has two maximal cartesian closed

full subcategory B in which all pointed algebraic bifinite domains are objects, and full subcategory L in which all pointed algebraic L−domains are objects. For more backgrounds about domain theory and category theory, the reader may refer to [9,17,20].

Revisiting formal concepts and approximable con- cepts
A formal context is a triple (Po, Pa, |=P ) where Po and Pa are two sets and
|=⊆ Po × Pa. The elements of Po and Pa are often called objects and attributes, respectively. FCA studies the relationship between objects and the properties. Ga- lois connection [12] is the basic mathematical technique for extracting concepts from formal contexts.
Definition 3.1 Let P and Q be ordered sets. A pair (f, g) of maps f : P → Q and
g : Q → P is a Galois connection between P and Q if, for all p ∈ P and q ∈ Q,
(Gal) f (p) ≤ q ⇔ p ≤ g(q).
Proposition 3.2 ([3]) Assume (f, g) is a Galois connection between P and Q. Let
p ∈ P and q ∈ Q. Then
(G1) p ≤ g ◦ f (p) and f ◦ g(q) ≤ q.
(G2) Both f and g are monotone.
(G3) f (p)= f ◦ g ◦ f (p) and g(q)= g ◦ f ◦ g(q).
Conversely, a pair (f, g) of maps f : P → Q and g : Q → P satisfying (G1) and
(G2) for all p ∈ P and q ∈ Q sets up a Galois connection between P and Q.
Given a formal context P = (Po, Pa, |=P ), we define two operators αP and ωP
as follows:
αP : 2Po → 2Pa with αp(A)= {a ∈ Pa | ∀o ∈ A, o |=P a}
ωP : 2Pa → 2Po with ωP (B)= {o ∈ Po | ∀b ∈ B, o |=P b}.
We write ηP for the composition ωP ◦αP : 2Po → 2Po . As is well known, (αP , ωP ) is a Galois connection between (2Po , ⊆) and (2Pa , ⊇). A concept of the formal context (Po, Pa, |=) is defined to be a pair (A, B) such that αP (A) = B and ωP (B) = A, where A and B are usually called the extent and the intent of the concept (A, B), respectively. The set of all concepts of (Po, Pa, |=P ) is denoted by B[(Po, Pa, |=P )]. For two arbitrary concepts (A1, B1) and (A2, B2), we write (A1, B1) ≤ (A2, B2) if A1 ⊆ A2. Then ≤ is an order on B[(Po, Pa, |=P )]. Clearly,
(A1, B1) ≤ (A2, B2) ⇔ A1 ⊆ A2 ⇔ B1 ⊇ B2.
Generally, letting P and Q be two sets, two arbitrary maps f : P → Q and g : Q → P induce a map H : P × Q → P × Q defined by H(x, y) = (g(y),f (x)). Writing fix(H) for the set {(x, y) ∈ P × Q | H(x, y) = (x, y)}, and fixP (H) for
{x ∈ P | ∃y ∈ Q, (x, y) ∈ fix(H)}, and fixQ(H) for {y ∈ Q | ∃x ∈ P, (x, y) ∈

fix(H)}, one has:
Proposition 3.3 If fix(H) /= ∅, then the restriction of f to fixP (H) is a bijection from fixP (H) to fixQ(H), and its inverse map is exactly the restriction of g to fixQ(H).
In order to be succinct, when speaking of a formal context P in the remainder of this paper, we always explicitly or non-explicitly have defined the corresponding sets Po, Pa and |=P .
Proposition 3.4 Given a formal context P, the set {A ⊆ Po | ηP (A)= A} under the inclusion is order-isomorphic to B[P ].
As is well known, B[P ] under the relation ≤ forms a complete lattice. Further- more, if defining γ : Po → B[P ] and μ : Pa → B[P ] by
γ(o)= (ωP ◦ αP ({o}), αP ({o})) and μ(a)= (ωP ({a}), αP ◦ ωP ({a})), then we can obtain the following central result in FCA:
Theorem 3.5 (Wille [4]) Let P be a formal context and L = B[P ] be the associ- ated complete lattice. Then the maps γ and μ are such that γ(Po) is join-dense in L, the set μ(Pa) is meet-dense in L, and o |= a is equivalent to γ(o) ≤ μ(a) for each o ∈ Pa and a ∈ Pa. For the other direction, let L be a complete lattice and let Po and Pa be sets and assume that there exist maps γ : Po → L and μ : Pa → L such that γ(Po) is join-dense in L and μ(Pa) is meet-dense in L. Deﬁne o |= a ⇔ γ(o) ≤ μ(a). Then L is order-isomorphic to B(Po, Pa, |=). In particular, any complete lattice L is order-isomorphic to the concept lattice B[(L, L, ≤)]
Zhang and Shen [10] introduced the notion of approximable concept to represent algebraic lattices. For a formal context P , a subset A of Po is called an approximable concept if and only if ηP (X) ⊆ A for all finite subsets X of A. Let A[P ] denote the set of all approximable concepts of a formal context P . All approximable concepts have the following properties:
The directed union of approximable concepts is again an approximable concept.
Given any set A of objects, the smallest approximable concept containing A is given by ηP (A)=  {ηP (X)|X ⊆fin A}.
ηP is an inductive closure operator, i.e., it preserves directed unions. From this is follows immediately that the set of approximable concepts (i.e., the fixpoints of ηP ) forms an algebraic lattice in which the compact elements are the closures of finite sets.
Theorem 3.6 (Zhang and Shen [10]) For any formal context P, A[P ] is an algebraic lattice. Conversely, every algebraic lattice L is order-isomorphic to A[(L, κ(L), ≤)], where the isomorphism is given by A ⊆→ sup A for any A ∈ A[(L, κ(L), ≤)].
There are strong relations between approximable concepts and concepts, in fact, the extent of a concept is also an approximable concept, but the inverse may be

false. From the definitions, one immediately has,
Lemma 3.7 Let P be a formal context. Then:
For every X ⊆ 2Po , (ηP (X), αP (X)) ∈ B[P ].
For every (A, B) ∈ B[P ], A is an approximable concept.

The above facts lead to two functions f : B[P ] → A[P ] sending an arbitrary (A, B) ∈ B[P ] to A, and f : A[P ] → B[P ] with f (A) = (ηP (A), αP (A)) for all A ∈ A[P ].

Theorem 3.8 Let P be a formal context. Then the map pair (f, f ) is a Galois connection between A[P ] and B[P ].
Hitzler and Zhang [13] introduced a certain morphism between two formal con- texts to investigate the approximable concepts from the point of view of category theory. Let Fin(A) denote the set of all finite subsets of a set A.
Definition 3.9 [13] Given two formal contexts P and Q, a formal context mor- phism M from P to Q is a relation M ⊆ Fin(Po) ×Fin(Qo), such that the following conditions are satisfied for all X, Xj ∈ Fin(Po) and Y, Y j ∈ Fin(Qo):
(cm1) ∅M∅.
(cm2) XMY and XMY j imply XM (Y ∪ Y j).
(cm3) ηP (X) ⊇ Xj and XjMY j and ηQ(Y j) ⊇ Y imply XMY .
All formal contexts and formal context morphisms between them form a cate- gory Cxt in which the composition of two formal context morphisms is the usual composition of them as relations.In [13], it is shown that the resulting category Cxt is equivalent to that of algebraic lattices and Scott-continuous morphisms.
For a formal context P , a set FP which consists of some finite subsets of Po is called consistent if for each F ∈ FP and each finite set A ⊆ ηP (F ), there is Fj ∈ FP such that A ⊆ Fj ⊆ ηP (F ). A conditional formal context (Po, Pa, |=, FP ) is a formal context (Po, Pa, |=) endowed with a consistent set FP . For the conditional formal context (Po, Pa, |=, FP ), a set X ⊆ Po is called finitely consistent if for every finite subset Y of X there is an F ∈ FP such that Y ⊆ F ⊆ X. We write W[(Po, Pa, |=, FP )] for the set of all finitely consistent sets of (Po, Pa, |=, FP ).
From now on, when P refers to a conditional formal context (shortly, cfc), we mean that all sets Po, Pa, |=P and FP corresponding to P have been given.
Definition 3.10 Let P be a cfc. A subset X of Po is call an F-approximable concept if X satisfies the following statements:
X is finitely consistent
For every F ∈ FP , F ⊆ X implies ηP (F ) ⊆ X.
The set of all F-approximable concepts of P is denoted by F[P ].
Example 3.11 Let the formal context P  be defined as follows.	The set
{{A, B}, {C, D}, {B, C, D}} is a consistent set. Note that {A, B, C, D} is not an

F−approximable concept because it is not finitely consistent, but an approximable concept.

Proposition 3.12 Let P be a cfc. Then:
Every F-approximable concept is an approximable concept.
For every directed set {Di ∈ F[P ] | i ∈ I}, W	Di =	Di.
F[P ] is an algebraic domain with a basis {ηP (F ) | F ∈ FP }.
Corollary 3.13 The embedding i : F[P ] → A[P ] which sends X to X for every
X ∈ F[P ] is Scott continuous.
Now we consider another direction. For an arbitrary algebraic domain L, it not only naturally generates a formal context P [L] = (κ(L), L, ≤), but also induces a set FL defined by
FL = {F ∈ Fin(κ(L)) | ∃a ∈ F∀b ∈ F (b ≤ a)}.
With respect to the formal context P [L], by the straightforward computation there are:
For all X ⊆ κ(L), αP [L](X)=  {↑ a | a ∈ X}.
For all X ⊆ κ(L), ηP [L](X)= {↓ b ∩ κ(L) | b ∈  {↑ a | a ∈ X}}.
Lemma 3.14 (κ(L), L, ≤, FL) is a cfc.
Theorem 3.15 For any cfc P, F[P ] is an algebraic domain. Conversely, every algebraic domain L is order-isomorphic to F[(κ(L), L, ≤, FL)], where the order- isomorphism is given A ⊆→ sup A for any A ∈ F[(κ(L), L, ≤, FL)].
Proof. The former assertion is just Proposition 3.12(3) and we only need to show the latter.
Let A ∈ F[(κ(L), L, ≤, FL)]. Then there is {Fi | i ∈ I} ⊆ FL and  {Fi | i ∈ I} = A, where {Fi | i ∈ I} is directed under inclusion. Given a pair x, y ∈ A, we are able to locate ix, iy, iz ∈ I such that x ∈ Fix and y ∈ Fiy and Fix ∪ Fiy ⊆ Fiz . By the definition of FL, we also find a tiz ∈ Fiz such that x ≤ tiWz and y ≤ tiz .

Therefore, A is a directed subset of L and has a least upper bound
We first claim A = (↓ W A) ∩ κ(L).
A in L.

It is sufficient to prove that (↓ W A) ∩ κ(L) =  {ηP [L](Fi) | i ∈ I}. In fact, for every i ∈ I, there is an ai ∈ Fi with b ≤ ai for all b ∈ Fi, so, ηP [L](Fi) =↓ ai ∩ κ(L) ⊆ (↓  A) ∩ κ(L). Let a ∈ (↓  A) ∩ κ(L). Then a ≤  A implies

a ≤ W{W Fi | i ∈ I} = W{ai | i ∈ I}, hence there is i0 ∈ I such that a ≤ ai by the compactness of a. That is, a ∈ ηP [L](Fi0 ). We completed our claim.
Since A = (↓ W A) ∩κ(L) for every A ∈ F[(κ(L), L, ≤, FL)], A ∈ {↓ t∩κ(L) | t ∈
L}. conversely, for an arbitrary t ∈ L, we show that ↓ t∩κ(L) is an F−approximable concept with respect to (κ(L), L, ≤, FL). For every finite subset F of ↓t∩κ(L), there is an aF ∈↓t ∩ κ(L) such that b ≤ aF for all b ∈ F since ↓t ∩ κ(L) is directed. This implies F ∪{aF }∈ FL and F ⊆ F ∪{aF } ⊆↓t∩κ(L). Therefore ↓t∩κ(L) is finitely consistent. Note that ηP [L](F ∪ {aF })= ηP [L]({aF }) =↓ aF ∩ κ(L) ⊆↓t ∩ κ(L). Up to now, F[(κ(L), L, ≤, FL)] = {↓t∩κ(L) | t ∈ L} is proved. Therefore, the assertion of order-isomorphism is easily inferred from the standard domain theory.	2
In this section we adopt the function symbols αP and βP instead of the symbol ( )’ used in the original FCA, because we emphasize the single side concepts for clustering data. But readers can find the counterparts in FCA community after carefully checking out all our terminologies.
Morphisms between conditional formal contexts
It is necessary to define a certain morphism between formal contexts in order to investigate the categorical aspects of formal contexts.
Definition 4.1 Given two formal contexts P and Q, a conditional formal context morphism (in short, cfcm) R from P and Q is a relation R ⊆ FP × Qo, such that the following conditions hold for all X, Xj ∈ FP and Y ∈ Fin(Qo) and a ∈ Qo:
(c1) XRY ⇒ ∃F j ∈ FQ(XRFj ⊇ Y ),
(c2) ηP (X) ⊇ Xj ∧ XjRY ∧ a ∈ ηQ(Y ) ⇒ XRa, where XRY means XRb for every b ∈ Y .
Let R1 be a cfcm from P to Q and R2 be a cfcm from Q to S. Define relation
R2 ◦ R1 ⊆ FP × So by
∀X ∈ FP ∀s ∈ So(X(R2 ◦ R1)s) ⇔ ∃Xj ∈ FQ(XR1Xj ∧ XjR2s).
Lemma 4.2 the relation R2 ◦ R1 is a cfcm from P to S.
Lemma 4.3 All cfcs as objects and all cfcms between them form a category named
Cct.
Lemma 4.4 Let M be a formal context morphism from P to Q in the sense of [13]. Then for all X ∈ Fin(Po) and Y ∈ Fin(Qo) , XMY ⇔ ∀y ∈ Y (XM{y}).
Let Acct denote the full subcategory of Cct in which all objects are ((Po, Pa, |=P
),Fin(Po)). Define two categorical functions R : Acct → Cxt and M : Cxt →
Acct as follows:
R acts on objects: R[((Po, Pa, |=P ),Fin(Po))]= (Po, Pa, |=P ).
R acts on morphisms: Let R be a cfcm from P to Q. For all X ∈ Fin(Po) and Y ∈ Fin(QO), XR[R]Y ⇔ ∀y ∈ Y (XRy).

M acts on objects: M[(Po, Pa, |=P )] = ((Po, Pa, |=P ),Fin(Po)).
M acts on morphisms: Let M be a formal context morphism from P to Q. For all X ∈ Fin(Po) and a ∈ QO, XM[M ]a ⇔ XM{a}.
Lemma 4.5 Both R and M are functors.
Given an arbitrary cfc P , for all A ∈ W[P ], {ηP (X) | X ∈ FP ,X ⊆ A} is a directed subset of W[P ], so,  {ηP (X) | X ∈ FP ,X ⊆ A} ∈ W[P ]. This enables us to introduce a function η  : W[P ] → W[P ] such that for all A ∈ W[P ], ηP (A) = {ηP (X) | X ∈ FP ,X ⊆ A}. ηP is an idempotent Scott continuous function, moreover, one should note that ηP (X)= ηP (X) for all X ∈ FP .
Proposition 4.6 Let P and Q be two cfc and let fixη(P, Q) denote the set {g ∈
[W[P ] → W[Q]] | ηQ ◦ g ◦ ηP = g}. Then:
For every Scott continuous function f from W[P ] to W[Q]. The relation
C(f ) ⊆ FP × Qo deﬁned by XC(f )q ⇔ q ∈ ηQ ◦ f ◦ ηP (X) is a cfcm from P to Q.
The restriction of C to fixη(P, Q) is bijective from fixη(P, Q) to hom(P, Q)
where hom(P, Q) denotes the set of all cfcms from P to Q.
Lemma 4.7 Let R : P → Q be a cfcm. Then F[R] : F[P ] → F[Q] : x ⊆→ {b |
∃X ∈ FP (X ⊆ x ∧ (XRb))} is a Scott continuous function.
Lemma 4.8 F is a faithful and full functor from Cct to Alg. Theorem 4.9 Cct ∼ Alg.
Proof. It is an immediate conclusion of the combination of Theorem 3.15, Lemma
4.8 and Theorem 1(3) of Chapter 4 in [17].
Cartesian closed categories
Domain theory stems from programming language semantics. Only Cartesian closed full subcategories of ALG⊥ are of interest in this case since any advanced algorith- mic language allows the formation of function spaces as data type, so, we investigate the pointed bifinite domains, pointed L−domains in this section.
Lemma 5.1 Let P be a cfc. Then F[P ] has the bottom if and only if
(PT )	∅∈ FP ∨ ∃X0 ∈ FP ∀X ∈ FP (X0 ⊆ ηP (X)).
Lemma 5.2 Let P be a cfc. An x ∈ W[P ] is an F-approximable concept if and only if ηP (x)= x.
Definition 5.3 Let P be a cfc and let F ∈ Fin(Po). Z ∈ FP with F ⊆ Z is called a local least upper-bound of F if for all V, Y ∈ FP , F ⊆ Y and Z ∪ Y ⊆ ηP (V ) imply Z ⊆ ηP (Y ).
We use sup(F ) to denote the set of all local least upper-bounds of F . Clearly, for each F ∈ FP , F ∈ sup(F ) from the above definition. Consider the subsequent condition:

(L):	∀X ∈ FP ∀F ∈ Fin(Po)(F ⊆ ηP (X) ⇒ ∃Z ∈ sup(F )(Z ⊆ ηP (X))).
Proposition 5.4 For every pointed L−domain, P [L] = ((κ(L), L, ≤), FL) meets
(L).
Proof. Let F ∈ Fin(κ(L)) and X ∈ FL such that F ⊆ ηP (L)(X). Then F ⊆↓ X ∩ κ(L). From the definition of FL, there is an aX ∈ X such that a ≤ aX for all a ∈ X. Since L is an L−domain, there is a unique minimal upper bound z of F in ↓ aX from Theorem 2.3. But z ∈ κ(L) from Proposition 1.9 [2], Put Z = F ∪ {z}. Then Z ∈ FL, and Z ⊆ ηP (L)(X).
Now let Y ∈ FL and Y ⊇ F . If Y ∪ Z ⊆ ηP (L)(V ) for some V ∈ FL. Note that
Y and z are the upper bounds of F in ↓	V . From the choice of z , we have
z ≤ W Y , hence Z ⊆ ηP (L)(Y ). We have proved Z ∈ sup(F ).
We have done.	2
Proposition 5.5 Let P be a cfc which satisﬁes (L). Then for each x ∈ F[P ], ↓x
is join-complete.
Proof. Let x ∈ F[P ] and x1, x2 ⊆ x. We only need to show that x1 and x2 have a least upper bound in ↓ x.
Put z = {a | ∃F ∈ Fin(x1 ∪x2)∃X ∈ FP ∃Z ∈ sup(F )(X ⊆ x∧Z ⊆ ηP (X) ∧a ∈
ηP (Z))}.
Claim 1. z ∈ W[P ]
Given an arbitrary F ∈ Fin(z). Then for every t ∈ F , there are Xt ⊆ x and Ft ⊆ Fin(x1 ∪ x2) and Zt ∈ sup(Ft) such that Zt ⊆ ηP (Xt) and t ∈ ηP (Zt). Put Fj =  {Ft | t ∈ F} and Xj =  {Xt | t ∈ F}. We have XF ∈ FP with Xj ⊆ XF ⊆ x, whence Fj ⊆ ηP (XF ). By (L), there is ZF ′ ∈ sup(Fj) such that ZF ′ ⊆ ηP (XF ). Since for every t ∈ F , Ft ⊆ Fj ⊆ ZF ′ and Zt ∪ ZF ′ ⊆ ηP (XF ), Zt ⊆ ηP (ZF ′ ) by the definition of Zt. Therefore, F ⊆ ηP (ZF ′ ), and hence there is Y ∈ FP such that F ⊆ G ⊆ ηP (ZF ′ ). Note that for each g ∈ G, g ∈ ηP (ZF ′ ) and ZF ′ ⊆ ηP (XF ) and XF ⊆ x and Fj ⊆ x1 ∪ x2. G ⊆ z by the definition of z.
Claim 2. z ∈ F[P ]
(Following Claim 1) F ⊆ ηP (ZF ′ ) implies ηP (F ) ⊆ η2 (ZF ′ )= ηP (ZF ′ ), that is,
a ∈ ηP (ZF ′ ) for every a ∈ ηP (F ). Thus ηP (F ) ⊆ z.
Claim 3. z is a least upper bound of x1 and x2 in ↓x.
We first show xi ⊆ z for i = 1, 2. Let a ∈ xi. Then there is Y ∈ FP and Y ⊆ xi such that a ∈ ηP (Y ). Y ⊆ xi ⊆ x means that there exists Y j ∈ FP and Y j ⊆ x with Y ⊆ ηP (Y j). Note that Y ∈ sup(Y ). Thus a ∈ z since Y ⊆ xi ⊆ x1 ∪ x2.
Let y ∈ FP such that x1, x2 ⊆ y ⊆ x and a ∈ z. Then there are X ⊆ x and F ⊆ Fin(x1 ∪ x2) and Z ∈ sup(F ) such that Z ⊆ ηP (X) and a ∈ ηP (Z). F ⊆ Fin(x1 ∪ x2) implies that there is V such that F ⊆ V ∈ FP and V ⊆ y ⊆ x. Again we have another Xj ∈ FP such that X ∪V ⊆ Xj ⊆ x. Thus X ∪V ⊆ ηP (Xj). Z ⊆ ηP (X) infers Z ⊆ ηP (X ∪ V ) ⊆ η2 (Xj)= ηP (Xj). Thus Z ∪ V ⊆ ηP (Xj). We have a ∈ ηP (V ) ⊆ y by the definition of Z. We have obtained z ⊆ y.	2
Let’s consider two subcategories of Cctb, Cctl of the category Cct, where the objects of these subcategories are:

Cctb: The cfcs with (PT) and (B)
Cctl: The cfcs with (PT) and (L).
Theorem 5.6 (1) Cctb ∼ B; (2) Cctl ∼ L.
Proof. We repeatedly employ Theorem 1(3) of Chapter 4 in [17]. Then: (1) It is a immediate conclusion of Theorem 3.15, Lemma 4.8 and Proposition ??. (2) It is clear by Theorem 3.15, Lemma 4.8, Propositions 5.4 and 5.5.
Conclusions
This work relates two independent fields FCA and algebraic domains. A basic idea is the approximation of targets along a road which is called a consistent set, so that we can work out of the hierarchy of complete lattices. The clustering data in format of domains is not only a kind of organization of data but also a procedure of approximation. All results of categorical equivalence in this work are confined in algebraic domains, but we look forward to outcomes with respect to continuous dcpos.
