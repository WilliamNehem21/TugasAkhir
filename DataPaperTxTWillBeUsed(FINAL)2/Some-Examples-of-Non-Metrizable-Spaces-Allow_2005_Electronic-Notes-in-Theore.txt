Abstract
Representations of spaces are the key device in Type-2 Theory of Effectivity (TTE) for defining computability on non-countable spaces. Almost-compact representations permit a simple measure- ment of the time complexity of functions using discrete parameters, namely the desired output precision together with “size” information about the argument, rather than continuous ones.
We present some interesting examples of non-metrizable topological vector spaces that have almost- compact admissible representations, including spaces of real polynomial functions and of distribu- tions with compact support.
Keywords: Topological Vector Spaces, Distributions, Type-2 Theory of Effectivity, Complexity Theory


Introduction
Up to now, most investigations in complexity theory deal with discrete spaces. In this article, however, we consider computational complexity of functions on non-discrete spaces. For studying time complexity of real functions there exist

already several approaches. They can be divided into two classes, depending on whether or not they are “bit-oriented”. Bit-oriented models take into ac- count the infinitesimal and approximative nature of real numbers and the fini- tary aspects of computations on digital computers, whereas non bit-oriented ones assume that an arithmetic operation can be performed on a real number in one step. An example of the latter is the real-RAM model by L. Blum,
M. Shub, S. Smale (cf. [1]), examples of the former are the approach by K. Ko (cf. [7]) and Type-2 theory of effectivity (TTE) developed by K. Weihrauch (cf. [14,9]).
In this paper we use Type-2 theory of effectivity. TTE provides a compu- tational model for functions on sets with cardinality of the continuum. The basic idea is to equip a given set X with a representation, which provides the objects of X with names and is formally a surjective partial function from the Baire space Nω onto X. On these names the actual computation is per- formed by a Type-2 machine. This kind of computability is called relative computability. Details can be found in Section 2 or in [14,10]. The compu- tation by a Type-2 machine is potentially infinite and produces increasingly better approximations of the result. As a mathematical model to describe approximations, we use topological spaces (cf. [4]).
Since the computation by a Type-2 machine does not terminate, we have to define time complexity of functions on non-discrete spaces different to the discrete case. For every “precision” m ∈ N, we count the finite number of steps which the realizing Type-2 machine needs to produce an approximation of the result with precision m. As we use infinite words for names rather than finite ones, there is, unlike the discrete case, no natural notion of a “size” of an input. So in general the time complexity of a relatively computable function has to be a function from Nω × N to N. However, for the sake of simplicity we are interested in time complexity functions of the type N × N →
N. Almost-compact representations are defined in such a way that indeed the time complexity of functions which are relatively computable w.r.t. almost- compact representations can be described by functions of the type N × N → N (cf. Subsection 2.3). In [12], several nice characterizations of the class of Hausdorff spaces equipped with an almost-compact admissible representation are shown.
In Section 3 we repeat the definitions of inductive limit spaces and of Silva spaces. We show conditions under which these spaces have almost- compact admissible representations. As examples, we prove in Section 4 that the space of real polynomials, the lp-spaces, the space of analytic functions on the interval [0, 1] and the space of distributions with compact support have, under suitable topologies, almost-compact admissible representations. The


considered almost-compact admissible representation of the real polynomials admits computation of the evaluation operator in polynomial time.

Notation and Terminology

By N we denote the set N ∪ {∞} = {0, 1,... }∪ {∞}, by N∗ the set of finite words over N and by Nω := {p | p : N → N} the set of infinite words over
N.  For p ∈ Nω, n ∈ N and w ∈ N∗ let p<n := p(0) ... p(n − 1) ∈ N∗,
p>n := p(n + 1)p(n + 2) ... ∈ Nω and wNω := {p ∈ Nω | (∃n ∈ N) p<n =
w} ⊆ Nω.  O n N	an}d N we use the usu al metrizable topologies τNω :}=
w∈W wNω W ⊆ N∗	and τN :=  U ⊆ N ∞ ∈ U =⇒ (∀∞n ∈ N) n ∈ U ,
where the quantifier (∀∞n) means for almost all n, i.e. (∃n0 ∈ N)(∀n ≥ n0). The convergence relation of a topological space X = (X, τX) is denoted by →X ,
i.e., we write (xn)n →X x∞ to express that (xn)n converges to x∞ in X, which is defined by (∀U ∈ τX)(x∞ ∈ U =⇒ (∀∞n) xn ∈ U ), cf. [4]. The closure of a subset M in X is denoted by ClsX(M), and dom(f ) denotes the domain of a partial function φ :⊆ A → B.

Basics of Type Two Theory
We repeat in this section the notions of relative computability and complexity with respect to representations and motivate the notion of an almost-compact representation. Details can be found e.g. in [14,11,12].

Computability
Type-2 Theory of Effectivity defines computability for functions between sets with cardinality of the continuum by introducing computability for functions on the Baire space Nω via Type-2 machines and by transferring this com- putability notion via representations. Briefly, a k-ary Type-2 machine M is a usual Turing machine with changed semantics. It has k input tapes, several work tapes, and an one-way output tape and is controlled by a finite flowchart. In each cell of these tapes, one symbol from our alphabet N is stored. The domain of the function ΓM :⊆ (Nω)k → Nω computed by M consists of those tuples p¯ ∈ (Nω)k for which M with input p¯ writes step by step infinitely many symbols onto the output tape, the corresponding sequence q is defined to be ΓM (p¯). Since M cannot change a symbol already written onto the output tape, each prefix of the output only depends on some prefixes of the inputs. This ﬁniteness property implies that ΓM is continuous w.r.t. the Baire space topology τNω .
Given representations δi :⊆ Nω → Xi, a function f : X1 × ... × Xk →


Xk+1 is called (δ1,... , δk+1)-computable iff there exists a Type-2 machine M
su ch that ΓM rea lizes f with respect to these representations, meaning that
dom(δk). Moreover, f is called (δ1,..., δk+1)-continuous iff there is a continu- ous function g realizing f w.r.t. δ1,..., δk+1. As computable functions on the Baire space are continuous, relative computability implies relative continuity. The property of admissibility is defined to reconcile relative continuity with mathematical continuity. We call δ :⊆ Nω → X an admissible representation of a topological space X = (X, τX) iff δ is continuous and for every continuous representation φ :⊆ Nω → X there is some continuous function g :⊆ Nω → Nω
with φ = δ ◦ g. From [9,10] we know
Proposition 2.1 Let δi be an admissible representation of a topological space Xi = (Xi, τXi ) for i = 1 ... k + 1. Then a function f : X1 × ... × Xk → Xk+1 is (δ1,... , δk+1)-continuous if and only if f is sequentially continuous (i.e., f maps convergent sequences to convergent sequences).

Time complexity of Type-2 machines
We assign to a k-ary Type-2 machine M a time complexity function TimeM :
dom(ΓM ) × N → N. For p¯ ∈ dom(ΓM ) and n ∈ N, TimeM (p¯, n) is de-
fined to be the number of steps which M on input p¯ executes until the prefix
ΓM (p¯)(0) ... ΓM (p¯)(n) is written onto the output tape 3 . We extend TimeM to a function of the type 2dom(ΓM ) × N → N ∪ {∞} defined by 4
TimeM (S, n) := sup TimeM (p¯, n) p¯ ∈ S}

for S ⊆ dom(ΓM ) and n ∈ N. For a function t : N → N, we say that M works on S in time t iff TimeM (S, m) ≤ t(m) holds for all m. For arbitrary subsets S such a time bound might not exist. However, compact subsets K ⊆ dom(ΓM ) satisfy TimeM (K, n) < ∞, since the function p¯ '→ TimeM (p¯, n) is continuous by the finiteness property and since continuous functions map compact sets to compacts sets (cf. [4]). Hence elements of a compact subset of dom(ΓM ) share a common time bound t : N → N.

3 To make good sense of it, reading as well as writing a symbol a of the infinite alphabet N has to cost lg(a) steps rather than one step, where lg(a) denotes the length of the binary notation of the number a.
4 For unbounded sets B ⊆ N let sup B := ∞.


Complexity w.r.t. proper and almost-compact representations
Let δ :⊆ Nω → X and γ :⊆ Nω → Y be admissible representations of topolog- ical spaces X and Y, let f : X → Y , t : N → N be functions, and let A ⊆ X. We say that f is (δ, γ)-computable in time t on A iff there is a Type-2 machine M such that ΓM realizes f w.r.t. δ and γ and M works on δ−1[A] in time t.
By the previous subsection, a time bound for A exists, if δ−1[A] is com- pact. By continuity of δ, compactness of δ−1[A] implies compactness of A (cf. [11,12]). A continuous representation such that the preimages of all compacts sets are compact is called proper. If δ is proper, then the time complexity of f can be estimated by a function T : K(X) × N → N, where K(X) denotes the set of compact subsets of X.
The signed-digit representation is an example of a proper admissible rep- resentation of the Euclidean space R = (R, τR), cf. [14]. It may be defined by QR(p) :=  i∈N νZ(p(i)) · 2−i for all p ∈ Nω such that (∀i ≥ 1) νZ(p(i)) ∈
{−1, 0, 1}, where νZ : N → Z is given by νZ(2n)= −n and νZ(2n + 1) = n + 1.
We are now interested in representations δ which allow to estimate com- plexity by natural number functions. This means that complexity is measured by a discrete parameter on the input (and, of course, by the output precision). Since the existence of a time bound is only guaranteed on compact name sets S ⊆ dom(δ), we have to require the domain of δ to be a countable union of compact sets. Moreover, it is reasonable to demand that it is possible to compute the index of (one of) the set(s) in which a given name p ∈ dom(δ) lies. Note that the situation in discrete complexity theory is similar: the set Σl of words of length l over a finite alphabet Σ is a compact subset of the set Σ∗ of all words, which is the countable union of the sets Σi. Furthermore, the length of a word can be computed.
These considerations motivates the following definition. We call δ an almost-compact representation iff there exists a computable 5 size function κδ : dom(δ) → Nk such that κ−1{(a1,... , ak)} is compact for every (a1,..., ak) ∈ Nk. In the presence of such a size function κδ, we say that f is (δ, γ)-compu- table in time T : Nk+1 → N in κδ iff there is a Type-2 machine M such that ΓM realizes f w.r.t. δ and γ and
TimeM κ−1{a1,... , ak}, n ≤ T (a1,... , ak, n)
holds for all a1,... , ak, n ∈ N. The signed-digit representation is an example of an almost-compact admissible representation: the corresponding size function κęR : dom(QR) → N can simply be defined by κęR (p) := νZ(p(0)) .
From [12] we obtain the following characterization theorem.

5 w.r.t. canonical representations of dom(δ) and Nk


Theorem 2.2 Let X be a sequential Hausdorff space.
The space X has a proper admissible representation if and only if X is separable metrizable.
The space X has an almost-compact admissible representation if and only if X is a direct limit (cf. Section 3) of compact metrizable spaces.

Inductive limits and Silva spaces
The spaces we will deal with in Section 4 are topologized by suitable inductive limit topologies. Given a sequence (Xm)m = (Xm, τm)m of Hausdorff spaces, its inductive limit L−−im→(Xm)m is defined to be the topological space having
m∈N Xm as its underlying set and

Lim (τm)m := O ⊆ 
m∈N
Xm (∀m ∈ N) O ∩ Xm ∈ τm}	(1)

as its topology.
Remark 3.1 Note that the inductive limit topology may equivalently be de- fined by the property of being the finest topology τ o n the set	m∈N Xm such
that all the inclusion mappings Xm ‹→	m∈N Xm,τ  are continuous.
If additionally for every a, b there is some c such that the spaces Xa and Xb are subspaces of Xc, then the inductive limit is called directed. From [9, Theorem 19] we obtain the following simple construction of an admissible representation of L−−im→(Xm)m.
Proposition 3.2 Let L−−im→(Xm)m be a directed limit of sequential Hausdorff spaces Xm, and let δm be an admissible representation of Xm for m ∈ N. Then the function δ :⊆ Nω →  m∈N Xm deﬁned by
δ(p) := x :⇐⇒ x ∈ Xp(0) ∧ δp(0)(p>0)= x
is an admissible representation of L−−im→(Xm)m.
In general, for non-directed inductive limits, the representation constructed in Proposition 3.2 fails to be admissible. For Silva spaces, however, one can show admissibility to hold even in the non-directed case. A Silva space (cf. [13], [3, Chapter 4.2.3]) is defined to be an inductive limit of a sequence of Banach spaces (complete normed vector spaces) (Xm)m such that for every
m there exists a continuous inclusion ιm+1 : Xm → Xm+1 which is compact,
mean ing that C}lsXm+1 ι	(Bm)
m
m+1	is compact in Xm+1, where Bm :=	x ∈
Xm  x m < 1 denotes the unit ball in Xm.



Compactness of the mappings ιm+1
allows us to interpret the inductive

limit topology of a Silva space in a different way suitable for our purposes:
Proposition 3.3 Let X = (X, τX) be a Silva space which is the inductive limit

of Banach spaces Xm = (Xm, .  m), with compact inclusions ιm+1
m+1
: X m →

Xm+1, m ∈ N. For every m, n ∈ N deﬁne Km,n := ClsXm+1 ιm	(n · Bm) .
The topological spaces Km,n := (Km,n, τX|Km,n ), m, n ∈ N, are compact, separable and metrizable.
The inductive limit topology of the Km,n, m, n ∈ N, coincides with the topology τX, i.e., X = L−−im→Km,n.
Proof. (i) is a well-known consequence from the theory of Silva spaces, it also follows from e.g. [6, Proposition 8.5.3].
To show (ii), denote the topology of L−−im→Km,n by τK. For every O ∈ τX and every m, n ∈ N, the set O ∩ Km,n is open in Km,n, thus according to Remark
, O is open in τK. This shows τX ⊆ τK.
For the opposite inclusion note that for every m, n ∈ N the inclusion (n·Bm, τXm |n·Bm ) ‹→ Km,n is continuous because so does the inclusion Xm ‹→ X. If then O ∈ τK, then the sets O ∩ Km,n, m, n ∈ N are open in Km,n, therefore the O ∩ n · Bm are open in τXm . Thus O ∩ Xm =  n∈N O ∩ n · Bm is open in Xm for every m ∈ N. With Remark 3.1 we get O ∈ τX. Thus τK ⊆ τX. 
From Proposition 3.3 and Theorem 2.2 we immediately get the
Theorem 3.4 Every Silva space has an almost-compact admissible represen- tation.
Examples of Silva spaces relevant to analysis are presented in Section 4. Note that an infinite dimensional Silva space can never be metrizable (cf. [3, Proposition 4.2.3.5]).

Examples
Polynomials
As a first simple example, we consider the set P of polynomials on the reals. A straightforward representation ψP of P can be constructed by using an
admissible representation of RN like 6 ☒∞ QR. We define ψP by
ψP(q)(x) := Σai · xi
i∈N

6 cf. [10, Section 4.1.4]; in [14, Definition 3.3.3] this representation is denoted by [QR]ω .



for all q ∈ dom(☒∞
QR) such that (ai)i := (☒∞
QR)(q) is an eventually

vanishing sequence. From [10, Proposition 4.1.6] it follows that ψP is an
admissible representation of a topological space XP which is isomorphic (via the obvious isomorphism) to the subspace of RN consisting of all eventually vanishing sequences.
It is easy to see that the evaluation function eval : P × R → R is not even (ψP, QR, QR)-continuous, because the names of ψP do not yield continuously accessible information about the degree of the encoded polynomial. This gives rise to the following representation QP which explicitly carries an upper bound of the degree of the polynomial. It is defined by
QP(q) := P :⇐⇒ ψP (q>0)= P ∧  ∀i > q(0) ai = 0 ,
where (ai)i := (☒∞ QR)(q>0). Clearly, eval is (QP, QR, QR)-computable. We
i=0
2

define nęP : dom(QP) → N
by nęP (q) :=
q(0), maxi≤q(0) |xi| , where xi is the

integer part of the i-th coefficient encoded in q>0. Since QR and thus (☒∞
QR)

are proper, n−1{(d, e)} is compact for all d, e ∈ N. Let Pm be the subspace of
XP consisting of all polynomials of degree at most m. The restriction δm of ψP to Pm is an admissible representation of Pm. Hence QP is an admissible representation of P := L−−im→Pm by being constructed as in Proposition 3.2.
In order to prove that P is not metrizable, we use the well-known and easily
provable fact that the convergence relation →Y of a first-countable topological space Y has the following property, which is often denoted by “(L4)”:
(L4) if (yi,j)j →Y xi for every i ∈ N and (xk)k →Y x∞, then there are functions
ϕ, ψ : N → N with (yϕ(n),ψ(n))n →Y x∞,
cf. [4, Ex. 1.7.18]. An example proving P to fail (L4) is provided by the sequences of polynomials (fi,j)i,j and (gk)k≤∞ defined by
fi,j(x) := 1/2j · xi + 1/2i , gi(x) := 1/2i and g∞(x) := 0 .
By Proposition 3.2, we have (∀i ∈ N) (fi,j)j →P gi and (gk)k →P g∞. Assume that there are functions ϕ, ψ : N → N with (fϕ(n),ψ(n))n →P g∞. Proposition
3.2 implies that on the one hand (ϕ(n))n is bounded and on the other hand the
sequence (1/2ϕ(n))n = (fϕ(n),ψ(n)(0))n converges to 0 = g∞(0), a contradiction. Therefore P does not satisfy Axiom (L4). Hence P is neither first-countable nor metrizable. We summarize these results:
Theorem 4.1 The space P of real polynomials has an almost-compact ad- missible representation and is not metrizable.
It is well-known that integer multiplication can be done in polynomial time. From this fact one can deduce that the evaluation function eval : P × R →


R is (QP, QR, QR)-computable in polynomial time in nęP , nęR and the output precision. More precisely, there is a Type-2 machine M and a polynomial T : N2 × N × N → N such that ΓM realizes eval w.r.t. QP and QR and
TimeM (q, v, n) ≤ T nę (q), nę (v), n 
holds for all q ∈ dom(QP), v ∈ dom(QR) and n ∈ N.
lp-spaces
F√orΣp ≥ 1, the vector space lp consists of all real sequences (ai)i with (ai)i  p :=


p
i∈N
|ai|p < ∞. An almost-compact admissible representation Qlp
:⊆ Nω →

lp can be constructed similar to QP by
Ql (q)= x :⇐⇒ (☒∞ QR)(q>0)= x ∧ q(0) ≥  x  p .
p	i=0
The size function nęÆp : dom(Qlp ) → N can be chosen as nęÆp (q) := q(0). An analogue representation has been investigated by V. Brattka in [2, Section 15]. We omit the proof that the final topology of Qlp is a vector space topology.
Real analytic functions on the unit interval
An important space of functions considered in functional analysis and numer- ical mathematics is the vector space A([0, 1]) of real analytic functions on the unit interval. It may be defined as those functions f : [0, 1] → R that for every x ∈ [0, 1] may be expanded into a Taylor series which is convergent in some complex neighbourhood of x.
The classical way to topologize the vector space A([0, 1]) is to identify its elements with the Silva space of those functions on the unit interval that have a unique holomorphic extension into some complex neighbourhood of [0, 1] (cf. [8]). We shortly recall this construction:
Consider some bounded domain U ⊆ C and denote by H∞(U ) the vec- tor space of continuous functions on the closure ClsC(U ) which are holo- morphic on U . By elementary facts from complex analysis, one can see that H∞(U ) is a closed subspace of the space of continuous functions on ClsC(U ), in particular it is a separable Banach space with respect to the norm  f  H∞(U ) := supz∈U |f (x)|.
Take now an arbitrary sequence (Um)m∈N of bounded domains in C such that we have Um ⊇ ClsC(Um+1), m ∈ N, and additionally  m∈N Um = [0, 1] and define for every m the Banach space Hm := (H∞(Um), τm), where τm is the norm topology on H∞(Um). This gives a sequence of linear, continuous

inclusions H
c2	c3
‹→ H ‹→
c4
H  ‹→
.. ., where the ιm+1 : H	→ H 
, m ∈ N, are

1	2	3
m	m	m+1


defined as restrictions, i.e. f '→ f |ClsC(Um+1). (Note that we can interpret the ιm+1 as inclusions as their the injectivity follows from the identity theorem for holomorphic functions).
Also with the identity theorem we can for every m ∈ N interpret the mapping ιm : H∞(Um) → A([0, 1]), f '→ f |[0,1] as an inclusion, which gives us the canonical identification A([0, 1]) = m∈N H∞(Um). This also yields a standard way to topologize the space A([0, 1]):
Definition 4.2 Define the topological space A as the inductive limit
(A([0, 1]), τA) := L−−im→(Hm)m.
Every real analytic function is thus interpreted as a holomorphic function in some neighbourhood of [0, 1]. If the neighbourhoods (Um)m are chosen in a suitable way, the index m ∈ N for which f ∈ H∞(Um) gives information on the radius of convergence of the Taylor series expansions of f . The open (resp. closed) sets in A are those subsets O ⊆ A([0, 1]) for which the intersection with every space Hm, m ∈ N, is open (resp. closed).
Note that as the spaces Hm are closed subspaces of spaces of continuous functions on compact sets, the theorem of Arzela-Ascoli is applicable and im- mediately yields the fact that the closed unit ball in Hm is relatively compact when restricted to the smaller set Um+1. Using Theorem 3.4 we have the
Theorem 4.3 The space A is a Silva space and thus has an almost-compact admissible representation.
We wish to describe an almost-compact admissible representation of A in some more detail. Define analogously to Proposition 3.3 for every m, n ∈ N the set Km,n := ClsA(n · Bm), where Bm is the unit ball in Hm, and the compact metrizable space Km,n := (Km,n, τA|Km,n ). By Theorem 2.2(i), for every m, n ∈ N there is an admissible representation δm,n :⊆ Nω → Km,n with compact domain. Using Proposition 3.2, we get the
Proposition 4.4 Deﬁne δA :⊆ Nω → A by
δA(p) := f :⇐⇒ f ∈ Kp(0),p(1) ∧ δp(0),p(1)(p>1)= f.
Then δA is an admissible almost-compact representation of A.
Proof. From Proposition 3.2 we get admissibility and for the computable

function nδA
: dom(δA) → N2 defined by nδ
(p) := (p(0), p(1)) the preimages

n−1(m, n)= δ−1 (Km,n), m, n ∈ N, are compact.	 
δA	m,n
Remark 4.5 We do not exactly specify the neighbourhoods Um and the rep- resentations δm,n, as their choice will depend heavily on the application. For


the δm,n one can e.g. take a proper admissible representation δ of the Banach space C([0, 1]) of continuous functions on [0, 1] and take as δm,n the restric- tion of δ to the sets Km,n (note that the inclusion of A into C([0, 1]) with its standard topology is continuous, thus the Km,n, m, n ∈ N, are compact in this space and have compact preimages under δ).

Distributions with compact support
A very important space in distribution theory is the space of distributions over R with compact support. Recall that the support of a distribution T over R is the set of those x ∈ R such that for every neighbourhood U of x there exists a test function ϕ with supp(ϕ) ⊆ U and T (ϕ) /= 0. 7
A very classical fact is that this space may be identified with the dual space 8 E' of the space E of infinitely differentiable functions on R (see e.g. [5, Theorem 2.3.1]).
We shortly describe the spaces E and E' and show the existence of an almost-compact admissible representation of E' under a suitable topology.
Consider the vector space C∞(R) of infinitel y differentiable f}unctions on
R with the semi-norms f  k,m := sup |f (j)(x)| |x| ≤ m, j ≤ k , m, k ∈ N.

With the metric defined by d(f, g) := Σ∞
2−(k+m) ·   f−g k,m  , this space
k,m

is a complete and separable metric space, classically denoted by E. A basis of
the neighbourhood filter of zero in E is given by the sets
Uk,m,n := f ∈ C∞(R)  f  k,m ≤ 1/(n + 1)}, k, m,n ∈ N.	(2)
The standard vector space topology on the dual E ' is given by the topology τpc of “precompact convergence” for which a basis of the neighbourhood filter of zero is given by the sets
VK,ε :=  y ∈ E'	sup |y(x)| ≤ ε} ,	ε > 0, K relatively compact in E .
x∈K

We will denote by E' also the dual of E equipped with this topology.
With the zero neighbourhoods Uk,m,n of E as in (2), we define the polar sets

o k,m,n
:= T ∈ E'	sup
f ∈Uk,m,n
|T (f )| ≤ 1} .



7 The space of test functions is defined as those ϕ ∈ C∞(R) such that its support, defined as supp(ϕ) := ClsR ({y|ϕ(y) /= 0}), is compact.
8 The dual space X′ of a topological vector space X is the vector space of continuous linear
functionals on X.



The properties of the Uo
needed in our context are well-known facts from

the theory of locally convex spaces. They are summarized in the following
Proposition 4.6

For every k, m, n ∈ N the set Uo
is a compact, separable and metrizable

subset of E'.
For every k, m, n ∈ N the linear span [Uo

] of Uo
 k,m,n

is a Banach space

with respect to the norm T	o
k,m,n
:= inf{λ > 0 T ∈ λ · Uo
} and the

embeddings ([Uo
],  ·	o
k,m,n
) ‹→ E' are continuous.

With Uk := ([Uo
],	·	o
k,k,k
), k ∈ N, we have E' = L−−im→Uk as a Silva

space.
Proof. Compactness is the well-known theorem of Alaoglou-Bourbaki (see e.g. [6, Theorem 8.5.2]) and the other assertions in (i) follow from standard duality theory (e.g. [6, Chapter 8.5]). (ii) and (iii) are folklore from the theory of locally convex spaces.	 
Theorem 3.4 and Proposition 4.6 yield
Theorem 4.7 The space E has an almost-compact admissible representation.
Using the Uo	, k, m, n ∈ N, we can construct an almost-compact admis-
sible representation δE' as in Proposition 4.4:
Proposition 4.8 Let δk,m,n be an admissible representation with compact do-

main of the compact metrizable space (Uo
, τ | o k,m,n
). Then the representa-

tion δE' :⊆ Nω → E' deﬁned by


δE' (p)= T :⇐⇒ T ∈ Up(0),p(1),p(2) ∧ δp(0),p(1),p(2)(p>2
is an almost-compact admissible representation of E '.
)= T

The representation δE' carries as the prefixes of a name of a distribution T

the indices k, m, n of the corresponding compact set Uo
. We can interpret

this prefix as follows: If a distribution T is contained in the set Uo
, then

}	k,m,n
we have |T (ϕ)| ≤ n · sup |ϕ(j)(x)|  j ≤ k, |x| ≤ m	for all test functions ϕ,
thus T is of order 9 at most k with support contained in the interval [−m, m].
From [5, Theorem 2.3.10] we get that a distribution with order k and

supp(T ) ⊆ [−m, m] is contained in some Uo
and can be extended to a



9 The order of a distribution T is the smallest k ∈ N∪{∞} such that there exist a compact
K and a constant C > 0 such that |T (ϕ)| ≤ C · sup |ϕ(j)(x)|  j ≤ k, x ∈ K} for all test
functions ϕ.


continuous linear functional on the space Ck(R) of k-times differentiable func- tions. Then n gives a bound for the operator norm of T in that dual space.
Thus our almost-compact admissible representation δE' has as prefixes of a name of a distribution T bounds for the order of T , for the support of T and for the norm of T viewed as a continuous linear functional on Ck(R).
