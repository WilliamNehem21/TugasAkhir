Abstract
Tuza (1981) conjectured that the cardinality τ (G) of a minimum set of edges that intersects every triangle of a graph G is at most twice the cardinality ν(G) of a maximum set of edge-disjoint triangles of G. In this paper we present three results regarding Tuza’s Conjecture. We verify it for graphs with treewidth
at most 6; and we show that τ (G) ≤ 3 ν(G) for every planar triangulation G different from K4; and that
τ (G) ≤ 9 ν(G)+ 1 if G is a maximal graph with treewidth 3.

Introduction
In this paper, we use the term graph to refer to a simple graph and the term multigraph to refer to a graph that might contain parallel edges. Other than this, the notation and terminology are standard. A triangle transversal of a graph G is a set of edges of G whose removal results in a triangle-free graph; and a triangle packing of G is a set of edge-disjoint triangles of G. We denote by τ (G) (resp. ν(G))

the cardinality of a minimum triangle transversal (resp. maximum triangle packing) of G. Tuza [14] posed the following conjecture.
Conjecture 1.1 (Tuza, 1981) For every graph G, we have τ (G) ≤ 2 ν(G).
This conjecture was verified for many classes of graphs. In particular, Tuza [15] verified it for planar graphs, and Haxell and Kohayakawa [9] proved that if G is a tripartite graph, then τ (G) ≤ 1.956 ν(G). The reader may refer to [1,5,6,8,10,11] for more results concerning Tuza’s Conjecture. In this paper we present three results regarding Tuza’s Conjecture. We verify it for graphs with treewidth at most 6; and we show that τ (G) ≤ 3 ν(G) for every planar triangulation G different from K4; and that τ (G) ≤ 9 ν(G) if G is a 3-tree, i.e., a graph obtained from K3 by successively choosing a triangle in the graph and adding a new vertex adjacent to its three vertices.
Puleo [13] introduced a set of tools for dealing with graphs that contain vertices of small degree (Lemma 3.3), and verified Tuza’s Conjecture for graphs with maxi- mum average degree less than 7, i.e., for graphs in which every subgraph has average degree less than 7. In this paper, we extend Puleo’s technique (Lemma 3.4) in order to prove Tuza’s Conjecture for graphs with treewidth at most 6 (Theorem 3.5). Note that there are graphs with treewidth at most 6 and maximum average degree at least 7 (Figure 1).

In another direction, as suggested in [9], we show that, for certain classes of graphs, the ratio τ (G)/ν(G) can be bounded by a constant smaller than 2. Specifically, we show that, if G is a planar triangulation different from K4, then τ (G) ≤ 3 ν(G) (Theorem 4.5) and, if G is a 3-tree, then τ (G) ≤ 9 ν(G)+ 1 (Theo-

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we establish the notation and present some auxiliary results used throughout the paper. In Section 3, we verify Tuza’s Conjecture for graphs with treewidth at most 6 and, in Sections 4 and 5, we study planar triangulations and 3-trees, respectively. Finally, in Section 6 we present some concluding remarks. Due to space limitations, we present only the sketch of some proofs.
Rooted tree decompositions
In this section we present most of the notation and some auxiliary results regarding tree decompositions. A rooted tree is a pair (T, r), where T is a tree and r is a

node of T . Given t ∈ V (T ), if tj is a node in the (unique) path in T that joins r and t, then we say that tj is an ancestor of t. Every vertex in T that has t as its ancestor is called a descendant of t. If t /= r, then the parent of t, denoted by p(t), is the ancestor of t that is adjacent to t. The successors of t are the nodes whose parent is t, and we denote the set of successors of t by ST (t). A node of T with no successor is a leaf of T . The height of t, denoted by hT (t), is the number of edges of a longest path that joins t to a descendant of t. When T is clear from the context, we simply write S(t) and h(t).
Definition 2.1 A tree decomposition of a graph G is a pair D = (T, V) consisting of a tree T and a collection V = {Vt ⊆ V (G) : t ∈ V (T )}, satisfying the following conditions:
{Vt : t ∈ V (T )} = V (G);
for every uv ∈ E(G), there exists a t ∈ V (T ) such that u, v ∈ Vt;
if a vertex v is in Vt1 ∩ Vt2 , then v ∈ Vt for every t in the path of T that joins
t1 and t2.
The width of D is the number max{|Vt|− 1 : t ∈ V (T )}, and the treewidth tw(G) of G is the width of a tree decomposition of G with minimum width. Let G be a graph with treewidth k. If |Vt| = k +1 for every t ∈ V (T ), and |Vt ∩ Vt′ | = k for every ttj ∈ E(T ), then we say that (T, V) is a full tree decomposition of G.
The following result was proved by Bodlaender [2] (see also Gross [7]).
Proposition 2.2 Every graph admits a full tree decomposition.

A triple (V,T, r) is a rooted tree decomposition of a graph G if (V,T ) is a full tree decomposition of G, (T, r) is a rooted tree, and Vt ∩ Vp(t) /= Vt ∩ Vt′ for ev- ery t ∈ V (T ) \ {r} and tj ∈ S(t). Every full tree decomposition can be modified into a rooted tree decomposition with a root r. So the following proposition comes naturally.
Proposition 2.3 Every graph admits a rooted tree decomposition.
Given a rooted tree decomposition (V,T, r) of a graph G and a node t ∈ V (T ) \
{r}, we say that the (unique) vertex in Vt \ Vp(t) is the representative of t. We leave undefined the representative of r.
We denote by NG(u) the set of neighbors of u for a vertex u ∈ V (G). When G is clear from the context, we simply write N (u). In what follows, we denote by N [u] the closed neighborhood N (u) ∪ {u} of u, by d(u) the degree of u, and by Δ(G) the maximum degree of G.
Remark 2.4 If y is the representative of a leaf t of a rooted tree decomposition of a graph G, then NG(y) ⊆ Vt.

Graphs with treewidth at most 6
In this section, we verify Tuza’s Conjecture for graphs with treewidth at most 6 by extending the technique introduced by Puleo [13], which explores the neighborhood of vertices of small degree in order to decrease the size of the graph studied. For that, we use the following definitions (see also [13]).
Definition 3.1 For a graph G, a nonempty set V0 ⊆ V (G) is called reducible if there is a set X ⊆ E(G) and a set Y of edge-disjoint triangles in G such that the following conditions hold:
|X|≤ 2|Y |;
X ∩ E(A) /= ∅ for every triangle A in G that contains a vertex of V0; and
if u, v ∈/ V0 and uv ∈ E(A) for some A ∈ Y , then uv ∈ X.
In this case, we say that (V0, X,Y ) isa reducing triple for G. If G has no reducible set, G is called irreducible.
The following lemma comes naturally (see [13, Lemma 2.2]).
Lemma 3.2 Let (V0, X,Y ) be a reducing triple for a graph G, and put Gj = (G −
− V0. If τ (Gj) ≤ 2 ν(Gj), then τ (G) ≤ 2 ν(G).
We say that a graph G is robust if, for every v ∈ V (G), each component of G[N (v)] has order at least 5. We often use the following result (see [13, Lemma 2.7]).
Lemma 3.3 Let G be an irreducible robust graph and let x, y ∈ V (G). The follow- ing statements hold:

if d(x) ≤ 6, then Δ(G[N (x)]) ≤ 1 and |E(G[N (x)])| /= 2;
if d(x) ≤ 6 and d(y) ≤ 6 then xy ∈/ E(G);
if d(x)=7 and d(y)=6 then N [y] /⊆ N [x]; and
if d(x) ≤ 8 and d(y)= 5, then N [y] /⊆ N [x].
We extend the result above in the following lemma.
Lemma 3.4 Let G be an irreducible robust graph and let x, y ∈ V (G). If d(x), d(y) ≤ 6 and |N (x) ∪ N (y)|≤ 7, then (i) d(x)= d(y)= 5; (ii) |N (x) ∩ N (y)| = 3; and (iii) G[N (x)]  G[N (y)]  K5.
Proof The proof consists of the analysis of a series of cases. In each of these cases, we find a reducing triple for G, which contradicts the irreducibility of G. In this extended abstract, we present only the proof of (i).
By Lemma 3.3(b), we have that xy ∈/ E(G). Assume, without loss of generality, that d(x) ≥ d(y). Because G is robust, d(y) ≥ 5. For a contradiction, suppose that d(x) = 6, and let N (x)= {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6}. In what follows, we analyze the case in which d(x)= d(y) = 6; the case in which d(x) = 6 and d(y) = 5 is similar.

Figure 2. Illustrations for the proof of Lemma 3.4. The triangles in Y containing x and y are illustrated, respectively, in blue and green, while the triangles in Y containing neither x nor y are illustrated in red. Dashed edges illustrate edges that may not exist.

Because |N (x) ∪ N (y)| ≤ 7, we may assume that N (y) ⊇ {v2, v3, v4, v5, v6}. By Lemma 3.3(a), without loss of generality, we may assume that E(G[N (x)]) ⊆
{v1v4, v2v5, v3v6}.
Case 1. N (y)= N (x).
Let	X	=	E(G[{v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6}])	and	Y	=
{v1v3v5, v2v4v6, xv1v2, yv2v3, xv3v4, yv4v5, xv5v6, yv1v6}. Then |X| ≤ 15 ≤ 16 = 2|Y | and ({x, y}, X,Y ) is a reducing triple for G (Figure 2(a)), a contradiction.
Case 2. N (y) /= N (x).
Then N (y)= {v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7} for some v7 ∈ V (G) \{v1}. By Lemma 3.3(a), without loss of generality, we may assume that E(G[N (y)]) ⊆ {v2v5, v3v6, v4v7}. Let H = G[{v2, v3, v4, v5, v6}]. We have three cases.
Subcase 2.1. |E(H)| = 0.
Let   X	=	{xv1, yv7}  ∪  E(H)   and   Y	=
{v2v4v6, v3v4v5, xv2v3, xv5v6, yv2v5, yv3v6}.	Therefore
|X| =2 + |E(H)| = 12= 2|Y | and ({x, y}, X,Y ) is a reducing triple for G
(Figure 2(b)), a contradiction.
Subcase 2.2. |E(H)| = 1.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that v2v5 ∈ E(H).  Let X = {xv1, yv7, v3v7}∪ E(H) and Y = {v2v4v6, v3v4v5, xv2v3, xv5v6, yv2v5, yv3v7}. Hence |X| = 3 + |E(H)| = 12 = 2|Y | and ({x, y}, X,Y ) is a reducing triple for G (Figure 2(c)), a contradiction.
Subcase 2.3. E(H)= {v2v5, v3v6}.
Let X = {xv1, yv7}∪ E(H) and Y  = {v2v4v6, xv2v3, yv3v4, xv4v5, yv5v6}. So
|X| = 2 + |E(H)| = 10 = 2|Y | and ({x, y}, X,Y ) is a reducing triple for G (Fig- ure 2(d)), a contradiction.	2
Using Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4, we verify Tuza’s Conjecture for graphs with treewidth at most 6.
Theorem 3.5 If G is a graph with treewidth at most 6, then τ (G) ≤ 2 ν(G).
Proof Suppose, for a contradiction, that the statement does not hold, and let G be a graph with treewidth at most 6 and τ (G) > 2 ν(G), that minimizes |V (G)|. We claim that G is irreducible. Indeed, suppose that G has a reducing triple (V0, X,Y ), and let Gj = (G−X)−V0. Note that Gj has treewidth at most 6, and τ (Gj) ≤ 2 ν(Gj) by the minimality of G. By Lemma 3.2, τ (G) ≤ 2 ν(G), a contradiction. One can check that G is robust by deriving a contradiction to the minimality of G if there is

a vertex v for which G[N (v)] contains a component with at most four vertices. So
G is irreducible and robust.
Suppose that |V (G)| ≤ 7. Then Δ(G) ≤ 6, and E(G) = ∅ by Lemma 3.3(b). Hence τ (G) ≤ 2 ν(G), a contradiction.  Therefore |V (G)| ≥ 8.  By Proposi- tion 2.3, G has a rooted tree decomposition (T, V, r). Because |V (G)| ≥ 8, we have that |V (T )| > 1, and hence there is a node t ∈ V (T ) with h(t)= 1. If t /= r, let vt be the representative of t; otherwise, let vt be an arbitrary vertex of Vt.
First, suppose that S(t)= {tj} and let x be the representative of tj. We have that d(x) ∈ {5, 6} by Remark 2.4 and because G is robust.  Re- mark 2.4 applied to G − x and t implies that NG—x(vt) ⊆ Vt, there- fore d(vt)= |N (vt)|≤ |NG—x(vt)| +1 ≤ |Vt|≤ 7. If d(vt) = 7, then vt must be adjacent to x and every vertex in Vt \ {vt}. Because Vt′ ⊆ Vt ∪ {x}, we have that N [x] ⊆ N [vt], a contradiction either to Lemma 3.3(c) or to Lemma 3.3(d). So d(vt) ≤ 6 and, by Lemma 3.3(b), vtx ∈/ E(G). Thus N (x) ∪ N (vt) ⊆ Vt \ {vt}, and hence |N (x)∪N (vt)|≤ |Vt|−1 ≤ 6. On the other hand, Lemma 3.4 implies that d(x)= d(vt)=5 and |N (x) ∩ N (vt)| = 3, which implies that |N (x) ∪ N (vt)| = 7, a contradiction.
Therefore |S(t)|  >  1.  Now suppose that |S(t)|≥ 3, and let t1, t2, t3 ∈ S(t).  Let zi be the representative of ti for i  = 1, 2, 3.  By Re- mark 2.4, |N (zi) ∪ N (zj)|≤ |Vt| = 7, for i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3} and i /= j. Thus, by Lemma 3.4, d(zi)=5 and G[N (zi)]  K5 for every i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, and |N (zi) ∩ N (zj)| = 3, for i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3} and i /= j. Let N (z1) = {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5}. Be- cause |N (z1) ∩N (z2)| = 3, we may assume, without loss of generality, that N (z2)= 
{v3, v4, v5, v6, v7}. It is not hard to check that N (z3) contains exactly one vertex in N (z1) ∩ N (z2), because |N (z1) ∩ N (z3)| = |N (z2) ∩ N (z3)| = 3 and |N (z3)| = 5. So we may assume, without loss of generality, that N (z3) = {v1, v2, v3, v6, v7}. Let H = G[{v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7}] and note that every pair of vertices of H is contained in at least one N (zi) for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Thus, since G[N (zi)]  K5 for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, we have H  K7. Let X = E(H) and note that |X| = 21. Put


and
Y1 = {z1v1v4, z1v2v5, z2v3v4, z2v5v6, z3v1v6, z3v2v3}

Y2 = {v1v2v7, v2v4v6, v3v6v7, v4v5v7, v1v3v5},

and Y = Y1 ∪ Y2. Note that |Y | = 11 and thus |X|≤ 2|Y |, hence ({z1, z2, z3}, X,Y ) is a reducing triple for G (Figure 3), a contradiction. We conclude that |S(t)| = 2. Let t1, t2 ∈ S(t) and let x, y be the representatives of t1, t2, respectively. Again, d(x)= d(y)= 5, |N (x) ∩ N (y)| = 3, and G[N (x)], G[N (y)]  K5 by Remark 2.4 and Lemma 3.4. Hence Vt ⊆ N (x) ∪ N (y). Note that t is a leaf of (T j, Vj, r),
where T j = T − t1 − t2 and Vj = V\ {Vt1 , Vt2 }. Therefore dG—x—y(vt) ≤ 6 by Re- mark 2.4, and dG(vt) ≤ 8. Note that vt ∈ N (x) ∪ N (y). Without loss of generality, assume that vt ∈ N (x). As G[N (x)] is a complete graph, N [x] ⊆ N [vt], a contra- diction to Lemma 3.3(d). This concludes the proof.	2
Because a K8-free chordal graph has treewidth at most 6, Theorem 3.5 general-

izes a result of Tuza regarding chordal graphs [15, Proposition 3].
Corollary 3.6 If G is a K8-free chordal graph, then τ (G) ≤ 2 ν(G).
Planar triangulations
All new definitions in this section are taken from the book of Bondy and Murty [3, Chapter 10]. A graph is planar if it can be drawn in the plane so that its edges intersect only at their ends. We refer to such a drawing of a planar graph as a plane graph. A plane graph partitions the plane into arcwise-connected open sets, which we call faces. The boundary of a face f in a plane graph is the boundary of the open set f in the usual topological sense. Two faces are adjacent if their boundaries have an edge in common. The dual graph G∗ of a given plane graph G is the multigraph whose vertex set is the set of faces of G, and in which two vertices are joined by k edges if the boundaries of the corresponding faces have k edges in common. Note that if G∗ has a bridge, then G contains a loop. Therefore, the dual of a simple plane graph has no bridges. A simple connected plane graph in which all faces have three edges is called a plane triangulation. A planar triangulation is a graph which admits a plane triangulation. It is not hard to check that a simple connected plane graph is a triangulation if and only if its dual is a bridgeless cubic multigraph. Moreover, the dual of a triangulation has parallel edges only if the triangulation is a single triangle. Also, every planar triangulation has a unique plane triangulation, thus we will refer to its faces and its dual. A facial triangle in a plane graph is a triangle that is the boundary of one of its faces.
In this section, we prove that τ (G)/ν(G) ≤ 3/2 for every planar triangulation G different from K4. It is not hard to check that if G = K5 −e, then τ (G)/ν(G)= 3/2. Therefore, this bound is tight. If G is a triangle, then τ (G)= ν(G) = 1. So we may assume that G is not K3. The proof is divided in two parts. In Lemma 4.2, we give an upper bound for τ (G) and, in Lemma 4.4, we give a lower bound for ν(G). For the proof of Lemma 4.2, we need the following theorem of Petersen (see [12]).
Theorem 4.1 (Petersen, 1981) Every bridgeless cubic graph contains a perfect matching.
Lemma 4.2 If G is a planar graph, then τ (G) ≤ n − 2.

Figure 3. Illustration for the proof of Theorem 3.5. The triangles in Y1 containing z1, z2, and z3 are illustrated, respectively, in blue (dotted), green (dashed), and cyan (dash-dotted), while the triangles in Y2 are illustrated in red (solid).

Proof We may assume n ≥ 4. Let H be a maximal plane graph containing G and note that τ (G) ≤ τ (H). By Euler’s formula, H has 2n − 4 faces. Because H is a plane triangulation, H∗ is a bridgeless cubic graph on 2n − 4 vertices. Thus, by Theorem 4.1, H∗ contains a perfect matching M∗. Let M be the edges of H corresponding to the edges in M∗. Note that |M| = |M∗| = n − 2. Since H∗ − M∗ contains only vertices with even degree, H − M is a bipartite graph. Therefore H − M has no triangles, and hence τ (H) ≤ |M| = n − 2.	2
To prove a lower bound on ν(G), we use the well-known Brook’s Theorem (see [4]). The chromatic number of a graph G is denoted by χ(G).
Theorem 4.3 (Brooks, 1941) If G is a connected graph, then χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) or
G is either an odd cycle or a complete graph.
Lemma 4.4 If G is a planar triangulation different from K4, then ν(G) ≥ 2 (n−2).
Proof We may assume G /= K3. The dual G∗ of G is a cubic graph different from K . By Theorem 4.3, there is an independent set Y ∗ of G∗ with at least |V (G∗ )|
4	3
vertices. Let Y be the facial triangles of G corresponding to the vertices in Y ∗.
As Y ∗ is an independent set in G∗, Y is a triangle packing in G. Thus ν(G) ≥
|Y | = |Y ∗|≥ |V (G∗ )| = 2 (n − 2).	2
3	3
The main result of this section comes directly from Lemmas 4.2 and 4.4.
Theorem 4.5 If G is a planar triangulation different from K4, then τ (G) ≤
3 ν(G).
We were also able to obtain the following slightly stronger version of Lemma 4.4 for a (finite) class of planar 3-trees. This result will be used in the next section. Given a copy H of K4 in a planar 3-tree G, we denote by g(H) the pair (i, j) where i (resp. j) is the maximum (resp. minimum) number of vertices of G inside a face of H. We say that a planar 3-tree G is restricted if G contains a copy H of K4 such that g(H)= (2, 0). In this case, we always consider the face of H with no vertices of G inside as the external face of G, that is, the vertices of G not in H are drawn in the internal faces of H. If, additionally, H has two faces with precisely one vertex of G inside, then we say that G is super restricted.
Proposition 4.6 If G is a restricted (resp. super restricted) planar 3-tree with f faces, then there is a triangle packing P of facial triangles of G containing the external face, and such that |P|≥ [f /3| (resp. |P| = 5).
Proof Let v∗ be the vertex of G∗ corresponding to the external face of G, and let Gj = G∗ − N [v∗]. Since G∗ is a cubic graph, Gj / K4. By Theorem 4.3, Gj contains an independent set Ij with [(f−4)/3| vertices, and hence the set P of facial triangles of G corresponding to the vertices in Ij ∪{v∗} is a triangle packing of facial triangles of G containing the external face, and such that |P|≥ [(f − 4)/3| + 1. Hence, if f − 1 /≡ 0 (mod 3), then [(f − 4)/3| +1 = [f/3|, and P is the desired triangle packing. Thus we may assume that f − 1 ≡ 0 (mod 3) and, because G is restricted, G is one of the ten first graphs in Figure 4, which have either 10 faces

and at least 4 independent faces (counting the external face), or 16 faces and at least 6 independent faces (counting the external face). If G is super restricted, then G is one of the two last graphs in Figure 4.	2

Figure 4. All 10 restricted planar 3-trees with f ≡ 1 (mod 3) faces and the two super restricted ones.
In the full version of the paper, we show that Proposition 4.6 cannot be extended for general planar 3-trees.


3-Trees
In this section, we prove that τ (G) ≤ 9 ν(G) + 1

for every 3-tree G.	Given

5	5
a graph G, a transversal X and a triangle packing Y  of G, we say that the
pair (X, Y ) is a 9 -TP of G if |X| ≤ 9 |Y | + 1 .	Note that if G has a 9 -TP,
5	5	5	5
then τ (G) ≤ 9 ν(G)+ 1 . Let (T, V, r) be a rooted tree decomposition of a graph
5	5
G. Given a node t ∈ V (T ) \ {r}, we denote by R(t) the set of all representatives
of all descendants of t. Note that the representative of t is also in R(t). Re- call that S(t) is the set of successors of t. For every triple of vertices Δ ⊆ Vt, let SΔ(t)= {tj ∈ S(t): Vt′ ∩ Vt = Δ}. When t is clear from the context, we simply write SΔ.
Our proof relies on the analysis of nodes with small height, which guarantees that a minimal counterexample has a particular configuration. For nodes with height 1 we present the following lemma.
Lemma 5.1 Let G be a 3-tree such that τ (G) > 9 ν(G)+ 1 , and G is minimal over
5	5
all such graphs. Let (T, V, r) be a rooted tree decomposition of G of width 3, and
let t ∈ V (T ) \ {r}. If h(t)= 1, then |S(t)| = 1.
Proof Let Vt = {a, b, c, d}. Suppose, for a contradiction, that |S(t)| > 1. Without loss of generality, assume that Vt ∩ Vp(t) = {b, c, d}. Let S(t) = {t1, t2,..., tk}. For every i ∈ [k], let vi be the representative of ti. Since h(t) = 1, at least one of Δ in {abc, abd, acd} is such that SΔ /= ∅. Suppose that exactly one triangle Δ in {abc, abd, acd}, say Δ = abc, is such that SΔ /= ∅. Let Gj = G − R(t). Note that Gj is a 3-tree. By the minimality of G, there exists a 9 -TP of Gj, say (Xj,Y j). Thus, (Xj ∪ {ab, bc, ac},Y j ∪ {acv1, abv2}) is a 9 -TP of G, a contradiction. In-

deed, τ (G) ≤ τ (Gj)+3 ≤ 9 ν(Gj)+ 16 ≤ 9 (ν(G) − 2) + 16 ≤ 9 ν(G)+ 1
(Fig-

ure 5(a)). Thus, we may assume that at most one triangle Δ in {abc, abd, acd} is
such that SΔ = ∅. Suppose that |S(t)| = 2 and assume, without loss of generality, that t1 ∈ Sabc and t2 ∈ Sabd. Let Gj = G − R(t). Again Gj is a 3-tree. By the min- imality of G, there exists a 9 -TP of Gj, say (Xj,Y j). Let e ∈ Xj ∩ E(bcd). Without loss of generality, we have two cases. If e = bc, then we let X = Xj ∪ {ad, av1, bv2}. If e = cd, then we let X = Xj ∪ {ab, cv1, dv2}. In both cases, (X, Y j ∪ {acv1, abv2}) is a 9 -TP of G, a contradiction (Figure 5(b)). Finally suppose that |S(t)| ≥ 3.

Without loss of generality, assume that either t1 ∈ Sabc and t2, t3 ∈ Sabd, or t1 ∈ Sabc, t2 ∈ Sabd, and t3 ∈ Sacd.  Let Gj = G − R(t).  By the minimal- ity of G, there exists a 9 -TP of Gj, say (Xj,Y j). Note that E(bcd) ∩ Xj /= ∅. Hence (Xj ∪ {ab, bc, cd, ac, bd, ad},Y j ∪ {acv1, abv2 adv3}) isa 9 -TP of G,a contra- diction (Figure 5(c)). This concludes the proof.	2

In what follows, we prove the main theorem of this section.
Theorem 5.2 If G is a 3-tree, then τ (G) ≤ 9 ν(G)+ 1 .
5	5
Proof Suppose, for a contradiction, that the statement does not hold. Let G be a minimal counterexample over all 3-trees with τ (G) > 9 ν(G)+ 1 .  We claim
5	5
that if (T, V, r) is a rooted tree decomposition of G of width 3, then |V (T )| ≥ 4.
Indeed, if |V (T )| = 1, then |V (G)| = 4, τ (G) = 2, and ν(G) = 1. If |V (T )| = 2, then |V (G)| = 5, τ (G) = 3, and ν(G) = 2. If |V (T )| = 3, then |V (G)| = 6, τ (G) ≤ 4, and ν(G) = 3. In each case, we contradict τ (G) > 9 ν(G)+ 1 . Due to
5	5
space limitations, we omit the proof of the next claim.
Claim 5.3 There exists a rooted tree decomposition (T, V, r) of G of width 3 with a node t ∈ V (T ) \ {r} such that h(t)= 2.
Let (T, V, r) be a rooted tree decomposition of G given by Claim 5.3, and let t be a node in T with h(t) = 2. Let L = {l1,..., lm} be the set of successors of t that are leaves, and let Q = S(t) \ L = {q1,..., qk}. For every i ∈ [m], let ui be the representative of li. By Lemma 5.1, |S(qi)| =1 for every i ∈ [k]. For every such i, let S(qi)= {qj}, and let vi be the representative of qi and vj be the representative
i	i
of qj (Figure 6). Let Qj = {qj ,..., qj }. Let Vt = {a, b, c, d} and assume, without

loss of generality, that Vt ∩ Vp(t) = {b, c, d}.

Claim 5.4 Let Δ be a triple of vertices in Vt with Δ /= bcd. Then (i) |SΔ(t)|≤ 2; and (ii) either SΔ(t) ∩ L = ∅ or SΔ(t) ∩ Q = ∅.

Proof Due to space limitations, we omit the proof of (i). For (ii), suppose, for a

contradiction, that Δ = abd and l1, q1 ∈ SΔ(t). Say Vq
∩ V ′

= {x0, x1, v1} and

let Gj = G−vj . Since G is minimal, there exists a 9 -TP, say (Xj,Y j), of Gj. Without
1	5
loss of generality, assume that yyj ∈ Xj ∩ E(x0x1v1), let z ∈ {x0, x1, v1}\ {y, yj},
and let X = Xj ∪ {zvj }. Note that X is a transversal of G. Suppose wwj ∈
E(x0x1v1) \ E(Y j). Hence (X, Y j ∪{wwjvj }) isa 9 -TP of G, a contradiction. Thus,
1	5
every edge of x0x1v1 is in E(Y j). Since dG′ (v1) = 3, we must have x0x1v1 ∈
Y j and let x2v1 ∈/ E(Y j).  Suppose that both x0u1 and x1u1 are not in E(Y j).
Then (X, Y j \ {x0x1v1}∪ {x0v1vj , x0x1u1}) is a 9 -TP of G, a contradiction. So at
1	5
least one between x0u1 and x1u1, say x0u1, is in E(Y j). Since dG′ (u1) = 3 and
x0x1v1 ∈ Y j, we have that x0x2u1 ∈ Y j and that x1u1 ∈/ E(Y j). But then (X, Y j \
{x0x1v1, x0x2u1}∪ {x1v1vj , x0x2v1, x0x1u1}) is a 9 -TP of G, a contradiction.	2

We proceed with the proof of the theorem. Abusing notation, for every triple of vertices Δ ⊆ Vt such that Δ /= bcd, let h(Δ) = 0 if SΔ(t) = ∅, and h(Δ) = 1 + max{h(tj): tj ∈ SΔ(t)} otherwise. Let kj = |{Δ ⊆ Vt : h(Δ) = 2}|, and mj = |{Δ ⊆ Vt : h(Δ) = 1}|. Let G+ be the graph obtained from G[Vt ∪ R(t)] by removing, for each triple of vertices Δ ⊆ Vt such that Δ /= bcd and |SΔ(t)| = 2, the vertices in R(x), for precisely one x ∈ SΔ(t). One can check that, by Claim 5.4, G+ is a restricted planar 3-tree. Also, G+ has f =4 + 4kj + 2mj faces. Let Q+ be the set {qi ∈ Q : vi ∈/ V (G+)}. By Proposition 4.6, G+ contains a triangle packing P+ of facial triangles containing the face bcd and such that |P+| ≥ [f /3|, and if G+ is super restricted, then |P+| = 5. For each qi ∈ Q+, let Ti = vivjwi, where wi is a vertex adjacent to both vi and vj, and let P = P+ ∪ {Ti : qi ∈ Q+}. Note
that |P| = |P+| + (k − kj).
Claim 5.5 Let Gj = G − R(t). If Xj is a transversal of Gj, then (i) there exists a transversal of G with size |Xj| +1+ 2k + m; and (ii) there exists a transversal of G with size at most |Xj| +5+ k.
Proof (i) Because Xj is a transversal of Gj and bcd is a triangle in Gj, Xj ∩ E(bcd) /= ∅.  Without loss of generality, assume that bc ∈ Xj.  Given a 4-clique K in G and a set X ⊆ E(G) such that E(K) ∩ X = {e}, denote by K ⊗ X the only edge in K that does not share any vertex with e. For instance, Vt ⊗ {bc} = ad.  For every i ∈ [m], let ei = Vli ⊗ {bc, ad}.  For ev-

ery i ∈ [k], let fi = Vq
⊗ {bc, ad} and fj = Vq′ ⊗ {bc, ad, fi}.	Note that X  =

i	i	i
Xj ∪ {ad}∪ {ei : i ∈ [m]}∪ {fi : i ∈ [k]}∪ {f j : i ∈ [k]} is a transversal of G and

|X| = |Xj| +1+ 2k + m. (ii) Let X = Xj ∪ E(G[Vt]) ∪ {vivj
: i ∈ [k]}. Note

that X is a transversal of G.	Because Xj is a transversal of Gj and bcd is a triangle in Gj, Xj ∩ E(bcd) /= ∅, and hence |Xj ∩ E(G[Vt])| ≥ 1.	Thus
|X| = |Xj| + |E(G[Vt])|− |Xj ∩ E(G[Vt])| + k ≤ |Xj| +5+ k.	2
Let Gj = G − R(t) and let (Xj,Y j) be a 9 -TP of Gj. The only triangle in P containing edges of Gj is bcd. Therefore Y = Y j ∪ (P\ {bcd}) is a triangle packing of G of size |Y j| + |P+|− 1+ (k − kj). By Claim 5.5, there exists a transversal X of G with size |Xj| + min{1+ 2k + m, 5+ k}. Note that kj ≥ 1 because h(t) = 2.

Also kj + mj ≤ 3. If mj = 2, then kj = 1 and G+ is super restricted. In this case, because 5(5 + k) < 9(3 + k) we have that |X|≤ |Xj| +5+ k < 9 (|Y j| +3+ k)+ 1 =
5	5
9 (|Y j| + |P+|− 1+ (k − kj)) + 1 ≤ 9 |Y | + 1 . So we may assume that mj ≤ 1.
5	5	5	5
Note that, for all possible values of kj and mj, we have [f/3|− 1+ (k − kj) = 
[(4 + 4kj + 2mj)/3|− 1+ k−kj = 1 + k + [(kj − 2+ 2mj)/3| = 1 + k + [kj/3♩ + [mj/2|. Suppose that k ≤ 2. Then we have that 10k ≤ 9k +2 and 5m ≤ 9[mj/2| +2 because mj ≤ m ≤ 2mj ≤ 2, and hence 5(1 + 2k + m)=5 + 10k + 5m ≤ 5+ 9k +
2+ 9[mj/2| +2 = 9(1 + k + [mj/2|). Moreover, we have

|X|≤ |Xj| +1+ 2k + m ≤

Now suppose that kj ≤ 2 and mj = 0. Since kj ≥ [k/2|, we have that k ≤ 4, and hence 10k ≤ 9k + 4. Moreover, we have that m = 0 = [mj/2|, and hence 5(1 + 2k + m) = 5 + 10k + 5m ≤ 5+ 9k +4+ 9[mj/2| = 9(1 + k + [mj/2|). Analogously to the case above, we have |X| ≤ |Xj| +1+ 2k + m ≤ 9 |Y | + 1 .
5	5
Hence we may assume that k ≥ 3, and either kj =3 or mj /= 0. This implies that
5k = 9k − 4k ≤ 9k − 12, and therefore 5(5 + k) = 25 + 5k ≤ 9k + 13 ≤ 9(k + 2). Moreover, we have that [kj/3♩ + [mj/2|≥ 1. So, the proof is complete because

|X|≤ |Xj| +5+ k ≤

Concluding remarks
In this paper we present three results related to Tuza’s Conjecture. In Section 3, we obtained a lemma (Lemma 3.4) that extends Puleo’s tools [13], and allowed us to verify Tuza’s Conjecture for graphs with treewidth at most 6. Since any minimal counterexample to Tuza’s Conjecture is an irreducible robust graph, Lemma 3.2 may be used in further results regarding this problem. In Sections 4 and 5, we obtained stronger versions of Tuza’s Conjecture for specific classes of graphs. We believe that the techniques used here may also be useful to deal with other classes of graphs, perhaps by introducing new ingredients.
