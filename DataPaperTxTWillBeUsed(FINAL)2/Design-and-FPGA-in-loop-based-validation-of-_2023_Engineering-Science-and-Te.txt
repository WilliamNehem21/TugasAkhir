Model predictive control Islanded AC microgrid
This paper proposes a decentralized control approach for the flexible operation of an autonomous AC microgrid (MG). AC MG typically consists of two or more voltage source inverters (VSI), capable of simultaneously regulating the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) and meeting the local power demand. The classical linear control techniques attain these functions. However, they have many limitations, such as slow transient response, high sensitivity to the parameter variations, and inability to handle the system nonlinearities. This paper aims to address these issues by presenting an improved finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) approach for inverter-based distributed generation (DG). The proposed scheme tracks the voltage trajectory using cost function (CF) over two-step prediction horizons. The proposed control method is employed for the AC MG having two parallel DGs. Droop control is responsible for the power- sharing between the parallel DGs regardless of impedance mismatch at the distribution level of AC MG. The decentralized secondary control is developed to eliminate the deviation in the voltage and frequency caused due to overlooking the primary control. The proposed control scheme has been validated through extensive simulations and real-time controller hardware in the loop tests using an FPGA ZYBO Z7 board. Moreover, the proposed methodology depicts the enhanced transient response, less computational burden than the classic MPC, and shows robustness to parametric uncertainties in terms of THD than hierarchical linear control. The simulations and experimental results visually represent research outcomes, exhibiting the THD of 0.98 % for different dynamic loads, which is within the limit of IEEE and IEC standards. Furthermore, the proposed controller’s mathematical stability is further supported by analysis based on the Lyapunov stability theory.





Introduction

Due to climate change and global warming, various countries in the world adopted the Paris Agreement to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and also limit global warming below the 2 ◦C [1]. Power generation through fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas is one of the primary causes of greenhouse gases emission. The world is looking for alternative ways of energy generation, which must be clean, reliable, and carbon-free. Therefore, power generation through renew- able energy sources has got the world’s attention. However, renewable energy resources (RES) are intermittent and produce energy in both AC and DC. Consequently, the concept of distributed generation (DG) is introduced in literature by the research community to integrate RES in conventional power systems and meet the load demand locally [2]. The DGs are connected to the grid through a power electronic inter- face (PEI). PEIs are responsible for regulating the voltage, current, and power. The high penetration and integration of RES in the power sys- tem originate high risks to the power system’s stability and reliability.
The microgrid (MG) concept is presented to mitigate the problems as mentioned [3,4]. MG is a small distribution power system with a cluster of loads, generation units, and energy storage systems, and it effectively controls each unit [5]. The MG can operate in two modes, i.e., grid- connected and islanded modes. In grid-connected mode, MG has the ability to import and export the power with the utility grid as per grid codes such as EN 50549-1 or EN 50549-2 [6]. In islanded mode, MG is disconnected from the main grid due to regular maintenance, low- quality power generation, or occurred faults. The autonomous MG is also developed for areas far from the power network, such as rural areas. Islanded MG is used in various applications such as avionic [7], marine [8] and automotive [9]. Sometimes, it is economical to dis- tribute the high power among the several DGs with lower current ratings. This mechanism also helps to maximize the system’s efficiency. The islanded MG generates power to meet the demand locally and also regulates the voltage at the point of common coupling. However, an energy management system is required to run and optimize the operation of an islanded MG.

/ig. 1. Control layers typically utilized for hierarchical control of MGs.













The MG control approaches are categorized as distributed, decen- tralized, and centralized in literature [10]. Distributed and centralized control techniques require a communication network. The implementa- tion of centralized techniques reduces reliability and increases system complexity. However, the decentralized approach uses local measure- ments and does not require any communication infrastructure [11].
The hierarchical control of MG is vastly proposed in the literature and it is considered to be the best possible solution to regulate the MG operation. Fig. 1 explains the hierarchical control graphically for easy understanding. MG hierarchical control consists of three different levels, i.e., primary, secondary, and tertiary levels [12,13].
Primary control: It is further divided into inner control and outer droop control loops. The inner control loop regulates the output current and voltage of DERs. The outer droop control is responsible for accurate power-sharing among the DGs and also mitigates the circulating current.
Secondary control: This control level is responsible for mitigat- ing the MG’s voltage and frequency deviation. The response of this level is slower than the primary controller.
Tertiary Control: This control level is at the highest level of the MG hierarchy, and its response is slower than the secondary con- trol loop. It is responsible for scheduling and optimizing power generation references for DGs and the techno-economic operation of MG and remains in contact with DSO and TSO.
As aforementioned that tertiary control focuses on economic dis- patch and operation scheduling. It is also characterized as coordination between multiple MG, which are interconnected. In [14] tertiary con- trol is implemented to adjust the DG compensating efforts with respect to unbalanced voltage limits of DGs and load buses. Optimal power flow-based tertiary control using MPC is proposed in [15]. In [16], authors proposed a centralized IOT-based tertiary control solution for multi-microgrids.
Many studies are proposed in the literature incorporating primary and secondary control levels and implementing the amalgam of linear and nonlinear controllers. Hierarchical control for grid supporting in- verter in AC MG is investigated in [17]. PR based inner and PI based
secondary loops are proposed in [18] for the islanded AC microgrid. However, multiple resonant controllers are connected in parallel to cope with the fifth and seventh harmonics, which makes the system complex and takes the system towards instability. In [19], the authors proposed the hierarchical control for MG. The PI based linear controller is implemented in the microgrid’s (primary and secondary) control lev- els. However, linear-based controllers cannot track the sinusoidal wave with zero steady state error and poor disturbance rejection capability and cannot handle the power systems’ nonlinearity. Flexible secondary control for three VSIs operated in parallel is proposed in [20]. The authors also proposed a new algorithm to optimally tune the various gain of PR controllers. MPC based primary and secondary control is proposed in [21,22]. The predictive voltage hierarchical control for islanded MC with limited communications is studied in [23]. However, implementing predictive control at the secondary level is unsuitable due to the computational burden. Implementing MPC at the secondary level increases the system complexity and decreases the system re- sponse due to computational burden. Table 1 summarizes some of the recent studies on the hierarchical control of MG based on different control typologies.
The main task of primary control is to regulate the voltage and
also achieve accurate power sharing among the DGs. Different types of linear and nonlinear control techniques have been proposed and investigated in the literature [29]. Linear controllers are limited in their ability to handle the nonlinearities and parameter variations of power systems, as well as other practical issues such as the need for tuning parameters and potential stability problems [20]. Nonlinear controllers perform better than linear controllers but have limitations, such as com- plex mathematical modeling [30], variable switching frequency [31], and high computational burden [32]. In [33], the author proposed sliding mode control for voltage regulation of a standalone DC/AC converter. Nevertheless, the complex mathematical modeling and chat- tering (an undesirable phenomenon) reduce the system’s performance. MPC based hierarchical control for AC MG is proposed in [34] but the authors did not test the proposed under different dynamic loads and THD (%) is more than the proposed scheme.
The artificial neural network (ANN) aided MPC based voltage regu- lation technique is proposed in [35,36]. The authors use the MPC as the parent system to train the ANN. The performance of ANN is better than MPC in terms of total harmonic distortion (THD) and computational burden. However, the control technique needs to be more mature. The PID controller and its combinations are matured and vastly im- plemented by the power electronics industry. However, the nonlinear or advanced control approaches need complex mathematical modeling, and their implementation requires high-speed digital platforms. Table 2 summarized the pros and cons of different advanced control techniques.

This study aims to develop and implement the decentralized hierar- chical control technique for attaining enhanced transient stability and accurate power sharing among the DGs under different dynamics loads in islanded AC MG. Fig. 6 elucidates the implemented hybrid MPC- based hierarchical control for DG. The key contributions in this study are as follows:
The finite control set model predictive voltage control is intro- duced at the primary layer to regulate the voltage of the DG and droop control is also implemented to attain accurate power- sharing among the DGs under complex load conditions. MPC uses DER’s discrete time domain model to anticipate the future voltage states for each possible switching combination in every sampling time. This technique determines the error using the pre-defined cost function and produces optimal control action for the coming instant based on the error minimization. In order to reduce the switching loss, the switching frequency reduction technique is implemented based on [37].
Lyapunov stability studies are carried out to validate the stability of the proposed controller. According to the authors’ best knowl- edge, this analysis has not been previously carried out for 2-level DC/AC three-phase inverters.
At the secondary control level, the PI controller based frequency and voltage regulation loop are employed to annihilate the voltage and the frequency deviation overlooked by the pri- mary control in AC MG. The proposed technique uses local measurements to regulate the voltage and frequency of MG.
The impact of different dynamics loads, such as commercial, residential, and constant power, on the proposed controller is also studied and evaluated.
Additionally, to validate the system performance in real time, the controller hardware in the loop (CHIL) testing is carried out using
cable is used for two way communication. Finally, we also provide an GitHub1 open repository of the dataset and simulation files and ZYBO Z7 (ZYNQ-7020) board definition files (to integrate the board into the MATLAB FPGA Manager for HIL validation) to the community for further research activities.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the structure of MG. Section 2.1 describes the discrete modeling of DER and MPC and the switching reduction method is written in Section 2.2. The Lyapunov function MPC stability for DC/AC converter is derived in Section 2.3. Section 2.4 discusses the virtual impedance loop while the droop control and its implementation are expressed in Section 2.5. PI-based secondary control and its stability analysis are studied in Sec- tion 3. Dynamics loads and their mathematical modeling is explained in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the simulation studies. In contrast, HIL testing of the proposed control scheme is discussed in Section 5.1 while parametric uncertainty tests are presented in Section 5.2. Finally, the conclusion is presented in Section 6.

Microgrid

Fig. 2 illustrates the common configuration of a microgrid, which contains multiple DGs, loads, the energy storage system (ESS), trans- mission lines, and their effective control. MG is connected to the utility grid through a circuit breaker or static transfer switch. DGs are connected to an AC bus through a feeder. MG has the ability to work in grid connected or islanded mode. In this study, only islanded mode operation of MG is studied. Fig. 1 expressed the hierarchical control layers of MG and their roles. Since tertiary control has no role in islanded operation mode, it is not taken into account in this study. Droop control and virtual impedance loop are also discussed in this section.

probable eight (23) switching states. Among these, six states are stated
as active states, while two states with zero output are known as zero states as expressed in Eq. (1). The control approach based on MPC theory chooses the switching state, which has the least value of CF among them and is implemented for the next sampling time. Fig. 6 presents the two level three phase voltage source inverter with an LC filter to mitigate the switching harmonics. Each leg of VSC has two switches; they can be in on or off state and represented as 1 and 0, respectively. The output voltage of the VSI depends upon the switching

After the controller’s initialization, measured inputs are taken by the controller to predict the one step ahead voltage and current using Eq. (7). Eq. (10) is used to determine the value of the CF for each possible switching state of the converter. Among all possible switching states, the switching state, which has minimal error value, is applied to the converter for the next switching instant.

Two steps ahead switching frequency reduction scheme
The power converters’ switching frequency has a major effect on systems’ losses. If the switching frequency is high, more loss and more stress on the converter switches will consequently occur, reducing the converter’s life and decreasing the system’s efficiency. Classical MPC has higher switching losses due to high switching frequency. In order to cope with this issue, a two step ahead reduction approach

eight possible switching states (six active and two zero vector states) in one sampling instant, as shown in Fig. 5a. The switching state fulfills the CF criteria and is applied to the converter for the next sampling instant. In the two steps ahead classical approach, the total possible sequences are 49. So, The algorithm has to run the loop for 49 times, which increases the computation burden and also enhances the MPC performance, as demonstrated Fig. 5b. In this study, the two step prediction is accomplished by taking only eight vectors into account, as illustrated in Fig. 5c. This technique showed similar performance but had a lower switching frequency and computational burden hence
the form of lower THD. The predicted voltage for instant (𝑡𝑘 + 2) is using fewer hardware resources and improving the voltage quality in
determined by Eq. (7).

MPC stability analysis

In the case of a linear theory based controller, the power electronic system is considered a linear system. In contrast, the nonlinear con- troller uses a power electronic system in a discrete time. So, the analysis methods based on eigenvector, bode plot, etc., are not ideal for finding the MPC stability. The Lyapunov stability criteria are widely used for the stability analysis of nonlinear controllers. There is no proper math- ematical method to prove MPC stability, but many studies incorporate the Lyapunov stability to establish MPC stability. In [41], a statistical model checking approach is proposed to validate the MPC stability in the PC domain. The Lyapunov function based MPC is proposed for a four leg inverter in [42]. In [43], the authors studied the stability of MPC based on Lyapunov theory for AC/DC converters in battery applications. According to the author’s best knowledge, the Lyapunov- based stability for a two level three phase DC/AC converter has not been derived before. In [44,45], multiple simulations are carried out with different system parameters to validate the response of the power converter under model uncertainties and parametric variations. The re- sults of simulations are also verified by experiments and compared with the classical PI benchmark model. It is observed from the results that the control performance deteriorates for underestimated inductance and has no effect on the overestimated inductance. The described cases demonstrate a good steady state and transient response. The downside of this type of study is that the experiments are very time consuming. Table 3 illustrates the overview of literature work done in the domain of performance and stability of FCS-MPC.

and 𝐾  =  𝛥𝑉  . 𝛥𝑉 and 𝛥𝑓 are the maximum deviations

in voltage and frequency, while 𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑄𝑚𝑎𝑥 are rated active and

angle stable, eliminating the circulating current. Eqs. (14) to (15) are used to evaluate the P and Q using instantaneous power theory in the

𝑃 = 𝑖𝑓 𝛼 𝑉0𝛼 + 𝑖𝑓 𝛽 𝑉0𝛽	(27)
𝑄 = 𝑖𝑓 𝛼 𝑉0𝛽 − 𝑖𝑓 𝛽 𝑉0𝛼	(28)

Secondary control

The fundamental responsibility of secondary control is to regulate the voltage and frequency deviation at PCC and forcefully shift the system variables to their nominal reference values with zero steady- state error after each change of generation and load. However, these deviations are generated due to overseeing the primary control. The voltage and frequency deviations are larger in the case of linear theory based controllers while smaller in the case of nonlinear controllers. In order to attenuate these deviations, the PI controller is used as a regulator. The secondary control layer usually consists of a voltage and frequency regulation loop. A second order generalized integrator phase locked loop (SOGI PLL) is used to measure the system’s frequency. The secondary voltage and frequency compensation loops are extracted as follows:
𝛥𝑉 = 𝑘𝑝𝑣 (𝑉𝑟𝑒𝑓 − 𝑉𝐴𝑐𝑡) + 𝑘𝑖𝑣 ∫ (𝑉𝑟𝑒𝑓 − 𝑉𝐴𝑐𝑡) 𝑑𝑡	(29)
𝛥𝑓 = 𝑘𝑝𝑓 (𝑓ref − 𝑓SOGI ) + 𝑘𝑖𝑓 ∫ (𝑓ref − 𝑓SOGI ) 𝑑𝑡	(30)

where 𝑘𝑝𝑣, 𝑘𝑖𝑣, 𝑘𝑝𝑓 and 𝑘𝑖𝑓 are the gain parameters of secondary layers regulators. 𝑉𝑟𝑒𝑓 and 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑓 are the reference voltage and frequency of MG, while 𝑓𝑆𝑂𝐺𝐼 and 𝑉𝐴𝑐𝑡 are the actual frequency and voltage of AC bus
in MG.
Fig. 7 illustrates the complete structure and process and how sec- ondary control works and restores the voltage and frequency deviation. However, the response of the secondary level control is slower than the primary level control. As shown in the p-f graph, with the load increment, primary control acts first accordingly and increases the
power generation. However, the system’s frequency moves from 𝑓2 to
𝑓3 Hz. Then secondary control adds the 𝛿𝑓 factor into droop control
to shift the characteristic curve to attain the system frequency. The
same principle is applied in the voltage droop case. Without secondary control, the amplitude and frequency of MG would be load dependent. To design the regulator and analyze the system’s stability, the transfer function is determined for the frequency regulation loop as written in Eq. (32). As shown in Fig. 6, the block model comprises droop control, secondary control gain, second order generalized integrator based phase lock loop, and communication delay. The block model is

By using this model, the secondary control parameters can be easily adjusted, and the effects of communication delays can also be analyzed. The voltage regulation loop is also modeled and developed using the same procedure.

Dynamics loads


The dynamic load is a load in which active and reactive power depends on the voltage and frequency of the systems. However, the voltage variation is in practice larger than the frequency variation [52]. The mathematical model of the load as a function of voltage is as follows:

between power and voltage is quadratic under constant impedance load (CZ), while in constant current load (CI), power is linear with bus voltage. However, constant power (CP) loads are independent of voltage. Table 4 expressed load constants, the power rating of the dynamic loads used in this study.

Simulation results

This part of the article discusses the simulation studies of the MG model developed in the MATLAB/Simulink environment to eval- uate the performance of the proposed control strategy. Several MAT- LAB/Simulink simulations are carried out to assess the response of the proposed controller under different types of dynamic loads. In the simulation studies, two DGs with feeder mismatch are tested under different dynamic loads such as constant current, constant impedance, and constant power load to validate the performance of the studied con- troller, as shown in Fig. 8.

To validate the performance of the proposed control, two DGs are operated in parallel, having an LC filter, and a feeder impedance is also added to make the system more realistic. The total load of 13 kW and 6 kVar is connected to the common MG AC bus. Fig. 9 shows the voltage

At t = 0.8 s, the 𝐷𝐺1 is disconnected from the system. Therefore, the frequency of 𝐷𝐺2 drops from its nominal value, and the voltage also falls due to an increased share of the load. 𝐷𝐺2 is under a no load condition, so the voltage and frequency of 𝐷𝐺2 elevate to the
predefined reference value.
Fig. 10 illustrates the voltage and frequency of the DGs with sec- ondary control. It can be observed from Fig. 10 that the frequency and voltage demonstrate a slight dip and deviation from the reference values due to the load change. The secondary controller adds the increments to attain the reference value within no time. It is also seen

in Fig. 10 that small transients occur in the system due to the operation of circuit breakers. However, the controller effectively accomplishes its goal of promptly achieving the reference voltage and frequency. Figs. 11 to 12 present DGs’ output voltage and frequency when imple- menting PI-based hierarchical control. As shown in Fig. 11, the voltage and frequency of DGs decrease with the increase in load due to the absence of secondary control loop, and the PI based primary control loop has more deviation in voltage and frequency compared to the proposed controller. Fig. 12 depicts the performance of DGs when PI controller based hierarchical control is implemented. From Fig. 12, it can be observed that the PI based hierarchical control exhibits inferior performance when compared to the proposed control scheme. Fig. 13 illustrates the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the voltage at the AC bus of the MG. The voltage THD remains under 2 percent for the proposed control scheme.
The performance of the proposed PI+MPC based hierarchical con- trol scheme is also analyzed under the different dynamics loads such as CZ, CI, and CP.
Constant Impedance: The output power of CZ load is in a quadratic relationship with voltage. Fig. 14(a) exhibits the voltage and frequency
of 𝐷𝐺1 and 𝐷𝐺2 under constant impedance (CZ) load. At t = 0.3 s,
the load of 2 kW is suddenly connected to the system. However, the
voltage and frequency remain stable despite the switching of the load. The THD percentage of the current is 0.65. So the proposed controller effectively suppressed the voltage and current harmonics.
Constant Current: In this load, the output current remains con- stant, but the power changes linearly with the voltage. The power rating CI load is 6 kW and 4 kVar, which is connected to the system
at t = 0.3 s, as demonstrated in Fig. 14(b). It is observed from the
simulation results that the voltage and frequency of the system drop
due to the addition of the load. But the proposed control system effectively tracks the reference and shares the DGs’ harmonics. The percentage THD of the voltage is less than with the conventional control techniques, as shown in Table 6. At the same time, the current harmonics is about 0.47 percent, far less than the recommended value of IEEE/IEC standards such as IEC 62040, IEEE 1547 [53], and IEEE 519 [54]. The IEEE 519 standard recommends that the total harmonic distortion (THD) for voltage should not exceed 5 percent for systems with a voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) of 69 kV and below. For individual harmonics, the standard recommends that it should not exceed 3 percent [54].
Constant Power: In this type of load, power remains constant and dependent on the input voltage change. The total load of 8 kW and 6 kVar is applied to the system at 0.3 s, as shown in Fig. 14(c). The system voltage and frequency show some disturbance, attain the reference, and become stable. The current harmonics are observed at PCC due to the feeder mismatch. However, the current harmonics are reduced and properly shared by the DGs. The current harmonic percentage is
0.33 at the PCC. The THD percentage comparison among the different control schemes is presented in Table 6.
Fig. 14(d) illustrates the simulation results of voltage and frequency of islanded MG when the industrial motor load is connected with a power rating of 16.55 kVA. The motor load is connected to the system at 0.3 s and shows the spike in voltage and current wave- form due to the switching of the circuit breaker. The nominal voltage

and frequency of the DGs deviate from their reference. The proposed secondary controller eliminates voltage and frequency deviation with minor transients in 0.1 s, produced by the droop control due to a change in load. The current harmonics in the case of the industrial motor is
0.22 percent. The active and reactive power generated by the DGs to meet the load demand is illustrated in Fig. 15. The power voltage relation is quadratic in the case of CZ load and also has a large load power variation. At the same time, the CI load has less load power variation compared to CZ and has linear relation between voltage & power. In the case of CP, the voltage is not dependent on power and has a constant power load. Table 6 explains the performance analysis of THD among different control techniques. The proposed hybrid control scheme has achieved less percentage THD in all load types.

SIMULINK. The CUT is burnt on the FPGA board, while the remaining AC MG model is on the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The interac- tive communication is done through a JTAG cable. FIL Implementation is performed in the following steps:
The controller under test is specified using a Simulink subsystem. Then inputs and outputs of the subsystem are defined as fixed data types(This operation can be performed using SIMULINK Fixed Point Tool).
After defining data types, select the CUT subsystem, open the HDL workflow, and run all tasks.
After running all tasks successfully, Matlab will generate the VHDL code of CUT and write it up on the FPGA board.
The performance of the studied controller is verified experimentally. Fig. 17 presents the systematic diagram of the experimental setup uti- lized for the proposed algorithm. This study implements the secondary controller on an FPGA card, while the AC MG model and MPC-based primary controller are modeled on MATLAB/Simulink environment. The controller hardware in the loop (CHIL) testing is carried out to study the response of the secondary controller in real time. Fig. 8 explains the detailed structure of the studied cases. Fig. 18 expressed the voltage and current of DERs during the step change of load under
primary and secondary control. At t = 0.2 s, the RL load is connected
to MG at the PCC. Voltage, the output current of the DERs remains
stable despite a smaller dip, as shown in Fig. 18. Suddenly further load of 5 kW & 2 KVar is added into the system to see the impact

𝐷𝐺1 and 𝐷𝐺2 according to the load demand.
Figs. 21 to 22 present the system’s fault study results. At t = 0.3 s,
the three phase ground fault occurred at the PCC. DG voltage becomes
zero, and the output current increases by 3 times the load current. Fig. 22 illustrates the fault current injection and bus voltage at the point of fault. When the fault is cleared at 0.4 s, the voltage and current of the MG are stabilized within no time.

Parametric uncertainty tests

changed at t = 0.4 s from 2 mH to 1 mH. After changing the filter
inductance value, The proposed controller performs better than PI, as
shown in Figs. 23 to 24. This comparison is carried out based on THD in the converter’s output voltage, which is 1.88 percent in the case of the proposed controller, but THD is 4 percent when PI is employed. The results illustrate the suitability and better performance of the studied controller under realistic conditions, and thus the proposed control can be effectively implemented for practical applications.

Conclusion

This paper proposed a decentralized hierarchical control comprised of FCS-MPC-based primary control and PI-based secondary approach for islanded AC microgrid to enhance the transient stability, load sharing, and power quality among the parallel connected DGs in AC MG under different dynamic loads (CZ, CI, CP, and industrial load). The mathematical stability of the proposed controller is also justified

The performance of the proposed control scheme is validated through the realistic MG test bench comprising two DGs operated in parallel along with an LC filter and a feeder impedance. The effectiveness of the proposed control technique was verified by performing simulations in MATLAB/Simulink along with hardware-in-loop testing using the FPGA-in-loop. The simulations and hardware setup results illustrated that the proposed approach tracked the reference with zero steady- state error by effectively regulating the voltage and frequency to its nominal value.
