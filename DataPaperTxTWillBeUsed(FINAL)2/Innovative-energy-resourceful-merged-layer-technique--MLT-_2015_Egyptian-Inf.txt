Abstract A wireless sensor network (WSN) is consisting of anthology of large number of small sensor nodes which are deployed in a defined area to observe the surroundings parameters. Since, energy con- sumption is significant challenge in WSN. As sensor nodes are equipped with battery which has limited energy. Energy efficient information processing is most importance for many routing protocols were proposed to increase the lifetime of WSN. In order to improve the lifetime of WSN, the proposed MLT routing protocol has implemented where the sensor nodes are randomly deployed in the field. The merged layer node deployment pattern of the sensor nodes system operation maximizes the working time of full coverage in a given WSN. MLT provides energy-balancing while selecting cluster head (CH) for each round. The cluster head selection mechanism is essential and has same procedure like Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) in MLT protocol. The main idea of this paper is combine two layers of sensor nodes which are belonging to the same set but in different group to improve the lifetime of WSN. MATLAB simulations are performed to analyze and compare the per- formance of MLT with LEACH protocol. The obtained simulation output has enhanced results and superfluous lifetime compared to other protocols.

Introduction

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are serene of many small sensor nodes with limited battery power. Routing techniques are the most important issue for networks to save the energy in [1,2]. Each sensor is limited in their energy level, by limit the processing power and sensing ability. Thus a network of these sensors gives rise to a more robust, reliable and accurate

network. New applications have been introduced by many research scholars in various areas, like remote and hostile regions as seen in the military for battle field surveillance, mon- itoring the enemy land, detection of attacks and security pro- priety information delivery.
An extravagant use of the available energy leads to poor performance the network. To this end, energy in these sensors is a rare resource and must be managed in an efficient manner. In this chapter, we proposed algorithm is implemented in homogeneous and heterogeneous system where merged layer technique (MLT) node deployment system of network helps to improve the power economy in WSN. In this case random deployment of nodes is deployed in two layers with same energy and same probability of head selection procedure. Two layer sensor nodes are belonging to same set but in differ- ent group. According to the LEACH principle the sensor nodes are transmitting their sensed data to CH and CH trans- mits aggregated data to base station (BS). The merged layer concept network has better results compared with LEACH protocol.
The formations of these chapters are as follows. We briefly review the related work in Section 2. Section 3 describes heterogeneous sensor network system. A sensor network model is analyzed in Section 4. In Section 5, we present MLT protocol. Simulation results of the proposed protocol are discussed in terms of energy consumption, num- ber of live nodes per round, separate base station location for two layer sensor nodes and comparative result graphs in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7 bring to an end of the pro- posed algorithm and future works.

Related works

Hierarchical routing technique in [3,4] is one of the effective techniques to maintain the energy saving of sensor nodes to improve the lifetime of the WSNs in [5,6]. It has multi-hop communication within a particular cluster and sensor nodes by performing data aggregation and transmits the data to the sink in [7,8].


Low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol

LEACH (Heinemann et al., 2002) is the first hierarchical rout- ing protocol for sensors networks. The idea proposed in LEACH has been an encouragement for many protocols in [9–11]. In LEACH, formation of clusters among the sensor nodes is based on the elected cluster heads for routers to the base station (BS) in [12]. The selection of cluster heads in [13,14] is followed by Eq. (1).

Stable Election Protocol (SEP)

A Stable Election Protocol (SEP) is improved version of LEACH protocol in [15]. In this protocol heterogeneous sen- sor nodes are used in wireless sensor networks. This protocol has operation like LEACH but in two different energy nodes. SEP based on weighted election probabilities of each node to become cluster head according to their respective energy. This approach ensures that the cluster head election is randomly selected and distributed based on the fraction of energy of each node assuring a uniform use of the nodes energy. In SEP, two types of nodes (normal and advanced) are considered [16]. It is based on weighted election probabilities of each node to become cluster head. This prolongs the stability period i.e. the time interval before the death of the first node.

Cluster head relay routing protocol for heterogeneous sensor networks

A cluster head relay (CHR) routing protocol for heteroge- neous sensor networks in [17]. This protocol uses two types of sensors to form a heterogeneous network with a single sink: a large number of lower-energy sensors and a small number of higher-energy sensors. Both types of sensors are static and aware of their locations using some location service. More- over, both types are uniformly and randomly distributed in a defined area. The CHR protocol partitions the heterogeneous network into clusters, each being composed of both lower and higher energy sensors. Within a cluster, the lower energy sen- sors are in charge of sensing the environment and forwarding data packets originated by other lower energy sensors toward their cluster head in a multi-hop transmission. The higher energy sensors, on the other hand, are responsible for data fusion within their own clusters and forwarding aggregated data packets from other cluster heads toward the sink in a multi-hop transmission by only cluster heads.

where ‘P’ is desired percentage of cluster head nodes in the sen- sor network, ‘r’ is current round number and ‘G’ is the set of nodes that have not been cluster heads in the last 1/P rounds. The concept of LEACH is depicted in Fig. 1.
Some performance measures that are used to evaluate the per- formance of clustering protocols are listed below for heteroge- neity of WSNs in [18]. Network lifetime (stability period): It is the time interval from the start of operation (of the sensor net- work) until the death of the first alive node. Number of cluster heads per round: Instantaneous measure reflects the number of



nodes which would send directly to the base station, informa- tion aggregated from their cluster members. Energy Efficiency: The Innovative ways for Smart Energy consumption. Number of live nodes per round: This instantaneous measure reflects the total number of nodes and that of each type that has not yet expended all of their energy. Throughput: This includes the total rate of data sent over the network, the rate of data sent from cluster heads to the base station as well as the rate of data sent from the nodes to their cluster heads

Energy model of sensor network

Network model

The following properties are assumed for the sensor nodes in the network energy model in Fig. 2.
The sink node locates at the center of field area and has enough memory and computing capability.
The WSNs consist of the heterogeneous sensor nodes. Per- centage of sensor nodes are equipped with more energy
resources than the rest of the nodes. Let ‘m’ be the fraction of the total number of nodes ‘n’ which are equipped with alpha times more energy than the others.
The distance can be measured based on the wireless radio
signal power.
All sensor nodes are immobile and have a limited energy.
All nodes are equipped with power control capabilities to vary their transmitting power.

Radio energy dissipation model adopted wireless channel models in the reference. Thus, to transmit a 1-bit message a distance ‘d’, the radio expends:

( kEelec + kefsd2	d < d0
are deployed in two layers with same energy and same proba- bility of head selection procedure. These two layers are sand- wiched and belonging to same set, but in different group. According to the LEACH formula the nodes are transmitting their data to the CH and CH transmits aggregated data to the BS. The merged layer concept network has better results com- pared with LEACH Protocol which is followed the same procedure.

Homogeneous merged layer LEACH system

In proposed HHMTL algorithm, Homogeneous Merged Layer LEACH system of sensor node deployment has 50 sen- sor nodes are in blue color and other 50 sensor nodes are in red color. These two layer sensor nodes are deployed and merged in the same set but in different group. As like the LEACH operation, after certain rounds the sensor nodes are lose their energy and going to be a dead node. Dead nodes are indicated as red dot after drain out its energy at certain rounds. The sen- sor node deployment for two layers with its base station located at (45 m, 45 m) and (55 m, 55 m) indicated in Fig. 3.
The data transmission from each sensor node to its CH and CH to BS could consume large amount of energy in separate BS of two layers. The two base-stations are located at (45 m, 45 m) and (55 m, 55 m). As a result, by providing common base station at center (50 m, 50 m) for each layer sensor nodes to have less consumption of energy for data communication than the separate base station for both layers is shown in Fig. 4. From the graph the homogeneous merged layer LEACH with common BS system yield better result of energy consumption with lifetime improvement.

at certain rounds. The sensor node deployment for two layers with its base station located at (45 m, 45 m) and (55 m, 55 m) indicated in Fig. 5. The data transmission from each sensor node to its CH and CH to BS could consume large amount of energy in separate BS of two layers. The two base-stations are located at (45 m, 45 m) and (55 m, 55 m). As a result, by providing common base station at center (50 m, 50 m) for each layer sensor nodes to have less consumption of energy for data communication than the separate base station for both layers is shown in Fig. 6.

turned off at all times except during their transmit time, thus minimizing the energy dissipated by the individual sensors.
In order to reduce the energy consumption of the cluster heads which are far away from the base station and balance the energy consumption of the cluster heads which are close to the base station, a multi-hop routing algorithm of cluster head has been presented, which introduces into the restriction factor of remainder energy when selects the short-term nodes between cluster heads and base station, and also the minimum spanning tree algorithm has been included. The protocol can not only reduce the consumption of transmit energy of cluster head, but also the consumption of communication energy between non-cluster head and cluster head nodes. Simulation results show that this protocol performs better than LEACH in terms of network lifetime. For that our proposed algorithm also implements the heterogeneity properties to improve the lifetime of WSN. Such as in merged layer 10% of nodes are higher energy advanced nodes than the normal nodes deploy- ment in (100 m, 100 m) field. This made better performance than that of normal LEACH heterogeneity.
In proposed HHTML algorithm, Heterogeneous Merged Layer LEACH node deployment has 50 nodes are in blue color and other 50 nodes are in red color. These two layer nodes are deployed and merged in the same set but in different group. In this heterogeneity 10% of nodes have higher energy from each layer. Those nodes are indicated by green (+) and red (+) col- ors. As like the LEACH operation, after certain rounds the sensor nodes are lose their energy and going to be a dead node. Dead nodes are indicated as red dot after drain out its energy
result of energy consumption with lifetime improvement.
Analysis of simulation results

Energy consumption analysis

The performance of HHMLT is compared with the original LEACH in terms of energy is shown in Fig. 7. The energy con- sumption of the network is decreased while using merged layer technique of sensor node deployment for data transmission from CHs to the BS. This is due to the gain of the energy dis- sipated by cluster heads to the base station. From the graph it is clear that HHMLT can achieve better energy savings than LEACH protocol. The used simulation parameters are shown in Table 1.

Network lifetime

The number of nodes alive for each round of data transmission is observed for HHMLT algorithm to evaluate the lifetime of the network. The overall homogeneous and heterogeneous merged layer concept of separate BS and single BS is evidently compared with homogeneous and heterogeneous LEACH pro- tocol. The foremost observation is heterogeneous merged layer single BS for both layer LEACH concept is produced the best result of energy consumption and lifetime improvement. It is clearly depicted in Fig. 7.

Result analysis

From our simulation, we observed the followings from Fig. 7.

HHMLT achieves better energy savings than LEACH protocol.

HHMLT with two layer merged technique to balanced energy dissipation of each nodes in WSN, which helps to
extend the network lifetime.
Simulation consequences show that the HHMLT improves the stable region of the clustering hierarchy, decrease probabil- ity of failure nodes and increase the lifetime of the network due to MERGED layer node deployment concept with balanced energy dissipation of individual node throughout the network and extends network lifetime. Balancing the energy consump- tion, reducing the occurrence of fast death node in single BS locations has better energy efficiency than two BS of merged layer node deployment concept. As the base station moves fur- ther away from the network, the energy proficient performance may improves than LEACH. Finally, HHMLT is scalable and



achieves better performance compared to LEACH in both het- erogeneous and homogenous environments.
Plan to implement node scheduling in merged layer tech- nique for both homogeneous and heterogeneous system of LEACH protocol.
