Abstract
The main contribution of this paper is to introduce an autonomous definition of the connective “fuzzy exclusive or” (fuzzy Xor, for short), which is independent from others connectives. Also, two canonical definitions of the connective Xor are obtained from the composition of fuzzy connectives, and based on the commutative and associative properties related to the notions of triangular norms, triangular conorms and fuzzy negations. We show that the main properties of the classical connective Xor are preserved by the connective fuzzy Xor, and, therefore, this new definition of the connective fuzzy Xor extends the related classical approach. The definitions of fuzzy Xor-implications and fuzzy E-implications, induced by the fuzzy Xor connective, are also studied, and their main properties are analyzed. The relationships between the fuzzy Xor-implications and the fuzzy E-implications with automorphisms are explored.
Keywords: Fuzzy Logic, Fuzzy Xor, Xor-implication, E-implication, Automorphism


Introduction
The connective exclusive or (Xor, for short) plays an important role in computer programming. For example, it is used as a primitive operation in many encryption algorithm (e.g, DES, blowfish, RC5, CAST, RIJNDAEL) [29,47]. The one-time pad [43] is an encryption algorithm where the plaintext is combined with a random

key (called pad) by a modular addition, or the operation XOR, when binary data are considered.
Several other applications of the Xor connective can be found, such as in simple threshold activated neural networks [39], in the identification of elemental emission spectra [15], in algorithms to eliminate cache conflict misses [50], in the construc- tion of conflict-free hash functions [49], in techniques to exploit the parallelism in IP routers [11], etc. Also, the boolean web search logic capability may be improved with the Xor operator, in order to consider the search of mutually exclusive sites. Moreover, due to its non-linearity, the connective Xor is frequently used as a prob- lem, e.g., in Neural Networks [24], in support vector machines (SVM ) [25] and Quantum Computing [31,35].
Different versions of the fuzzy Xor connective have been used in the literature. In [34], a fuzzy Xor operation ⊕, defined as x ⊕ y = x + y − 2xy, is used to identify preference rules from interactions in the linear model. In [39], a generalized Xor operation is given as a family of fuzzy Xor operations, based on a composition of the fuzzy negation, and triangular conorms and norms (t-conorms and t-norms, for short). In [6,28], three distinct definitions of the fuzzy Xor are considered, in order to introduce a semantics of interval fuzzy logics related to the checklist paradigm:
x ⊕⊥ y = max(x − y, y − x),	(1)
x ⊕T y = min(2 − x − y, x + y),	(2)
x ⊕mid y = (1 − x)y + x(1 − y).	(3)
In the literature, special attention has been given to the research on the validity of many classical logic tautologies in fuzzy logic, especially those that are related to fuzzy implications. Fuzzy implications have been widely studied, playing important roles in different domains [18,19,46,48,51,52,54,55]. Recent papers studied different classes of fuzzy implications [2,4,5,12,18,44,53].
Several properties of classical implications can be generalized from the multival- ued implications: 4
R-implication,	related to a residuation concept from the intuitionistic logic [21,22];
S-implication, arising from the notion of disjunction and negation of classical logic, and generated by a t-conorm and a fuzzy negation [4];
QL-implication, which may be generated from a left-continuous t-norm, a t- conorm, joint with a strong fuzzy negation [44];
(iii) D-implication, whose definition is obtained as a contraposition concerning a fuzzy negation of a QL-implication [32,33];

(iv)
L- ukasiewicz implication, whose definition is based on the
L- ukasiewics t-

norm [1].
In this paper, we introduce an autonomous definition of the fuzzy Xor connective, which is independent of the other connectives, generalizing the previous definitions

4 See also [3,5,53], for other different definitions of fuzzy implications.

referred above (equations (1), (2) and (3)).
We also provide two canonical constructions based on the composition of other fuzzy connectives. In particular, one of them constitutes a generalization of the fuzzy Xor connective introduced in [39], by considering arbitrary fuzzy negations.
Since the main properties of the classical Xor connective are preserved, this new definition of the fuzzy Xor connective extends the related classical approach.
We use this definition of the fuzzy Xor connective to construct two new classes of fuzzy implications, namely E-implications and Xor-implications, analyzing their main properties and their relationship with automorphisms.
The results can be applied in soft computing, which deals with the design of flex- ible information processing systems [36], with applications in control systems [14], decision making [13], expert systems [45], pattern recognition [7,36], etc.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we review the main concepts related to ordinary fuzzy connectives. Fuzzy t-conorms (and t-norms), negations and implications are presented in the subsections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, respectively. The fuzzy Xor connective and corresponding properties are considered in Sect. 3. In Subsect. 3.1, the canonical definition of the fuzzy Xor operator is introduced. The fuzzy Xor implications and E-implications are defined in Sect. 4, where we also show how to construct an E-implication as a composition of a t-norm, a t-conorm, a negation and an Xor operator. Automorphisms are presented in Sect. 5, where it is shown that the action of the generalization of an automorphism introduced in [20,21] preserves the generalization of an E-implication. Section 6 is the Conclusion.
Usual Fuzzy Connectives
In this section, basic definitions related to the fuzzy connectives t-norm, t-conorm and fuzzy negation are considered.

T-norms and T-conorms
Let U = [0, 1] be the unitary interval. A t-norm is a function T : U 2 → U satisfying, for all x, y, z ∈ U , the following properties:
T1: T (x, y) = T (y, x) (commutativity);
T2: T (x, T (y, z)) = T (T (x, y), z) (associativity);
T3: If y ≤ z then T (x, y) ≤ T (x, z)) (monotonicity);
T4: T (x, 1) = x (boundary condition).
A t-conorm is a function S : U 2 → U satisfying, for all x, y, z ∈ U , the following properties:
S1: S(x, y) = S(y, x) (commutativity);
S2: S(x, S(y, z)) = S(S(x, y), z) (associativity);
S3: If y ≤ z then S(x, y) ≤ S(x, z) (monotonicity);
S4: S(x, 0) = 0 (boundary condition).

Fuzzy Negation
A function N : U → U is a fuzzy negation if
N1: N (0) = 1 and N (1) = 0;
N2: If x ≥ y then N (x) ≤ N (y), ∀x, y ∈ U .
Fuzzy negations satisfying the involutive property are called strong fuzzy nega- tions [12,27]:
N3: N (N (x)) = x, ∀x ∈ U .

Fuzzy Implications
Several definitions for fuzzy implications together with related properties have been given in the literature (see, e.g., [2,5,12,17,18,23,30,42,51,52,53]). The unique con- sensus in these definitions is that the fuzzy implication should have the same behav- ior as the classical implication for the crisp case. Thus, a binary function I : U 2 → U is a fuzzy implication if I satisfies the minimal boundary conditions:

I(1, 1) = I(0, 1) = I(0, 0) = 1 and I(1, 0) = 0.	(4)

Several reasonable properties may be required for fuzzy implications. The prop- erties considered in this paper are listed below:
I1: If x ≤ z then I(x, y) ≥ I(z, y) (first place antitonicity); I2: If y ≤ z then I(x, y) ≤ I(x, z) (second place isotonicity); I3: I(1, x) = x (left neutrality principle);
I4: I(x, I(y, z)) = I(y, I(x, z)) (exchange principle); I5: I(x, y) = I(x, I(x, y)) (iterative boolean-like law);
I6: I(x, N (x)) = N (x), and N is a strong fuzzy negation; I7: N (x) = I(x, 0) is a strong fuzzy negation;
I8: I(x, 1) = 1;
I9: I(x, y) ≥ y;
I10: I(x, y) = I(N (y),N (x)), and N is a strong fuzzy negation (contra-positive); I11: I(0, x) = 1, dominance falsity.
The Connective Fuzzy Xor
In fuzzy logic, one can use the Xor connective in order to evaluate the degree with which one and only one of its immediate antecedents is true. Unfortunately, in the literature, there is no autonomous definitions for that fuzzy connective, in the sense that it would be independent from the other connectives. In the following, we introduce a definition for the fuzzy Xor connective satisfying this condition of independence.

Definition 3.1 A function E : U 2 → U is a fuzzy Xor if it satisfies the properties:
E1: E(x, y) = E(y, x) (symmetry);
E2: E(x, E(y, z)) = E(E(x, y), z) (associativity);
E3: E(0, x) = x (0-Identity);
E4: E(1, 1) = 0 (boundary condition).
Example 3.2 The fuzzy Xor connective introduced in [34], defined by x ⊕ y =
x + y − 2xy, trivially satisfies the properties E1, E3 and E4. It also satisfies the
x ⊕ (y ⊕ z) = x + (y ⊕ z) − 2x(y ⊕ z)
= x + (y + z − 2yz) − 2x(y + z − 2yz)
= x + y + z − 2yz − 2xy − 2xz + 4xyz

property E2, since:
= x + y − 2xy + z − 2xz − 2yz + 4xyz
= x + y − 2xy + z − 2z(x + y − 2xy)
= (x ⊕ y) ⊕ z.


It follows from properties E3 and E4 that the fuzzy Xor connective generalizes the classical Xor connective.
Based on Definition 3.1, the following extra reasonable properties can be con- sidered for the fuzzy Xor connective:
E5: E(x, x) = 0 
E6: E(E(x, y), x) = y
E7: If x ≤ y ≤ z then E(x, y) ≤ E(x, z) and E(y, z) ≥ E(x, z)
E8: NE(x) = E(x, 1) is a strong fuzzy negation.
E9: If E(x, y) = 0 then x = y.
E10: If E(x, y) = 1 then |x − y| = 1.
E11: E(NE(x), x) = 1.
E12: E is continuous.
These properties are not necessarily primitive, that is, some of them can be obtained from some other properties.
Proposition 3.3 Let E : U 2 → U be a fuzzy Xor connective. Then, the following relations hold:
E5 ⇒ E6: If E satisﬁes E5 then E satisﬁes E6. E7 ⇒ E8: If E satisﬁes E7 then E satisﬁes E8. E6 ⇒ E11: If E satisfy E6 then E satisﬁes E11.
Proof. Let E : U 2 → U be a fuzzy Xor connective. Then it follows that: E5 ⇒ E6: E(E(x, y), x) = E(x, E(x, y)) = E(E(x, x), y)) = E(0, y) = y.

E7 ⇒ E8: The function NE : U → U , given by NE(x) = E(x, 1), satisfies the properties:
N1: NE(0) = E(0, 1) = 1 and NE(1) = E(1, 1) = 0.
N2: If x ≤ y, then, by the property E7, NE(x) = E(x, 1) ≥ E(y, 1) = NE(y). N3: One has that NE(NE(x)) = NE(E(x, 1)) = E(E(x, 1), 1).	Based on the associativity (E2) and boundary condition (E4) properties in Defini- tion 3.1, it holds that E(E(x, 1), 1) = E(x, E(1, 1)) = E(x, 0) = x, and, thus, NE(NE(x)) = x.
Therefore, NE(x) = E(x, 1) is a strong fuzzy negation.
E6 ⇒ E11: If E(E(x, y), x) = y then E(NE(x), x) = E(E(x, 1), x) = 1.


Obtaining the Xor Connective from Other Connectives
Proposition 3.4 Let T , S and N be a t-norm, a t-conorm and a fuzzy negation, respectively. A fuzzy Xor connective can be given by the function ET : U 2 → U, deﬁned by:
ET (x, y) = T (S(x, y),N (T (x, y))).	(5)
Proof. The function ET : U 2 → U , given by ET (x, y) = T (S(x, y),N (T (x, y))), satisfies the properties in Definition 3.1:
E1: Based on the commutativity of T and S, it follows that:

ET (x, y) = T (S(x, y),N (T (x, y))) = T (S(y, x),N (T (y, x))) = ET (y, x).

E2: Based on the associativity of T and S, it follows that:
ET (x, ET (y, z))
= ET (x, T (S(y, z),N (T (y, z))))
= T (S(x, T (S(y, z),N (T (y, z)))),N (T (x, T (S(y, z),N (T (y, z))))))
= T (S(T (S(x, y),N (T (x, y), z))),N (T (S(x, y),N (T (x, y))), z))
= ET (T (S(x, y),N (T (x, y))), z)
= ET (ET (x, y), z).
E3: Considering the boundary conditions in the definitions of T , N and S, it follows that:
ET (0, x) = T (S(0, x),N (T (0, x))) = T (x, N (0)) = T (x, 1) = x.

E4: The same conditions in the definitions of T , N and S assure that

ET (1, 1) = T (S(1, 1),N (T (1, 1))) = T (1,N (1)) = T (1, 0) = 0.
 
Example 3.5 Consider the L- ukasiewicz t-norm, defined by TL(x, y) = max(x +
y − 1, 0), the t-conorm (or bounded sum), defined by SL(x, y) = min(x + y, 1), and

the fuzzy negation, given by N (x) = 1 − x (see [44]). The fuzzy Xor operator ETL , canonically obtained as in Eq. (5), can be expressed as:
ETL (x, y)= max(min(x + y, 1)+ (1 − max(x + y − 1, 0)) − 1, 0)
= ⎧⎨ x + y	if x + y ≤ 1
2 − (x + y) if x + y > 1
Considering the properties discussed in this paper, this operator only verifies two of them:
E8: It is straightforward, following from Proposition 3.8. E11: ETL (NET (x), x) = ETL (1 − x, x) = 1.
Proposition 3.6 Let T , S and N be a t-norm, a t-conorm and a fuzzy negation, respectively. A fuzzy Xor connective can be given by the function ES : U 2 → U, deﬁned by:
ES(x, y) = S(T (N (x), y),T (x, N (y))).	(6)
Proof. The function ES : U 2 → U , given by S(T (N (x), y),T (x, N (y))), satisfies the properties in Definition 3.1:
E1: ES satisfies the commutativity property, that is,
ES(x, y) = S(T (N (x), y),T (x, N (y))) = S(T (N (y), x),T (y, N (x))) = ES(y, x)
which is a consequence of the commutative properties of T and S. E2: Based on the associativity of T and S, it follows that
ES (ES (x, y), z)
= ES (S(T (N (x), y),T (x, N (y))), z)
= S(T (N (S(T (N (x), y),T (x, N (y)))), z),T (S(T (N (x), y),T (x, N (y))),N (z)))
= S(T (N (x)),S(T (N (y), z),T (y, N (z))),T (x, N (S(T (N (y), z),T (y, N (z)))))
= ES (x, S(T (N (y), z),T (y, N (z))))
= ES (x, ES (y, z)).
E3: Considering the boundary conditions T4 and S4 in the definitions of T and S, respectively, it follows that
ES(0, x) = S(T (N (0), x),T (0,N (x))) = S(T (1, x), 0) = S(x, 0) = x.

E4: Considering the boundary conditions T4 and S4 in definitions of T and S, respectively, one has that
ES(1, 1) = S(T (N (1), 1),T (1,N (1))) = S(N (1),N (1)) = S(0, 0) = 0.
 
Example 3.7 Consider the L- ukasiewicz t-norm, defined by TL(x, y) = max(x +
y − 1, 0), the t-conorm (or bounded sum), defined by SL(x, y) = min(x + y, 1), and

the fuzzy negation, given by N (x) = 1 − x (see [44]). The fuzzy Xor operator ESL , canonically obtained as in Eq. (6), can be expressed as:

ESL (x, y) = |x − y|.
This operator satisfies all the properties from E5 to E12. The fuzzy Xor operator ESL coincides with the one introduced in [28] (Table 3), which was presented in the Introduction (see Eq. (1)).
Proposition 3.8 Let T , S and N be a t-norm, a t-conorm and a fuzzy negation, respectively. Then it holds that NET = NES = N.
Proof. It follows that:  NET (x)  =  ET (x, 1)  =  T (S(x, 1),N (T (x, 1)))  = T (1,N (x)) = N (x) and NES (x) = S(T (N (x), 1),T (x, N (1))) = S(N (x),T (x, 0)) = S(N (x), 0) = N (x).	 

Fuzzy Implications Induced by the Fuzzy Xor Con- nective
The fuzzy Xor connective allows us to define two new fuzzy implications, which are presented in the next subsections.

Xor-implications
Proposition 4.1 Let S, N and E be a t-conorm, a fuzzy negation and a fuzzy Xor connective, respectively. Then, the function IE,S,N : U 2 → U, deﬁned by
IE,S,N (x, y) = E(x, S(N (x),N (y))).	(7)
is a fuzzy implication, called a fuzzy Xor-implication.
Proof. It follows that IE,S,N satisfies the following properties:
IE,S,N (0, 0) = E(0, S(N (0),N (0))) = E(0, S(1, 1)) = E(0, 1) = 1;
IE,S,N (0, 1) = E(0, S(N (0),N (1))) = E(0, S(1, 0)) = E(0, 1) = 1;
IE,S,N (1, 1) = E(1, S(N (1),N (1))) = E(1, S(0, 0)) = E(1, 0) = 1;
IE,S,N (1, 0) = E(1, S(N (1),N (0))) = E(1, S(0, 1)) = E(1, 1) = 0.
Therefore, IE,S,N is a fuzzy implication.	 
Proposition 4.2 Let S be a t-conorm and E be a fuzzy Xor connective satisfying the property E6. Then the fuzzy implication IE,S,NE satisﬁes the properties I2 and I5.
Proof. It follows that
I2: IE,S,NE (1, x) = E(1, S(NE(1), NE(x))) = E(1, S(0, NE(x))) = E(1, NE(x)) =
NE(NE(x)) = x.

I5: IE,S,NE (x, 0) = E(x, S(NE(x), NE(0))) = E(x, S(NE(x), 1)) = E(x, 1), which,
by property E6, is a strong fuzzy negation.


E-Implications
Proposition 4.3 Let S, N and E be a t-conorm, a fuzzy negation and a fuzzy Xor connective, respectively. Then the function IS,N,E : U 2 → U, deﬁned by
IS,N,E(x, y) = S(N (x), E(N (x), y)).	(8)
is a fuzzy implication, called a fuzzy E-implication.
Proof. It follows that IS,N,E satisfies the following properties:
IS,N,E(0, 0) = S(N (0), E(N (0), 0)) = S(1, E(1, 0)) = S(1, 1) = 1;
IS,N,E(0, 1) = S(N (0), E(N (0), 1)) = S(1, E(1, 1)) = S(1, 0) = 1;
IS,N,E(1, 1) = S(N (1), E(N (1), 1)) = S(0, E(0, 1)) = S(0, 1) = 1;
IS,N,E(1, 0) = S(N (1), E(N (1), 0)) = S(0, E(0, 0)) = S(0, 0) = 0.
Therefore, IS,N,E is a fuzzy implication.	 
Proposition 4.4 Let S be a t-conorm and E be a fuzzy Xor connective satisfying the property E6. Then the fuzzy implication IS,NE,E satisﬁes the properties I2 and I6.
Proof. It follows that:
I2: IS,NE,E (1, x) = S(NE(1), E(NE(1), x)) = S(0, E(0, x)) = E(0, x) = x.
I5:  IS,NE,E (x, 0) = IS,NE,E (0, x) = S(NE(0), E(NE(0), x)) = S(1, E(1, x)) =
E(x, 1), which, by Property E6, is a strong fuzzy negation.

Automorphism
Definition 5.1 A function ρ : U → U is an automorphism if it is bijective and monotonic, that is: [26,37]
x ≤ y ⇒ ρ(x) ≤ ρ(y).

An equivalent definition is given in [12], where ρ : U → U is an automorphism if it is a continuous and strictly increasing function such that ρ(0) = 0 and ρ(1) = 1.
Denote by Aut(U ) the set of all automorphisms on U .
Automorphisms are closed under composition, that is, if ρ and ρ' are automor- phisms then ρ ◦ ρ'(x) = ρ(ρ'(x)) is also an automorphism.
The inverse of an automorphism is also an automorphism.

The action of ρ on a function F : Un → U , denoted by Fρ, is defined as follows:
Fρ(x1,..., xn) = ρ−1(F (ρ(x1),..., ρ(xn))).	(9)
As it is well known (see, e.g., [12,38]), the action of ρ preserves the fuzzy connec- tives, that is, Sρ,T ρ, Nρ and Iρ are a fuzzy t-conorm, a t-norm, a (strong) negation and an implication, respectively.
Proposition 5.2 If E is a fuzzy Xor connective, then Eρ is also a fuzzy Xor con- nective.
Proof. Considering that E is a fuzzy Xor connective, one has that Eρ satisfies the following properties:
E1: Eρ(x, y) = ρ−1(E(ρ(x), ρ(y))) = ρ−1(E(ρ(y), ρ(x))) = Eρ(y, x), based on the symmetry of E;
E2: One has that
Eρ(x, Eρ(y, z)) = ρ−1(E(ρ(x),ρ ◦ ρ−1(E(ρ(y), ρ(z)))))
= ρ−1(E(ρ(x), E(ρ(y), ρ(z))) = ρ−1(E(E(ρ(x)ρ(y)), ρ(z))),
considering that E satisfies the associativity property, and then it follows that
Eρ(x, Eρ(y, z)) = ρ−1(E(ρ ◦ ρ−1(E(ρ(x)ρ(y)), ρ(z)))) = Eρ(Eρ(x, y), z);
E3: Eρ(0, x) = ρ−1(E(ρ(0), ρ(x))) = ρ−1(E(0, ρ(x))) = ρ−1(ρ(x))) = x, since E
satisfies the 0-Identity property;
E4:  Eρ(1, 1) = ρ−1(E(ρ(1), ρ(1))) = ρ−1(E(1, 1)) = ρ−1(0) = 0, based on the
boundary condition related to E.
Therefore, Eρ is a fuzzy Xor connective, whenever E is a fuzzy Xor connective. 
Proposition 5.3 Let S, N and E be a t-conorm, a fuzzy negation and a fuzzy Xor connective, respectively. Then it holds that ISρ,Nρ,Eρ (x, y) = (IS,N,E)ρ(x, y).
Proof. Considering x, y ∈ U , one has that:
ISρ,Nρ,Eρ (x, y)= Sρ(Nρ(x), Eρ(Nρ(x), y)) by Eq. (8)
= Sρ(ρ−1N (ρ(x)), Eρ(ρ−1N (ρ(x), y))) by Eq. (9)
= Sρ(ρ−1N (ρ(x)), ρ−1E(N (ρ(x), ρ(y)))) by Eq. (9)
= ρ−1S(N (ρ(x)), E(N (ρ(x), ρ(y)))) by Def. 5.1
= ρ−1S(N (ρ(x)), E(N (ρ(x), ρ(y)))) by Eq. (8)
= ρ−1IS,N,E(ρ(x), ρ(y)) = (IS,N,E)ρ(x, y) by Def. 9
 Corollary 5.4 If I is a fuzzy E-implication then Iρ is also a fuzzy E-implication. Proof. It follows from the definition of E-implication and the Property 5.3. 
Proposition 5.5 Let S be a t-conorm, E be a Xor and N be a fuzzy negation. Then it holds that IEρ,Sρ,Nρ (x, y) = (IE,S,N )ρ(x, y).

Proof. Considering x, y ∈ U , one has that
IEρ,Sρ,Nρ (x, y)= Eρ(x, Sρ(Nρ(x),Nρ(y))) by Eq.(8)
= Eρ(x, Sρ(ρ−1N (ρ(x), ρ(y)))) by Eq.(9)
= Eρ(x, ρ−1(S(N (ρ(x)),N (ρ(y))))) by Eq.(9)
= ρ−1E(ρ(x), S(N (ρ(x)),N (ρ(y)))) by Def. 5.1
= ρ−1E(ρ(x), ρ(S(N (x),N (y)))) by Eq.(7)
= ρ−1S(N (ρ(x)), E(N (ρ(x), ρ(y)))) = (IE,S,N )ρ(x, y) by Def. 9
 Corollary 5.6 Let I be a fuzzy E-implication then Iρ is also a fuzzy E-implication. Proof. It follows from the definition of E-implication and Proposition 5.5.	 
Conclusion and Further Work
Fuzzy implications play an important role in fuzzy logic, both in a broad sense (heavily applied to fuzzy control, analysis of vagueness in natural language and techniques of soft-computing) and in a narrow sense (developed as a branch of many-valued logic which are able to investigate deep logical questions).
One of the main contributions of this paper is the introduction of an autonomous definition of the fuzzy Xor connective, independently of the other fuzzy connectives. Also, two canonical constructions of the fuzzy Xor connective, denoted by ET and ES, were obtained by the composition of t-conorms, t-norms and fuzzy negations.
Based on this definition of the fuzzy Xor connective, this paper introduced two new fuzzy implications called Xor-implication and E-implication, denoted by IS,N,E and IE,S,N , respectively.
Moreover, considering an automorphism ρ, we showed that the action of ρ on the fuzzy implications IS,N,E and IE,S,N preserves these connectives, that is, Iρ

and

Important properties, such as commutative and associative properties of Xor- implications and E-implications were considered in this paper, which resulted in a canonical definition concerned with the notions of triangular norms and triangular conorms. Although these implications are still in an early analysis phase, new prop- erties can be explored and general comparisons concerning their relationships with the other interesting implications (R-implications, S-implications, QL-implications, D-implications) can be developed.
The definition of interval-valued Xor-implications and E-implications is an on- going work, following our previous works [8,9,10,16,40,41] on the study of the the various interval-valued implication functions derived from interval t-norms and in- terval t-conorms.
Also, additive and multiplicative generators to obtain the fuzzy Xor connective and the new implications can be considered in further work. So, the investigation of the most important properties preserved under the action of automorphisms and the related interval extension can be carried out.

Finally, since bounded lattices may be considered from the point of view of fuzzy logic, it seems interesting to extend the notions of E-implications and Xor- implications from the unit interval to an arbitrary bounded lattice. The interval extensions of such implications also motivate the study of their general properties on bounded lattices.
