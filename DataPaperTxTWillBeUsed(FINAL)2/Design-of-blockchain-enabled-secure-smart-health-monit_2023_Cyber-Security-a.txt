Smart healthcare technology is transforming from the traditional healthcare system in every manner conceivably. Smart healthcare provides several advantages over the existing approaches. However, it suffers from healthcare data security and privacy issues. As the Internet attackers may get access to sensitive healthcare data through the use of various types of cyber attacks. In this paper, an architecture of a blockchain-enabled secure smart health monitoring system has been presented (in short, it is called as BSSHM). BSSHM consists of various health data monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature, heartbeat, etc., which monitor the real time health data of the different patients. The healthcare data of the patients can be transmitted to the connected health servers in a secure way, where this data can be stored securely for its various uses. The formal security verification of the proposed BSSHM is also done through the widely-accepted Scyther tool. It has been proved that BSSHM is able to defend various potential attacks.





Introduction

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of numerous interconnected devices and gadgets that collect data in real time. We are completely surrounded by IoT gadgets, for example smart home devices. A basic watch that tracks your activities and routines in real time, as well as a temperature sensor that detects your body temperature. One of the next evolutionary steps in internet-based computing is the Internet of Things (IoT). The Internet of Things (IoT) has progressed from a futur- istic concept to a market reality in recent years. IoT has a favourable influence on a wide range of application fields, including healthcare, sustainable living, smart cities, the industrial sector and many more. The analysis of data from many IoT data sources, including as sensors, actuators, smart devices, and other internet-connected things, is referred to as IoT analytics. IoT solutions enable users to gain more automation, analysis and system integration [1]. It is possible to increase these areas and precision by making it more flawless. IoT makes use of technolo- gies such as sensing, networking and robotics. IoT has the potential to transform the way we live and work, making our lives more eﬃcient, convenient and connected. However, due IoT devices generate data in the enormous amount, which may be sensitive in nature. It poses crit- ical problems regarding data privacy, security and ethical implications [2,3]. For example, in smart homes, IoT devices can be used to control and monitor everything from the temperature and lighting to the secu-
rity system and home appliances. Smart cities can use IoT to manage traﬃc flow, monitor air quality, and even track waste management [4]. In industrial settings, IoT can be used to monitor machines and equip- ment, optimize production processes and prevent downtime. In health- care, IoT devices can be used to track patient health data and monitor vital signs, enabling more personalized and remote care [5]. One of the key advantages of IoT is the ability to collect and analyze vast amounts of data in real time. This can help businesses and organizations make more informed decisions, optimize processes and improve eﬃciency. However, it also raises concerns around data privacy and security, as the sheer volume of data generated by IoT devices can be a challenge to manage and protect. Overall, the potential applications of IoT are vast and varied. It is an area of technology that is constantly evolving and expanding. As we continue to integrate more devices and sensors into our daily lives, the possibilities for what IoT can achieve are almost limitless.
The sensor is also known as a transducer. A transducer, often known as a sensor is any device that converts one type of energy into another. A physical occurrence is converted into an electrical impulse that can be interpreted by the sensor or transducer. Also, there are several methods for measuring the same object. The actuator is the second type of trans- ducer. An actuator works in the opposite direction of a sensor. It uses an electrical impulse to execute a physical activity. For example, the temperature sensor can detect the heat. There may be different kinds of

sensors, i.e., temperature sensor, distance sensor, optical sensors, light sensor and environmental sensor [6–8].
The practical implementation of IoT has been made possible by re- cent advancements in several different technologies.
They include the availability of low-cost, dependable sensors that require little power, making them more accessible to manufacturers.
Low-cost and low-power sensors that can easily link to the cloud and other devices through various network protocols make this possible.
Cloud systems also make it simple to scale up infrastructure without having to manage it all.
Companies may use advanced machine learning and analytics to ac- quire insights quicker by leveraging massive volumes of data stored in the cloud.
Moreover, neural network improvements have enabled natural- language processing in IoT devices, making them more desirable and cheap for home usage.
All these allied technologies are pushing the boundaries of IoT and driving its growth. IoT has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry by providing eﬃcient and timely medical atten- tion to patients. Many patients do not receive timely medical atten- tion due to various reasons, such as the inability to identify diseases, high medical fees, living in remote areas, etc. This delay in treat- ment can have adverse effects on patients’ health, and many people may not even be aware of a severe illness until a critical event oc- curs. IoT can address this issue by monitoring patients’ health and alerting them about any potential health threats. For instance, patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases can have their heart rate and blood pressure monitored by IoT devices, while diabetic patients can track their sugar levels regularly for effective medication. This way, pa- tients can receive the necessary medical attention before a critical event occurs [9,10].
Following are the applications and uses of IoT in healthcare. Some- times it is also called as Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) [10].
IoMT devices can monitor patients’ health continuously and transmit the data in real-time to healthcare providers for remote monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment.
Patients can use wearable IoT devices to track their health metrics, such as heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and activity levels, to manage chronic conditions and receive timely interven- tions.
IoMT-enabled medical equipment, such as smart beds and infusion pumps can improve patient safety and reduce errors.
IoMT devices can help with medication adherence by remind- ing patients to take their medications on time and in the correct dosage.
Healthcare providers can use IoMT-enabled inventory management systems to monitor medical supplies and reduce waste.
IoT devices can enable telehealth services, providing patients with access to remote medical consultations and follow-ups.
By analyzing large amounts of patient data, IoT devices can help identify patterns and insights to improve healthcare delivery and outcomes.
There are many IoT devices which have infrared temperature sensor which can detect human body temperature.
People with diabetes can benefit greatly from using IoT medical de- vices that can monitor their glucose levels continuously and provide real-time data to their healthcare providers. These devices can be worn on the body or attached to the skin, allowing patients to mon- itor their glucose levels frequently and accurately without the need for invasive blood tests.
The introduction of modern hearing aids has revolutionized the way people with hearing problems can improve their hearing. These new hearing aids incorporate advanced technology, such as bluetooth connectivity, digital signal processing, and noise-cancellation fea-
tures, to provide a more natural and personalized hearing experi- ence.

Motivation

The BSSHM is helpful to observe the physiological condition of a patient. It then sends the monitored healthcare data to the connected health server. At the health server can be used for various purposes, i.e., getting the knowledge about the health of the patient remotely or make some predictions about the health of the patient. Whatever data the smart healthcare devices and health servers exchange that happens in the secure way through the steps of the used authentication and key establishment mechanism of the BSSHM. Therefore, it can protect the system against various possible cyber attacks.
Research contributions

Following are the research contributions of the paper.
In this paper, an architecture of the blockchain-enabled secure smart health monitoring system is proposed (in short BSSHM).
The threat model related to the BSSHM is then provided.
The formal security verification of the BSSHM is done through the widely-accepted Scyther tool. It has proved that BSSHM is able to defend various potential attacks.
Then in the end, a testbed of the BSSHM is provided to check its usability in the real-time.

Paper outline

The outline of the paper is as follows. The relevant related work has been discussed in Section 2. We present an architecture associated to the blockchain-enabled secure smart health monitoring system includ- ing the network and threat models in Section 3. We then discuss various phases in details related to the proposed framework in Section 4. We per- form the formal security verification using broadly-used automated soft- ware validation tool, namely Scyther in Section 5. Additionally, a practi- cal implementation of the proposed framework in Section 6 along with the blockchain implementation in Section 7. At the end, in Section 8, some concluding remarks and future research have been discussed.
Literature review

In recent years, access control, authentication and key management become primary security services in several networking environments [11–16].
Access control in smart devices is a very pressing and important topic, and it is also a trending technology to safeguard access and se- cure data. As a result, different studies and surveys in the field of access control have been offered. Rana et.al [17] exhibited an access control approach. They also provided a model in which they indicated that the astute health clinical framework was expected to have a significant in- fluence on the nature of medical care administrations.
Pal et al [18] They proposed a method for “user authentication that used symmetric key cryptography. They discovered a safe method that was both simple and inexpensive.” Roy et.al [19] “developed the notion of multi-cloud server access control, claiming to be the first fine-grained data access control system”.
The lightweight authentication approaches for IoT-based healthcare applications were presented at Merabet [20] et al. They formally vali- dated the security of “their approaches using the AVISPA and ProVerif programmes. They have also released the security analysis for their plan. The performance of the aforementioned schemes was also compared to that of other comparable schemes. These systems were eventually shown to be vulnerable to session key computation attacks utilising the CK-adversary model and sophisticated replay attacks. They also did not meet other crucial security and functionality standards.”

Thapliyal et al. [4] discussed sustainable smart healthcare system in which health services may be delivered to patients in remote locations via Internet. They suggested to use biodegradable, recyclable, and en- vironmentally friendly healthcare equipment and goods, which operate with minimal power use. They provided significant benefits over the traditional healthcare system.
Jang et al. [21] explored the wireless body area network security re- quirements (WBAN). They also suggested a hybrid security method for WBANs. Their approach, however, did not support the anonymity at- tribute. Moreover, it lacked support for other critical security and func- tionality requirements. He and Zeadally [22] presented a system archi- tecture of the ambient assisted living system (AAL) system. Its associated security requirements were explored. After that, they suggested an effec- tive authentication strategy for the AAL system. Finally, they compared the performance of their plan to that of two other comparable schemes in order to highlight its benefits and limitations.

Architecture of blockchain-enabled secure smart health monitoring system

In this section, we provide the details of the architecture of the pro- posed BSSHM along with the information of potential threats/ attacks.

Network model of BSSHM

Fig. 1 shows the architecture of the proposed BSSHM. In the given scenario, there are smart healthcare devices which are connected to users like patient, doctors, nurses or some other related entities through health server. Smart healthcare devices collect data and then send it to the health server for further processing, storage and analysis [23]. Entire exchange of the data happens in the secure way through the deployed authentication and session key establishment. The function of the health server is critical here since it processes and saves healthcare data. This healthcare data may then be used to generate valuable outputs (for ex- ample, prediction of a disease) through some machine learning models that can be deployed over the health servers [24–26].

Threat model of BSSHM

In proposed BSSHM, we follow guidelines of widely accepted “Dolev- Yao (DY) model [27].” The communicating entities communicate over an insecure (open) or public channel, according to this model. As a re- sult, network attacker (adversary) A has the ability to intercept the ex- changed messages. Afterwards, A may leak, update, or delete the mes- sages exchanged. In addition, different malware attacks are conceivable in such an environment. The registration authority/trusted authority has

full access to control the smart devices 𝑆𝐷𝑖 and users of the architec- ture for the registering them on it. Only the authorised devices/users
get access to the different resources of the system.

BSSHM: Proposed framework

The proposed BSSHM is designed in several phases, i.e., “registra- tion phase,” where we conduct the registration of devices and servers. The registration has been done the trusted authority of the system. An- other important phase is “multi-factor authentication procedure”, where
tween the legitimate smart healthcare device 𝐻𝐷𝑖, and health server the mutual authentication and key establishments are performed be-
𝐻𝑆𝑗 , and 𝐻𝑆𝑗 and the registered genuine user 𝑈𝑘. This task can be per-
phase, there is session key establishment 𝑆𝐾𝑈𝑘 ,𝐻 𝑆𝑗 between 𝑈𝑘 and 𝐻𝑆𝑗 formed through the steps mentioned in [6]. After the completion of this and also another session key establishment 𝑆𝐾𝑆𝐷𝑖 ,𝐻 𝑆𝑗 between 𝑆𝐷𝑖 and
𝐻𝑆𝑗 . Further, there is another important phase that is blockchain imple-
monitoring system as 𝐵𝐶𝑆𝑀𝑆 . The 𝐵𝐶𝑆𝑀𝑆 stores the data of the pro- mentation process, in which we get the blockchain of the smart health
posed system in the form of some blocks. This data can be further uti- lized to make various health predictions. The details of the notations used in the proposed BSSHM are provided in Table 1. The details of the proposed BSSHM are give below.

Registration of devices and servers
There is a trusted registration authority 𝑇 𝐴, which does the regis-
registration authority 𝑇 𝐴 for the registration of the users, devices and tration of the other entities of the network. It mandatory to use trusted servers. Because if we use 𝑇 𝐴 for that task then the secret credentials of
the entities become safe and secure and can not be revealed to A in any case. The registration of devices and servers is conducted as follows.
The trusted registration authority 𝑇 𝐴 registers the smart healthcare device 𝑆𝐷𝑖 and stores the registration information in its memory through some secure mean. Then 𝑆𝐷𝑖 is deployed as per the needs.
𝑇 𝐴 registers the health server 𝐻𝑆𝑗 and stores the registration infor-
mation in its database.
The details of registration process are provided in Algorithm 1.

Multi-factor authentication procedure

We need multi-factor authentication procedure to make the proposed BSSHM more secure. As it uses three factors to check the authenticity of a user. On the basis of three used factors, the system allows or stops the users to enter into the system. The required multi-factor authentication procedure in BSSHM is conducted as follows.
With the help of username 𝑈𝑁𝑀𝑈𝑘 , password 𝑃 𝑊 𝐷𝑈𝑘  and one- time password (OTP) 𝑂𝑇 𝑃𝑈𝑘 the registered user 𝑈𝑘 can login into
the system.
𝑈𝑘 performs the steps of authentication and session key establish- ment (i.e., session key 𝑆𝐾𝑈𝑘 ,𝐻 𝑆𝑗 ). For the computation and estab-

Formal security verification using Scyther tool

The details of formal security verification using the Scyther tool is provided in this section. The formal security verification of the BSSHM is performed through scyther tool [28–30]. It is better than the other tools, like, ProVerif and AVISPA. Scyther provides prediction on the basis of various cryptographic assumptions. It implies that an attacker would be unable to decipher the encrypted data without the secret key. Via the us- age of Security Protocol Descriptive Language (SPDL), Scyther simulates user-defined security protocols. The Scyther tool follows the Dolev-Yao (DY) model plus nine more adversarial models, including the eCK model and the CK model.
The tests offered by Scyther are said to validate security aspects like “secrecy, authentication, synchronisation, aliveness, weak agreement, and agreement.” In BSSHM, there are some basic roles for the “authenti- cation and key agreement phase,” i.e., SD (for smart healthcare device) and HS (for health server). The steps of BSSHM are coded via SPDL. Scyther takes the SPDL file as input and executes various analyses on the BSSHM. The SPDL snippet of the BSSHM is given in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 depicts

the outcome of the Scyther tool. Upon examination, it was determined that the BSSHM is protected by the aforementioned claims.

Practical implementation of BSSHM

In this section, we provide the details practical implementation of the proposed BSSHM. In BSSHM, we have worked on the smart temper- ature monitoring device. The non-contact infrared temperature sensors can measure body temperature without physical contact, making them a useful tool for identifying those who may have a fever and potentially be infected with the virus. However, it’s important to note that fever is not always a reliable indicator of some viral infection, i.e., COVID-19. As some infected individuals may not have a fever, and some non-infected individuals may have a fever for other reasons. Therefore, it’s important to use a combination of different screening measures to identify poten- tially infected individuals. IoT has brought about a significant change in

the way we live our lives. It has enabled the development of various sys- tems that can be monitored and controlled from remote locations. The proposed scheme utilizes the power of IoT to create a temperature moni- toring device that is based on Raspberry Pi and MLX90614 [5]. Through which the temperature of a subject (i.e., a human user-patient) can be monitored in a smart way without making the physical contact. The
readings of the temperature are available 24 ×7 hours in a web-based
software tool or in the form of a smartphone application. Therefore, the
physiological symptoms of a patient can be monitored easily with the help of the implemented system.
The details of system specifications are given in Table 2. We have used Windows 10 as the platform along with processor AMD Ryzen 5 5600H with Radeon Graphics 3.30 GHz. The programming environ- ment was Python 3. The online storage was Google firebase real-time database. The random-access memory (RAM) size was 8.00 GB along with Pyrebase for firebase libraries.
The hardware requirements are given in Table 3. We have used Mi- croSD Card for booting up the Raspberry Pi. There was a Raspberry Pi case to protect and hold the Raspberry Pi. Moreover, there was a HDMI cable to connect the Raspberry Pi to a monitor or TV. Again a keyboard

and mouse was used to control the RasSpberry Pi. A Wi-Fi dongle has been used to connect the Raspberry Pi to the Internet in case of any needs. The light-emitting diodes (LEDs) display were used for indicat- ing the status of the device. The breadboard was deployed for prototyp- ing and testing purposes. We also used jumper wires for connecting the components together. There was a power supply (5V,2A/3A) to provide the power supply to the Raspberry Pi and other associated components. It is important to ensure that all components are compatible with the Raspberry Pi and that they are of good quality to ensure the smooth execution of the experiments. A view of implemented testbed of the
BSSHM is given in Fig. 4.

Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is a small, credit card-sized computer designed for educational/experimentation purposes, which has gained popular- ity among developers and hobbyists for its affordable price and im- pressive specifications. It features onboard Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a pro- grammable GPIO header, making it ideal for learning programming skills, building hardware projects, and even industrial use. Raspberry Pi boards can run a variety of operating systems, including various ver- sions of Linux, Windows 10 IoT Core, and others. They are popular for a wide range of projects, including media centers, game consoles and home automation systems.

380° C, with an accuracy of ±0.5° C. The MLX90614 is a popular sensor for a wide range of applications, including temperature measurement
in industrial, automotive, and medical equipment. It is also commonly used in hobbyist projects, such as building a contactless thermometer or integrating temperature sensing into a home automation system. One of the key advantages of the MLX90614 is its non-contact nature, which makes it useful in situations where physical contact with a temperature sensor is not possible or desirable.
The view of real time sensed healthcare data on the web page is given in Fig. 5. It shows ambient temperature as 29°C and object (i.e., patient) temperature as 39°C.

Implementation of blockchain phase

Here, the details of the implementation of blockchain phase of the BSSHM are given [31,32]. Since the proposed BSSHM processes and stores the sensitive healthcare data. Therefore, under these circum- stances, it is mandatory to maintain the secrecy of the sensitive health- care data. Otherwise, the sensitive healthcare data may be leaked, or updated in an authorised way. Blockchain is a distributed ledger tech- nology, which maintains the data in the form of blocks and each block contains some information inside them. Due to such mechanism of stor- ing the data in the blockchain, we can store the healthcare data in the form of certain number of encrypted transactions. Due to the encrypted transactions, the revealing and updating of healthcare is not possible for
A. Hence the sensitive healthcare data is protected due to the deploy- ment of blockchain technology in the proposed BSSHM. Various scenar- ios are considered during the simulation study. It is implemented on a “Windows 10 64-bit system with an Intel (R) core i5-8250U processor
running at 1.60 GHz-1.80 GHz.” This system contains random-access memory (RAM) of 8 GB. “Eclipse IDE 2019-12” has been utilized for the platform part and the Java langauge is used for coding. The number of “smart healthcare devices” taken in each scenario as 15 (in case-1), 30 (in case-2), and 45 (in case-3). Number of blocks consider as 5 in case-1, 10 in case-2, and 15 in case-3. The number of users are taken as 10 in case-1, 20 in case-2, and 40 in case-3. Moreover, 4 miner nodes in each case are taken. The details of the estimated results are given below.
Calculation of computational time: In all considered cases, the impact of increasing number of users and healthcare devices was computed in the form of computation time (in seconds). For exam- ple, for case-1, case-2, and case-3, the appraise computational time (in seconds) are 4.25, 5.50, and 6.12, respectively. The results are depicted in Fig. 6. It’s important to mention that the “computational time” has increment when “number of smart healthcare devices” and “number of users” increases when we go from case-1 to case-2 and case-2 to case-3. That happened because “creation and addition of more number of blocks in the blockchain” were required under those circumstances.
Calculation of transactions per second (TPS): In all considered cases, the impact of increasing number of users and healthcare de- vices was also estimated in the form of transactions per second (TPS). For example, for case-1, case-2, and case-3, the appraise TPS values are 118, 182, and 245, respectively. The results are depicted in Fig. 7.

It’s important to note that the number of transactions per second (TPS) increases as the blockchain expands in size with more num- ber of smart healthcare devices, and users. That happened because “creation and addition of more number of blocks in the blockchain” were required under those circumstances. Eventually, that increases the value of TPS.

Conclusion and future scope

The smart health monitoring system is an important aspect of health- care as it is used to diagnose and treat various illnesses and conditions. In this paper, an architecture of the blockchain-enabled secure smart health monitoring system was presented. The threat model related to the BSSHM was given. The formal security verification of the BSSHM is done through Scyther tool. It has proved that BSSHM is able to defend various potential attacks. Finally, a testbed of the BSSHM was imple- mented to check its usability in the real-time.
In future, we would like to add more features in the proposed BSSHM. In addition, the Big data analytics in cloud computing environ- ment for the discussed smart health monitoring system would be helpful as it was performed in [33].
