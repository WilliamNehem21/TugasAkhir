Abstract
Determining whether a quantum state is separable or entangled is a problem of fundamental importance in quantum information science. This is a brief review in which we consider the problem for states in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. We show how the problem becomes tractable for a class of Gaussian states.
Keywords: Quantum Entanglement, Quantum Algorithms, Quantum Complexity.


Introduction
The concept of entanglement arose with the question of completeness of quantum theory [1]. Nowadays entanglement is regarded as a fundamental property of certain quantum states and it appears to be an important physical resource. In some sense, entanglement is synonymous of inseparability because entangled states possess some global properties that cannot be explained in terms of only the parties (subsystems) of the system. Roughly speaking, entangled states possess “strong” correlations among parties that cannot be explained within any classical local theory (because these would imply an instantaneous action at distance). Separable states may also exhibit correlations among parties, but these are purely classical and local, hence “weaker” than those underlying entanglement.

Recently, the role of entanglement became important and often necessary in many different contexts like quantum algorithms, quantum communication proto- cols, quantum cryptography, etc. (see e.g. [2]). So, the problem of deciding whether a given quantum state is separable or entangled has become of uppermost impor- tance. This can be called the Quantum Separability Problem (QSP). Essentially, it represents an instance of a combinatorial optimization problems called the Weak Membership Problem [3].
Although there exists a number of characterizations of separability, there is still no feasible procedure to solve QSP in its generality (see e.g. [4] and references therein). Concerning its computational complexity, QSP is a “difficult” problem. In fact, QSP has been proved to be NP-hard [5]. However, if we restrict ourselves to specific classes of quantum states, there are examples in which QSP can be efficiently solved. For instance, this is the case of states in Hilbert space of dimension 2 or 3
[6] and certain finite sets of states [7].
In infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, Gaussian states give rise to an important class of states for which QSP is “easy” (see e.g. [8,9] and the reference therein). In this paper, we review the formulation of QSP for infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces and we show how to tackle the problem for the class of Gaussian states.
The paper is organized as follow. In Sec.2 we review some basic notions of Quantum Theory. In Sec. 3 we formalize the QSP. In Sec.4 we introduce the Gaussian states. In Sec.5 we develop a criterion for separability of Gaussian states. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in Sec.6.

Basic Notions of Quantum Theory
In this section, we introduce some terms and notions of Quantum Mechanics needed to approach the paper. Of course, the expert reader may skip this section.
In its standard formulation, Quantum Theory takes place in Hilbert spaces [10]. A Hilbert space H is a vector space over the field of complex numbers C endowed with an inner product (which induces a norm), that can have finite or infinite dimension. We use the so-called Dirac notation for a vector |ψ ⟩. Its dual is ⟨ ψ|. Then, the inner product between two st ates |ψ ⟩ and |φ ⟩ reads ⟨ ψ|φ ⟩ ∈ C. The
mathematical representation of quantum states:
Postulate 2.1 The space of states of a physical system is a Hilbert space. The states are described by unit norm vectors in such Hilbert space.
Postulate 2.2 The space of states of a composite system is the tensor product of Hilbert spaces of subsystems.
The structure of Hilbert space naturally leads, when considering composite sys- tems, to the concept of entanglement. In fact, there exist states of the whole system that cannot be factorized into states of the subsystems.
Example 2.1 Let |ψ⟩1, |ψ⊥⟩1 be two orthogonal states in H1 and |η⟩2, |η⊥⟩2 be two orthogonal states in H2. Then, |ψ⟩1 ⊗ |η⟩2 ∈ H1 ⊗ H2 as well as (a|ψ⟩1 ⊗ |η⟩2 +

b |ψ⊥⟩1 ⊗ |η⊥⟩2) ∈ H1 ⊗ H2, with a, b ∈ C. The first can be factorized into states of the subsystems; this is not the case for the second one.
It is fashinating that this seemingly abstract mathematical notion has a large impact in the description of the quantum mechanical world.
The above postulates can be generalized in terms of mixture of states, {pj, |ψj ⟩}, where pj denotes for the probability for the system to be in the state |ψj⟩. This can be done by introducing the notion of density operator :
Definition 2.2 A density operator ρˆ is a non-negative, self-adjoint, trace-one class operator which is also positive semi-definite (that is ⟨ ψ|ρˆ|ψ ⟩≥ 0 ∀|ψ ⟩∈ H.


Thus we can represent the mixture {pj, |ψj ⟩} by the density operator
j pj|ψj ⟩⟨ ψj|.
ρˆ =

Definition 2.3 A state ρˆ of a composite bipartite system is said to be separable iff it can be written in the form
ρˆ = Σ pjρˆ(1) ⊗ ρˆ(2),	(1)

with non-negative pj’s such that Σ
pj = 1, and where ρˆ(1), ρˆ(2) are density opera-

The physical quantities of a system that can (in principle) be measured are called observables. The next postulate fixes the mathematical representation of observables:
Postulate 2.3 To physical observables correspond self-adjoint operators. The pos- sible measurement results on the observable O are the eigenvalues of the associated self-adjoint operator Oˆ. The expectation value is ⟨Oˆ⟩ ≡ Tr(Oˆρˆ).
Restrictions on expectation values are imposed by the following famous principle:
Principle 2.1 (The Uncertainty Principle) Any two observables A and B in
H must satisfy, for all quantum states, the following inequality:
⟨(ΔA^)2⟩⟨(ΔB^)2⟩ ≥	 ⟨[A^, B^]⟩ ,	(2)
where ΔO^ ≡ O^ − ⟨O^⟩ and [A^, B^] ≡ A^B^ − B^A^ is the commutator.
The Quantum Separability Problem
In this section we introduce the Quantum Separability Problem. Let us consider a quantum system with two parties associated to a Hilbert space 1  2 ∼= CM CN . Notice that such a Hilbert space is isomorphic to RM N and it is endowed with the Euclidea n inner product (Xˆ, Yˆ ) ≡ Tr(Xˆ Yˆ ) which induces the corresponding norm

of all density operators. The set of bipartite separable quantum states, S ⊂ D, is defined as the convex hull of the separable pure states {|ψ⟩1⟨ψ|⊗|η⟩2⟨η|} where |ψ⟩1 (resp. |η⟩2) is a normalized vector in CM (resp. CN ). An arbitrary density matrix in D is parametrized by M 2N 2 − 1 real variables. Since we deal with continuous quantities, in defining the separability problem we cannot allow infinite precision, so we need to introduce a precision parameter δ ∈ R+.
Definition 3.1 [The Quantum Separability Problem] Given ρˆ ∈D and a precision
δ assert either ρˆ is:

Separable: there exists a separable state σˆ such that or
ρˆ − σˆ 	δ

Entangled: there exists an entangled state τˆ such that
ρˆ − τˆ 
< 1 .

In this formulation, this problem is equivalent to an instance of a combinato- rial optimization problem called Weak Membership Problem [3]. In its complete generality, QSP has been shown to be NP-hard [5]. Thus, any devised test for sep- arability is likely to require a number of computational steps that increases very quickly with M and N . For MN ≤ 6 the positivity under Partial Transpose (see the next section) represents a necessary and sufficient test [6]. Otherwise, there only exist sufficient ‘one-sided’ tests for separability. In these tests, the output of some polynomial-time computable function of ρˆ can indicate that this is certainly entangled or certainly separable, but not both (see e.g. [4] and reference therein).

Gaussian States
In this section we introduce Gaussian states. Let us now move to M, N → ∞, thus considering two infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces H1 and H2. In such spaces we can introduce continuous spectrum self-adjoint operators corresponding to canonical position and momentum variables [10]. Let us arrange them into four-dimensional column vectors
vˆT = (qˆ1, pˆ1, qˆ2, pˆ2),	zT = (x1, y1, x2, y2).
The operators in vˆ obey commutation relations [10] that take the compact form
[vˆα, vˆβ]= i Ωαβ,	α, β = 1, 2, 3, 4,	(3)


with
Ω= ⎛ J 0 ⎞ ,	J = ⎛
0 1 ⎞ .	(4)

⎝ 0 J ⎠
⎝ −1 0 ⎠

There is a one-to-one correspondence between density operators and c-number
Wigner distribution functions in phase space [11], the space of variables z, i.e. R4, in this case.

Definition 4.1 For a given density operator ρˆ in H1 and H2 the corresponding Wigner function is defined as follows
W (z) := Tr ρˆTˆ(z) ,	(5)


where

Tˆ(z) :=  1 	d4z' exp iz'T (vˆ	z) .	(6) (2π)4



In turn, it results

A density operator
ρˆ = ∫ d4z W (z)Tˆ(z).	(7)
ρˆ has finite second order moments if Tr(ρˆqˆ2) < ∞ and

Tr(ρˆpˆ2) < ∞ for all j. In this case we can define the vector mean m as
m :=Tr(ρˆvˆ)
= ∫ d4zz W (z),	(8)
and the real symmetric correlation matrix V as
1
Vαβ := 2 ⟨{Δvˆα, Δvˆβ}⟩,	α, β = 1, 2, 3, 4,	(9)
where {Δvˆα, Δvˆβ}≡ ΔvˆαΔvˆβ + ΔvˆβΔvˆα is the anticommutator. It results


Vαβ
= Tr ρˆ 1 {Δvˆ

, Δvˆβ} 

= ∫ d4z (z − m)α (z − m)β W (z).	(10)
A given V is the correlation matrix a physical state iff it satisfies
i
K ≡ V + 2 Ω ≥ 0,	(11)
as consequence of the Uncertainty Principle 2 and commutation relation (3). The correlation matrix forms a 4×4 matrix that transforms as an irreducible second rank tensor under the linear canonical (symplectic) transformations and has 4 invariants. If we write the correlation matrix in the block form
V = ⎛ A C ⎞ ,	(12)
⎝ CT B ⎠
3 Throughout the paper, if not specified, the integration is intended from −∞ to +∞.

the invariants are det A, det B, det C and Tr(AJCJBJCT J ). The condition (11) implies A ≥ 1/4 and B ≥ 1/4. Moreover, Eq.(11) can be read as


det A det B − Tr(AJCJBJCT J ) −
1
(det A + det B)+ 
4
1	2
4 − det C
≥ 0.	(13)

It is also worth remarking that any correlation matrix can be brought into the standard form
⎛ a	c	⎞
V = ⎜	a	d ⎟ ,	(14)
⎜ c	b	⎟
⎝	d	b ⎠
with a, b, c, d ∈ R, by effecting suitable local canonical transformations correspond- ing to some element of Sp(2, R)× Sp(2, R) ⊂ Sp(4, R). Now we are ready to give the definition of Gaussian state:
Definition 4.2 A state ρˆ is called Gaussian if its Wigner function takes the form

	1		1

T	−1

W (z)= 4π2√det V exp
− 2 (z − m) V
(z − m)
,	(15)

with m a real 4-vector and V a real symmetric 4 × 4 -matrix.
One can show that m is indeed the mean and V is the correlation matrix. These define the Gaussian state uniquely. In what follows, we simply consider the case m = 0, because m can be easily removed by some local displacement and thus has no influence on the separability or inseparability of the state.

A separability criterion for Gaussian states
In this section, we describe how to solve QSP for Gaussian states. Let us consider a separable state ρˆsep of the form (1) in the Hilbert space H1 ⊗ H2. Let us choose a generic couple of observables for each subsystem, say rˆj, sˆj on Hj (j = 1, 2), with
Cˆj = i [rˆj, sˆj] ,	j = 1, 2 .	(16) Then, we introduce the following observables on H1 ⊗ H2:
uˆ = a1rˆ1 + a2rˆ2 ,
vˆ = b1sˆ1 + b2sˆ2 ,	(17)
with aj, bj ∈ R. From the the Uncertainty Principle 2, it follows that every state ρˆ on H1 ⊗ H2 must satisfy
2	2	|a1b1⟨Cˆ1⟩ + a2b2⟨Cˆ2⟩|2

⟨(Δuˆ) ⟩⟨(Δvˆ) ⟩≥ 
.	(18)
4

However, for separable states, a stronger bound exists. We have in fact the following theorem [12]:
Theorem 5.1 For any separable state the following implication holds:
ρˆsep	=⇒	⟨(Δuˆ)2⟩⟨(Δvˆ)2⟩≥ W2 ,	(19)


where
W = 1 |a b |W + |a b |W  ,	(20)

with
2	1 1	1
2 2	2

Wj ≡	pk |⟨Cˆj ⟩k| ,	j = 1, 2,	(21)
k
being ⟨Cˆj ⟩k ≡ Tr[ Cˆj ρˆ(j)].
The theorem can be proved with the help of a family of linear inequalities
α⟨(Δuˆ)2⟩ + β⟨(Δvˆ)2⟩ ≥ 2√αβ W,	α, β ∈ R+,	(22) which must be always satisfied by separable states. The convolution of such relations
gives the condition (19), representable by a region in the ⟨(Δuˆ)2⟩, ⟨(Δvˆ)2⟩ plane delimited by an hyperbola.
Notice that, since



k	k
the following inequalities hold
1	ˆ	ˆ
≥ 1 |a b ⟨Cˆ ⟩ + a b ⟨Cˆ ⟩| .	(24)
In particular, Eq. (24) tells us that the bound (19) for separable states is much stronger than Eq. (18) for generic states. Moreover, Eq. (24) gives us a simple separability criterion. In fact, while W is not easy to evaluate directly, as it depends on the type of convex decomposition (1) that one is considering, the right hand side of Eq. (24) is easily measurable, as it depends on the expectation value of
the observables Cˆj . Then, we can claim that Eq.(19) is a necessary criterion for
separability, i.e.
2	2	2

⟨(Δuˆ) ⟩⟨(Δvˆ) ⟩ < W
=⇒	ρˆ
entangled .	(25)

Example 5.2 An important simplification applies when the observable Cˆj is pro- portional to the identity operator, e.g. rˆj ≡ qˆj and sˆj ≡ pˆj. In sucha case, Eq.(18) reduces to
2	2	1
⟨(Δuˆ) ⟩⟨(Δvˆ) ⟩≥ 4 ,	(26)

while Eq.(19) reduces to

⟨(Δuˆ) ⟩⟨(Δvˆ) ⟩ ≥ 1 ,	(27)

Let us now consider the case in which rˆj, sˆj are linear combinations of canonical observables qˆj and pˆj, i.e.
a3	b3
rˆ ≡ qˆ +	pˆ	sˆ ≡ pˆ +	qˆ
1	1	a1 1	1	1	b1 1

a4	b4
rˆ ≡ qˆ +	pˆ	sˆ ≡ pˆ +	qˆ
,	(28)

2	2	a2 2	2	2	b2 2
where a3, a4, b3, b4 ∈ R are generic real parameters. Then Eq. (19), taking into account Eq.(3), becomes


⟨(Δu) ⟩⟨(Δv)
1
a b − a b | + |a b
— a b | 2,	(29)

⟩ ≥ 4
that should be compared with
| 1 1	3 3
2 2	4 4

⟨(Δu) ⟩ + ⟨(Δv) ⟩≥ |a1b1 − a3b3| + |a2b2 − a4b4| .	(30)
It is easy to verify that, given aj, bj (j = 1,... , 4), the “product condition” (29) implies the “sum condition” (30). However, if we require Eqs. (29) and (30) to be verified for all possible values of the coefficients aj, bj, the two are equivalent since it is possible to re-obtain one from another using a convolution trick, like the used with Eqs.(19) and (22) (the one-to-one correspondence between quadratic and linear tests under all circumstances has been also pointed out in Ref.[13]).
It turns out that the restriction
⟨(Δu)2⟩ + ⟨(Δv)2⟩≥ |a1b1 − a3b3| + |a2b2 − a4b4|,	∀aj, bj ∈ R,	(31) is necessary and sufficient for separability of Gaussian states [14,15].
However, solving QSP by testing the condition (31) would be hard from a com-
plexity point of view, due to the presence of the universal quantifier at right hand side.
Nevertheless, the condition (31) can be rephrased in a simpler way. First notice that the uncertainty relation satisfied by all (separable and inseparable) states
2	2	1	2
⟨(Δu) ⟩⟨(Δv) ⟩≥ 4 |a1b1 − a3b3 + a2b2 − a4b4| ,	(32)
and corresponding to uˆ and vˆ formed from Eq.(19), is equivalent to
⟨(Δu)2⟩ + ⟨(Δv)2⟩≥ |a1b1 − a3b3 + a2b2 − a4b4|,	(33) as much as like Eqs.(29) and (30).
Then, what is the relation between conditions (30) and (33)?

They are simply related by the partial transpose transform


PT :
vˆ −→ Λvˆ,	Λ= diag(1, 1, 1, −1).	(34)

This operation inverts pˆ2, leaving qˆ1, pˆ1, and qˆ2 unchanged 4 . In fact, separable states satisfies the usual uncertainty relation (33) and the analogous one obtained under partial transpose; thus these satisfy the condition (30).
On the other hand, the transformation (34) changes the correlation matrix as
V → V˜ = ΛV Λ. Hence, the compact uncertainty relation (11) becomes
V˜ +  i Ω	0.	(35)
2


Expressed in terms of invariants, the condition (35) for V˜
takes a form identical to

(13). The signature in front of det C in the second term on the left hand side is changed. Thus, if we write
 1	 2

f (V ) := det A det B +
4 −| det C|

— tr(AJCJBJC
1
J ) − 4 (det A + det B),	(36)

the requirement that the correlation matrix of a separable state has to obey (35), in addition to the fundamental uncertainty principle (11), can be stated as follow
Theorem 5.3 A bipartite Gaussian state is separable iff f (V ) ≥ 0.
The necessity follows from theorem 5.1. The sufficiency follows from the fact that Gaussian states with correlation matrix having det C ≥ 0 are separable [14].
The statement 5.3 is equivalent to the condition (31), but much more effective to be used.
Given the standard form (14) of the correlation matrix V we can consider the space of all possible Gaussian states as isomorphic to R4, while the set of physical states is a subspace G ⊂ R4 defined through (11). Furthermore, the equation f (V )= 0 reads
f (V )= 4(ab − c2)(ab − d2) − (a2 + b2) − 2|cd|− 1 = 0.	(37)
The equation defines the surface S of the subset S ⊂ G of separable states. Then, by simply evaluating f we can say whether a given state (point in G) is within S (hence separable) or not (hence entangled). This is an easy computational task that can be efficiently accomplished. In reality, taking into account a finite accuracy δ, we can only say that the state is almost separable (resp. almost entangled) within δ. Nevertheless, if we want to assert that the state is strictly separable (resp. strictly

4 The partial transposition of a density matrix, i.e. the transposition with respect to the subsystem 2, is equivalent to a mirror reflection in the phase space subsystem 2. That is, ρˆ → ρˆT2 ⇔ W (x1, y1, x2, y2) → W (x1, y1, x2, −y2).

entangled), we have to be sure that the distance of the state ρˆ from the surface S
is greater than 1/δ. That is

min
ρˆ ∈S
ρˆ	ρˆ' >		. δ
(38)

'
According to Sec.3, the distance between two states is considered as ρˆ − ρˆ	≡ 
Tr [(ρˆ − ρˆ')2] and for Gaussian states this can be expressed through Wigner func- tions (hence correlation matrices) as
ρˆ − ρˆ'  = ∫ d4z W (z) − W '(z) 2 .	(39)
Such a task can be efficiently accomplished with the aid of geometrical arguments and simple algorithms. For instance, a software package that efficiently find all hyperplanes tangent to the surface S, from which evaluate the l.h.s. of Eq.(38), is already available [16].

Conclusions
Summarizing, we have given a brief review of QSP for Gaussian states of two parties. The problem has been approached by developing tests that involve variances to arrive at an efficient solution based on the invariance (positivity) of only separable states under partial transpose. Notice that this argument can be further generalized to partial scaling transforms to which partial transpose belongs. In fact, while K and V are always invariant under linear canonical transformations, they are not invariant under scale changes on the vˆ that are not contained in Sp(4, R). In particular under partial scaling K is not necessarily positive definite [17]. These arguments could be extended to multipartite systems, with e.g. N degrees of freedom. Starting from the uncertainty relation K ≡ V + Ω ≥ 0, we can perform an arbitrary scaling described by the real vector x = (x1, x2, ... x2N ) and then compute


Kx = V x +
Ω,	V x
2
= ΛxV Λx,	(40)

with Λx ≡ diag(x1, x2, ... x2N ). The 2N real quantities x parameterize the Abelian scaling semigroup with the requirement that
|x1x2|≥ 1, |x3x4| ≥ 1,... , |x2N−1x2N | ≥ 1.	(41) The necessary condition for the separability of the state is
Kx ≥ 0,	∀x.	(42)
Notice, however, that for multipartite systems besides separability (resp. insepara- bility) there can be the possibility of partial separability (resp. partial inseparabil- ity), e.g. separability of a subsystem with respect to the others which in turns are entangled [9]. Hence QSP becomes much more subtle and even for Gaussian states it is not completely understood.
