Abstract
On a fuzzy dcpo with a frame L as its valued lattice, we define an L-fuzzy Scott topology by means of graded convergence of stratified L-filters. It is a fuzzy counterpart of the classical Scott topology on a crisp dcpo. The properties of L-fuzzy Scott topology are investigated. We establish Scott convergence theory of stratified L-filters. We show that for an L-set, its degree of Scott openness equals to the degree of Scott continuity from the underlying fuzzy dcpo to the lattice L (also being viewed as a fuzzy poset). We also show that a fuzzy dcpo is continuous iff for any stratified L-filter, Scott convergence coincides with topological convergence (w.r.t. the L-fuzzy Scott topology).
Keywords: fuzzy dcpo, stratified L-filter, L-fuzzy Scott topology, Scott convergence, topological convergence.


Introduction
Domain Theory, a formal basis for the semantics of programming languages, originates in work by D. Scott [17,18] in the mid-1960s. Domain models for var- ious types of programming languages, including imperative, functional, non- deterministic and probabilistic languages, have been extensively studied.
Quantitative Domain Theory that provides a model of concurrent systems forms a new branch of Domain Theory and has undergone active research in the past three decades. Rutten’s generalized (ultra)metric spaces [16], Flagg’s

continuity spaces [5] and Wagner’s Ω-categories [21] are examples of frame- works of quantitative domain theory.
Recently, based on complete Heyting algebras, Fan and Zhang [3,29] stud- ied quantitative domains via fuzzy set theory. In their approach, a fuzzy partial order, namely a degree function, is defined on a nonempty set firstly. Then fuzzy directed subsets and (continuous) fuzzy dcpos are defined and studied. Also in [1,2], in order to study fuzzy relational systems, B˘elohla´vek defines and studies an L-order on a set. In fact, we will show that a fuzzy par- tial order in the sense of Fan-Zhang and an L-order in the sense of B˘elohla´vek are equivalent to each other. In [13,14], Lai and Zhang studied directed com- plete Ω-categories, where Ω is a commutative unital quantale. Roughly speak- ing, each Ω-category could be regarded as a fuzzy preordered set in sense of [3,29,30].
In [13,14,29,30] many ideal and nice results have been obtained, but there are still some problems which should be put forward:
The definition of fuzzy directed subsets in [29,30] (Definition 2.6 in [29] and Definition 2.3 in [30]), which is based on the wedge below relation is relatively complex in some sense. 3
In [29,30], for two fuzzy posets (X, eX) and (Y, eY ) and a monotone map f : X −→ Y . The lift f˜ : LX −→ LY of f is defined by

∀A ∈ LX, y ∈ Y,
f˜(A)(y)=  A(x) ∧ eY (y, f (x)).
x∈X



Then it is shown that for any fuzzy directed subset φ of X,
f˜(φ) is also a

fuzzy directed subset of Y (Theorem 2.11 in [29], Theorem 2.7 in [30] and more earlier Lemma 12 in [5]). By the criterion of extension from crisp setting to fuzzy setting, when L = {0, 1}, f˜ should be the same as f . While, for two crisp posets X and Y , a monotone map f : X −→ Y and any directed subset D of X, the image of D under f˜ is not equal to f (D) in general, but to ↓ f (D) := {y ∈ Y | ∃x ∈ D, s.t. y ≤ f (x)}. Also, the lift in [14] is the same as that in [29,30] by replacing ∧ with the tensor ∗. For this reason, the lift of
a map in [13,14,29,30] is not a good extension.
The category of crisp dcpos is cartesian closed. It is natural to ask that, whether the category of fuzzy dcpos is also cartesian closed or not?
In [29,30], a crisp topology, namely the generalized Scott topology, is defined on a given fuzzy dcpo. Can we naturally construct an L-topology on a fuzzy dcpo just like a crisp topology on a crisp dcpo?

3 In fact, in [13,14] Lai and Zhang have already given a simple definition of fuzzy directed subsets (cf. Definition 5.1 in [14]).

Many important and nice results in [29,30], especially the definition and results of the generalized Scott topology, is based on a completely distributive complete lattice with the top element ∨-irreducible and the well below relation multiplicative (Seeing [29,30] for detail). In my opinion such a condition is too strong. In fact, we can show that any finite lattice with a multiplicative well below relation must be a chain. Thus many canonical finite lattices, for example the simplest nontrivial Boolean algebra M2, can not be supplied as an evaluating lattice in [29,30].
In [25,26,27], for an arbitrary frame L, we call a map between two fuzzy dcpos fuzzy Scott continuous if it is order-preserving and preserves joins of fuzzy directed subsets. Such a category of fuzzy dcpos is cartesian closed. Also, a natural L-topology, called a fuzzy Scott topology, on fuzzy dcpos are defined and studied.
The aim of this paper is to define and study an L-fuzzy topology on fuzzy dcpos. We shall call it an L-fuzzy Scott topology. And then to establish Scott convergence theory for stratified L-filters. Likewise the fuzzy Scott topology, an L-fuzzy Scott topology is an L-fuzzy counterpart of a crisp one.

Preliminaries
In this section, L always stands for a complete residuated lattice with ∗ as its tensor, i.e., a complete lattice equipped with a pari of binary operations (∗,
→) that forms a Galois connection, for detail please refer to [20].

Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Posets
For a set X and an element a in a lattice L, we use a to stand for the constant map from X to L with the value a.
For each map f  : X  −→ Y , we have a map f→ : LX  −→ LY
(called L-forward powerset operator, cf.	[15]) defined by f→(A)(y)  =
L
X	→
← (called L-backward powerset operator, cf.	[15]) and given by ∀B ∈
LY , f←(B)= B ◦ f.
An L-relation E on X is an L-subset of X × X. An L-relation E on X is called an L-preorder if
(Ref) ∀x ∈ X, E(x, x)= 1;
(Tran) ∀x, y, z ∈ X, E(x, y) ∗ E(y, z) ≤ E(x, z).
An L-preorder E on X is called an L-equivalence if (Sym) ∀x, y ∈ X, E(x, y)= E(y, x).
An L-equivalence E is called an L-equality if E(x, y) = 1 implies x = y. Let

E be an L-equivalence and R an L-relation on X. R is said to be compatible with E [1,2] if for all x1, x2, y1, y2 ∈ X, E(x1, y1) ∗ E(x2, y2) ∗ R(x1, x2) ≤ R(y1, y2).
For L a frame, in order to study quantitative domain theory via fuzzy sets, a kind of fuzzy posets is introduced by L. Fan and Q.Y Zhang [3,29]. Almost at the same time, in order to study fuzzy relational systems, for L a complete residuated lattice, another kind of fuzzy posets are introduced by R. Bˇelohlavek [1,2].
Definition 2.1 (1) (A fuzzy partial order in sense of Bˇelohla´vek [1,2]) A Bˇelohl´avek-fuzzy partial order (a B-fpo for short) on a set X with an L- equality ≈ is an L-preorder e : X × X −→ L which is compatible w.r.t. ≈ and satisfying
(B) ∀x, y ∈ X, e(x, y) ∧ e(y, x) ≤ (x ≈ y).
(2) (A fuzzy partial order in sense of Fan and Zhang [3,29]) A Fan-Zhang- fuzzy partial order (an FZ-fpo for short) on a set X is an L-preorder e :
X × X −→ L satisfying
(FZ) ∀x, y ∈ X, e(x, y)= e(y, x) = 1 implies x = y.
By Lemma 4 in [2], we know that if e is a B-fpo on X which is compatible
w.r.t. an L-equality ≈, then (x ≈ y)= e(x, y) ∧e(y, x) for all x, y ∈ X. Hence there’s a unique L-equality compatible with a B-fpo.
Obviously, a B-fpo is always an FZ-fpo since (B) can imply (FZ). Con- versely, let e be an FZ-fpo on X. Define ≈e: X × X −→ L by
(x ≈e y)= e(x, y) ∧ e(y, x) (∀x, y ∈ X).
It can be shown straightforwardly that e satisfies (Ref), (Tran), (B) and ≈e is an L-equality on X and e is a B-fpo on X which is compatible w.r.t. ≈e. Thus a B-fpo and an FZ-fpo are equivalent concepts. The definition of an FZ-fpo is formally simpler than that of a B-fpo. From now on, a B-fpo or an FZ-fpo will be just called a fuzzy partial order. For a fuzzy partial order e on X, we call the pair (X, e) (or just be denoted by X if there’s no confusion) a fuzzy poset.
Example 2.2 Let L be a residuated lattice.
Define eL : L × L −→ L by eL(x, y)= x → y for all x, y ∈ L. Then eL
is a fuzzy order on L.
∀A, B  ∈ LX, the subsethood degree [7] of A in B is define by

subX(A, B) =	 
x∈X
A(x) → B(x).	Then subX : LX × LX −→ L a fuzzy

order on LX (sometimes the subscript X is omitted).

The following definitions and propositions can be found in [1,2,3,29,30], etc.
Definition 2.3 Let (X, e) be a fuzzy poset and A ∈ LX. Au ∈ LX (resp.,
Al ∈ LX) is defined by ∀x ∈ X,
Au(x)=   A(y) → e(y, x) (resp., ∀x ∈ X, Al(x)=   A(y) → e(x, y)).
y∈X	y∈X
Au(x) and Al(x) can be considered as the degree of x to be an upper bound and a lower bound of A, respectively.
Definition 2.4 Let (X, e) be a fuzzy poset, x0 ∈ X, A ∈ LX. The element x0 is called a join (resp., meet) of A, in symbols x0 =  A (resp., x0 =  A), if
∀x ∈ X, A(x) ≤ e(x, x0) (resp., A(x) ≤ e(x0, x));

∀y ∈ X, 
x∈X
A(x) → e(x, y) ≤ e(x0, y) (resp., 
x∈X
A(x) → e(y, x) ≤

e(y, x0)).
It’s easy to verified by (FZ), x1, x2 are two joins (resp., meets) of A, then
x1 = x2. That is each A ∈ LX has at mostly one join (resp., one meet).

Proposition 2.5 (1) x0 = . A iff for all y ∈ X, e(x0, y) = 
x∈X
A(x) →

e(x, y).
(2) x0 = . A iff for all y ∈ X, e(y, x0)= 
x∈X
A(x) → e(y, x).

A fuzzy poset (X, e) is called complete if for all A ∈ LX, . A and . A
exist. For example, (L, eL) is a complete fuzzy poset, where . A =   A(x)∗x

and
. A =
 
x∈X
A(x) → x for all A ∈ LX.
x∈X

Definition 2.6 A ∈ LX is called a fuzzy upper set (resp., a fuzzy lower set) if ∀x, y ∈ X, A(x) ∗ e(x, y) ≤ A(y) (resp., A(x) ∗ e(y, x) ≤ A(y)).
Definition 2.7 For x ∈ X, ↓ x ∈ LX (resp., ↑ x ∈ LX) is defined as ∀y ∈
X, ↓ x(y)= e(y, x) (resp., ↓ x(y)= e(x, y)).
Let (X, eX) and (Y, eY ) be two fuzzy posets. We call a map f : X −→ Y order-preserving or (L-fuzzy) monotone (resp., antitone) if eX(x, y) ≤ eY (f (x), f (y)) (resp., eX(x, y) ≤ eY (f (y),f (x))) for all x, y ∈ X.
Definition 2.8 Let (X, eX), (Y, eY ) be two fuzzy posets and f : X −→ Y , g :
Y −→ X two order-preserving maps. (f, g) is called a fuzzy Galois connection

between X and Y if
eY (f (x), y)= eX(x, g(y))
for all x ∈ X, y ∈ Y , where f is called the left adjoint of g and dually g the right adjoint of f .
Remark 2.9 For two order-preserving maps f : (X, eX) −→ (Y, eY ) and g : (Y, eY ) −→ (X, eX) between two fuzzy posets, (f, g) is called a fuzzy Galois connection if for all x ∈ X, y ∈ Y , we have eY (f (x), y) = eX(x, g(y)). Fuzzy Galois connections are extensively studied in [24].
(f→,f←) is a fuzzy Galois connection between (LX, subX) and
L	L
(LY , subY ).
In [11,14,21], for two Ω-categories A and B, a pair of Ω-functors f :
A −→ B and g : B −→ A is said to be an Ω-adjunction if
B(f (a), b)= A(a, g(b))
for all a ∈ A, b ∈ B (cf. Definition 2.9 in [14]). A fuzzy Galois connection in Definition 4.1 is an L-adjunction in sense of [11,14,21].

Fuzzy Dcpos and Their Continuity
Let (X, e) be a fuzzy poset. We call an L-subset D ∈ LX fuzzy directed if

(FD1) 
x∈X
D(x)= 1;

(FD2) ∀x, y ∈ X, D(x) ∗ D(y) ≤ 
z∈X
D(z) ∗ e(x, z) ∗ e(y, z).

A fuzzy ideal is a lower fuzzy directed subset. We denote the set of all fuzzy
directed subsets and all fuzzy ideals on X by DL(X) and IL(X), respectively. A fuzzy poset is called a fuzzy dcpo if every fuzzy directed subset has a join, or equivalently every fuzzy ideal has a join.
A map f : X −→ Y between two fuzzy dcpos is called Scott continuous if for any directed subset D ∈ LX, f ( D)= f→(D). All fuzzy dcpos and Scott continuous maps forms a cartesian closed category [26].
It’s easy to verify that D ∈ LX iff ↓ D is a fuzzy ideal and f : X −→ Y
is fuzzy Scott continuous iff for any fuzzy directed subset D of X, f (. D)= 
f→(D). In the following discussion, one will see that for many statements, it is valid for any fuzzy subsets iff it is valid for any fuzzy ideals.
Example 2.10 (Example 5.5 in [25]) For X a nonempty set, a family δ ⊆ LX is called an L-topology if (T1) 0X, 1X ∈ δ; (T2) A, B ∈ δ implies A ∗ B ∈ δ; (T3) {Aj| j ∈ J} ⊆ LX implies j Aj ∈ δ. For an L-topology δ on X, put Lpt(δ)= {p : δ −→ L| p preserves arbitrary joins and p(A ∗ B) ≥ p(A) ∗ p(B)

for all A, B ∈ LX}. Define eLpt : Lpt(δ) × Lpt(δ) −→ L by
∀f, g ∈ Lpt(δ), eLpt(f, g)=   f (U ) → g(U ).
U∈δ
Then (Lpt(δ), eLpt) is a fuzzy dcpo.
Definition 2.11 Let (X, e) be a fuzzy dcpo. For any x ∈ X, define ⇓ x ∈ LX
by
∀y ∈ X, ⇓ x(y)=		e(x, . I) → I(y).
I∈IL(X)
A fuzzy dcpo is called continuous or a fuzzy domain if ⇓ x ∈ IL(X) and
x =	⇓ x for all x ∈ X.
If (X, e) is a fuzzy domain, then the map ⇓ has the property of interpo-

lation, i.e., ⇓ y(x) = 
z∈X
⇓ z(x)∗ ⇓ y(z) for all x, y ∈ X (cf. Theorem 4.6 in

[13]). A fuzzy dcpo (X, e) is continuous iff (⇓, .) is a fuzzy Galois connection between (X, e) and (IL(X), subIL(X)) (cf. Theorem 5.10 in [25]).

An L-fuzzy Topology Induced by an L-generalized Convergence Spaces
Definition 2.12 A stratified L-filter on X is a map F : LX −→ L satisfying (LF 1) F(∅)= 0, F(X)= 1;
(LF 2) ∀A, B ∈ LX, A ≤ B implies F(A) ≤ F(B); (LF 3) ∀A, B ∈ LX, F(A ∗ B) ≥ F(A) ∗ F(B);
(SF ) ∀a ∈ L, F(a) ≥ a or F(aA) ≥ F(A).
Remark 2.13 (1) The conditions (LF2) and (LF3) in Definition 2.12 can be equivalently replaced by
(LF4) ∀A, B ∈ LX, F(A → B) ≤ F(A) → F(B).
(2) For a stratified L-filter F on X and all A, B ∈ LX, subX(A, B) ≤ F(A → B) since A → B ≥ subX(A, B).
The set of all stratified L-filters on X will be denoted by Fs (X).
Example 2.14 (1) For x ∈ X, the map [x] : LX −→ L defined by [x](A) = 
A(x) is a stratified L-filter, called the principal L-filter of x.
Let (X, δ) be an L-topological space. For all x ∈ X, define Ux : LX −→ L by Ux(A) = A◦(x) for all A ∈ LX, where ◦ : LX −→ LX is the L-interior operator of (X, δ). Then Ux is an L-filter and if δ is stratified then so is Ux.
δ	δ
Let (X, τ ) be an L-fuzzy topological space.  For all x ∈ X, define

Ux : LX −→ L by

Ux(A)= 

B(x) ∗ τ (B)

B≤A
for all A ∈ LX. Then Ux is an L-filter and if τ is enriched then Ux is stratified.
τ	τ
Definition 2.15 ([10,23]) A stratified L-generalized convergence structure on
X is map R : Fs (X) × X −→ L satisfying that (LFC1) ∀x ∈ X, R([x], x)= 1.
(LFC2) ∀x ∈ X, ∀F, G ∈ Fs (X), F ≤ G implies R(F, x) ≤ R(G, y).
Theorem 2.16 ([10,23]) Each stratiﬁed L-generalized fuzzy convergence structure R on X induces an enriched L-fuzzy topology (cf. Subsection 4.2 in [9]) τR on X given by

∀A ∈ LX, τR(A)=	 
(F,x)∈Fs (X)×X

(A(x) ∗ R(F, x)) → F(A)

and a stratiﬁed L-topology δR = {A ∈ LX| τR(A)= 1}.

L-fuzzy Scott Topology and Scott Convergence of Stratified L-filters
In the rest of this paper, L stands for a frame, i.e., a complete residuated lattice with ∗ = ∧.
Let (X, e) be a fuzzy dcpo and F a stratified L-filter on X. Define Fl ∈ LX

by
∀x ∈ X, Fl(x)= 
A∈LX

F(A) ∧ Al(x).

Proposition 3.1 (1) F ≤ G implies Fl ≤ Gl;
∀x ∈ X, [x]l =↓ x.
Proof. Straightforward.	 
Let (X, e) be a fuzzy dcpo. Define a map S : Fs (X) × X −→ L by
∀(F, x) ∈ Fs (X) × X, S(F, x)=		subX(D, Fl) ∧ e(x, . D).
D∈DL(X)
By Proposition 3.1, it’s easy to see that S is a stratified L-generalized conver- gence structure on X. Thus it induces an enriched L-fuzzy topology σLF (X, e)

given by
∀A ∈ LX, σLF (X, e)(A)=	 
(F,x)∈Fs (X)×X


(A(x) ∧ S(F, x)) → F(A)

and a stratified L-topology
σL(X, e)= {A ∈ LX| ∀(F, x) ∈ FL(X) × X, A(x) ∧ S(F, x) ≤ F(A)}.
We call σLF (X, e) (σLF (X) for short) and σL(X, e) (σL(X) for short) an L-fuzzy Scott topology and a fuzzy Scott topology on (X, e), respectively. (σL(X) is studied in [27].)
Lemma 3.2 (1) e(. A, x)= sub(A, ↓ x).
e(x, y) ∧ sub(↑ x, A) ≤ sub(↑ y, A).
S([y], x)= e(x, y).
Proof. Straightforward.	 
For a fuzzy directed subset D ∈ LX, define FD : LX −→ L by
∀A ∈ LX, FD(A)=   D(x) ∧ sub(↑ x, A).
x∈X
Proposition 3.3 (1) FD is a stratiﬁed L-ﬁlter;
Fl =↓ D.

S(FD, . D)= 1.
Define ∇(X): LX −→ L by
∇(X)(A) =	 
x,y∈X




(e(x, y) ∧ A(x)) → A(y).

∇(X)(A) can be interpreted as the degree of A to be a fuzzy upper set 4 .
Define F (X): LX −→ L by

∀A ∈ LX, F (X)(A)=	 
D∈DL(X)
A(. D) → FD(A).

Lemma 3.4 F (X) ≤ ∇(X).
Proof. ∀A ∈ LX. ∀x, y ∈ X,
F (X)(A) ≤ A(. ↓ x) → F↓x(A)= A(x) → F↓x(A)

4  ∇(X) just is the L-fuzzy Alexandrov topology for L = [0, 1] in [4].

and by Lemma 3.2(2),

F↓x(A)= 
a∈X
↓ x(a) ∧ sub(↑ a, A)=  e(a, x) ∧ sub(↑ a, A).
a∈X

Then F (X)(A) ≤	 
x,y∈X
A(x) → (e(x, y) → A(y)) =	 
x,y∈X
A(x) → sub(↑

x, A)= ∇(X)(A).	 
Proposition 3.5 σLF (X)= F (X).
Proof. ∀A ∈ LX. On one hand,

σLF (X)(A) ≤	 
D∈DL(X)
=	 
D∈DL(X)
(A(. D) ∧ S(FD, . D)) → FD(A)
A(. D) → FD(A)

= F (X)(A).
On the other hand, for all (F, x) ∈ FL(X) × X, A(x) ∧ S(F, x) ∧ F (X)(A)
= A(x) ∧ S(F, x) ∧ F (X)(A) ∧ F (X)(A)
=		A(x) ∧ (sub(E, Fl) ∧ e(x, . E)) ∧ (A(. D) →
E∈DL(X) D∈DL(X)
FD(A)) ∧ F (X)(A)

≤	 
E∈DL(X)
A(x) ∧ (sub(E, Fl) ∧ e(x, . E)) ∧ (A(. E) →

FE(A)) ∧ ((A(x) ∧ e(x, . E)) → A(. E))

≤	 
E∈DL(X)
≤	 
E∈DL(X)
sub(E, Fl) ∧ A(. E) ∧ (A(. E) → FE(A))
sub(E, Fl) ∧ FE(A)

=		sub(E, Fl) ∧ (E(y) ∧ sub(↑ y, A))
E∈DL(X) y∈X
≤		  (E(y) → Fl(y)) ∧ (E(y) ∧ sub(↑ y, A))
E∈DL(X) y∈X
≤		F(↑ y)) ∧ sub(↑ y, A)
E∈DL(X) y∈X
≤ F(A).

Then F (X)(A) ≤ (A(x) ∧S(F, x)) → F(A) and by the arbitrariness of (F, x), we have σLF (X)(A) ≥ F (X)(A).	 
For an L-filter F, we call F Scott converges to x if there exists a fuzzy ideal I ∈ IL(X) such that I ≤ Fl and x ≤  I (this means e(x,  I) = 1). For an L-fuzzy topology τ on X, we call F topologically convergent to x if Ux ≤F (cf. Subsection 6.2 in [8] and Definition 8.2.3 in [9]).

Define d(X): LX −→ L by
d(X)(A)=	 
D∈DL(X)

A(. D) → . A→(D).

d(X)(A) as the degree of A to be Scott continuous.

Lemma 3.6 . A→(D) = 
x∈X
A(x) ∧ D(x), where . A→(D) is the join of

A→(D) taken in the fuzzy poset (L, eL). Thus

d(X)(A)=	 
D∈DL(X)
A(. D) → (   D(x) ∧ A(x)).
x∈X

Proof. Straightforward.	 
Theorem 3.7 σLF (X)= ∇(X) ∧ d(X).
Proof. ∀A ∈ LX. On one hand,

σLF (X)(A) ≤ 
x,y∈X
(A(x) ∧ S([y], x)) → [y](A)= ∇(X)(A)

and
σLF (X)(A) = F (X)(A)

=	 
D∈DL(X)
A(. D) → FD(A)

=	 
D∈DL(X)
≤	 
D∈DL(X)
A(. D) → ( 
x∈X
A(. D) → ( 
x∈X
I(x) ∧ sub(↑ x, A))
I(x) ∧ A(x))

= d(X)(A).
On the other hand, we only need to show that ∀D ∈ DL(X),
(A(. D) → (   I(x) ∧ A(x))) ∧ ∇(X)(A) ≤ (A(. D) → FD(A)
x∈X

and we only need to show that
∇(X)(A) ∧ (  I(x) ∧ A(x))) ≤   I(x) ∧ sub(↑ x, A)

x∈X
and we only need to show
x∈X



A(x) ∧ ∇(X)(A) ≤ sub(↑ x, A).
In fact, A(x)∧∇(X)(A)= A(x)∧(   (A(x)∧e(x, y)) → A(y)) ≤ 

e(x, y) →

y∈X	y∈X
A(y)= sub(↑ x, A).	 
Theorem 3.8 [27] (1) A ∈ σL(X) iff A : X −→ L preserves joins of fuzzy directed subsets (when L is being viewed as the complete fuzzy poset (L, eL)).
If (X, e) is continuous, then for all x ∈ X, ⇑ x ∈ σL(X).
If (X, e) is continuous, then {a∧ ⇑ x| a ∈ L, x ∈ L} forms a basis of
σL(X).
Proof. (1) is a corollary of Theorem 3.7. (2) can be inferred from the property of interpolation of the fuzzy way-below relation ⇓. (3) By Theorem 3.7, we

can show that U = 
y∈X
U (y)∧⇑ y for any U ∈ σL(X).	 

Proposition 3.9 For x ∈ X, we have (Ux)l ≤⇓ x. If (X, e) is continuous then (Ux)l = ⇓ x.
Proof. ∀y ∈ X, B ≤↑ y, I ∈ IL(X),
σLF (X)(B) ≤ (B(. I) ∧ S(FI, . I)) → FI(B)
= B(. I) → FI(B) ≤ B(. I) → FI(↑ y)= B(. I) → I(y)
and
B(x) ∧ σLF (X)(B) ∧ e(x, . I)
= B(x) ∧ e(x, . I) ∧ σLF (X)(B) ∧ σLF (X)(B)
≤ B(x) ∧ e(x, . I) ∧ (B(. I) → I(y)) ∧ ((B(x) ∧ e(x, . I)) → B(. I))
≤ B(. I) ∧ (B(. I) → I(y))
≤ I(y)
and then B(x) ∧ σLF (X)(B) ≤ e(x, . I) → I(y). By the arbitrariness of I ∈ IL(X), we have B(x) ∧ σLF (X)(B) ≤⇓ x(y). Hence (Ux)l(y) = Ux(↑ y) ≤⇓ x(y) and then (Ux)l ≤⇓ x.

If (X, e) is continuous, then σLF (X)(⇑ x) = 1 and (Ux)l(y) = Ux(↑ y) ≥
σLF (A)(⇑ x)∧⇑ y(x) =⇓ x(y). Thus (Ux)l ≥⇓ x.	 
Proposition 3.10 For all (F, x) ∈ Fs (X) ×X, S(F, x) ≤ sub(Ux, F). Then Scott convergence always implies topological convergence.
Proof. It’s easy to show that sub(Ux, F) = A∈LX (A(x) ∧ σLF (X)(A)) → F(A) and for all A ∈ LX, σLF (X)(A) ≤ (A(x) ∧ S(F, x)) → F(A). It follows that S(F, x) ≤ sub(Ux, F). If F Scott converges to x, then S(F, x)=1 and sub(Ux, F)= 1. Thus Ux ≤ F, i.e., F topologically converges to x.	 
The following theorem is the main result of this paper which establishes a connection between the continuity of a fuzzy dcpo and the Scott convergence of L-filters.
Theorem 3.11 Consider the followings:
(X, e) is continuous;
for any stratiﬁed L-ﬁlter, Scott convergence coincides with topological convergence with respect to the L-fuzzy Scott topology;
∀x ∈ X, Ux is Scott convergent to x.
S(F, x)= sub(Ux, F).
We have (1) ⇐⇒ (2) ⇐⇒ (3) =⇒ (4) and if 1  1 5 , then (4) is equivalent to
(1-3).
Proof. (2) ⇒ (3) is obvious. (1) ⇒ (2) : Suppose that F is topological convergent to x, that is Ux ≤ F. Since (X, e) is continuous, we have x =  ⇓ x and ⇓ x is a fuzzy ideal and ⇓ x = (U x)l ≤ Fl. It follows that F is Scott convergent to x.
(3) ⇒ (1) : If Ux is Scott convergent to x, then there exists a fuzzy ideal
I ∈ I.L(X) such that x ≤ . I and I ⊆ (Ux)l ≤⇓ x ≤↓ x. It’s easy t o show that
x =	⇓ x. To show ⇓ x is fuzzy directed. In fact,	⇓ x(y) ≥	I(y)=1 
y∈X	y∈X
and for all a, b ∈ X, ⇓ x(a)∧ ⇓ x(b) ≤ (e(x, . I) → I(a)) ∧ (e(x, . I) →
 	 
I(b)) = I(a) ∧ I(b) ≤	I(c) ∧ e(a, c) ∧ e(b, c) ≤	⇓ x(c) ∧ e(a, c) ∧ e(b, c).
c∈X	c∈X
(1) ⇒ (4) : we only need to show S(F, x) ≥ sub(Ux, F). In fact, since (X, e) is continuous, then ⇓ x ∈ DL(X), . ⇓ x = x, (Ux)l = ⇓ x and ⇑ x is
fuzzy Scott open. Then

S(F, x) ≥ e(x, . ⇓ x) ∧ sub(⇓ x, Fl)= 
y∈X
⇓ x(y) → Fl(y)

such that x ≤ a.

If 1  1, then (4) implies (3).	 

Relations between Fuzzy Scott Continuous and Topo- logical Continuous
In this section, for a map, we will define the fuzzy Scott continuity (which is a counterpart of Scott continuity) and topological continuity w.r.t the L-fuzzy topology and then study relations among them and the continuity of fuzzy dcpos.
Define Δ(X), c(X): LX −→ L by

Δ(X)(A) =	 
x,y∈X
c(X)(A)  =	 

(e(x, y) ∧ A(y)) → A(x),
. A→(D) → A(. D),

D∈DL(X)
c  (X) = Δ(X) ∧ c(X).
c  (X)(A) can be condisered the degree of A to be Scott closed. We call

A ∈ LX a fuzzy Scott closed set if σc
(X)(A) = 1 and denote the set of all

fuzzy Scott closed sets by σc (X). Obviously, for any x ∈ X, ↓ x ∈ σc (X).

L
Proposition 4.1 For A ∈ LX, c(A)=	 
D∈DL(X)
L
sub(D, A) → A(. D).

Proof. Trivial since it is easy to show that . A→(D)= sub(D, A).	 
Lemma 4.2 Let f : (X, e1) −→ (Y, e2) be a fuzzy continuous map and B ∈
LY , D ∈ DL(X). Then	(f←(B))→(D)=	B→(f→(D)) (taken in (L, eL)).

Proof.
L	L	L	L

. B→(f→(D)) =  B(y) ∧ f→(D)(y)=   B(y) ∧ ( 
D(f (x))

=   B(f (x)) ∧ D(x)=   f←(B)(x) ∧ D(x)= .(f←(B))→(D).

Proposition 4.3 If L is a complete Boolean algebra, then for all A ∈ LX,

σLF (X)(A) = σc
(X)(¬A), ∇(X)(A) = Δ(X)(¬A), d(X)(A) = c(X)(¬A)

and σL(X)= {¬A| A ∈ σL(X)}, where (¬A)(x)= ¬(A(x)) (∀x ∈ X).

Proof. Straightforward.	 
Theorem 4.4 Let f : (X, e1) −→ (Y, e2) be a map between two fuzzy dcpos. Consider the following:
f is fuzzy Scott continuous.

∀B ∈ LX, σc  (X)(f←(B)) ≥ σc
(Y )(B).

LF	L	LF
∀B ∈ σc (Y ), f←(B) ∈ σc (X).
L	L	L
∀B ∈ LX, σLF (X)(f←(B)) ≥ σLF (Y )(B).
∀B ∈ σL(Y ), f←(B) ∈ σL(X).
We have (1) ⇐⇒ (2) ⇐⇒ (3) =⇒ (4) =⇒ (5) and if L is a Boolean algebra additinally, then the above ﬁve are equivalent to each other.
Proof. (2) ⇒ (3) and (4) ⇒ (5) are obvious.	(1) ⇒ (2) is trivial since Δ(X)(f←(B)) ≥ Δ(Y )(B) and c(X)(f←(B)) ≥ c(Y )(B). (1) ⇒ (4) is analo-
L	L
gous to (1) ⇒ (2).
(3)⇒ (1). ∀x1, x2 ∈ X, f←(↓ x2) ∈ σc (X) and
L	L
e1(x1, x2) ≤ f←(↓ f (x2))(x2) → f←(↓ f (x2))(x1) =↓ f (x2)(f (x1)) = e2(f (x1, x2)).
L	L
Thus f is order-preserving. ∀D ∈ DL(X),

 
z∈Y

f→(D)(z) → e2(z, y) = 
x∈X
= 
x∈X

D(x) → e1(f (x), y)
D(x) → f←(↓ y)(x)

= sub(D, f←(↓ y))
≤ f←(↓ y)(. D)
= ↓ y(f (. D))
= e2(f (. D), y).
Hence f (. D)= . f→(D).
If L is a Boolean algebra additionally, then (5) ⇒ (3).	 

A Special Case: The Fuzzy Scott Topology on Crisp Dcpos
There are many kinds of fuzzy filter, such as L-filter of the form L(LX ), L-filter of crisp degree of the form 2(LX ) and L-filter of ordinary sets of the form L(2X ). There are also three kinds of fuzzy topology: the L-topology, the L-fuzzifying topology and the L-fuzzy topology. Using a proper kind of fuzzy filters (to

define deferent kinds of Scott convergence) on fuzzy dcpos and on crisp ones, we get many kinds of fuzzy versions of Scott topology.
For example, we choose L-filters to define a fuzzy Scott topology on crisp dcpo. A fuzzy Scott topology on crisp dcpo is not only a special case of σLF (X) for a crisp dcpo X in Section 3, but also arises naturally by following three additional origins:
Recall the definition of Scott topology [6] on a crisp dcpo X, a subset is Scott open iff it is a Scott continuous map from X to two elements lattice
{0, 1}. Extending {0, 1} to some complete lattice L (sometimes equipped with some necessary conditions), the family of all Scott continuous maps from X to L forms an L-topology on X. In addition, by the slogan that a predicate and an open set are the same thing [19], we also get that the Scott continuous (i.e., structure-preserving) maps from X to L consists of an L-topology on X.
In [22], it is shown that for a continuous frame L, the family of all continuous functions from a topological space (X, T ) to (L, σ(L)) is an L- topology on X. If X itself is a dcpo and T is the Scott topology on X, then a continuous map from (X, T ) to (L, σ(L)) is exactly a Scott continuous map from X to L and the results in [22] still hold. In the case, the condition that L is continuous frame could perhaps be weaken. In fact, Theorem II-4.19 in
[6] points out that L is a frame is sufficient.
For a crisp topology T on X, by using the Lowen functor ωL (see in [12] for detailed discussion), we can construct an L-topology, namely ωL(T ), the L-topology generated by T . In fact, ωL(T ) is a set of all continuous maps (X, T ) to (L, ν(L)), where ν(L) is the upper topology on L. If L is completely distributive, then ν(L) = σ(L). Thus in this case, ωL(T ) is the set of all continuous maps from (X, T ) to (L, σ(L)). Also, if X is a dcpo and T is the Scott topology on X, then ωL(T ) is the set of all Scott continuous maps from X to L.
The four origins come to the same object—a fuzzy Scott topology on crisp dcpos, which has been studied in [28] and the following main results are ob- tained:
The fuzzy Scott topology is just the L-topology generated by the clas- sical Scott topology.
If the dcpo is continuous, then the fuzzy Scott topological space is ι-sober (an L-topology is called ι-sober if ιL(δ) is sober, where ιL is the right adjoint of ωL).
The fuzzy Scott topology is completely distributive iff L is completely distributive and the dcpo is continuous.
