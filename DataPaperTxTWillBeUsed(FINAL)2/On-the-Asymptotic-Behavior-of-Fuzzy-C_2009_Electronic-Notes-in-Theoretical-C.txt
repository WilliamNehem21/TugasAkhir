Abstract
Fuzzy cellular automata (FCA) are continuous cellular automata where the local rule is defined as the “fuzzification” of the local rule of a corresponding Boolean cellular automaton in disjunctive normal form. In this paper we consider circular FCA; their asymptotic behavior has been observed through simulations and FCA have been empirically classified accordingly. No analytical study exists so far to support those observations.
We now start the analytical study of circular FCA’s dynamics by considering a particular set of FCA (Weighted Average rules) which includes rules displaying most of the observed dynamics, and we precisely derive their behavior. We confirm the empirical observations proving that all weighted average rules are periodic in time and space, and we derive their periods.
Keywords: Fuzzy cellular automata, asymptotic behavior, periodic points.


Introduction
Fuzzy cellular automata (FCA) are a particular type of continuous cellular au- tomata, or coupled map lattices, where the local transition rule is the “fuzzifica- tion” of the local rule of a corresponding Boolean cellular automaton in disjunctive normal form (DNF fuzzification). 4
Fuzzy cellular automata were first introduced in [5] as a model to describe the impact that perturbations (e.g. noisy sources, computation errors, mutations, etc.) can have on the evolution of Boolean CA (e.g., see [11]), They have been shown to be useful tools for pattern recognition purposes (e.g., see [13,14]), and good models for generating images mimicking nature (e.g. [6,18]). Their asymptotic behavior

4 These are not to be confused with a variant of cellular automata, also called fuzzy cellular automata, where the fuzziness refers to the choice of a deterministic local rule (e.g., see [1])

has been studied in quiescent backgrounds only, where it has been shown that none of the elementary FCA rules has chaotic dynamics [10,16,17]. Recently, the DNF fuzzification has been shown to maintain properties of the corresponding Boolean CA [2]. For example, it has been proven that density conservation is preserved through fuzzification, and that additivity of a Boolean CA implies and is implied by self-oscillation of the corresponding fuzzy CA (a peculiar property of the asymp- totic behavior of FCA). In [2] it has also been shown that if a FCA converges to an homogeneous configuration, the convergence value coincides with the mean filed approximation of the corresponding Boolean CA (i.e., to an estimate of its asymptotic density)
A fundamental problem in the study of Boolean CA, and thus also of their fuzzy counter-part, is their classification. The first attempt to classify cellular au- tomata was done by Wolfram in [20] where they were grouped according to the observed behaviour of their space-time diagrams; although not formally precise, this classification captures important distinctions among cellular automata. Sev- eral other criteria for classifying CA have followed: some based on observable be- haviours, some on intrinsic properties of CA rules, some on topological properties (e.g., see [4,7,8,12,15,19]). Since for most classifications class membership is un- decidable, observation of the evolution of a CA starting from (possibly all) initial configurations becomes crucial to understanding its dynamics. The evolution of CA is usually observed either for finite initial configurations in zero backgrounds (quiescent background), or for infinite but periodic initial configurations (circular CA).
Fuzzy cellular automata have been empirically classified according to various criteria. For example, fuzzy cellular automata in Boolean backgrounds have been grouped according to the level of “spread” of fuzziness in [5]. More recently, an empirical classification for elementary circular FCA was proposed based on experi- mental results from random initial configurations [9]. The observed results suggested that all elementary rules have an asymptotic periodic behavior but, interestingly, with periods of only certain lengths: 1,2,4, and n (where n is the size of the circular lattice).
Intrigued by these recent observations and by the surprising resulting classifi- cation of [9], we now begin the study of the asymptotic behavior of circular FCA with the goal of understanding and explaining the empirical findings. We start by considering Weighted Average rules, where the value of cell i at time t +1 can be seen as the weighted average of two of the values in xi’s neighborhood (or their negation) at time t. From experiments, these rules seem to display most of the observed dynamics: fixed points, periods of length 2, and periods of length 4. We analytically study the asymptotic behaviour of weighted average rules and we prove that they all have spatial and temporal periodic behaviour from arbitrary initial configurations thus confirming the experimental findings. While analyzing their asymptotic behavior we discover an interesting density property for rule 29, which holds both in the Boolean and in the fuzzy domain: rule 29 is density conserving at alternate iterations, where density is defined as the number of 1s in the case of the

Boolean model, as the sum of the values in the case of the fuzzy. More precisely: the initial density is preserved at even iterations, while at odd iterations the density is the complement of the initial one.
This study is a first step towards the analytical support of the classification of FCA in terms of periodicity, and it opens interesting research directions. In light of the results of [2] on the probabilistic interpretation of FCA, particularly interesting would now be to understand the meaning of non-homogeneous periodic points of weighted average rules (and of other FCA rules) in terms of estimates of asymptotic density of their corresponding Boolean CA. Studies in this direction are underway.

Definitions
A one dimensional circular Boolean cellular automaton is a collection of cells ar- ranged in a circular linear array. Cells have Boolean values and they synchronously update their values according to a local rule applied to their neighbourhood. A con-

figuration Xt = (xt , xt ... , xt
) is a description of all cell values at a given time

0	,	n−1
t (alternatively one can think of an infinite array containing a periodic configura-
tion). The neighbourhood of a cell consists of the cell itself and its q left and right neighbours, thus the local rule has the form: g : {0, 1}2q+1 → {0, 1}. The global dynamics of a one dimensional cellular automaton composed of n cells is then de- fined by the global rule (or transition function): B : {0, 1}n → {0, 1}n  s.t.  ∀X ∈
{0, 1}n, ∀i ∈ {0,... ,n − 1}, B(X)i = g(xi−q ... , xi,... , xi+q), where all operation on indices are modulo n. A cellular automata is elementary if it has radius and dimension one. In the paper we focus only on circular elementary cellular automata and we will omit the term circular.
The local rule g : {0, 1}3 → {0, 1} of an elementary Boolean CA is typically given in tabular form by listing the 8 binary tuples corresponding to the 8 possible local configurations a cell can detect in its direct neighbourhood, and mapping each tuple to a binary value ri (0 ≤ i ≤ 7): (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111). The binary representation (r0, ··· , r22q+1 ) is often converted into the decimal representation i ri, and this value is typically used as the “name” of the rule (or rule number).
Let us denote by di the tuple mapping to ri. The local rule can also be canonically
expressed in disjunctive normal form (DNF) as follows:

g(v ,v ,v )=  r

vdij

0	1	2
i<8
i	j
j=0:2

where dij is the j-th digit, from left to right, of di, and v0 (resp. v1) stands for ¬vj
j	j
(resp. vj).
A fuzzy cellular automaton (FCA) is a particular continuous cellular automaton where the local rule is obtained by DNF-fuzziﬁcation of the local rule of a classical Boolean CA. The fuzzification consists of a fuzzy extension of the boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT in the DNF expression of the Boolean rule. Depending on which fuzzy operators are used, different types of fuzzy cellular automata can be defined. Among the various possible choices, we consider the following: (a ∨ b) is

replaced by max{1, (a + b)}, (a ∧ b) by (ab), and (¬a) by (1 − a). Note that, in the case of FCA, max{1, (a + b)} = (a + b)
Whenever we talk about fuzzification we refer to the DNF-fuzziﬁcation defined above. The resulting local rule becomes a real function that generalizes the canonical representation of the corresponding Boolean CA:

(1)
f : [0, 1]3 → [0, 1] s.t. , f (v0, v1, v2)= Σ ri 
l(vj, di,j)


where l(a, 0) = 1 − a and l(a, 1) = a.
i<8
j=0:2

Example: Rule 18. Consider, for example, elementary rule 18 whose local tran- sition rule in tabular form is given by: (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111) →
(0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0). The local transition rule in DNF form is the following:
g(v−1, v0, v1)= (¬v−1 ∧ ¬v0 ∧ v1) ∨ (v−1 ∧ ¬v0 ∧ ¬v1).

The corresponding fuzzification is:
f (v−1, v0, v1)= (1 − v−1)(1 − v0)v1 + v−1(1 − v0)(1 − v1).

Throughout this paper, we will denote local rules of Boolean CA by g and their fuzzifications for the corresponding FCA by f . The corresponding global rules are denoted by G and F .
We define a ﬁxed point P ∈ [0, 1]n for a circular FCA with global transition rule
F : [0, 1]n → [0, 1]n as a configuration P such that F (P)= P.
Also, a rule is said to be Temporally Periodic with period τ if ∃T such that
∀t > T : F (Xt)= F (Xt+τ ). Similarly, a rule is Spatially Periodic with period ω if
∃T such that ∀t > T , ∀i: xt = xt
i	i+ω
Definition 2.1 A rule is Asymptotically Periodic in Time (or Asymptotically Tem- porally Periodic) with period τ if, for any initial configuration, ∀ϵ > 0 ∃T such that
∀t > T and ∀i: |xt − xt+τ | < ϵ 
i	i
Definition 2.2 A rule is Asymptotically Periodic in Space (or Asymptotically Spa- tially Periodic) with period ω if, for any initial configuration, ∀ϵ > 0 ∃T such that

∀t > T and ∀i: |xt − xt
| < ϵ 

i	i+ω
A rule that is asymptotically periodic in space with period 1 will be called asymptotically homogeneous. A rule which is asymptotically periodic in time with period 1 will be said to be convergent to a ﬁxed point.
When a configuration at time t is spatially periodic with smallest period m < n, we shall indicate it as Xt = (α)m, where α is the sequence of values corresponding to the smallest period. For example, given a FCA with even size n, let it have a spatially periodic configuration of period two X = (a, b, a, b, a, b, . . .): we will
n
indicate X as (a, b) 2 . Finally, given a configuration X of a CA or a FCA, let
d(X)= 1 Σn−1 x .

Asymptotic behavior of weighted average FCA rules
Observation suggest that elementary FCA have simpler dynamics than elementary Boolean CA. In fact, a recent classification based on observations from random initial configurations has grouped circular elementary FCA into four categories [9]: FCA converging to a fixed point, periods of length two, four and n.

Table 1
Observed dynamics of Circular Elementary Cellular Automata. Rules equivalent under conjugation, reflection and both are not indicated.

We now start the analytical study of FCA by focusing on a group of rules called Weighted Average rules, which includes rules in most categories above (the rules in bold in the table). We will confirm the observed temporal periodicity for these rules and we will also prove spatial periodicity of their convergence points.
We will begin by defining a generalized fuzzy circular cellular automaton where the rule at each point need not be identical but will have the same form. We will then show that under certain conditions weighted average rules on generalized fuzzy CA will converge to a fixed point. We will proceed to describe each of the rules highlighted above as a weighted average rule. Rule 172 will be shown to be an example of a generalized fuzzy CA which meets the conditions for convergence. For each subsequent rule, we will show that it is conjugate to rule 172 either in several steps or when taken as the cross product of two separate generalized circular CA or as a combination of both and will therefore converge to a regular pattern which is described in detail. Some of the convergence proofs (the one that follow arguments already used for other proofs) are omitted.

Preliminaries
We first introduce the notion of a weighted average and of a type of generalized fuzzy CA.
A weighted average of two numbers α and β is an equation of the form μ = (1 − γ)α + γβ where γ ∈ [0, 1], (the usual mean occurs when γ = 1 ). Weighted
averages have the following useful properties.
Property 1 If μ = (1 − γ)α + γβ	then	(1 − μ)= (1 − γ)(1 − α)+ γ(1 − β)
Property 2 If γ1 < γ2 and α < β	then	(1 − γ1)α + γ1β < (1 − γ2)α + γ2β
A generalized fuzzy CA is a lattice where every cell updates its state according to a different local rule. In this paper, we will consider generalized fuzzy CA with neighbourhood 1 (q = 1) and with rules of the type defined below.
Definition 3.1 GW CA
A generalized fuzzy cellular automata with weighted average rules (GW CA) is a generalized fuzzy CA where the local rule has the following form:
(2)	xt+1 = γtxt + (1 − γt)xt
i	i  i	i	i+1
(3)	(or xt+1 = γtxt + (1 − γt)xt	)

i	i  i
i	i−1

with bounded weights. That is, there exists 0 < γ < 1 such that γt ∈ (γ, 1 − γ) for
2	i
all i and for all t.
In other words, in a GW CA the state of a cell i at time t + 1 takes the average of the state of the cell itself and of one of its neighbours at time t weighted by a value in (0, 1) that varies from cell to cell. In this section, we consider only GW CA of form (2); the proofs for averaging with the neighbour on the left as in form (3) are analogous.

A general convergence theorem
We now prove a convergence result for GW CA when the initial configurations are in the open interval (0, 1)n. We wish to show that repeated weighted averaging of a circular array results in the values in the array converging to a fixed point, as stated in the general theorem below.


Theorem 3.2 General Theorem
Consider a GWCA starting from conﬁguration X0 = (x0, ··· , x0
). Then for

some p ∈ [0, 1], xt → p for all i as t → ∞.
0	n−1

We will prove the theorem by a sequence of lemmas.
Lemma 3.3 Consider	the	sequence	mini{x0}, mini{x1},... , mini{xt},... 
i	i	i
Such a sequence converges to some	value  lm.	Furthermore,	sequence
maxi{x0}, maxi{x1},... , maxi{xt},... converges to some value lM .
i	i	i

Proof. Since each value is averaged with its neighbour, the result is always between

these two values. Assume that xt ≤ xt
. Then,

i	i+1
xt+1 = γixt + (1 − γi)xt	≥ γixt + (1 − γi)xt ≥ xt
i	i	i+1	i	i	i
with equality if and only if xt = xt	. In particular, the previous holds when xt
i	i+1	i
is the minimum value at time t. Since all values at time t +1 are the weighted
averages of values greater than or equal to the minimum value at time t, all values at time t + 1 must be greater than or equal to the minimum at time t. Thus the sequence is increasing and bounded above by 1 and therefore convergent.
Analogous proof holds for the sequence of maxi.	 
We wish to show that lm = lM . We will proceed by showing that if there is a difference in the maximum and minimum values in the configuration at some time t, then in n − 1 iterations (i.e., at time t + n − 1), the minimum must increase by at least an amount proportional to this difference.
Lemma 3.4 Given a conﬁguration of length n, if at any time t, maxi{xt} − 

t	t+n−1
i
t	n−1	t

mini{xi}≥ δ then mini{xi	}− mini{xi}≥ γ	δ where γ < γi < 1 − γ.
Proof. Let m = mini  xt} and M = maxi  xt} so that M − m ≥ δ. Renumbering
if necessary, we may assume that the maximum occurs at xt	, so that:


(4)
xt ≥ ⎧⎨ m	for 0 ≤ i < n − 1

⎩ M ≥ m + γ0δ for i = n − 1
with xt = m for at least one i and xt	= M .
i	n−1
We wish to show by induction that for 0 ≤ s ≤ n − 1,
xt+s ≥ ⎧⎨ m	for 0 ≤ i < n − s − 1
⎩ m + γsδ for n − s − 1 ≤ i < n 
This is true when s = 0 by equation (4). Now assume it is true for xt+s with
s ≤ n − 2, and consider xt+s+1.
We prove this separately for i = n − s − 2, for i = n − 1, and for 0 ≤ n − s − 1 < i < n − 1. In each case, we obtain a new lower bound by averaging the current lower bounds, giving the highest weight, (1− γ), to the lower of the two values being averaged, as in Property 2. For i = n − s − 2, we have that:


t+s+1 n−s−2
t+s n−s−2
t+s n−s−2
t+s n−s−2
t+s n−s−1
(by definition)



t+s n−s−2
t+s n−s−2
(m + γsδ) (by the induction hypothesis)

≥ (1−γ)m+γ(m+γsδ) (by Property 2 and by the fact that ∀i, ∀t, γ < γt < 1−γ)
≥ m + γ(m + γsδ − m) ≥ m + γs+1δ

In the case of i = n − 1, we are averaging m and m + γsδ, hence xt+s+1 ≥
(1 − γ)m + γγsδ ≥ m + γs+1δ. For 0 < i < n − s − 2, we are averaging values greater than or equal to m, and thus the result will be greater than or equal to m. Finally, for n − s − 1 < i < n − 1, we have weighted averages of values greater than m + γsδ and therefore, xt+s+1 ≥ m + γsδ > m + γs+1δ.
As a consequence, when s = n − 1, that is at time t + n − 1, we have that
xt+n−1 ≥ m + γn−1δ for all i. Hence mini{xn−1}− mini{x0}≥ (m + γn−1δ) − m ≥
i	i	i
γn−1δ.	 
We are now ready to prove the General Theorem.
Proof. (of the General Theorem) We will show by contradiction that lm = lM . Let
lM − lm = δ > 0. Fix ϵ such that 0 < ϵ < γn−1δ and let T be such that for all
t > T , if m = min xt ,... , xt } and M = max xt ,... , xt } then lm − m < ϵ and
M − lM < ϵ. Note that M − m > δ.
Let mt = mini{xt}. Fix t > T . By Lemma 3.4,
mt+n−1 > mt + γn−1δ > m + ϵ > lm

which is a contradiction. Hence lM − lm = 0. Let us call this limit p.
For all xt, we have mt ≤ xt ≤ Mt. Since as t → ∞, mt → p and Mt → p,
i	i
xt → p also.	 

Weighted average rules
Several elementary FCA can be viewed as weighted averages of two values in a neighbourhood (or their negations) weighted by the third value (or its negation), closely resembling GW CA. Table 2 lists the elementary FCA with this feature. Note that in the following we will use (1 − x) and x¯ interchangeably.

Table 2
Weighted Average Rules. Rules equivalent under conjugation, reflection and both are indicated in parenthesis.

Although Theorem 3.2 does not apply directly to these rules (except for the case of rule R172), we can determine their asymptotic behavior by constructing, for each of them, a topologically conjugate system for which the theorem does apply. In this section we assume that the initial configurations are in the open interval (0, 1)n. We show convergence beginning with the simplest and progressing to the most complex.
We remind the reader that we will indicate by (p)n a spatial asymptotic ho- mogeneous configuration (p, p,... , p). We will also indicate a spatially periodic
n
configuration of the form (p, q, p, q,.. .) with (p, q) 2 , and analogous notation is used
for other periodicities.
Rule 172
The simplest rule to analyze is rule 172 where the state of xi at time t +1 is the average of xi and xi+1 weighted by xi−1 at time t.
Theorem 3.5 Rule 172 converges spatially and temporally to a homogeneous con- ﬁguration.

Proof. Rule 172 is the weighted average of xt and xt
, so, to apply Theorem 3.2

i	i+1
we only need to show that there exists a value 0 < γ < 1 such that the weights are
bounded by γ and (1 − γ). Let γ = min x0, ··· , x0	2	0	0	} then

∀t,


γ ≤ min xt , ··· , xt

, 1 − xt , ··· , 1 − xt
n−1, 1 − x0, ··· , 1 − xn−1
}

1 − γ ≥ max xt , ··· , xt	, 1 − xt , ··· , 1 − xt	}
Since the weights used by rule 172 are taken from these sets, it follows that γ ≤ γt ≤ 1 − γ and the conditions of Theorem 3.2 hold. Hence, there exists a value p such that xt → p for all i as t → ∞.	 
Note that any configuration (p)n is a fixed point for rule f172 since f172(p, p, p)= 
p ∀p, so the convergence value depends on the initial configuration.
Summary of results for t →∞ 


Rule 78
Consider rule R78 as a weighted average of xi and xi−1: xt+1

= (1 − xt

)xt +

t i+1
(1 − xt	).

Again, Theorem 3.2 does not apply directly to this rule since one of the values is inverted before it is averaged, so we will derive the asymptotic behaviour of FCA 78 by finding a topologically conjugate FCA to which Theorem 3.2 applies. In the
even case, this will simply involve inverting every other element and modifying the rules at each point appropriately. Accordingly, we would expect spatial periodicity

with period 2. In the odd case, we will double the length of the circular CA again inverting every other element so that at every iteration each value and its inverse is calculated.
Theorem 3.6 When n is even, rule 78 converges temporally to a homogeneous

conﬁguration. Furthermore, if xt converges to a value p, then for all i, xt
converges

0	2i

to p, and xt
converges to (1 − p). When n is odd, rule 78 converges to the

homogeneous conﬁguration ( 1 , 1 ,... , 1 ).

Proof.

Let A be a fuzzy cellular automaton following rule 78 and let f : (0, 1)3 → (0, 1) be its local rule and F its global rule.
Assume that n is even. Consider a GW CA A' with global rule F ' given by two local rules f ' ,f ' : (0, 1)3 → (0, 1) defined as follows:
1	2
'
f1(x, y, z)= zy + (1 − z)x
'
f2(x, y, z)= (1 − z)y + zx
which are applied in alternation to a configuration (x0, ··· , xn−1) as follows:
'	'	'	'
F (x0, ··· , xn−1)= (f1(xn−1, x0, x1), f2(x0, x1, x2), ··· , f2(xn−2, xn−1, x0))
Let h : (0, 1)n → (0, 1)n be a homeomorphism defined by:
h(x0, x1, x2,... , xn−1)= (x0, 1 − x1, x2,... , 1 − xn−1)
We want to show that F and F ' are conjugates, that is that h ◦ F = F ' ◦ h. Let
X = (x0, x1,... , xn−1) be an arbitrary configuration for A.
h ◦ F (x0, x1, ··· , xn−1)= 
= h((1−x1)x0 +x1(1−xn−1), (1−x2)x1 +x2(1−x0), ··· , (1−x0)xn−1 +x0(1−xn−2))

= ((1−x1)x0+x1(1−xn−1), (1 − x2)x1 + x2(1 − x0), ··· , (1 − x0)xn−1 + x0(1 − xn−2))
= ((1 − x1)x0 + x1(1 − xn−1), (1 − x2)(1 − x1)+ x2x0, ··· , (1 − x0)(1 − xn−1)+ x0xn−2)

F ' ◦ h(x0, x1, ··· , xn−1) == F '(x0, (1 − x1), ··· , (1 − xn−1))
= ((1 − x1)x0 + x1(1 − xn−1), (1 − x2)(1 − x1)+ x2x0, ··· , (1 − x0)(1 − xn−1)+ x0xn−2)
Since the weights are bounded as in the proof of Theorem 3.5, by Theorem 3.2, the GW CA A' converges to some point (p, p, ··· p). Then h−1(p, p, ··· , p)= (p, 1 − p, p, ··· , 1 − p) is the point of convergence A.
Xt → (p, 1 − p, ··· , p, 1 − p)
When n is odd, consider a GWCA B of length 2n with global rule F ' as above, and a homeomorphism h : A → B defined as:
h(x0, x1, ··· , xn−1)= (x0, x¯1, ··· , xn−1, x¯0, x1, ··· , x¯n−1).
Functions F and F ' are conjugate since h ◦ F = F ' ◦ h. In fact:
F ' ◦ h(x0, x1, ··· , xn−1)= F '(x0, x¯1, ··· , xn−1, x¯0, x1, ··· , x¯n−1)= 

(x¯1x0+x1x¯n−1, x¯2x¯1+x2x0, ··· , x¯0xn−1+x0x¯n−2, x¯1x¯0+x1xn−1, ··· , x¯0x¯n−1+x0xn−2),
while
h ◦ F (x0, x1, ··· , xn−1)= h(x¯1x0 + x1x¯n−1, x¯2x1 + x2x¯0, ··· , x¯0xn−1 + x0x¯n−2)= (x¯1x0+x1x¯n−1, x¯2x¯1+x2x0, ··· , x¯0xn−1+x0x¯n−2, x¯1x¯0+x1xn−1, ··· , x¯0x¯n−1+x0xn−2).
Since f ' and f ' are weighted sums of neighbours with bounds as in the proof of

1
Theorem 3.5, F '
2
must converge to a single value, p. But we also notice that for all

i, xt = (1 − xt) as t → ∞, since xt	= (1 − xt) → p also. So we must have that
i	i	i+n	i
p = 1 and h−1( 1 , ··· , 1 )= ( 1 , ··· , 1 ) is the point of convergence of A.

In this case, all values are inverted before averaging so will construct a system

Thus F ◦ F and F ' ◦ F ' are equal. Since both F ' and F ' are weighted averages

a homogeneous configuration. Moreover, every other iteration of A must also be converging.
If we let the limit of the even iterations be p, then

Note that any configuration (p)n is mapped to (1 − p)n by rule f27 since f27(p, p, p) = 1 − p ∀p, so the convergence values p and (1 − p) depend on the initial configuration.

Rule 58

The proof of the asymptotic behaviour of rule 58 combines both techniques used
above since it combined both essential properties: only one value is inverted before averaging so even and odd indices (when the length of the array is even) must be treated separately as for rule 78, and the value of xt itself is inverted in the average so two steps must be taken at a time as in the proof of rule 27. As a result, in the even case we have both spatial and temporal period 2.

Theorem 3.8 When n is even, rule 58 is spatially and temporally asymptotic with
period 2. Furthermore, if x2t → p then x2t+1 → 1 − p, x2t  → 1 − p and x2t+1 → p.

When n is odd, rule 58 converges to the homogeneous conﬁguration ( 1 , 1 ,... , 1 ).

Rule 184
We recall rule 184: xt+1 = (1 − xt)xt

+ xtxt	. Rules 184, 46, and 29 use xt itself

i	i	i−1
i  i+1	i

as the weighting factor in the average of its two neighbours. When n is even, we
effectively have two separate weighted averages, one of the even indices, the other of the odd. The weight factors in each case come from the other set of values. We will exploit this structure to determine topologically conjugate FCA where to apply Theorem 3.2.
Rule 184 is somewhat special because its Boolean version is known to be the only non trivial density conserving elementary rule [3]: the number of 1s in the initial configuration are preserved during the evolution. In [2] it is shown that the same property applies to the corresponding fuzzy rule as well. We remind that given a
configuration X, d(X)= 1 Σn−1 x . We now prove the convergence theorem.
Theorem 3.9 When n is even, rule 184 is asymptotically periodic with period 2

both spatially and temporally. Furthermore, if ∀i as t → ∞, x2t → p and x2t
→ q,

2i	2i+1
then x2t+1 → p, and x2t+1 → q with p + q = 2 Σn−1 x0. When n is odd, rule 184
converges spatially and temporally to a homogeneous conﬁguration. Moreover, if ∀i
as t → ∞, xt → p, then p = d(X0).
Proof. Let A be a fuzzy cellular automaton following rule 184 and let f : (0, 1)3 →
(0, 1) by f (x, y, z)= y¯x + yz be its local rule and F its global rule.
When n is even, let B be the fuzzy cellular automaton where the global rule G
is the left shift of F :
G(x0, ··· , xn−1)= (f (x0, x1, x2),f (x1, x2, x3), ··· ,f (xn−1, x0, x1)) Now let S be the shift self-homeomorphism of B:
S(x0, ··· , xn−1)= (xn−1, x0, ··· , xn−2)
Notice that S ◦ G = G ◦ S, also that F = S ◦ G. Now consider Fn: Fn = (S ◦ G)n =
SnGn = Gn.
Thus every n-th iteration of A is equal to every n-th iteration of B. Furthermore, in-between steps can be determined by the appropriate number of shifts of B. We will now determine the asymptotic behaviour of B.
Let B' be the cross product of two GW CA of length m = n/2 with global rule
G' given by:

'
G ((u0, ··· , um−1) × (v0, ··· , vm−1))
= (f (u0, v0, u1),f (u1, v1, u2), ··· ,f (um−1, vm−1, u0))
× (f (v0, u1, v1),f (v1, u2, v2), ··· ,f (vm−1, u0, v0)) with γ as in the proof of Theorem 3.5.
The topological space B is conjugate to B' under the homeomorphism h defined
as follows:
h(x0, ··· , xn−1)= (x0, x2, ··· , xn−2) × (x1, x3, ··· , xn−1)
To prove this we need to show that h ◦ G = G' ◦ h.	The i-th position of
G(x0, ··· , xn−2) is (1 − xi+1)xi + xi+1xi+2 so
h◦G(x0, ··· , xn−1)= h((1−x1)x0+x1x2, (1−x2)x1+x2x3, ··· , (1−x0)xn−1+x0x1)= ((1−x1)x0+x1x2, ··· , (1−xn−1)xn−2+xn−1x0)×((1−x2)x1+x2x3, ··· , (1−x0)xn−1+x0x1)
'				'=	((x , x , ··· , x	) × (x , x , ··· , x	)) =		◦ h(x , ··· , x	)
Both GW CA will converge to fixed points by Theorem 3.2. If (p, ··· , p) × (q, ··· , q) is the point of convergence of B', then h−1((p, ··· , p) × (q, ··· , q)) = (p, q, p, ··· , q) is the point of convergence of B.
Since, by definition, A’s global rule is given by the right shift of B’s global rule, the theorem follows. In summary we have,
X2t → (p, q, ··· , p, q)
X2t+1 → (q, p, ··· , q, p)
Now the sum of all values at the point of convergence is n (p + q). We know
from [2] that this must be equal to the sum of values in the initial configuration. Hence, p + q = 2 Σn−1 x0.
With n odd, we consider the system B described as above. However, this time we will consider a homeomorphism h given by:
h(x0, x1, ··· , xn−1)= (x0, x2, ··· , xn−1, x1, x3, ··· , xn−2) and a GW CA B' of size 2n with a new global rule G'. Let m = n+1 , then
'
G (x0, x1, ··· , xn−1)= (f (x0, xm, x1),f (x1, xm+1, x2), ··· ,f (xi, xm+i, fi+1), ·· ·)
where f is local rule 184, and γ as in the proof of Theorem 3.5.
The system B' is conjugate to B using h. To prove this we show that h◦G = G'◦h


h◦G(x0, x1, ··· , xn−1)= h((1−x1)x0+x1x2, (1−x2)x1+x2x3, ··· , (1−x0)xn−1+x0x1)
= (x¯1x0 +x1x2, x¯3x2 +x3x4, ··· , x¯0xn−1 +x0x1, x¯2x1 +x2x3, ··· , x¯n−1xn−2 +xn−1x0)

G' ◦ h(x0, x1, ··· , xn−1)= G'(x0, x2, ··· , xn−1, x1, x3, ··· , xn−2)= 
(x¯1x0 + x1x2, x¯3x2 + x3x4, ··· , x¯0xn−1 + x0x1, x¯2x1 + x2x3, ··· , x¯n−1xn−2 + xn−1x0)

Now G' must converge to a single value and since h merely reorders those values, G must also converge to a single value. Finally, since the shift is the identity of the point of convergence, A must converge to a single value both spatially and temporally. Moreover, if ∀i as t → ∞, xt → p, then p = d(X0) from [2]. 

Note that, given the special nature of rule 184, which conserves the density in time, we have been able, not only to determine the asymptotic periodicity, but also to derive the convergence point as a function of the initial configuration.

Rule 29
We now examine rule 29: xt+1 = xt(1 − xt

)+ (1 − xt)(1 − xt	).

Also rule 29, analogously to rule 184, has an interesting density conservation
property both in the fuzzy and in the Boolean domain, which holds when the initial configuration has even size, and which has never been observed before: the sum S of the values of a configuration at time t is conserved at any time t + 2i, ∀i; moreover, the sum of the values of a configuration at any time t + i, ∀i, is n − S, as we show below.
Lemma 3.10 Given a fuzzy CA with rule 29 and initial conﬁguration X =
(x0, ··· , x0	) for n even, if S = Σn−1 x0, then Σn−1 x2t = S and Σn−1 x2t+1 =

In particular, Σn−1 x1 = n − S.
Now at time t + 2, Σn−1 xt+2 = n − Σn−1 xt+1 = n − (n − Σn−1 xt)= Σn−1 xt,
so every other iteration will have the same density, as required.

This lemma obviously applies as well in the Boolean case.

Corollary 3.11 If the initial conﬁguration has length n and density d, all subse- quent even numbered iterations will have density d while odd iterations will have density n − d.
We can show convergence using sub-arrays as in the previous case. However, the rules for each sub-array are average the inverted values as for rule 27 so we will need to consider two steps at a time. The convergence lemma allows us to describe more precisely the point of convergence in the even case.
Theorem 3.12 When n is even, rule 29 is asymptotically periodic with period 2
both spatially and temporally. Furthermore, if ∀i as t → ∞, x2t → p, and x2t	→ q
2i	2i+1
then x2t+1 → 1 − q, and x2t+1 → 1 − p. Furthermore, p + q = 2d(X0). When n is
2i	2i+1
odd, rule 29 converges spatially to a homogeneous conﬁguration and is asymptotically
periodic with period 2 temporally.

Rule 46
Rule 46 yields the most interesting results of all FCA in this group and it appears to be unique among all elementary FCA. In fact, from the experimental observa- tions of [9] it is the only rule with periodic behavior of length 4. It once again uses the central value as the weight factor, but the resulting rule individuates sub- automata where the rule uses one value directly while the other is inverted resulting in temporally periodic behaviour in each of the GW CA in the cross product.
Theorem 3.13 When n modulo 4 is equal to 0, rule 46 is asymptotically periodic with period 4 both spatially and temporally. Furthermore, if ∀i as t → ∞, x4t → p,

and x4t
→ q then x4t
→ 1−p, and x4t
→ 1−q. Also, x4t+1 → q, x4t+2 → 1−p,

4i+1
4i+2

and x4t+3 → 1 − q. When n modulo 4 is not equal to 0, rule 46 converges to the
homogeneous conﬁguration ( 1 , 1 ,... , 1 ).

Concluding remarks and open problems
In this paper we have focused on asymptotic behavior of circular elementary FCA starting the analytical explanation of the empirical classification suggested in [9]. We started with weighted average rules: a class of rules that contains most of the observed behaviors and we studied their dynamics confirming the observations.
Based on the insights obtained by this analysis and on careful study of other common properties, we are are now studying the other elementary CAs with the goal of completing the analytical study of all elementary rules.
Assuming that the empirical classification is indeed accurate, an interesting open problems is to understand the reasons of these particular periods length: why are all elementary circular FCA of size n eventually converging to temporal periodicity of lengths 1,2,4, or n ? The periodicity is clearly connected to circularity and to the neighborhood’s size, but the explanation of these particular lengths is not known.
The asymptotic analysis of this paper heavily rely on circularity of the lattice; quiescent backgrounds obviously do provide different types of convergences [16]. It would be interesting to understand the behavior for infinite configurations.
Finally, it has been proven in [2] that the fixed points of a FCA based on DFN- fuzzification are the mean field approximations for the corresponding Boolean rule. The most obvious consequence of that result is that when a FCA converges to a homogeneous configuration, the point of convergence is a rough estimate of the asymptotic density of the Boolean rule (this is the case, for example, of weighted average rule 172). What is more interesting, and is now under investigation, is what the FCA indicate about the density of the Boolean rule when they do not converge homogeneously.
