Abstract
In this paper, concepts of strongly way below relations, completely precontinuous posets, coprimes and Heyting posets are introduced. The main results are: (1) The strongly way below relations of completely precontinuous posets have the interpolation property; (2) A poset P is a completely precontinuous poset iff its normal completion is a completely distributive lattice; (3) An ω-chain complete P is completely precontinuous iff P and P op are precontinuous and its normal completion is distributive iff P is precontinuous and has enough coprimes; (4) A poset P is completely precontinuous iff the strongly way below relation is the smallest approximating auxiliary relation on P iff P is a Heyting poset and there is a smallest approximating auxiliary relation on P . Finally, given a poset P and an auxiliary relation on P , we characterize those join- dense subsets of P whose strongly way-below relation agrees with the given auxiliary relation.
Keywords: Completely precontinuous poset, completely distributive lattice, normal completion, coprime, auxiliary relation.


Introduction
The theory of continuous domains arose independently in a variety of mathematical contexts. Due to their strong connections to computer science, general topology and topological algebra, continuous domains have been extensively studied by people coming from various areas [1,9]. There are several different equivalent ways to define continuous domains, the most straightforward one is formulated by using the way below relation. We say x way below y, denoted by x  y, iff x ∈⇓ y :=  {↓ D : D is directed and y ≤ ∨D}. A dcpo P is called a continuous domain if each of

the sets ⇓ y is directed and has join y. This definition has turned out to be very fruitful for many categorical and topological developments generalizing the theory of continuous lattices, but it is still rather restrictive, taking into consideration only dcpos. However, some naturally arising posets are important but fail to be directed complete. So, there are more and more occasions to study posets which lack suprema of directed sets (see [7,10,15,17]). Though continuous posets inherit some good properties of continuous domains, but they also lose some hopeful properties, for example, they are not completion-invariant [5], i.e. the normal completion of a continuous poset is not always a continuous lattice (see [3]). In [3], Erne´ introduced a new way below relation and the concept of precontinuous posets by taking Frink ideals [8] instead of directed lower sets, which are not restricted to dcpos and have the desired completion-invariant property.
A complete lattice is completely distributive if it satisfies the most general dis- tributivity [9]. Taking arbitrary subsets instead of directed ones leads to the strong way below relation a, where xay iff x ∈⇓ y := {↓ Y : y ≤ ∨Y }. Since Raney [13] proved that a complete lattice L is completely distributive iff x = ∨{y ∈ L : y a x}, many people have studied this structure (see [4,6,16]). In [18], Zhao generalized the concept of completely distributive lattices to general posets and introduced the con- cept of supercontinuous posets, which inherit some good properties of completely distributive lattices, but they fail to be completion-invariant. A simple counterex- ample will be given in Section 2.
Now questions naturally arise: What is the counterpart of a precontinuous poset in the realm of completely distributive lattices and to what extent does the coun- terpart possess the completion-invariant property? In this paper, we answer these questions. First, in the manner of Erne´, we introduce a strongly way below rela- tion for arbitrary posets. The fundamental idea is to replace each inequality of the form x ≤ ∨Y by the condition that x be less or equal to every upper bound of Y . Thereby, we avoid the use of any join. Then we introduce the concept of completely precontinuous posets, which are precisely those in which every element is the join of its strong way below elements. It is proved that the strongly way below relations of completely precontinuous posets have the interpolation property and that a poset is completely precontinuous iff its normal completion is a completely distributive lattice. Considering relationships of precontinuous posets and completely precon- tinuous posets, we show that an ω-chain complete is completely precontinuous iff it and its dual are precontinuous and its normal completion is distributive iff it is pre- continuous and has enough coprimes. We also locate the strong way below relation within auxiliary relations, it is proved that a poset is completely precontinuous iff the strong way below relation is the smallest approximating auxiliary relation iff it is a Heyting poset and there is a smallest approximating auxiliary relation. At the end of this paper, given a poset P with an auxiliary relation, we characterize those join-dense subsets of P whose strongly way-below relation agrees with the given auxiliary relation.

Preliminaries
Let P be a poset.  For all x ∈ P , A ⊆ P , let ↑ x = {y ∈ P : x ≤ y} and
↑ A = a∈A ↑ a; ↓ x and ↓ A are defined dually. Let D(P )= {A ⊆ P : A =↓ A}. A↑ and A↓ denote the sets of all upper and lower bounds of A, respectively. Let Aδ = (A↑)↓ and δ(P )= {Aδ : A ⊆ P}. (δ(P ), ⊆) is called the normal completion, or the Dedekind-MacNeille completion of P . By a completion-invariant property we mean a property that holds for P iff it holds for any normal completion of P . Let δ(P )c = {B : P\B ∈ δ(P )}. A subset I ⊆ P is called a Frink ideal if for all finite subsets Z ⊆ I, we have Zδ ⊆ I. Let Fid(P ) denote the set of all Frink ideals of P .
The following lemma is well-known (see [5]).
Lemma 2.1 Let P be a poset.
The maps (−)↑ : (2P )op → 2P , A '→ A↑ and (−)↓ : 2P → (2P )op, A '→ A↓ are order preserving.
((−)↑, (−)↓) is a Galois connection between (2P )op and 2P , that is, for all A, B ⊆ P, B↑ ⊇ A ⇔ B ⊆ A↓. Thus both δ : 2P → 2P , A '→ Aδ = (A↑)↓ and δ∗ : 2P → 2P , A '→ (A↓)↑ are closure operators.
For all {Cj : j ∈ J}⊆ 2P , (  Cj)↑ = T Cj↑, (  Cj)↓ = T Cj↓.
Let L = δ(P ). For all {A δ : i ∈ I} ⊆ L,	{A δ : i ∈ I} =	{A δ : i ∈ I},
  L{Aiδ : i ∈ I} = (  {Aiδ : i ∈ I})δ = (  Ai)δ.
Corollary 2.2 Let P be a poset. Then the map j : P → δ(P ), x '→↓ x is an order embedding of P in normal completion δ(P ) and
j preserves all existing joins and meets;

For all Aδ ∈ δ(P ), Aδ =
a∈A
j(a)= 
a∈Aδ
j(a).

For two sets X and Y , we call ρ : X - Y a binary relation if ρ ⊆ X × Y . When X = Y , ρ is usually called a binary relation on X. For ρ : X - Y and τ : Y - Z, define τ ◦ ρ = {(x, z) ∈ X × Z : there exists y ∈ Y with (x, y) ∈ ρ and (y, z) ∈ τ}. The relation τ ◦ ρ : X - Z is called the composition of ρ and τ .
Definition 2.3 ([14]) A binary relation ρ : X - Y is called regular if there exists
τ : Y - X such that ρ ◦ τ ◦ ρ = ρ.
Definition 2.4 ([9]) A binary relation и on a nonempty set X is said to have the interpolation property, if for all x, y ∈ X with x и y, there exists z ∈ X such that x и z и y.
Completely Precontinuous Posets
In [18], Zhao generalized the concept of completely distributive lattices to general posets and introduced the following

Definition 3.1 Let P be a poset.
Given any two elements x and y in P , we write x ( y if for any subset A ⊆ P
with ∨A existing and y ≤ ∨A, there exists z ∈ A with x ≤ z.
A poset P is called supercontinuous if for all x ∈ P , x = ∨{y ∈ P : y ( x}.
The supercontinuity fails to be completion-invariant, as following simple example shows.
Example 3.2 Let P = {a, b, c} with discrete order. Obviously, P is supercon- tinuous. But δ(P ) = {∅, X, {a}, {b}, {c}} is not distributive. Thus δ(P ) is not a completely distributive lattice.
To obtain the desired completion-invariance property, we will introduce a new continuity concept.
Definition 3.3 Let P be a poset. Given any two elements x and y in P , we say
x is strongly way below y (in symbols: xa y) if x ∈⇓ y :=  {I ∈ D(P ): y ∈ Iδ}.
It is easy to get the following two propositions
Proposition 3.4 In a poset P, the following statements hold for all u, x, y, z ∈ P.
xay implies x ≤ y;
u ≤ xay ≤ z implies ua z.
if a smallest element 0 exists, then 0 a x.
Proposition 3.5 For a poset P, x, y ∈ P, the following conditions are equivalent.
xa y;
y ∈/ (P\↑ x)δ;
y ∈ P\(P\↑ x)δ ⊆↑ x.
Remark 3.6 If X ⊆↓ x, then x = sup X iff x ∈ Xδ.
Definition 3.7 A poset P is called completely precontinuous if for all x ∈ P ,
x ∈ (⇓ x)δ.
By Remark 3.6, we have that a poset P is completely precontinuous iff x = sup ⇓ x for all x ∈ P .
Obviously, complete precontinuity implies supercontinuity. However, the con- verse is not true by Example 3.2 and Theorem 3.10.
Proposition 3.8 P is a chain iff δ(P ) is a chain.
Proof. If P is a chain, then its set of lower sets ordered by inclusion is a chain, and thus δ(P ) is a chain, since it consists of lower sets. Conversely P order embeds in δ(P ) by Corollary 2.2, so is a chain if δ(P ) is.	2
Proposition 3.9 Let P be a poset. Then for all x, y ∈ P, xay in P iff ↓ x (↓ y
in δ(P ).

Proof. For all {Bδ : i ∈ I} ⊆ δ(P ) with ↓ y ⊆ 

δ(P )
Bδ, we have ↓ y ⊆ (  Bi)δ

i∈I
by Lemma 2.1. Since xa y, x ∈	↓ Bi. Thus there exists i ∈ I such that x ∈↓ Bi.
i∈I
Therefore, ↓ x ⊆ Bδ.
Conversely, for all I ∈ D(P ) with y ∈ Iδ =	δ(P ){↓ z : z ∈ I}, since ↓ x (↓ y, there exists z ∈ I such that ↓ x ⊆↓ z. Thus x ∈ I.		2
It will be convenient to introduce the following three operators:
δ : 2P → 2P , δ(Y )= Y δ;
⇓: 2P → 2P , ⇓ Y = {x : xay for some y ∈ Y }.
⇑: 2P → 2P , ⇑ Y = {x : y a x for some y ∈ Y }.
Notice that δ(Y ) and ⇓ Y are always lower sets so that the restrictions
Δ= δ|D(P ) and o =⇓ |D(P )
are self-maps of D(P ). The following inclusions hold throughout:
⇓ Y =⇓↓ Y ⊆⇓ Y δ ⊆↓ Y ⊆↓ Y δ = Y δ.
By Lemma 2.1, Proposition 3.5 and Theorem 2.2 in [14], we can get the following
Theorem 3.10 For a poset P, the following conditions are equivalent:
P is completely precontinuous;
The relation ¢ on P is regular;
For all x, y ∈ P with x ¢ y, there are u, v ∈ P such that
x ¢ v, u ¢ y, and
for all z ∈ P, u ≤ z or z ≤ v.
Y ⊆ (⇓ Y )δ for all Y ⊆ P;
Y δ = (⇓ Y )δ for all Y ⊆ P;
The pair (Δ, o) is a Galois connection of the complete lattice D(P ), i.e. oΔ 
Y ⊆ Y ⊆Δ oY for all Y ∈ D(P );
Δ: D(P ) → D(P ) preserves arbitrary intersections;
Δ induces a complete homomorphism from D(P ) onto the normal completion
δ(P );
The normal completion δ(P ) is a completely distributive lattice.
Remark 3.11 The equivalence of (3) and (9) was firstly obtained by H.J.Bandelt in [2].
From Proposition 3.8 and Theorem 3.10, we can immediately get the following two corollaries.
Corollary 3.12 Completely precontinuous is self-dual.
Corollary 3.13 Every chain is completely precontinuous.
Proposition 3.14 For a poset P, the following two conditions are equivalent:

P is completely precontinuous;
For all a ∈ P, P\↓ a =  {⇑ x : x ∈ P\↓ a}.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Obviously.

(2) ⇒ (1): If there is x ∈ P with x ∈/
(⇓ x)δ, then there exists y ∈ P with

⇓ x ⊆↓ y such that x ¢ y. Thus x ∈ P\ ↓ y. So, there exists a ∈ P\ ↓ y such that
x ∈⇑ a, that is, a ¢ y and aa x, a contradiction to ⇓ x ⊆↓ y.	2

Theorem 3.10 also yields several criteria of complete distributivity for complete lattice: Observing that a complete lattice is isomorphic to its completion, we get (cf.2,12,13,14)
Corollary 3.15 For a complete lattice L, the following conditions are equivalent:
L is a completely distributive lattice;
Lop is a completely distributive lattice;
y = ∨⇓ y for all y ∈ L;
∨Y = ∨⇓ Y for all Y ⊆ L;
Y '→↓ ∨Y : D(L) → D(L) preserves arbitrary intersections;
Y '→ ∨Y induces a complete homomorphism from D(L) onto L;
L is a complete homomorphic image of a complete ring of sets;
The relation ¢ on L is regular;
For all x, y ∈ L with x ¢ y, there are u, v ∈ L such that
x ¢ v, u ¢ y, and
for all z ∈ P, u ≤ z or z ≤ v;
For all a ∈ L, L\↓ a =  {⇑ x : x ∈ L\↓ a}.
By Theorem 3.10, we can get the following
Theorem 3.16 If P is a completely precontinuous poset, then a ◦ a = a, i.e. a has the interpolation property.
The next theorem clarifies the relationships between complete precontinuity of a poset P and the system δ(P )c.
Theorem 3.17 For a poset P, the following conditions are equivalent:
P is completely precontinuous;
(P\U )δ = P\⇑ U for all upper sets U;
P\A =⇑ (P\A) for all A ∈ δ(P );
For all x ∈ P, P\↓ x =⇑ (P\↓ x);
δ(P )c = {⇑ Y : Y ⊆ P} and a has the interpolation property.

Coprimes
Definition 4.1 An elements p in a poset P is called coprime if for all finite F ⊆ P ,
p ∈ F δ implies p ∈↓ F . The set of coprimes is denoted by Coprime(P ).
Remark 4.2 For sup semilattices the preceding definition of coprime is equivalent to the standard one ([9, Definition I-3.11]).
Proposition 4.3 For a poset P and p ∈ P, the following conditions are equivalent:
p ∈ Coprime(P );
For all x1, x2 ∈ P, p ∈ ({x1, x2})δ implies p ∈↓ x1∪↓ x2.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Trivial.
(2) ⇒ (1): For all finite F = {x1, ··· , xn}⊆ P with p ∈ F δ = ( n	↓ xi)δ. For
all x ∈ (  n	↓ xi)↑, we have  n	↓ xi ⊆↓ x1∪ ↓ x. Thus p ∈ (↓ x1∪ ↓ x)δ. By
(2), p ≤ x1 or p ≤ x. If p ¢ x1, then p ≤ x. Thus p ∈ (  n	↓ xi)δ. Repeating the
above steps, we can obtain p ∈↓ F .	2
Definition 4.4 ([9]) A poset P is called ω-chain complete if every countable chain has a sup.
Lemma 4.5 Let P be ω-chain complete and a have the interpolation property, x, y ∈ P, x ¢ y. If there exists u ∈ P such that uax and u ¢ y, then there exists p ∈ Coprime(P ) such that pax and p ¢ y.
Definition 4.6 ([3]) Let P be a poset.
Given two elements x, y ∈ P , we say x is way-below y, in symbols x  y, if
y ∈ Iδ implies x ∈ I for all I ∈ Fid(P ).
P is called precontinuous if for each x ∈ P , x ∈ ({y ∈ P : y  x})δ.
Theorem 4.7 ([3]) For a poset P, the following two conditions are equivalent:
P is precontinuous;
δ(P ) is a continuous lattice.
Theorem 4.8 ([9,11]) Let L be a complete lattice. Then the following two condi- tions are equivalent:
L is completely distributive;
L and Lop are continuous lattices, and L is distributive.
By Lemma 4.5, Theorem 4.7 and Theorem 4.8, we can get the following
Theorem 4.9 For a poset P, consider the following conditions:
P is completely precontinuous;
P and P op are precontinuous, and δ(P ) is distributive;
P is precontinuous and has enough coprimes.
Then (3) ⇒ (1) ⇔ (2); If P is an ω-chain complete, then (1) ⇒ (3).

Locating the strongly way below relation a within Aux(P)
In this section, we firstly characterize completely precontinuous posets by auxiliary relations. Then we construct those posets which are completely precontinuous and whose strongly way below relation a agrees with ≺.
Definition 5.1 ([9]) We say that a binary relation ≺ on a poset P is an auxiliary relation, if it satisfies the following conditions for all u, x, y, z ∈ P ,
x ≺ y implies x ≤ y;
u ≤ x ≺ y ≤ z implies u ≺ z;
if a smallest element 0 exists, then 0 ≺ x.
The set of all auxiliary relations on a poset P will be denoted by Aux(P ). As Aux(P ) is closed under arbitrary intersections in 2P ×P , it is therefore a complete lattice. Let T x = {y ∈ P : x ≺ y} and ] x = {y ∈ P : y ≺ x}.
Definition 5.2 ([9]) An auxiliary relation ≺ on a poset P is approximating if for all x ∈ P , x ∈ (] x)δ. The set of all approximating auxiliary relations is denoted by App(P ).
Proposition 5.3 ([9]) Let P be a poset and let M be the set of all monotone func- tions s : P → D(P )) satisfying s(x) ⊆↓ x for all x ∈ P - considered as a poset relative to the ordering s ≤ t iff s(x) ⊆ t(x) for all x ∈ P. Then the mapping
φ : Aux(L) → M, φ(≺)= s≺ = (x '→ {y : y ≺ x})
is a well-deﬁned isomorphism from Aux(P ) onto M, whose inverse associates to each function s ∈ M the relation ≺s given by
x ≺s y ⇔ x ∈ s(y).
From the definition of strongly way below relation a, we have sa(x) =	{T ∈
D(P ): x ∈ T δ} for all x ∈ P .
By Proposition 5.3, we can get the following
Lemma 5.4 Let P be a poset. For each T ∈ D(P ), we deﬁne the function mT :
P → D(P ) by


mT (x)= 
↓ x ∩ T,	if x ∈ T δ,
↓ x,	otherwise.

Then mT ∈ M for all T ∈ D(P ) and a =	{≺mT : T ∈ D(P )}.
Definition 5.5 A poset P is called Heyting if for each x ∈ P and A ⊆ P , x ∈ Aδ
implies x ∈ (↓ x∩↓ A)δ.
Obviously, in a complete lattice, the definition of a Heyting poset agrees with that of a frame [8].

Lemma 5.6 In a Heyting poset P, all relations s≺m
belonging to the functions

mT for T ∈ D(P ) are approximating. This holds, in particular, for completely
precontinuous posets, as these are Heyting posets.
By Lemma 5.4 and Lemma 5.6, we can get the following
Lemma 5.7 In a poset P, the strong way below relation a is contained in all ap- proximating auxiliary relations, and is equal to their intersection, if P is a Heyting poset.
By Lemma 5.7, we can get the following
Theorem 5.8 For a poset P, the following conditions are equivalent:
P is completely precontinuous;
a is the smallest approximating auxiliary relation on P;
P is a Heyting poset and there is a smallest approximating auxiliary relation on P.
To conclude the paper, we construct posets which are completely precontinu- ous and whose strongly way below relation a agrees with ≺. In cases of possible ambiguity, we shall use superscripts to distinguish between concepts related to two posets P and Q , here aP from aQ.
Definition 5.9 ([5]) Let P be a poset. We say that S ⊆ P is join-dense in P if
x ∈ (↓ x ∩ S)δ for all x ∈ P .
Theorem 5.10 Let S be join-dense in a poset P and ≺ an auxiliary relation on S. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
P is completely precontinuous and ≺ agrees with aP on S.
The conjunction of
For all x, y ∈ S, x ≺ y implies x aP y.
For all x ∈ S, x ∈ (] x ∩ S)δ.

Summary
In this paper, based on cut operator, the concept of completely precontinuous posets is introduced as a generalization of completely distributive lattices. Some properties and characterizations of completely precontinuous posets are investigated. In par- ticular, we discuss the relationships between completely precontinuous posets and precontinuous posets. The important contribution of this paper is that we show that a poset is completely precontinuous iff its normal completion is a completely distributive lattice. Therefore, from the sense of Erne´ in [3], our generalization is a good generalization.
