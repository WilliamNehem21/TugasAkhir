Abstract With the increased usage of time-critical applications, the need for differentiation among service classes has become a major goal in research communities. Optical burst switching (OBS) is one of the most promising switching technologies to cope with heavy traffic diversity. To satisfy the bandwidth requirement in OBS networks, the recent literature suggests two efficient techniques: one is based on offset time and the other is on wavelength reservation. In this paper, we analyze the wavelength reservation based technique to support a given number of service classes. We describe a Markov model to estimate the blocking probabilities of various service classes. Simulation is con- ducted at one of the output ports of a core node to validate the model.

Introduction

Since the last few years, the Internet is experiencing an expo- nential growth in IP traffic [1]. With the increased usage of bandwidth sensitive applications such as video conferencing, voice-on-demand and other multimedia applications, this growing trend is expected to continue for many years to come [2]. To meet this overwhelming demand for bandwidth, wave-

length division multiplexing (WDM) technology [3] has become an effective choice for the backbone networks. OBS [4,5] is a promising switching paradigm to carry IP traffic over WDM networks. In the context of OBS, the unit of transmis- sion is a burst. The transmission of each burst is preceded by the transmission of a burst header packet (BHP) to reserve wavelength resources for the upcoming data burst. The BHP undergoes O/E/O conversion at intermediate nodes while the data burst is transmitted all-optically. Unlike circuit switching, a source node does not wait for confirmation that an end-to- end connection has been established; instead, it starts transmit- ting the burst after a delay referred to as offset, following the transmission of the BHP [6]. The value of the offset time should be greater than or at least equal to the total processing delay encountered by the BHP.

(QoS) differentiation mechanisms to satisfy the burst loss probability (BLP) requirements of various service classes are studied.

Analytical results validating the models are given in Section 5. In Section 6, we conclude the paper.

Signaling protocols in OBS networks

Signaling specifies the protocol used for handling traffic requests, and its operation determines whether or not the bandwidth resource is efficiently utilized [7]. Several signal- ing protocols have been proposed for OBS networks. Among these, two most widely used protocols in the litera- ture are Just-Enough-Time (JET) and Just-In-Time (JIT) protocols, both of which use the offset-based signaling tech- nique [8].
Based on the duration of reservation on the wavelength channel, signaling techniques can be categorized as immediate reservation or delayed reservation [9]. In the immediate reser- vation technique, the channel on which the data burst is due to arrive is reserved immediately after the BHP is processed. On the other hand, in the delayed reservation technique, the chan- nel is reserved only for the duration of the data burst. When the BHP arrives on the control wavelength, it informs the core node about the upcoming burst length, arrival time, and the wavelength used [10]. For example, JIT signaling protocol uses immediate reservation, while the JET signaling protocol adopts delayed reservation. Since the bandwidth is reserved even when there is no burst, the utilization in JIT protocol is poorer compared to JET protocol. JET protocol outperforms JIT protocol in terms of bandwidth utilization and BLP at the expense of increased computational complexity at the core nodes.
In OBS networks with multiple wavelength channels per link, a scheduling algorithm must be implemented to select the channel on which a burst should be forwarded. In general, wavelength scheduling algorithms can be divided into two dis- tinct categories: non-void filling and void filling algorithms. The non-void filling algorithm maintains the latest available unscheduled time on each wavelength and when a new burst arrives it is scheduled on a wavelength such that the void size is minimized. Examples of algorithms in this category include FFUC (First Fit Unscheduled Channel) [11] and LAUC (Lat- est Available Unscheduled Channel) [12].
On the other hand, void filling algorithms keep track of all the voids on the wavelengths and try to schedule a burst in one of the voids whenever possible. Examples of this category of algorithms are LAUC-VF (Latest Available Unused Channel with Void Filling) [12], PLAUC-VF (Preemptive Latest Avail- able Unused Channel with Void Filling) [13].
The signaling protocol used in an OBS network plays a prominent role in determining the blocking probability for data bursts in that network [14]. For the JIT protocol, the blocking probability can be calculated by modeling the output
port as a M/G/k/k queue, and using the well-known Erlang’s
B formula for the loss probability:
offered load. For the JIT protocol, the offered load is k(b + a), In this equation, k is the number of wavelengths, and q is the where k is the mean burst arrival rate, a is the burst offset-time
in time units, and b is the burst duration in time units. Erlang’s B formula has also been used to approximate the blocking probability for the JET protocol by treating the output port as a traditional loss system with an offered load of kb.

QoS differentiation in OBS networks

Burst loss due to contention is a major concern in OBS net- works. Such contention losses can heavily degrade the perfor- mance of OBS networks. Contention occurs when two or more bursts intend to take the same output port, on the same wave- length, at the same time. OBS is a buffer-less technology and OBS networks belong to the class of loss networks [15,16]. The lack of efficient optical buffers makes the task of designing QoS differentiation mechanisms for OBS networks even more important when contention for resources leads to burst loss. The key idea of QoS differentiation mechanism is to allocate more resources to higher priority classes compared to lower priority classes. The wavelength reservation based QoS differ- entiation mechanism is studied in the literature under the fol- lowing two alternatives.

Offset time based approach

The logical explanation of this approach [17,18] is that if the offset time is relatively large, then bandwidth will be reserved before other bursts have a chance to make a reservation. To achieve a certain degree of isolation from lower-priority bursts, an additional offset time is provided to bursts belonging to higher priority classes. A big advantage of this approach is that it is implemented only at the OBS ingress edge nodes and no modifications in the core of the network are required.
To make a tractable analysis, we consider a system with a single switch and a single output port. For instance, we con- sider two classes of traffic, namely class 1 (higher priority traf- fic), and class 0 (lower priority traffic). To ensure a higher priority for wavelength reservation, an additional offset time, denoted by Toffset is given to class 1 traffic. We denote by tai and tsi the arrival time and the service time for class i (i = 0, 1) traffic respectively. Let li denote the average burst length of class i (i = 0, 1) traffic. We refer to Fig. 1 where a burst request from class 0 arrives, followed by a burst request
from class 1 traffic. Though ta1 < ts0 + l0, the blocking of class
the condition ta1 + Toffset > ts0 + l0 holds. Thus, Toffset needs to 1 request can be avoided by selecting a proper Toffset such that be larger than the average burst length of class 0 traffic to
avoid blocking of a class 1 burst by a class 0 burst.

Figure 1	Additional offset time for class 1 traffic.

Consider Fig. 1 when the condition ta1 ﬃ ts0 holds. Assum- ing the burst length is exponentially distributed with an aver-
age of l0, the probability P that a burst in class 1 avoids being blocked by a class 0 burst is given by the following:
Toffset
Wmin = 0; Wmax = W; i = 1, 2, 3, ... P	(3)
In case of a wavelength partitioning (WP) policy, the wave-
length space is partitioned among the P traffic classes and each class has a dedicated access to a subset of W wavelengths [22].

Thus, the wavelength bounds for the traffic classes are stated
as follows:

Wavelength reservation based approach

In this approach [19], more wavelength resources are allocated to higher priority bursts compared to the lower priority bursts according to a threshold parameter. In a 2-class system, the lower priority bursts are discarded when the occupancy of
At last, the family of generalized wavelength sharing
(GWS) policies are examined. GWS not only reserves Wmin number of wavelengths to be used exclusively by class i bursts, but also restricts the number of wavelengths that can be occu- pied simultaneously by class i bursts to Wmax. The wavelength lower and upper bounds for each class are defined as follows:

Analytical model

Markov Decision Processes (MDP) are the fundamental aspects to analyze stochastic systems [23]. In this section, we present a Markov model for a single class OBS system that employs wavelength reservation based QoS mechanism as shown in Fig. 3. We consider a single switch and one of its out- put ports that carries W wavelengths. Further, we assume that there is no use of fiber delay lines (FDLs).
dom variable X(t) that defines the number of wavelengths busy For the above depicted Markov model, we denote a ran- in serving class k bursts at time instant t. Let kk and lk denote
the arrival and the service rate of traffic class k. The above con- tinuous time Markov model is a one dimensional birth and death process, and follows the following postulates:

According to the above postulates, we can state that:

At steady state, limt→∞Pij(t)= Pj and limt→∞P' (t)= 0.
Hence, at steady state the above derivation can be restated
as follows:
— kkP0 + lkP1 = 0
From Eq. (10), we observe that the probability of being in state 0 denoted by P0 decreases with the increase in traffic intensity.

Assumptions

There are two traffic classes namely Low (L) and High (H) with burst arrival rates k1 and k2 respectively.
Each output port consists of W wavelengths where bursts from class L traffic are allowed to use at most W S wave-
lengths at any given time. Accordingly, the pair of wave- length lower and upper bounds for class L traffic is
(0, W S) and for class H traffic is (0, W ) respectively.
Without loss of generality, the aforementioned assumptions
can be used to model a two dimensional birth and death pro- cess as shown in Fig. 6. A state of the system at time instant t
can be characterized by the pair (n1, n2) where n1 and n2 are the
number of wavelengths assigned to the bursts of classes L and
H respectively. According to the above assumptions, n1 6 WS
and n1 + n2 6 W.

and j wavelengths to the bursts of class L and class H respec- tively and is stated as below:

lengths are busy and its blocking probability is calculated by the probability of being in state W, denoted by PW. The block- ing probability of a burst increases with the increase in traffic intensity for a given W as shown in Fig. 5. PW increases with

q = q1 + q2 and the whole wavelength space is allocated to this sum of the traffic intensities of both class L and class H, i.e. traffic intensity.
Figs. 9–14 validate Eq. (11) for a given W, WS and q1. It is observed that with increase in higher class traffic intensity q2,
the probability of being in state (1, 0) decreases.
In Figs. 15–18, we study the effect of increasing the traffic
intensity of class H on the BLP of both class L and the shared system for a given W, WS and q1. It is observed that class H bursts suffer lesser loss compared to class L bursts. Blocking probabilities of both class L and class H increase as q2
increases. In order to demonstrate service class isolation, PShared is also depicted as a function of q2. It is observed that PShared lies between PH and PL, implying that bursts of class H are prioritized to those of class L.
In Figs. 19 and 20, we have studied the impact of increasing the traffic intensity of class L on the BLP of class H for a given W and WS respectively. It is observed that the blocking prob- ability of class H bursts increases with the increase in q1. It is because a class H burst has a lower chance of using the spared wavelengths from the pool of wavelengths allocated to class L when q1 is sufficiently large.
In Figs. 21 and 22, we have studied the impact of WS on the BLP of class H for a given W and q1 respectively. It is observed that the blocking probability of class H bursts increases with the increase in WS. When class L is privileged with more num- ber of wavelengths and with the increase in class L traffic, a burst from class H lessens its chance of getting a free wavelength.

Conclusion

In this paper, we presented an analytical model for the wave- length reservation based QoS differentiation mechanism in OBS networks. The model is studied in depth for a single class system and then generalized to a k-class service system. Through simulation, we examined the impact of higher prior- ity traffic classes on the performance of lower priority classes in terms of blocking probability. During simulation, a shared traffic system is also examined to exhibit the QoS differentia- tion among multiple traffic classes. Through the numerical results, it is concluded that service classes with more allocated wavelengths experience lesser BLP compared to classless sys- tems, while those with lesser wavelengths suffer heavy burst losses.
