Abstract
In this paper, we tried to evaluate the fractional derivatives by using the Chebyshev series expansion. We discuss the indefinite quadrature rule to estimate the fractional derivatives of Riemann-Liouville type.
Keywords: Fractional derivative, Chebyshev series expansion, Quadrature formula


Introduction
When 0 < α < 1, the definition of Riemann-Liouville type fractional derivative is written as
	1		∫t

(1)
Dαf (t) = Γ(1
α) D
0
(t − τ )−αf (τ )dτ.

We can rewrite the above equation with integration by parts as follows,


t−α
	1	 ∫t

(2)
Dαf (t) = Γ(1
— α) f (0) + Γ(1
α)
0
(t − τ )−αDf (τ )dτ,

where Df means the first order derivative of f .
We try to compute the above integration as a derivative of f (x) of order α.

Indefinite quadrature formula
For the finite integration of the product of a sufficient smooth function and a special function, Hasegawa et al.[1][2] proposed to estimate the approximation of the infinite integration when the special function has the type of |t − c|α.
The integration


(3)
Q(x, y, c) = ∫

|t − c|αf (t)dt,	−1 ≤ x, y, c ≤ 1,  x ≤ y,  α > −1

is considered. We denote k	th Chebyshev polynomial as Tk(t) and write
''

f (t) ∼ p

This gives the following approximate integration

(5)
Q(x, y, c) = ∫ |t − c|αpN (t)dt.

Here, we introduce the following N -th polynomial

and set

GN (t; c) = |t − c|α(t − c){FN

From the property of Chebyshev polynomial
2 ∫ T (t)dt = Tk+1(t) − Tk−1(t) + C,  (k ≥ 2),


we have
k	k +1 
k − 1

F' (t) = b0 T '(t)+  b1  T '(t)+ b T (t)+ ··· + b

— 2N TN (t).
Therefore from T0(t) = 1, T1(t) = t, and setting bN = 0, bN+1 = 0, we can get
N−1

(9)
F' (t) = 1 b
+ Σ b T (t)

N

Furthermore we have the relation
2 0	k  k
k=1

2tTk(t) = Tk+1(t)+ Tk−1(t),
so by putting b−1 = b1, the following relation holds
N
(10)	2(t − c)F' (t) = Σ(bk+1 − 2cbk + bk−1)Tk(t).
k=0

If we determine the coefficients bk by the following way

(11)
b	(1 − α +1 
— 2cb + b
(1 + α +1 
aN ,  k = N, N − 1, ··· , 1

where bN = 0, bN+1 = 0, we can find the next relation
' (t; c) = |t − c|αpN (t)
Consequently the approximate value of the integration is estimated as follows
QN (x, y, c) = GN (y; c) − GN (x; c).
Descretize Fractional Derivatives
We write the principal part of the integration (2) in Sec.1 as follows,


​
D˜q f (s) = f (0)s−q +
0
f' (t)(s − t)−qdt,

and then we apply the result of Sec.2 to this integration.
At the beginning, we expand the function f (s) in Chebyshev series as follows;


​

f (s) ∼ fn(s) =

0 ≤ k ≤ n and τ0 = τn = 1, τk = 2(1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1),
and the double prime denotes that the first and the last terms of summation are halved.
According to the preceding result, for the integration

'

we can find some polynomial Fn−1(s) with order n − 1, such that

That is, the following equation is satisfied

(18)
f' (x) − f' (s) = (x − s)F'
(x) + (1 − q)(Fn−1(x) − Fn−1(s)).

Then, by setting x = 0, we can get the formula for estimating the value of the derivative of order q

f (s)
(20)	= f (0)s−q + (s)1−q{ n	− Fn−1(s)+ Fn−1(0)}.

In order to determine the unknown function Fn−1(x), we set
n−2
(21)	F'	(x) = Σb U (2x − 1),

where Uk(x) is a Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind for which obeys the recurrence formula
2xUk(x) = Uk+1(x)+ Uk−1(x),	U−1(0) = 0.

Accordingly we have

Substituting these relations to the equation (18), we can find the next equation on the coefficients bk,

k = n − 1,n − 2, ··· , 1,
where bn = bn−1 = 0. Then we can estimate the right-hand side of (20).

Finally we can summarize the process of the estimation of Dqf (s) as follows.


Step 1: f (x);given

Illustrate Fractional Derivatives
Here we show an example of the function f (x) = xk. The q-th derivative is estimated as follows;

	1	d ∫s

Γ(k +1 − q)
Γ(k +2 − q)

where we use the relation B(k + 1, 1 − q) = ∫ 1 tk(1 − t)−qdt.

In case of f (x)= x7



Table 2
In case of f (x)= x5


In Table 1 we show the case of k = 7 and q = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and the case of k = 5 is in Table 2. In these cases the numerical results coincide with the exact values in very small difference. Then these results are showing that our expansion method is positively working accurate.
Furthermore we tried to treat some examples due to Oldham and Spanier [5], when the order of derivative is 1/2.

For the calculation of the expansion coefficients we set n = 10 as an expansion order of the Chebyshev series in these cases. In order to compare with the exact values we examined simple cases which are known their analytic solutions.
At the begining, we made the direct application of Hasegawa-Torii algorithm to compute the integration part. On the series expansion for the first derivative F' (x),
we take Prof. Sugiura’s suggestion. The author would like to express the sincere thanks to him.
