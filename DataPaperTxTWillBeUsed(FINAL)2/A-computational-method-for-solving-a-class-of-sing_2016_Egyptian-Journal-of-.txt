In recent years, strenuous action and interest have been investigating singular boundary value problems (SBVPs) and a number of methods have been proposed. The singular bound- ary value problems arise frequently in many branches of applied mathematics, mechanics, nuclear physics, atomic theory and chemical sciences. Hence, the singular boundary value problems have attracted much attention and have been in- vestigated by many researchers. Kadalbajoo and Agarwal treated the homogeneous equation using Chebyshev polynomial and B-spline [1]. Kanth and Reddy solved a particular singular boundary value problem by applying higher order finite dif- ference method [2].The same authors investigated by using the cubic spline [3] method. Mohanty et al. [4] introduced accurate cubic spline method for solving the singular bound- ary value problems. Variational iteration method (VIM) was introduced by Wazwaz [5] for solving nonlinear singular bound- ary value problems.
The authors [6,7] elaborately discussed singular boundary value problems and solved by the methods based on repro- ducing kernel space. Galerkin and Collocation methods are presented for solving two-point boundary value problems by Mohsen and El-Gamel [8]. Secer and Kurulay [9] described the Sinc-Galerkin method for singular Dirichlet-type boundary value problems. Rashidinia et al. [10] proposed a reliable paramet- ric spline method.
The purpose of this note is to develop a reliable opera- tional matrix method for singular boundary value problems. The aim of the present paper is to apply Bernstein opera- tional matrix of differentiation to propose a reliable numerical technique for solving SBVPs.
With the advent of computer graphics, Bernstein polyno- mial restricted to the interval x 0, 1becomes important in the form of Bezier curves [11,12]. Bernstein polynomials have
that combines Neumann and integral condition for the wave equation. Bhattacharya et al. [25] implemented the algorithm for integro differential equations. Shen et al. [26] suggested a boundary knot method (BKM) to solve Helmholtz problems with boundary singularities. Lin et al. [27] used the efficient bound- ary knot method to obtain the solution of axisymmetric Helmholtz problems. Recently, Pirabaharan et al. [28] intro- duced a Bernstein operational matrix method for boundary value problems.
The objective of this paper is to give the computational method based on the Bernstein operational matrix for differ- entiation for the class of singular boundary value problems (SBVPs). The proposed algorithm converted to the given SBVP to the system of algebraic equations with unknown coeffi- cients and are solved easily by using mathematical tool like MATLAB.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we review the basic properties of Bernstein polynomials and we develop the Bernstein operational matrix for derivative. Section 3 implemented and presented the methods of solution for the singular boundary value problems. In Section 4, some numeri- cal examples are presented to show the efficiency and the applicability of the suggested algorithm. Conclusion is given in Section 5.


Properties of Bernstein polynomials [29]

The Bernstein basis polynomials of degree n are defined in the interval (0, 1) as [17,18]

many constructive properties such as the positivity, the con-

tinuity, recursive relation, symmetry and unity partition of the basis set over the interval. For this reason, Bernstein opera- tional matrix method is a new and rising area in applied mathematical research which has gained considerable atten- tion in dealing with differential equations. Optimal stability of the Bernstein basis was discussed by Farouki and Goodman [13]. Bhatta and Bhatti [14] have been used modified Bern-

Chakrabarti and Martha [15] described a method for Fredholm integral equations. Bhattacharya and Mandal [16] presented Bernstein polynomials method for Volterra integral equa- tions. Yousefi and Behroozifar [17] found the operational matrices of integration and product of B-polynomials. The same authors [18] introduced the Bernstein operational matrix method (BOMM) for solving the parabolic type partial differ-
where bn1 x  0 and bn1 x  0 .
Since the power basis forms a basis for the space of poly- nomials of degree less than or equal to n, any nth degree Bernstein polynomial can be expressed in terms of the power basis. This can be computed by using the binomial expansion,

they all disappear at boundaries of the interval, except the first and the last one, which are equal to one at x  0 and x  1 re- spectively. This gives greater flexibility which imposes boundary conditions at the end points of the interval [31]. Also, Bernstein polynomials have two most important properties:

Numerical examples

To exhibit the effectiveness and power of the Bernstein op- erational matrix method, we have tested several singular boundary value problems. These problems have been pre- ferred because they are commonly discussed in literature.


Example 4.1. Consider the linear singular two-point bound- ary value problem [33]

is shown in Fig. 1. From this figure, it can be noted that the results of the present technique are an excellent agreement with the exact solution, they are more applicable and effi- cient for solving singular boundary value problem.

Here we have y x  CTBx, y x  CTDBx, y x  CTD2Bx. Using these values in Eq. (17), we obtain the following:

It is understandable that in Example 4.2, the proposed al- gorithm is speedily converged in to the true solution results. For a small value of n  2, the exact solution is reached. This proves the efficiency of the proposed BOM method.

E1 indicates the absolute errors between exact and BOM, whereas E2 indicates the absolute errors between exact and B-Spline methods. Table 2 shows that the proposed method has high accuracy and has better results than the B-Spline method for all points of x. It is also clear that the proposed algorithm attains the exact solution by using very few calculations.

The maximum absolute errors between BOM and exact solution for various choices of x are also shown in Table 3. It is clearly noted that the errors are very close to zero. This proves the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

from Fig. 2 that the Bernstein operational matrix method so- lutions converge rapidly to the exact solution.

As done before, the Lane-Emden type differential equa- tion is solved. Applying the boundary conditions of Eq. (34) in Eq. (33) and by following the same procedure given in Example

Thus, Eq. (33) and Eq. (34) are transformed into a system of algebraic equations. Solving the system of algebraic equations,

We solve problem Eq. (35) by applying the method de- scribed in Sections 2 and 3, using Bernstein operational matrices of derivatives with n  2 we have

Results in Table 5 show the comparison between the exact solutions and the BOM solutions for various values of x and n  2 . The absolute errors are also given in Table 5. As seen from the table, it is evident that the overall errors are near to zero. This shows that the proposed approach is not only more accurate but also more simple and direct.
The curves of exact solutions and approximate solutions obtained by the proposed method for n  2 are shown in Fig. 4. In the figure, the exact and approximate solutions com- pletely coincide. It is clear from this figure that the proposed solutions converge rapidly to the exact solution.

Conclusion

In this work, a new spectral method is constructed for a nu- merical solution of the singular boundary value problems. Based on the Bernstein polynomials, the operational matrix derivatives are used together with the properties of Bern- stein polynomials to reduce the given singular boundary value problems to a system of algebraic equations and it simplifies the problem. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is adding few terms of the Bernstein polynomials, and a good approximation of the exact solution of the problem is achieved. The accuracy of the proposed BOM method has been demon- strated by solving widely applicable singular boundary value test problems.
Moreover, the proposed technique provides a reliable method which requires less work compared to the traditional tech- niques such as B-spline and standard HPM. The approach has been tested on some existing problems from the literature. From the comparison of the results made with some exact solu- tions, it can be concluded that the proposed approach is effective and viable to broad range of nonlinear singular bound- ary value problems. The results show that BOM method values match very effectively with the exact solution with very few calculations. By comparing the results with other existing methods, it has been proved that the proposed method provides more realistic solutions that convey very rapid convergence toward the exact solution.
