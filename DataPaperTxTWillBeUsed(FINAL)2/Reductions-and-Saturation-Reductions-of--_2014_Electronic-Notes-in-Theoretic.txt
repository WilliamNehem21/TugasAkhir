Abstract
Rough set theory is a useful tool for dealing with fuzzyness and uncertainty of knowledge. In rough set theory, knowledge reductions and generatings are important research topics and critical steps of knowledge acquisition. This paper generalize knowledge bases to abstract knowledge bases and study (abstract) knowledge bases on infinite universe by considering the problem of existence of finite reductions of infinite knowledge bases. For abstract knowledge bases, the concept of saturations and saturation reductions are introduced. Global properties of saturations and saturation reductions of abstract knowledge bases are investigated. It is proved that for a given abstract knowledge base which is closed w.r.t. arbitrary unions on a finite universe U , its saturation augmented the unverse U forms a topology, whereas a counterexample is constructed to show that this may not be true if U is infinite. Making use of the saturation of an abstract knowledge base, some sufficient and/or necessary conditions for existence of finite reductions of an infinite abstract knowledge base are given. It is proved that for an abstract knowledge base on finite universe, there is one and only one saturation reduction. Some examples are constructed to reveal various cases of existence of knowledge reductions. Simple applications of saturation reductions are also given.

Introduction
Rough set theory [8,13,14] is an important tool for dealing with fuzzyness and un- certainty of knowledge, and has become an active branch of information sciences. Meanwhile it has been successfully applied in medical science, material science, management science and so on. Basic opinion in rough set theory is that knowl- edge (human intelligence) is the ability to classify elements [5,7,13]. Also, one can say that knowledge is a family of classification patterns in some interesting fields,

providing us some facts from which one can deduce new ones [6,10,12]. Early rough set [8,13] theory mainly consider equivalence relations on U which are subsets of U ×U and determine partitions on U . One deals with not only a single classification (knowledge or partition) on U , but also a family of classifications [5,6]. This leads to the definition of a knowledge base. Specifically, given a universe U and a family of equivalence relations on U , the pair K = (U, P) is called a knowledge base.
As the developing of rough set theory, one considers more general families of sets, such as the lower and upper approximation families determined by binary relations, image families of some operators (called rough operators) obtained by axiomatic methods. These kinds of families often are closed w.r.t. unions or intersections. So one can consider very general families of sets as abstract knowledge bases. Mathe- matically, let U ×=∅ be a set of elements we are interested in, called a universe, any subset X ⊆ U is called a concept or knowledge on U . Every concept family (the family of subsets on U ) is called an abstract knowledge base on U .
On one hand, one can derive more knowledge from a given knowledge base. For example, from “tall”, “played basketball in NBA” and “a Chinese man born in Shanghai” one can figure out by taking intersections of suitable sets that the man may be Ming Yao. Mathematically we can derive new families of sets from a given family. This paper considers the new abstract knowledge base formed by nonempty finite intersections of an abstract knowledge base, called the saturation (in Topol- ogy, an intersection of open sets is called a saturated set, hence we give the name). Given a family P on U , the family P∗ = {∩F| ∅ ×=F ⊆ P, F is finite} is called the saturation of P, where finite intersections is nonempty intersections. Properties of the saturation will be discussed in this paper.
On the other hand, it is well-know that elements in a knowledge base are not of the same importance, some even are redundant. So we often consider reductions of a knowledge base by deleting unrelated or unimportant elements with the require- ment of keeping the ability of classification. In classic rough set theory, the universe one deals with normally is a nonempty finite set. In this case a knowledge base is finite and reductions always exist. For infinite universe, this is not the case. This paper will study (abstract) knowledge bases on infinite universe by considering the problem of existence of finite reductions of infinite knowledge bases. Some suffi- cient and/or necessary conditions for existence of finite reductions of an abstract knowledge base are given. Some examples are constructed to reveal various cases of existence of knowledge reductions.
Since usual reductions of a knowledge base K involve only the special intersec-
tion indK = ∩R∈KR, and since reductions on a finite universe exist but generally not unique, usual knowledge reductions lose much information and bring new uncer- tainty. In view of this, we will define a new kind of reductions of abstract knowledge bases, called saturation reductions. It turns out that saturation reductions of an abstract knowledge base not only have special significance in dealing with informa- tion of knowledge bases, but also have their own rights to research. We also give examples in the last section to show possible applications with topology and ordered structures.

Preliminaries
We give some basic concepts and results which will be used in the sequel. Most of them come from [4,11,13]. For other unstated concepts please refer to [2,3].
Definition 2.1 Let (X, T ) be a topological space, B ⊆ T . If every open set of X is a union of some elements of B, that is for each U ∈T , there exists B1 ⊆B such that U = ∪B∈B1 B, then we call B a base of T , or a base of topological space X.
Lemma 2.2 (see [11, Th.2.6.3]) Let B be a family of subsets of X. If B is closed
w.r.t. ﬁnite intersections (include empty intersection), then there is a unique topol- ogy on X having B as a base.
Let (X, T ) be a topological space, F the closed sets of X. Since complements of open sets are closed sets, F is closed w.r.t. arbitrary intersections and finite unions. If B is a base of T , then Bc = {X − B|B ∈ B}⊆F is called a closed base. In this case, each element of F can be expressed as an intersection of some elements of Bc. Intervals in the real line have 9 classes: open intervals (a, b), (a, +∞), (−∞, b), (−∞, +∞); closed intervals [a, b]; half open and half closed intervals [a, b), (a, b],
[a, +∞) and (−∞, b]. We will not take a singleton as an interval.
Definition 2.3 Let G be an open set of the real line. If an open interval (a, b) ⊆ G
with endpoints a, b ∈/ G, then (a, b) is called a structure interval of G.
Lemma 2.4 (See [1, Th.1 (open set structure theorem)]) Each nonempty open set of the real line can be expressed as a union of ﬁnite or countable mutually disjoint structure intervals. If an open set is expressed as a union of mutually disjoint open intervals, then these intervals must be the structure intervals of the open set.
The following two lemmas are easy to prove and will be used in the sequel.
Lemma 2.5 Let U = R be the real line. If X ⊆ U is a union of some intervals, then X can be expressed as a union of some mutually disjoint intervals.
Lemma 2.6 If {Ai}i∈I is a family of mutually disjoint intervals of real line, then
{Ai}i∈I is a countable family.
Definition 2.7 (1) Let U ×=∅ be a set and P ×=∅ a family of equivalence relations on U. Then the pair K = (U, P) is called a knowledge base, sometimes we say P a knowledge base, and U the universe of K or P. Set ind(P)= ∩R∈P R, then ind(P) is still an equivalence relation on U, and is called the indiscernible relation of K.
Let P ×=∅ be a family of subsets of U. Then P is called an abstract knowledge base, U is called the universe of P. Set ind(P)= ∩A∈P A, then ind(P) is a subset of U, called the indiscernible set of P.
Say A ∈ P to be not necessary if ind(P)= ind(P − {A}). Otherwise, A is said to be necessary. The set core(P)= {A ∈ P|A is necessary} is called the core of P. If every element in P is necessary, then we say that P is independent.
It is easy to see that any knowledge base P in the sense of Definition 2.7(1) can be viewed as an abstract knowledge base P on U × U by taking R ∈P as a subset of U × U . So, a knowledge base is a special abstract knowledge base.


Let L be a poset. A subset D ⊆ L is directed if each finite subset of D has an upper bound in D. A poset is called a directed complete poset (briefly, dcpo) if each directed subset has a supremum. A poset is said to be a semilattice if every pair of elements of L has an infimum. If (L, ≤) is a poset, then (L, ≥) is a poset, called the dual poset of L, denoted by Lop. If ∀a, b ∈ L, a ≤ b or b ≤ a holds, then “ ≤ ” is said a linear order, and L is called a total-ordered set or a chain. If ∀a, b ∈ L, neither a ≤ b nor b ≤ a holds, then L is called an anti-chain. A nonempty subset X ⊆ L is said to be ﬁltered if every pair of elements a, b ∈ X, there is c ∈ X such that c ≤ a and c ≤ b. It is easy to see that every semilattice itself is filtered.
Definition 2.8 Let P be a poset, x, y ∈ P. We say that x approximates y, written x  y, if whenever D is directed with sup D ≥ y, then x ≤ d for some d ∈ D. If x  x, then we say x a compact element.

Saturations of Abstract Knowledge Bases
In this section we introduce the concept of saturations of abstract knowledge bases and investigate their properties.
Definition 3.1 Let P be an abstract knowledge base. Then P∗ is called the satu- ration of P if P∗ consists of all the nonempty ﬁnite intersections of P. If P = P∗, then P is called saturated.
Notice that generally P ⊆ P∗. However, even if (P, ⊆) is a semilattice, one can easily construct examples with P ×=P∗. If an abstract knowledge base is a semilattice, then itself must be filtered and indP = indP∗. Moreover, saturations are closed w.r.t. nonempty finite intersections. So, by Lemma 2.2, P∗ ∪ {U } is a base of some topology on U . Further more, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 3.2 Let U be a given nonempty ﬁnite set, P a family of subsets on U
which is closed w.r.t. arbitrary unions. Then P∗ ∪ {U} is a topology on U.
Proof. Since U is finite, any topology on U must be closed w.r.t. arbitrary unions and intersections. Thus, the family F of closed sets of a topology T on U is also closed w.r.t. arbitrary unions and intersections. Note that P is closed w.r.t. arbitrary unions, we see that the family B = {U − X|X ∈ P} is closed w.r.t. arbitrary intersections. By Lemma 2.2, there is a unique topology T on U having B as a base. In this case, the family F of closed sets of T is exactly the family P∗ ∪ {U}, that is, F = P∗ ∪ {U}. So, P∗ ∪ {U} is closed w.r.t. arbitrary unions and intersections. Thus, P∗ ∪ {U} is a topology on U .	2
For an infinite universe U , even if P is closed w.r.t. arbitrary unions, P∗ ∪ {U}
may not be a topology. See the following example.
Example 3.3 Let U = R be the reals, P the family of subsets expressed as unions of some mutually disjoint intervals of R. Then empty union is empty and ∅ ∈
P. Noticing that unions of some unions of intervals are still unions of intervals

and by Lemma 2.5, these unions of intervals can also be expressed as unions of some mutually disjoint intervals, we have that P is closed w.r.t. arbitrary unions. However, P∗ ∪ {U} is not a topology.
To see this, let Y = ∩∪ Qi,j be a nonempty finite intersection of elements in P, where for i = 1, 2, ··· , n, Qi,j(j ∈ J ) is a family of mutually disjoint intervals. By Lemma 2.6, J is a countable set. By the completely distributive law, we have that Y = ∪f∈M (∩Qi,f (i)), where M = {f|f : {1, ··· , n} −→ J is a map}. As a finite product of the countable set J , M is also a countable set. It is clear that the finite intersection ∩Qi,f (i) is either ∅, or a singleton, or an interval. If cardinalities
|∩ Qi,f (i)|≤ 1 for all i ∈ J , then Y is a countable set. If there is an i ∈ J such that
∩Qi,f (i) is an interval, then Y has a nonempty interior. So, any finite intersection
Y of elements in P is either countable, or has a nonempty interior.
Every irrational singleton is a finite intersection {ξ} = (−∞, ξ] ∩ [ξ, +∞) in P and thus is in P∗. So, the uncountable set of all irrationals is a union of elements of P∗. Thus, the set of all irrationals is not in P∗ ∪ {U}, for it clearly has empty interior. That is to say, P∗ ∪ {U} is not closed w.r.t. unions, let along a topology.
Definition 3.4 Let P be an abstract knowledge base. If ∀P ∈ P, (P−{P})∗ ×=P∗, then P is said to be minimally saturated.
By Definition 3.4, it is easy to show the following
Proposition 3.5 If no element A ∈P can be expressed as a ﬁnite intersection of elements in P− {A}, then P is minimally saturated.
Example 3.6 A chain or an anti-chain P is saturated and minimally saturated.
Reductions of Infinite Abstract Knowledge Bases
This section will give existence conditions of finite reductions of infinite abstract knowledge bases. We have first the following definition.
Definition 4.1 Let P be an abstract knowledge base on a universe U, Q⊆ P. We say Q a reduction of P if ind(Q)= ind(P) and ∀A ∈ Q, ind(Q) ×=ind(Q− {A}). Sometimes, we also say that Q is a reduction of K = (U, P).
Definition 4.2 For an abstract knowledge base P on U, if P is ﬁnite, then P is called a finite knowledge base; if P0 ⊆ P is a reduction of P and has only ﬁnite elements, then P0 is called a finite reduction of P.
Lemma 4.3 (see [13, Theorem 1.9]) A (ﬁnite) reduction always exists for any knowledge base on a ﬁnite universe.
Corollary 4.4 Every ﬁnite knowledge base on an inﬁnite universe has (ﬁnite) re- ductions. If P has the least element, then P has a ﬁnite reduction.
Let P be an abstract knowledge base. If (P, ⊆) is a chain (resp., an anti-chain, a filtered set, a semilattice), then we say that P is a chain(resp., an anti-chain, a filtered set, a semilattice).
The following three propositions are not difficult, and their proofs are omitted.

Proposition 4.5 If P is a chain, then P has a ﬁnite reduction if and only if P
has the least element.
Proposition 4.6 If P is ﬁltered, then P has a ﬁnite reduction iff P has the least element. Particularly, if P is a semilattice, then P has a ﬁnite reduction iff P has the least element.
Proposition 4.7 If P is an abstract knowledge base and P∗ is the saturation of P, then P has a ﬁnite reduction iff P∗ has a ﬁnite reduction.
Theorem 4.8 If P is an abstract knowledge base, then P has a ﬁnite reduction iff the saturation P∗ of P has the least element.
Proof. ⇒: Let P0 be a finite reduction of P, P∗ the saturation of P and P∗ the saturation of P0. Then P∗ ⊆ P∗, and by Proposition 4.6, we conclude that P∗ has
0	0
the least element R0 ∈ P∗. So, indP = indP∗ ⊆ indP∗ = indP0 = indP. Thus
0	0
R0 = indP∗ = indP0 = indP∗ and R0 is the least element of P∗. We conclude that
P∗ has a finite reduction {R0}.
⇐: Let P∗ be the saturation of P with a finite reduction. Then (P∗, ⊆) is a semilattice. By Proposition 4.6, we conclude that P∗ has the least element R0. So, there are R1, ··· , Rn ∈ P such that R0 = R1 ∩· · ·∩ Rn. For the finite knowledge base {R1, ··· , Rn}, by Corollary 4.4, there is a finite reduction P0 ⊆ {R1, ··· , Rn} such that indP0 = R1 ∩· · ·∩ Rn = indP∗ = indP. Since P0 ⊆ P is independent, P0 is a finite reduction of P.	2
Corollary 4.9 If P is an abstract knowledge base, then P has a ﬁnite reduction iff there are ﬁnite elements R1, ··· , Rn ∈P such that R1 ∩  ∩ Rn = indP.
Proposition 4.10 Let P be an abstract knowledge base with no inﬁnite anti-chains. If every maximal chain in P has the least element, then P has a reduction.
Proof. Since the set of all the least elements of maximal chains in P forms an anti-chain which by the assumption is finite. The anti-chain has a finite reduction and the intersection of the anti-chain is exactly indP. Clearly, the finite reduction is also a reduction of P.	2
Proposition 4.11 Let Pop be the dual of an abstract knowledge base P. If in the set inclusion order Pop is a dcpo and max(Pop) is ﬁnite, then P has a ﬁnite reduction.
Proof. Every maximal chain of P has an element in max(Pop). This maximal element in Pop is just the least element of maximal chain of P and thus a minimal element of P. So, we have that ∩max(Pop)= indP. By the finiteness of max(Pop), we see that max(Pop) has a finite reduction which is also a finite reduction of P.2
Example 4.12 Let P0 be an inﬁnite knowledge base which is independent in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.7(3). Let P = P0 ∪ {ind(P0)}. Then {ind(P0)} is a ﬁnite reduction of P. However, ind(P0) is nota compact element of (P∗)op, showing that elements in a ﬁnite reduction of P needn’t be compact in (P∗)op.
Proposition 4.13 Let P be an inﬁnite abstract knowledge base. If ind(P) is a compact element in (P∗)op, then P has and only has ﬁnite reductions. In this case,

core(P)= ∩red(P).
Proof. Since ind(P) can be expressed as a filtered intersection of finite intersections of elements in P and ind(P) is compact in (P∗)op, ind(P) is a finite intersection of elements in P. A part of these finite elements forms a finite reduction of P, showing that P has finite reductions. If P has another infinite reduction Pj, then the intersection of this reduction is ind(P) and can be expressed as a filtered intersection of finite intersections of elements in the reduction Pj. Since ind(P) is compact in (P∗)op, ind(P) is a finite intersection of elements in the reduction Pj, showing that Pj is not independent, a contradiction. So, P has no infinite reductions.
Let P ∈ ∩red(P). If P ×c∈ore(P), then ind(P − {P})= ind(P). Since ind(P) is compact in (P∗)op, ind(P) is a finite intersection of elements in P − {P}. And a part of these finite elements forms a finite reduction without P , a contradiction! So, ∩red(P) ⊆ core(P). The other direction of inclusion is globally true. Thus, core(P)= ∩red(P).	2

Saturation Reduction of Knowledge Bases
This section will give another reduction concept of abstract knowledge bases, called saturation reductions. It turns out that every abstract knowledge base on a finite universe has a unique saturation reduction.
Definition 5.1 Let P be an abstract knowledge base, P0 ⊆ P. If P0 is minimally saturated and P∗ = P∗, then P0 is called a saturation reduction of P.
Obviously, P is minimally saturated iff P is a saturation reduction of P.
The following four propositions are not difficult and their proofs are omitted.
Proposition 5.2 Let P0, P1 be saturation reductions of P and P0 ⊆ P1, then
P0 = P1.
Proposition 5.3 Let P be an abstract knowledge base, P∗ the saturation of P. Then saturation reductions of P are all saturation reductions of P∗.
Proposition 5.4 Let P and Pj be abstract knowledge bases. Let P0 be a saturation reduction of P and max(P) the set of all maximal elements of P. Then max(P) ⊆ P0. If P0 ⊆ Pj ⊆ P∗, then P0 is a saturation reduction of both Pj and P∗.
Proposition 5.5 Let P be an abstract knowledge base, P1 the saturation reduction of P. Then for every P ∈ P1, there are no ﬁnite elements K1,   , Km ∈ P1 \ {P}
such that P = ∩m Ki.
When the universe U is finite, an abstract knowledge base P on U in the set inclusion order is a finite poset and then a dcpo. By the Zorn’s Lemma, we know that max(P) ×=∅. With this observation, we can prove the following theorem which reveals the existence of saturation reduction.
Theorem 5.6 If P is an abstract knowledge base on a ﬁnite universe U, then P
has at least a saturation reduction.

Proof. Inductively construct a family K0, K1, ··· , Kn, ··· of subsets of P such that
K0 = max(P) ⊆ P,
K1 = max(P\ K∗) ⊆ P,
K2 = max(P\ (K0 ∪ K1)∗) ⊆ P,
··· , ··· , ·· ·,
Kn−1 = max(P\ (K0 ∪ K1 ∪· · · ∪ Kn−2)∗) ⊆ P,
Kn = max(P\ (K0 ∪ K1 ∪· · · ∪ Kn−1)∗),
··· , ··· , ·· ·.
Noticing that max(P) ×=∅, we know that the family P \ (K0 ∪ K1 ∪· · ·∪ Ki)∗ is strictly decreased. Since U and P are finite, there is some n such that P \ (K0 ∪

K1 ∪ ··· ∪ Kn−1)∗ = ∅ and then Kn = ∅. Set P0 = ∪n
Ki ⊆ P. We have that

P∗ = (∪Ki)∗ = (K0 ∪ K1 ∪· · · ∪ Kn−1)∗ ⊇ P,
(K0 ∪ K1 ∪· · · ∪ Kn−1)∗ ⊇ P∗ ⊇ (K0 ∪ K1 ∪· · · ∪ Kn−1)∗.
And P∗ = P∗.
Let P ∈ P0. Then there is i0 < n such that P ∈ Ki0 . We assert that P ∈/
(P0 \ {P})∗. In fact, if P ∈ (P0 \ {P})∗ ⊆ P∗, then there is a nonempty finite set

n i=0
Ki such that P = T{A|A ∈ A}. Set
A1 = A∩ ∪i0−1Ki,	A2 = A∩ ∪n−1Ki.

i=0
Then A1 ∪ A2 = A and P = (∩A1) ∩ (∩A2).
i=i0

Notice that A2 ⊆ ∪n−1Ki ⊆ P \ (∪i0−1Ki)∗. If A2 ×=∅, then for each A ∈ A2,
i=i0	i=0
since P ∈ Ki0 is the maximal element and Ki ∩ Kj = ∅ (∀i ×=j), we have P ¢ A,
a contradiction to the above equation of P . So A2 = ∅. Then P = ∩A1 ∈/ Ki0 , this is a contradiction. Then the assertion is proved. By the assertion, we have (P0 \ {P})∗ ×=P∗, showing that P0 is a saturation reduction of P.	2
Proposition 5.7 Let P be an abstract knowledge base on a ﬁnite universe U, P0 the saturation reduction constructed in Theorem 5.6 and P1 another saturation re- duction of P. Then P0 ⊆ P1. So, P0 is the unique saturation reduction of P.
Proof. We need to prove Ki ⊆ P1 (i = 0, ··· , n). To this end, we use the mathe- matical induction.
For K0 = max(P) and ∀A ∈ K0, there exist Ps ∈ P1(s = 1, ··· , m) such that A = ∩Pi. Since A is a maximal element, A = Ps ∈ P1 and K0 ⊆ P1.
Assume that when i ≤ j, Ki ⊆ P1. Then
∪j	Ki ⊆ P1.	Since P1 is a saturation reduction of P, we have that

P1 \ ∪j
Ki = P1 \ (∪j
Ki)∗.  Thus, for Kj+1 and A ∈ Kj+1, we have that

A ∈/ (∪j
Ki)∗ and P1 \ ∪j
Ki = P1 \ (∪j
Ki)∗ ⊆P \ (∪j
Ki)∗ ⊆↓ Kj+1. Since

P1 is a saturation reduction, there is a finite A⊆ P1 such that A = (∩A1) ∩ (∩A2),
A1 ⊆ P1 \ ∪j	Ki, A2 ⊆ ∪j	Ki. We assert that A2 = ∅. In fact, if A2 ×=∅,
then by A1 ⊆↓ Kj+1 and that A is a maximal element of ↓ Kj+1, we have that
A1 = ∅ or A1 = {A}. Thus A = ∩A2 ∈ (∪j	Ki)∗, a contradiction! So, A2 = ∅
and A = ∩A1 = A. So A1 = {A} ⊆ P1 and A ∈ P1. Thus, Kj+1 ⊆ P1. By the

principle of mathematical induction, we have that Ki ⊆ P1 (i = 0, ··· , n). Then

P0 = ∪n
Ki ⊆ P1. Since P0 and P1 are both minimal saturated, P0 = P1.	2

Corollary 5.8 Let P be an abstract knowledge base on a ﬁnite universe U, P∗ the saturation of P. Then a saturation reduction of P∗ is also a saturation reduction of P and is included in P.
Proof. Let P0 be a saturation reduction of P. Since a saturation reduction of P is also a saturation reduction of P∗, and by Proposition 5.7, P0 is also the unique saturation reduction of P∗ and is included in P.	2

By the construction process in Theorem 5.6, we can give an algorithm to com- pute the saturation reduction of an abstract knowledge base P on a finite universe as follows.
Initially, calculate K0 = max(P), this can be realized by comparison proce- dure, then set K := K0 and S := ∅.
Recursively calculate S := S ∪ K, S∗, P\ S∗ and K := max(P\ S∗) under the control of the Boolean condition “K ×=∅”. To calculate S∗, one can make use of the algorithm constructed in [12]; to calculate a complement of a set, one can use search-deleting procedure. The Boolean condition “K ×=∅” means that if the condition is fulfilled, then the recursive procedure continues, otherwise stops and goes to the next step.
P0 := S is what we need, the saturation reduction of P.
Stop. The procedure is completed.
Proposition 5.9 Let P ×=∅ be an abstract knowledge base on U, P0 the saturation reduction of P, V ⊆ U. Set P|V = {P ∩ V |P ∈ P}. If P|V ×={∅}, then P0|V ×={∅} and (P|V )∗ = (P0|V )∗.
Proof. First we need to prove P0|V ×={∅}. Let P ∩ V ∈ P|V and P ∩ V ×=∅. Since P0 is the saturation reduction of P, there are P1, ··· , Pn ∈ P0 such that

∅ ×=P = ∩n
Pi and ∅ ×=P ∩ V = ∩n
Pi ∩ V . Thus Pi ∩ V ×=∅ and Pi ∩ V ∈ P0|V .

So, P0|V ×={∅}.
Since P0 is the saturation reduction of P, we have that P0|V  ⊆ P|V and (P0|V )∗ ⊆ (P|V )∗. Let P ∈ (P|V )∗. Then there is Pi ∩ V ∈ P|V (i = 1, ··· , n)

such that P = ∩n
(Pi ∩ V ) with Pi ∈ P. For each Pi ∈ P, there exists P (j) ∈ P0

(j = 1, ··· , k) such that Pi = ∩k	P (j). Then P = ∩n	∩k
(P (j) ∩ V ). Since

j=1 i
i=1
j=1	i

P (j) ∩ V ∈ P0|V , we have P ∈ (P0|V )∗. To sum up, we have (P0|V )∗ = (P|V )∗.  2
Normally, P0|V is not the saturation reduction of P|V by the following example.

Example 5.10 Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4}, P = {{1}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}} on U and V =
{1, 3, 4} ⊆ U. Then it is easy to show that P is minimally saturated, i.e, P is the saturation reduction of itself. But P|V = {{1}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}} is not minimally saturated. So, P|V can’t be a saturation reduction of P|V .

Let P0 be a saturation reduction of P, V ⊆ U , and P0|V = {P1 ∩V, ··· , Pn ∩V }. Then one can get a minimally saturated subfamily P1|V ⊆ P0|V of P0|V such that (P1|V )∗ = (P0|V )∗, then P1|V ⊆ P0|V is the saturation reduction of P|V .

Some Examples
Firstly, we are intend to construct special examples of equivalence relations to show that there is knowledge base which is a chain but has no reductions, there is an independent knowledge base which is an infinite anti-chain and that there is a knowledge base which has not only infinite reductions but also finite reductions. The following four examples respectively reflect these situations.
Example 6.1 Let U = N be a universe and P = {R0, R1, ··· , Ri, ·· ·} a family of equivalence relations on U, where Ri = {(0, 0), (1, 1), ··· , (i, i)}∪{(k, j)|k, j ≥ i+1}. Then P is decreased and thus a chain with no least element. By Theorem 4.5, K = (U, P) has no ﬁnite reductions. More over K has no reduction.
To see these, assume P has a reduction P0. Then P0 must be infinite and indP = indP0. Let t be the least index of Ri such that Ri ∈ P0. Then P0 −{Rt} ×=∅. Since P is decreased, indP0 = ind(P0 − {Rt}) and P0 is not independent, a contradiction to P0 being a reduction. Thereby this contradiction shows P has no reduction.
Example 6.2 Let U = N+ = {1, 2, ·· ·} be a universe, P = {R1, ··· , Rn, ·· ·} a family of equivalence relations on U, where Rn = {(1, n), (n, 1), (1, 1), ··· , (n, n)}∪ 
{(k, j)|k, j ≥ n + 1}. Then Rn is an equivalence relation on U. We assert that
K = (U, P) has no reduction.
In fact, indP = {(x, x)|x ∈ U} = Δ, the identity relation on U . Any finite meets of P cannot be Δ. By Corollary 4.9, we see that P has no finite reduction. Let Ri1 , ··· , Rik , ··· be an infinite sequence of P. For every pair (i, n) with i ×=n, pick ik > max{i, n}. Then (i, n) ∈/ Rik . With this fact, we see that Ri1 ∩··· ∩Rik ∩· · · = Δ. This implies that for any infinite sequence Pj of P and any R ∈ Pj, one has that indPj = indP = ind(Pj − {R})= Δ and Pj is not independent. So, P has no infinite reduction, either.
In this example, ∀i < n, we have that
Ri = {(1, i), (i, 1), (1, 1), ··· , (i, i)}∪ {(k, j)|k, j ≥ i + 1},

Rn = {(1, n), (n, 1), (1, 1), ··· , (n, n)}∪ {(k, j)|k, j ≥ n + 1}
and (1, n) ∈ Rn, (1, n) ∈/ Ri, (i + 1,n + 1) ∈ Ri, (i + 1,n + 1) ∈/ Rn. So, Rn ¢ Ri
and Ri ¢ Rn. By this fact, we see that P is an anti-chain.
Example 6.3 Let U  = N+ be a universe, P = {R1, ··· , Rn, ·· ·} a family of equivalence relations on U such that U/R1 = {{1}, {2, 3, ·· ·}}, U/R2 =
{{1, 2}, {3, 4, ·· ·}}, U/R3 = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, ·· ·}}, ·· ·, U/Rn = {{1, 2, ··· , n}, {n +
1,n + 2, ·· ·}}, ·· ·. Rn is indeed an equivalence relation. We will show that the knowledge base K = (U, P) has itself as a reduction.

In fact, ∀i < n, we have
U/Ri = {{1, 2, ··· , i}, {i + 1,i + 2, ·· ·}},

U/Rn = {{1, 2, ··· , n}, {n + 1,n + 2, ·· ·}}
and [1]Ri = {1, 2, ··· , i}, [1]Rn = {1, 2, ··· , n}, [n+1]Ri = {i+1, i+2, ·· ·}, [n+1]Rn =
{n + 1,n + 2, ·· ·}. So, [1]Rn ¢ [1]Ri and [n + 1]Ri ¢ [n + 1]Rn . This reveals that P
is an anti-chain.
Let Rm ∈ P . Then (m, m + 1) ∈/ Rm and when i ×=m, (m, m + 1) ∈ Ri. So (m, m + 1) ∈ ind(P − {Rm}). It is easy to see that indP = {(x, x)|x ∈ U} = Δ ×= ind(P− {Rm}). So, P is independent and P is a reduction of itself.
Example 6.4 Add another equivalence relation R0 = {(x, x)|x ∈ U} = Δ to P in Example 6.3, one gets a new knowledge base Kj = (U, P ∪ {R0}). It is easy to see that P and {R0} are the two reductions of Kj, one inﬁnite and the other ﬁnite.
To sum up, we see that families P of equivalence relations in Examples 6.1-6.4 are respectively a chain with no reduction, an anti-chain with no reduction, an independent anti-chain having only itself as a reduction, and a knowledge base having not only a finite reduction but also an infinite reduction.
It is easy to show that core(K) ⊆ ∩red(K) for any (abstract) knowledge base. However, for an infinite knowledge base, the following example shows that its core needn’t be the intersection of all its reductions.
Example 6.5 Let K = (U, P) be the inﬁnite knowledge base in Example 6.2 with no reductions such that ind(K)= Δ. Let Kj = (U, Pj), where Pj = P ∪ {Δ}. Then
{Δ} is a reduction of Kj and this is the only one reduction of Kj. Intersection of all reductions of Kj is Δ. However, every element in Kj is not necessary and core (Kj)= ∅ ×={Δ}.
Secondly, we give an example to show that an abstract knowledge base on an infinite universe U needn’t have saturation reductions.
Example 6.6 Let U be an inﬁnite set, P = 2U an abstract knowledge base. Then
P has no saturation reduction.
In fact, if P0 is a saturation reduction of P, then it is easy to see that U ∈ P0
and ∀x ∈ U , U − {x}∈ P0. By Proposition 5.5, when F ⊆ U is finite and |F | ≥ 2,
we have that U \ F ∈/ P0. Let A ⊆ U be an infinite set. Then ∀x ∈ A, we have
(U − A) ∪ {x} ∈ P = P∗. So there are finite elements P1, ··· , Pn ∈ P0 such that
(U−A)∪{x} = ∩n  Pi. Then U−A = (U−A)∪{x})∩(U−{x})= (U−{x})∩∩n  Pi
is an intersection of finite elements deferent from U − A in P0. By Proposition 5.5, U − A ∈/ P0. So, P0 = {U − {x}|x ∈ U}∪ {U}. Since subsets of P∗ are all infinite, P∗ ×=U2, a contradiction! So, P has indeed no saturation reductions.
Thirdly, we give some examples of simple applications of saturation reductions.

Example 6.7 Figure out the number of different sub-semilattices of 2{a,b}.
Let P be a subsemilattice of 2U with U = {a, b}. Then P has only one saturation reduction P0 ⊆ P which is a family of subsets of U such that each P ∈ P0, P is not an intersection of other elements of P0. By Proposition 5.4, P0 is also the saturation reduction of P0. So each subsemilattice uniquely determines a family of subsets P0 on U such that P0 is the saturation reduction of itself. Conversely, a minimally saturated family uniquely determines a subsemilattice P∗. So, to figure out the number of different subsemilattices of 2U , we need to figure out the number of different minimally saturated families. If U = {a, b}, then 2U = {∅, {a}, {b},U}, the number of different minimally saturated families having 1 element is C1 = 4, the number of different minimally saturated families having 2 elements is C2 = 6 (chain or anti-chain), the number of different minimally saturated families having 3 elements is C1 + 1 = 3, for in this case the families must contain U and if they contain ∅, they do not contain {a} and {b} at the same time; if they do not contain ∅, the other three elements are indeed minimally saturated. Since 2U is not minimally saturated, the number of different minimally saturated families having 3 elements is 0. So the number of different subsemilattices is 4 + 6 + 2 + 1 = 13.
Example 6.8 Let U = {a, b, c} be a universe. Caculate the number of different topologies on U.
We first prove that when |U| ≤ 3, the saturation reduction P0 of a topology P on U is closed w.r.t. nonempty unions. In fact, when |U| = 1, 2, it is easy to check. When |U| = 3, then for any pair of two elements A, B ∈ P0, if A ∪ B = U or A, B can be compared, obviously A ∪ B ∈ P0. If A, B cannot be compared, when
|A ∪ B| = 1, then A = B or one of A, B is ∅ and A ∪ B is A or B in P0; when
|A ∪ B| = 2, then A ∪ B ∈ max(P \ {U}) ⊆ P0. So, when |U| ≤ 3, the saturation reduction of each topology on U is closed w.r.t. nonempty unions.
With this result, we come to consider the example.
Let U = {a, b, c}. Then 2U = {∅, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c},U}. Each topology on U uniquely determines its saturation reduction. The saturation reduc- tion is minimally saturated, contains U and is closed w.r.t. nonempty unions. So, to figure out the number of different topologies on U is to figure out the number of families P which satisfy conditions that (1) minimally saturated, (2) include U , (3) closed w.r.t. nonempty unions and (4) saturations containing ∅.
Let P0 be a family of this kind. Then
If P0 has 1 element, then P∗ is not a topology, the number of P0 is 0;
If P0 has 2 elements, then P0 = {∅,U}, the number of P0 is 1;
If P0 has 3 elements, then (a) when ∅ ∈ P0, the number of P0 is C1 = 6,
(b) when ∅ ∈/ P0, the number of P0 is C1 = 3;
If P0 has 4 elements, then (a) when ∅ ∈ P0, the number of P0 is
C2 + C1C1 = 9, (b) when ∅ ∈/ P0, the number of P0 is C3 + C1C1 + C2 = 10;
3	3  2	3	3  2	3
If P0 has 5 elements, then P0 is not minimally saturated.
So the number of different topologies on U is just the number of P0 which is now 0 +1+6+3+9+ 10+0 = 29.


Note that for a finite U with |U| > 3, the saturation reduction of a topol- ogy P on U needn’t be closed w.r.t.  nonempty unions.  For example, let U = {1, 2, 3, 4} and P = {∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4},U}. Then P0 =
{{1}, {2}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4},U} is the saturation reduction of P. Clearly, P0 is not closed w.r.t. nonempty unions.
