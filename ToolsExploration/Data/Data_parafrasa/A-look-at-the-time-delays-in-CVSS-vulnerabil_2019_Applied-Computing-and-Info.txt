This empirical study investigates the time lag between the publication of common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the availability of Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) information associated with the published CVEs. The study's empirical findings, based on an analysis of over 80,000 archived vulnerabilities using regularized regression, reveal that (i) the CVSS content does not have a statistically significant impact on the time delays, but (ii) the delays are strongly influenced by a decreasing annual trend. Additionally, the paper offers insights into the misuse of statistical methodologies in empirical research on software vulnerabilities.

Software vulnerabilities refer to software bugs that expose weaknesses in software systems. The CVSS standard is commonly used to assess the severity of identified and disclosed vulnerabilities. Once a CVE is classified and evaluated, the severity information is quantified and stored in vulnerability databases. This study specifically focuses on the time delays between the publication of CVEs and the subsequent release of CVSS information in the NVD and the second revision of the CVSS standard.

CVSS is widely mandated and recommended for assessments in various security-critical domains, including medical devices and the payment card industry, and has been integrated into governmental security risk, threat, and intelligence systems. Additionally, CVSS information is utilized in numerous commercial products, such as vulnerability scanners, compliance assessment tools, automated penetration testing, and intrusion detection systems. Academic research also extensively employs CVSS in domains such as risk analysis, security audit frameworks, attack graphs, and empirical assessments for different purposes.

Mitre, the organization responsible for maintaining the backlog of assigned CVEs, may reject some vulnerabilities for inclusion in the NVD. However, eventually, accepted vulnerabilities are published in the NVD after undergoing severity evaluation. The empirical results of the study suggest that the content of CVSS has minimal influence on predicting time delays. Furthermore, the statistical effect of CVSS content diminishes when the decreasing annual trend is taken into account. The remainder of the paper is structured into three sections, introducing the dataset and variables, outlining the statistical methodology, and discussing the findings.

By examining the joint significance of dummy variable groups using a F-test, the study found that all groups are significant at a p<0.001 level. The research concludes that practical applications using CVSS information, whether in governmental security intelligence systems or commercial security assessment tools, should not be concerned about significant delays in NVD data feeds for CVSS information.

In summary, the paper underscores that the decreasing annual trend is a significant factor affecting time delays, while the CVSS content displays negligible influence on these delays. Consequently, the practical application of NVD data feeds for CVSS information should not raise concerns about significant delays.
