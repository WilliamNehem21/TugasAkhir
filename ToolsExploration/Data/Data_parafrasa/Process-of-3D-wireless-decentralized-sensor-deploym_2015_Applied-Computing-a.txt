In order to address the challenge of optimizing sensor deployment in a 3D environment, non-deterministic search methods such as random search and simulated annealing can be utilized, as they may yield better results by considering terrain elevations compared to traditional deterministic approaches. Previous efforts to tackle this problem have leveraged evolutionary algorithms, but conventional evolutionary approaches face shortcomings. The homogeneous nature of sensors leads to redundancy and over-concentration of sensor positions when employing crossover schemes such as uniform crossover. This results in decreased effectiveness and hinders the optimization process in sensor deployment.

To mitigate these issues, we proposed a parsing crossover scheme specifically tailored for genetic algorithms. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed parsing crossover method over traditional uniform crossover, one-point crossover, and two-point crossover schemes, particularly in highly irregular terrain. However, we acknowledge the possibility of further refining the parsing crossover scheme to enhance its robustness across different terrain irregularities.

Despite the improved performance of the parsing crossover scheme, its effectiveness is dependent on the underlying genetic algorithm. Under circumstances where genetic algorithms fail, the adequacy of our parsing crossover scheme remains uncertain. While our simulations did not exhibit instances of genetic algorithm failure, this potential limitation warrants further investigation in future studies.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: We commence with the problem statement, followed by an exposition of the proposed method. We then present the experimental protocol and results, concluding with discussions and future perspectives.

Although sensor deployment optimization is recognized as a complex problem, comprehensive frameworks for its optimization are scarce. Most existing approaches rely on generic heuristic algorithms due to the complexity of the problem. Previous work by Akbarzadeh et al. (2010) proposed a more comprehensive framework, but we believe that there are still important concepts that require further clarification and delineation.

The paper introduces a coverage framework for sensor deployment optimization, defining the coverage of a point of interest based on the deployment of multiple sensors. The global coverage of a region of interest is determined by the collective coverage of all points within that region, accounting for both binary and probabilistic coverage settings.

To validate the efficacy of the proposed parsing crossover method, we conducted experiments on terrains with varying irregularities. Introducing asymmetry in the experiments, sensors were placed one meter above the ground instead of on the ground. We tested several search algorithms, including traditional deterministic pattern, random search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with different crossover schemes, and the proposed parsing crossover.

Our experimental setup included 10-50 generations for comparability, with a crossover rate of 0.9 for uniform crossover. We also tested mutation rates and disturbances for simulated annealing. Given the NP-hard non-convex nature of sensor deployment in a 3D environment, our results suggest that non-deterministic optimization methods, particularly the proposed parsing crossover scheme, offer promising outcomes for the optimization of sensor deployment in various terrain types.
