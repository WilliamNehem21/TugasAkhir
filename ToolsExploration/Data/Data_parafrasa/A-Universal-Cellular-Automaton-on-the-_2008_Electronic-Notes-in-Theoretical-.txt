As stated in the abstract, this paper presents the initial findings on a universal cellular automaton operating on a ternary heptagrid. While the larger number of cell neighbors makes a case for having a smaller number of states compared to the pentagrid case, this assertion has not been previously proven. Additionally, directly translating the result from the pentagrid using the continuous transformation constructed in previous works would likely yield an automaton with at least the same number of states as in the pentagrid. Thus, demonstrating an improved result requires significant effort, as shown in this study. Furthermore, since this investigation takes place in a separate grid with unique properties, it cannot be simply regarded as an enhancement.

A switch is an oriented structure with a single track "u" on one side and two tracks "a" and "b" on the other side, providing two ways of crossing. The path from "u" to "a" or "b" is referred to as active, while the path from "a" or "b" to "u" is designated as passive. These names stem from the fact that in the passive mode, the switch does not impact the locomotive's trajectory, whereas in the active mode, the switch determines which track, a or b, the locomotive will follow after traversing "u," and the chosen track is termed the selected track.

The fixed switch is unchanged by the locomotive's passage and always maintains its position, consistently directing the locomotive onto the same track when actively crossed. On the other hand, the flip-flop switch is designed to be actively crossed only, and after each locomotive passage, it alters the selected track. The memory switch may be traversed by the locomotive both actively and passively. When actively crossed, the locomotive is guided to the selected track, which is determined by the track of the last passive crossing. Initially, the selected track is fixed.

A method is needed to keep track of whether the locomotive has incremented or decremented "r," serving as one aspect of control. Another aspect is derived from multiple instructions usually applying to the same register. Upon returning from "r," the locomotive typically moves to carry out a new instruction that depends on the previous one executed on "r." This can be managed using a component referred to as the selector in previous literature.

The switches regulate the convergence of tracks in accordance with the principles outlined in the preceding section. By definition, four paths meet at a crossing, while three paths converge at a switch. In line with previous research, such a convergence is represented by a tile, which plays a specific role and is termed the center of the meeting. The other parts of the tracks adjoin a neighbor of the center, referred to as the first cell of the respective track.

Each cell is assigned a numbering of its sides from 1 to 7. Except for the central cell, where side 1 is fixed, in the other cells, side 1 is the side shared with the preceding cell. Once side 1 is established, the numbering of the other sides is also fixed, increasing in a counterclockwise manner around the supporting tile. It is noteworthy that the sons of a black node in the Fibonacci tree correspond to sides 4 and 5, while those of a white node correspond to sides 3, 4, and 5.
