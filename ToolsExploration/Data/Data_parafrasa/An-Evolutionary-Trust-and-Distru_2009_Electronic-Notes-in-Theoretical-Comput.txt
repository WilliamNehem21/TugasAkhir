This academic paper introduces a trust model that goes beyond simply considering trust and distrust, by also incorporating a parameter that measures the reliability and stability of trust or distrust. The addition of this new parameter aims to enable a more accurate use of trust. The paper argues that trust is dynamic rather than static, and emphasizes that trust values can fluctuate over time. As a result, the proposed model takes time into consideration as a fundamental parameter. The authors highlight the limited existing research on the impact of time on trust.

The paper discusses the historical use of trust management systems to facilitate interactions between entities within a system, serving as a crucial tool in the decision-making process. It identifies a lack of adequate information about other entities, which creates the need for trust management systems. With the rise of electronic communications and transactions, reputation systems have been developed to supplement trust management systems in aiding the trust decision process.

The paper points out that existing systems do not account for the influence of time on trust or reputation outcomes, despite some recognition in the literature of time's potential impact on trust dynamics. The authors reference various works that acknowledge the dynamic nature of trust and propose methods for incorporating time into trust models.

The paper also discusses related research that incorporates time as a factor in trust models and highlights the importance of accounting for the freshness of trust values. The authors propose a formula to update trust degrees as time progresses, underscoring the significance of recent behaviors in determining the final measure of trust.

The paper outlines a three-dimensional trust model that integrates trust values, reliability values, and the influence of time to derive a trustworthy decision. The model is organized to introduce the proposed trust model, application scenarios, and conclusions.

Furthermore, the paper discusses a concrete example involving two eBay sellers to illustrate how the proposed model assesses trust and reliability based on past activities and time. The authors also address the storage and scope of the model, emphasizing the local storage of trust statements and the importance of trust scope in considering personal biases.

In addition, the paper discusses trust statement import and export processes, and the potential challenges in reaching a consensus when importing multiple trust statements. It also presents a scenario involving the review process for conference papers, demonstrating how the proposed trust model can assist in decision-making and providing a framework for computing acceptance values for reviewed papers.

The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of time in refining the process of accepting papers for a conference and discusses an example of using the proposed model in this scenario.
