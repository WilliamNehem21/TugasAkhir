This academic paper presents an interactive visualization tool designed for large natural deduction proof searches. The tool allows users to monitor and display the progression of a search as well as the proof tree itself. The paper discusses the tool's feature set and architecture, highlighting its extensibility and interface for interaction with other user-provided analysis and visualization code.

The visualization tool, called VIPRS, was developed as part of the IARPA CASE program under contract FA8750-06-C-0194, with HNC Software as a subcontractor of the University of South Carolina. The views and conclusions presented in the paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the US government or its agencies.

The paper emphasizes the importance of visualization in the context of automated theorem proving in natural deduction. It asserts that natural deduction is generally easier to comprehend than other logics, making it essential to present easily-comprehensible proofs in an accessible format. Additionally, given that automated theorem proving in natural deduction is still in its early stages, visualization is identified as a valuable tool for aiding in the understanding of experimental algorithms.

The paper discusses the design of VIPRS, its interface, implementation, and architecture as well as its potential future extensions. It also emphasizes the challenges in adapting automated theorem provers, traditionally focused on mathematics, to informal domains of human knowledge. The paper highlights the need for tools like VIPRS to gain insights into search patterns and inefficiencies in practical applications, particularly in reasoning over large knowledgebases.

In terms of the VIPRS interface, the paper describes the viewing pane as the main component, which displays the proof search in a graphical format. The interface allows mouse-based interactions for zooming, panning, selecting, and displaying additional information about nodes. The paper also details the use of a command line interface as the primary means for users to manipulate the proof search programmatically.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the underlying model and visualization of the graph, the use of the Prefuse visualization toolkit, and the focus on understanding the structure of the search space to improve search efficiency. It also explains the considerations for extensibility in the VIPRS architecture, including the addition of Python functions and various possibilities for future visualizations.

The paper concludes by noting the potential for future extensions of VIPRS in line with the development of the Silk theorem proving project, including its interoperability with Bayesian network software systems.
