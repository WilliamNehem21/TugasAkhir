is this sensible? implementations of cryptographic functions(e.g. the openssl library) typically do not provide means of testing whether decryption with a given decryption key is successful or not. however, in many applications it is assumed that this information is available, e.g. by appending a publicly known token to the clear text before encryption; it can then be checked if the decryption output also contains this token.



which intuitively says that only encrypted first components of pairs can be decrypted. this assumption is not very strong though, for the vast majority of theories with rules on the above form are not convergent. note that if e is an independent convergent subterm theory then e+ is also an independent convergent subterm theory.



considered as a set of known terms, the analysis often contains redundancy. for complexity reasons we only wish to consider the smallest subset of the analysis from which the analysis can be reconstructed by applying appropriate contexts. the first step towards this aim is the following definition of cores.
