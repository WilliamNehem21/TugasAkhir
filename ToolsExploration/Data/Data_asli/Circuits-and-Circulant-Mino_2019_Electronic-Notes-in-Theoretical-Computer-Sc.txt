circulant contraction minors play a key role for characterizing ideal circular matrices in terms of minimally non ideal structures. in this article we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for a circular matrix a to have circulant contraction minors in terms of circuits in a digraph associated with a. in the particular case when a itself is a circulant matrix, our result provides an alternative characterization to the one previously known from the literature.



perfectness is a hereditary graph property, which means that any vertex induced subgraph of a perfect graph is itself perfect, and the corresponding holds for their clique-vertex incidence matrices. similarly, idealness can be shown to be a hereditary matrix property, which is transferred to minors of the matrix. in the first case, this observation has led to the characterization of perfect graphs in terms of minimally non perfect subgraphs. the corresponding characterization of minimally non ideal matrices turned out to be much more difficult and is still an open task. however, several results have been obtained for particular classes of matrices.



in the same work, we also stated a necessary condition for a circular matrix to have a circulant minor. in this paper we further develop this result. the main result of this contribution is stated in theorem 4.7, where we completely characterize circulant minors of circular matrices in terms of directed circuits in its associated digraph. when restricted to the subclass of circulant matrices, our result yields an alternative characterization of circulant minors to the one provided in.
