Reliable seismic phase identification is often challenging especially in the circumstances of low-magnitude
events or poor signal-to-noise ratio. With improved seismometers and better global coverage, a sharp increase
in the volume of recorded seismic data has been achieved. This makes handling seismic data rather daunting
by using traditional approaches and therefore fuels the need for more robust and reliable methods. In this
study, we develop 1D deep Residual Neural Network (ResNet), for tackling the problem of seismic signal
detection and phase identification. This method is trained and tested on the dataset recorded by the Southern
California Seismic Network. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve robust performance for
the detection of seismic signals and the identification of seismic phases. Compared to previously proposed deep
learning methods, the introduced framework achieves around 4% improvement in earthquake detection and
a slightly better performance in seismic phase identification on the dataset recorded by Southern California
Earthquake Data Center. The model generalizability is also tested further on the STanford EArthquake Dataset.
In addition, the experimental result on the same subset of the STanford EArthquake Dataset, when masked by
different noise levels, demonstrates the model’s robustness in identifying the seismic phases of small magnitude.
1. Introduction
The detection of earthquakes is crucial for seismologists to monitor
tectonic activities in a region. In order to achieve reliable earthquake
monitoring, many automated methods for seismic phase identification
have been developed. The most state-of-the-art conventional algorithms
for earthquake detection or seismic phase picking include template
matching ( Peng and Zhao , 2009 ; Ross et al. , 2017 ) and short-time
average/long-time average (STA/LTA) ( Zhou et al. , 2022 ). Template
matching involves measuring the similarity between earthquake wave-
forms and cataloged waveforms of seismic events. However, it relies
heavily on the pre-defined events, which makes the detection chal-
lenging in case of unseen data ( Ross et al. , 2018 ). STA/LTA refers to
measuring the ratio between the amplitude of the signal on a short time
window and that on a long time window; an event is detected when the
ratio exceeds some pre-defined threshold. STA/LTA might not perform
well for the signals with low signal-to-ratio (SNR) and low magnitudes.

and seismic monitoring networks, remarkable improvements have been
achieved in seismic event detection systems which brings about a
huge and rapidly-increasing seismic database. This calls for robust
and sensitive methods to process the ever-growing volume of seismic
data. Therefore, seismic event detection and phase picking algorithms
are becoming increasingly important to automatically deal with large
amounts of seismic data. Deep learning, with its recent development
— especially in computer vision, is capable of processing big data
with a large number of different features such as lines, edges, and
image segments. The task of earthquake signal detection or seismic
phase identification can be recognized as similar to the identification
of objects in computer vision. Therefore, recent advances in the field
of computer vision have great potential for seismological applications.
Recently, deep learning has been widely used to detect seismic events,

identify seismic phases, and estimate seismic phase arrival-time pick-
ing (Ross et al., 2018; Zhu and Beroza, 2019; Mousavi et al., 2020;
Saad and Chen, 2020; Li et al., 2021; Chakraborty et al., 2021; Saad
and Chen, 2021; Chakraborty et al., 2022). For example, in Ross et al.
(2018), a convolutional neural network associated with fully-connected
layers was trained to detect short windows of P-waves, S-waves, and
noise. Capsule Neural Network-based earthquake signal detection and
seismic phase identification was presented in Saad and Chen (2020,
2021). The authors in Li et al. (2021) combined the attention mech-
anism and U-shaped neural network for seismic phase arrival-time
estimation. Both convolution layer and Bidirectional Long-Short Term
Memory units were used in Chakraborty et al. (2021) and Chakraborty
et al. (2022) for earthquake identification and magnitude estimation.
In convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based phase picking meth-
ods, the pooling layer is mainly used to reduce the network dimen-
sionality. However, its use may result in the loss of some key features.
As a result, the use of a pooling layer at the deeper network could
increase the risk of more information loss, which may lead to a decrease
in the network performance (Zeiler and Fergus, 2014; Sabour et al.,
2017). Besides, CNN is not sensitive to the shift or orientation of the
object (Sabour et al., 2017). Furthermore, deep CNNs are challenging
to train because of the vanishing gradient problem, and the model
performance becomes saturated or begins to degrade rapidly with the
increase in network depth (He et al., 2016). To tackle the problem of
the pooling layer in CNN, the capsule neural network (Sabour et al.,
2017) was introduced by Sabour et al. (2017), using the dynamic
routing algorithm. Dynamic routing enables a capsule to attend to
some active capsules at a low level while ignoring others. Therefore,
in this manner, the coupling coefficients among capsules could be
iteratively updated. However, Peer et al. (2021) found that capsule net-
works cannot be viewed as universal approximators due to the limited
representation capabilities of routing-by-agreement and EM-routing to
symmetric functions (Peer et al., 2021). Furthermore, Capsule networks
also suffer from performance issues when dealing with larger datasets
including complex data (Xi et al., 2017). The residual neural networks
(ResNet) were developed by He et al. (2016) to address the degradation
problem and enhance the model performance in the deeper network
using residual blocks (see Section 2.1 for more details). In this study,
1D-ResNet adapted from the original ResNet architecture is imple-
mented for earthquake signal detection and seismic phase identification
given short-window seismic waveforms similar with Ross et al. (2018),
Saad and Chen (2020, 2021), while continuous seismic waveforms are
adopted in Zhu and Beroza (2019), Mousavi et al. (2020), Li et al.
(2021) and Chakraborty et al. (2021, 2022). Within this work, the
seismic data fed into the introduced model is not labeled with specific
phase arrival time, however, the proposed model could further be
used for the arrival-time estimation of continuous seismic waveforms.
Therefore, it is capable of reducing the efforts and time of arrival-time
labeling.
In this work, both earthquake detection and seismic phase iden-
tification are formulated as a supervised classification problem. Con-
sidering that Residual Neural Network (ResNet) (He et al., 2016)
achieves superiority in image classification by adopting skip connection
and 1D ResNet works well for time-series data (e.g., valve acoustic
signals) (Sha et al., 2022), we develop 1D ResNet34 based on the
residual module (He et al., 2016) for the defined tasks, here the
Reset34 denotes a 34 layers convolution neural network combined with
multiple residual blocks. The seismic data of the Southern California
Seismic Network (Center, 2013) labeled as ‘P-phase’, ‘S-phase’, and
‘Noise’ is employed to train the model and test its performance. In
addition to this, the model’s generalization ability is also verified on the
data selected from the STanford EArthquake Dataset (STEAD) (Mousavi
et al., 2019). The results well indicate that the proposed method is capa-
ble of reliably identifying small magnitude earthquakes and respective
P-phase and S-phase.This work is organized as follows: Section 2 comprehensively de-
lineates the proposed methodology. Section 3 briefly describes the
used dataset, and shows the experimental setting and metrics for the
performance evaluation. Section 4 details the results of the performed
experiments and finally, Section 5 describes the conclusions of this
work.
2. Methodology
The proposed method described in this section takes a window of
three-channel seismogram data, i.e., three-channel normalized wave-
form within the duration of 4 s, as input, and outputs the probabilities
over three classes: P-wave window, S-wave window, and noise window.
2.1. Residual neural network
In principle, the neural network could be considered as the function
approximator (𝑥)which maps the input 𝑥with the output. In He et al.
(2016), the authors showed that when adding more layers to the neural
network to enrich the features of the model, training the neural network
becomes more challenging due to difficulty in optimizing the model
parameters caused by vanishing/exploding gradient. Furthermore, the
accuracy of the model either gets saturated at a particular value or
slowly degrades. Consequently, the model performance deteriorates
both in the training phase and testing phase. To tackle this, the popular
neural network architecture known as ResNet was proposed in He
et al. (2016), where the layers are explicitly reformulated as learning
residual functions with respect to the layer input. The idea is that it is
easier to optimize the residual function (𝑥)than the original function
(𝑥) =(𝑥) +𝑥. Thus, the stacked nonlinear layers aim at fitting the
mapping (𝑥) ∶=(𝑥) −𝑥, not the original mapping (𝑥). They also
provided extensive empirical evidence to indicate that it is not only
easier to optimize these residual networks, but also the accuracy could
be enhanced from the considerably increased depth. The residual block
adopted from He et al. (2016) is displayed at the bottom of Fig. 1. On
one hand, the skip connections in ResNet succeeded in dealing with
the issue of vanishing gradient in deep neural networks by allowing
the gradient to flow directly through the alternative shortcut path
backward from the latter layers to the former layers. On the other hand,
these connections allow the model to learn the identity functions, which
guarantees that the higher layer could perform at least as well as the
lower layer.
2.2. Model architecture
In this study, the existent ResNet component, as shown in Fig. 1, is
utilized as the fundamental block and adapted for earthquake detection
and seismic phase classification using 1D seismic data. The only differ-
ence between these two tasks is the output size. In our work, the seismic
records with three components are treated as images by the devised 1D
ResNet to identify seismic phases to P-wave, S-wave, or noise window,
correspondingly.
It should be noted that in this work the two tasks (earthquake detec-
tion and phase identification) are separately implemented when using
1D ResNet. Therefore, in the task of earthquake detection, the output is
labeled as an earthquake (including but not distinguishing P-wave and
S-wave) and noise signals (Saad and Chen, 2020), while in the case
of seismic phase identification, the model is trained to classify noise
window, P-wave window, and S-wave window, respectively, similar
to Ross et al. (2018) and Saad and Chen (2021). For those two tasks,
in the model training process, the labels are defined as follows: (i)
for earthquake detection — ‘zero’ for earthquake signal and ‘one’ for
noise. (ii) for phase classification — ‘zero’ for P-wave windows, ‘one’
for S-wave windows, and ‘two’ for noise windows.Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 115–122

3. Experiments
3.1. Seismic dataset
In this study, the open-source dataset (SCEDC Center , 2013 ) recor-
ded by the Southern California Seismic Network is used to train and
test the proposed model. This dataset was first used in Ross et al.
(2018 ) and the following preprocessing steps were used: the data was
first detrended and high-pass filtered with a corner frequency of 2 Hz
to remove microseismic noise, and then resampled at 100 Hz; strong-
motion records were integrated to velocity. The 3-component records
included in the dataset consist of 1.5 million P-wave seismograms, 1.5
million S-wave seismograms, and 1.5 million noise windows, with each
window being exactly 4 s (400 samples) in duration. The magnitude
range of the data is −0.81< 𝑀 < 5.7, while only records with
epicentral distances less than 100 km are used. Both P-wave and S-
wave windows are centered on the arrival pick, while each noise
window starts 5 s before each P-wave arrival pick. Fig. 2 visualizes the
waveforms including one P-phase window, one S-phase window, and
one noise window.
The STEAD dataset ( Mousavi et al. , 2019 ) is also used for model
evaluation. In order to help better understand the model output, Fig. 3
visualizes the pipeline of the testing process and the testing result (the
predicted probability) using the pie chart of three different input data
extracted from one raw waveform of STEAD dataset when fed to the
trained model. Similar to the SCEDC dataset ( Center , 2013 ), the P-phase
and S-phase windows are centered on the respective arrival time, and
the noise windows are extracted starting 5 s before the P arrival time.
Each pie chart shows the predicted probability for each class (P-phase,
S-phase, Noise), in which the sum over all the probabilities is one.
3.2. Parameters setting
In this study, the ADAM algorithm is used for optimization with a
learning rate of 0.001, and the model is trained for 50 epochs when
the training loss is stable. The proposed models are implemented in
Pytorch ( Paszke et al. , 2019 ) and trained on an NVIDIA A100 Graphics
Processing Unit. The loss function used is cross-entropy and training is
performed in the mini-batches of 480 records. A dropout rate of 0.2
is adopted for all dropout layers. Note that here data augmentation is
not used on the training data and at the same time, we do not use any
ensemble methods in the model training phase.Aiming to make the comparison with CapsNet ( Saad and Chen ,
2020 ) for the earthquake detection task, 50% of the whole dataset is
used for model training and 25% of the data is utilized for testing.
However, in CapsNet ( Saad and Chen , 2020 ), the training dataset is
balanced, i.e., the number of the data labeled by zero (‘earthquake’)
is same as the number of the data with labels of one (‘noise’). Please
note that, from the beginning, the whole dataset is labeled with one of
the three classes: P-phase, S-phase, or noise. On the other hand, in the
case of earthquake and non-earthquake detection, the wave windows
including P-phase and S-phase are re-labeled as earthquake signals. The
above-mentioned processes make the training dataset biased, where the
number of the data labeled by zero (earthquake) is not equal to that
labeled by one (noise). For seismic phase identification, 90% of the
seismograms are used as a training set, and the remaining 5% of the
seismograms are used to build the testing set same as CapsPhase ( Saad
and Chen , 2021 ).
3.3. Evaluation metrics
The following metrics are used to evaluate the model performance.
First, the accuracy is defined as the ratio of correctly identified in-
stances over all testing samples, which is usually regarded as the basic
measurement of a classifier’s performance.
𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 =𝑁𝐶
𝑁𝑇(1)
where𝑁𝐶denotes the number of correctly labeled samples and 𝑁𝑇
represents the total number of testing samples.
Then, in order to further estimate the model’s effectiveness, the con-
fusion matrix ( Stehman , 1997 ) is employed to reflect the classification
result. Furthermore, given a confusion matrix, the precision, recall, and
F1-score can be defined as follows:
𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 =𝑇𝑃
𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃(2)
𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 =𝑇𝑃
𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁(3)
𝐹1𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = 2 ∗𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 ∗𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙
𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 +𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙(4)
where TN, FN, FP, and TP are the true negative, false negative, false
positive, and true positive, respectively.Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 115–122

4. Results and discussions
4.1. Phase identification performance
In order to find an optimum architecture for seismic phase iden-
tification, we first tested several ResNet blocks such as 1D-ResNet18,
1D-ResNet34, and 1D-ResNet50. The results show that 1D-ResNet34
(98.70%) performs better than both 1D-ResNet18 (98.63%), and 1D-
ResNet50 (98.62%) even though 1D-ResNet34 has fewer parameters
compared with 1D-ResNet50.
The overall testing accuracy for earthquake detection and phase
classification of different methods is compared and summarized in
Table 1. We can find that the testing accuracy of 1D ResNet is 98.83%.The result demonstrates that our proposed model achieves better per-
formance for earthquake detection than CapsNet ( Saad and Chen , 2020 )
(here, the result of CapsNet is stated from Saad and Chen (2020 )).
For seismic phase classification, 1D ResNet demonstrates its superiority
compared with CapsPhase ( Saad and Chen , 2021 ) (here, the result
of CapsPhase is adopted from Saad and Chen (2021 )). The potential
reason behind achieving higher performance could be that the residual
blocks in ResNet ( He et al. , 2016 ) contribute to improving the classi-
fication accuracy since it is capable to learn some meaningful features
from the input.
The results of different metrics including precision, recall and F1-
score for earthquake identification are shown in Table 2. It is found
that 1D ResNet can achieve compatible results with CapsNet.Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 115–122

Finally, Table 3 summarizes the classification result of different met-
rics for seismic phase identification. It can be observed that compared
with CapsPhase ( Saad and Chen , 2021 ), the proposed model achieves
better performance, especially for S wave identification.
As reported in Ross et al. (2018 ), P- and S-waves windows are
obtained from the earthquake events, whereas, the noise windows
are selected starting 5 s before each P-wave arrival. Hence, there are
similarities between these windows. Fig. 4 visualizes an example for
each class including the P-phase window, S-phase window, and noise
window from the SCEDC dataset that is misclassified by the proposed
1D-ResNet in this work. As one can see, the resemblance between data
belonging to different classes could lead to misclassification. In the casewhere the noise is either misclassified as P- or S-phase, we notice an
increase in either amplitude or sudden change in frequency or both
which might have contributed to the wrong detection. Whereas, most
of the P- or S-phase which are misclassified as noise were noisy signals.
4.2. Model generalizability
To further investigate the model generalization ability, the pro-
posed model is evaluated on the STEAD dataset ( Mousavi et al. , 2019 )
and compared with previous deep learning-based phase identification
methods.
For this purpose, local earthquake signals of the STEAD dataset after
normalization are used. As in Ross et al. (2018 ), only seismic data
satisfying the following requirements are used. First, P- and S-wave
windows are centered on the ground truth phase pick corresponding
to the dataset metadata, and each noise window is clipped starting 5 s
before each P-phase arrival time. Second, the arrival-time difference
between P-wave and S-wave picks of each signal is larger than 6 s with
the goal to reduce the effect of the waveform overlapping between
P-phase and S-phase arrivals. Third, only the seismograms with the
‘source_distance’ labeled in the metadata of the STEAD dataset less
than 100 km are chosen same as ( Ross et al. , 2018 ). Finally, the
created dataset consists of 8111 P-wave seismograms, 8111 S-wave
seismograms, and 8111 noise windows. Here the duration of each
window is 400 samples with a sampling rate of 100 Hz. The earthquake
magnitude of the used data ranges from 1 to 3. The distributions of
the earthquake magnitude, source distance, and the time difference
between P-phase and S-phase arrival time are displayed in Fig. 5.
The proposed method is first compared with CapsPhase ( Saad and
Chen , 2021 ). Here, these two models are pre-trained on the SCEDC
dataset, and the best-saved model of CapsPhase published by the au-
thors is directly used without model retraining. In contrast to the
original work, Saad and Chen (2021 ), in this comparison, no threshold
is used for the model output. The overall testing accuracies of the
used two methods are 94.39% (CapsPhase), and 95.68% (1D-ResNet),
respectively. Thus, we see find that 1D-ResNet used in this study
achieves better performance, especially in the S-phase identification.
The confusion matrices on the selected data for the three methods
are depicted in Fig. 6 and the precision, recall, and F1-score areArtificial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 115–122

summarized in Table 4. Table 4 shows that the proposed 1D-ResNet
performs better in S-phase identification, and achieves a comparable
performance in P-phase and noise window identification compared
with CapsPhase.
Finally, the proposed method is also compared to the generalized
phase detection method (GPD) ( Ross et al. , 2018 ). Hence, 75% of the
SCEDC dataset is used to retrain the proposed 1D-ResNet, which is the
same as GPD, and the built STEAD data is further utilized to test the
model performance. Here, the best-saved model of the GPD method isTable 4

the results of different metrics are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 5, where
we can find that 1D-ResNet achieves competitive performance with the
GPD method ( Ross et al. , 2018 ).
4.3. Discussions
To investigate the model performance, when facing more noisy data,
the same subset of the STEAD dataset used for model generalization
evaluation in the study is masked by Gaussian noise (similar to the
approach used in Mousavi et al. (2020 )). Then, the noisy data is fed to
the pre-trained model to test the performance. The signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of the data before adding noise ranges from 0 to 70 dB. Here, the
SNR is the mean value of SNR over three-components for each signal.
To study the impact of different noise levels on model performance,
the subset is masked by the Gaussian noise (similar to the method used
in Mousavi et al. (2020 )) with mean 𝜇= 0 and standard deviation
𝛿= 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5, respectively. The testing accuracies are
summarized in Table 6 below.
The results in Table 6 show that large noise reduces the model
performance, and compared with CapsPhase and GPD, 1D-ResNet34
achieves a better performance.
The SCEDC dataset used in this study consists only of windows
centered around the first arrivals of P- and S-waves. Therefore, during
the training phase only windows with P- and S-arrivals in the center
are encountered by the model; this could affect the model performance
when tested on windows not centered around P- and S-arrivals. To
study the case where the P- and S-waves are not at the center of theArtificial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 115–122

are randomly located from 1 s to 3 s after the window start time. The

in accuracy is most likely the difference between the position of P- and
S-arrivals in the training data and the testing data which could have
resulted in incorrect decisions.
5. Conclusions
In this study, we investigate the 1D residual neural network (ResNet)
for earthquake detection and seismic phase classification. This model
is trained and tested on the Southern California Seismic Dataset and
further evaluated on the STEAD dataset. Extensive experimental results
verify that the 1D-ResNet achieves a better performance than previous
deep learning-based approaches, and performs better over the baseline

methods when facing more noisy data. The proposed model can be
utilized by seismologists to identify earthquake signals and phases,
especially in the case of noisy low-magnitude earthquake waveforms.
Future work will focus on a hierarchical classifier to hierarchically com-
plete the tasks of earthquake detection and seismic phase identification.
Note that this study only focuses on seismic phase identification, in
follow-up work, we will investigate how to use the pre-trained phase
classifier to improve the phase arrival time picking on continuous
seismic waveforms.
