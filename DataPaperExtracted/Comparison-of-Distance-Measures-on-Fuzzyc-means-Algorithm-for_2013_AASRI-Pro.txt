compared with SOM and k-Means algorithm. By combin ing the ideas of FCM and divergence measure for the problem of image classification, we expect a better feature extraction procedure for more accurate classification scheme. The method adopts the FCM algor ithm with Divergence Measure [3]-[5]for acquiring texture information from image data. Section 2 summarizes FCM algorithms with two diffe rent distance measures: Euclidean distance and divergence distance. Section 3 reports the evaluations  and a comparison of different schemes through experiments. Section 4 presents  conclusions. 2. Adopted Clustering Algorithms 2.1. Fuzzy c-MeansAlgorithm The following  equation is used as the objective function for FCM[2] :  
                                                                                                              (1)  whered
i(xk) , ki,m, n, and c follow the definitions in [2]. From Eq. (1), Bezdekfinds  the following equations [2]: 
                                                                                                                                            (2) 
 
                                                                                                                                                 (3) 2.2. FCM with Divergence Measure The choice of different distance measure can affect th e performance of clustering results [1]. This leads to the idea of divergence measure for image classification problem. Given two Gaussian Probability Density Functions, 
and , i = 1, , d ,  the divergence distance can be defined as follows[6,8]:  
  
                                                                                                       (4)  52   Jiho Han et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  50 – 56 
where ,,and follow the definition in [6,8]. Note that the divergence measure is also called as Kullback-Leibler Divergence.  FCM calculates the parameters of center and membership values by applying all the data at once in batch mode. However, the D-FCM used in the proposed classifier calculates and updates their parameters at each application of each data vector as the Gradient-based FCM [3]. The advantage of this iterative application and updating the center parameters was reported in [3]. When each data vector 
is presented to the network, the following can be also found : 
                                                                                                                                            (5)  
Subsequently, the following update equation for  the mean and variance was derived[6]:  
                                                                                                     (6)   
                                                                                                          (7) where
, , , , and  follow the definitions in [6].  3. Experiments and Results For evaluation and comparison purpose for different classification schemes, we performed some experiments on a set of the Caltech image database[7]. The Caltech image database has been widely used as a benchmark data for various image classification problems. Examples of the four-category data used in experiments are given in Fig. 1.200 data are used fo r each category. Preparation for experiments follows the procedure used in [4]:  150 randomly selected traini ng data and 50 remaining data for each class are used for the evaluation of different classifier schemes.  Note that  all the image data are converted to grey images with identical resolution. The first step for designing a data classifier is the feature extraction process. The local feature extraction adopted in our experiments allows us to find localized feature information from entire image space.By collecting thefeature information from local points, each image data can be expressed in terms of features. In our experiments, 8 
8 blocks are used for extracting localized information of an image data. The local information in each image window can be extracted by using conventional feature extraction methods [9]-[11]. Among them, Gabor filters and wavelet filters show reasonable performance except requiring extensive computational burden. This computational burden keep s these methods from being used for feature extraction tools for several applications. On the other hand, the Di screte Cosine Transform (DCT) is more suitable to acquire frequency information in images and DCT is used for our experiments because DCT does not require so much computational effort. Even though DCT coefficients out of each block image produces 64-dimensional one, the 32 lower frequency part of the 64 coefficients are used [4] and this yields a total 32-dimensional vector value for each local block image. The model for a data category is formed by deciding the code vectors using clustering algorithms on its feature vectors. The modeling or training process consists of finding representativecode vector for 53  Jiho Han et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  50 – 56 
eachcategory with its feature vectors.Bayesian classifier is utilized for the performance evaluation on various classification schemes. Itallocates a class for a given testdata according to the following probability  calculation [4]:  
                                                                                                                          (8)  
                                                                                                                              ( 9)

 4. Conclusions
 
A comparative study Euclidean distance and divergen ce distance for FCM is conducted in this paper.When used for an image classification problem, conventional FCM algorithm which uses Euclidean distance measure utilizes only mean information from an image block for its feature. On the other hand, FCM algorithm with divergence utilizes both of variance and mean information from an image block  for its features.  Self-Organizing Map is also used in ou r experiments as a baseline method for the performance comparison purpose.  Experiments on Caltech database are performed for a four category problem. Classification accuracies from different classification schemes imply that  divergence-based FCM is a better fit for image classification problem than the conventional FCM or SOM that use only the mean information as their features for image data. We can conclude that the divergence information of image data plays an important role in image classification problem and the resultant classification scheme that uses the divergence information as well as the mean information from image data is a better choice for image classification problem. However, a further effort should be given to find a feature extraction method for overcoming the confusion between Motorbike data and Airplane data.
