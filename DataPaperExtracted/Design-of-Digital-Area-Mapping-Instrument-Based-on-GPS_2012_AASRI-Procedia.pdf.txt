1. Introduction The traditional land area measurement technology, in the past, has been on simple of arrows or tapes as measurement tools, and the area is general rules, but if  meeting irregular shape or large plot, these tools are not so precise as other advanced ones. On the other ha nd, in modern society, many aspects are closely related to area measurement, for instance, farm machinery homework charges, farmland contracting measurement, enterprise land tax, etc. So it is difficult to meet the requirements if still using the traditional measuring methods, and the digital measurement method is effective to resolve that problem.  2. General Scheme The scheme is manipulative to make use of satellite: firs tly, the device receives the data sent by the satellite, which to interpret the needed information to extrac t (namely longitude, latitude and altitude). And then

 For any latitude point M,  whose distance to the coordinates of the origin is N(N>0)ˈcan be set to ( N*cos(latitude), N*sin(latitude)). Take it into elliptic epuation, at the same time, have

So for the point(latitude, longitude, height are known ), the distance from the origin of ellipsoid is R=N+heightˈAt its center to coordinate the origin, establish coordinate as shown in figure 3 below. For any point M, in XOY plane projection for P, can draw | OM | = N + height, so M in the Z axis on coordinate is :  
           z=(N+height)*sin(latitude)                                                                   ˄2˅ 
then˖            |OP|=(N+height)*cos(latitude)                                                              ˄3˅ 
In XOY plane, the point P on the X axis in the coordi nate x and Y axis in the coordinate y, can express as: 
x=|OP| cos(longitude)                                                          ˄4˅ y=|OP| sin(longitude)                                                          
˄5˅ 
ByķĸĹĺĻavailable: for any point M, the conversion equation that convert height, longitude and latitude into three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate are as followed   
X=(N+height)*cos(latitude)*cos(longitude)                                     ˄6˅ Y=(N+height)*cos(latitude)*sin(longitude) 
                                                             ˄7˅ Z=( N+height)*sin(latitude)   
                                                                                           ˄8˅ 
And N=a/sqrt(1+(eq) *sin(latitude)*sin(latitude)) ; eq=(a*a-b*b)/(b*b) ; 3.2 Area Calculation Formula Any point’s three-dimensional coordinates caculated in the front can be regarded as x, y, z, take the x, y as the projection in the XOY plane. Due to little latit ude variation, all latitudes can be regarded varying around the average latitude. then the only working needed to do is to calculate the area of projection, according to a series of two-dimensional coordinates for
S / sin(longitude)reality projectionS , during which we must utilize the Green’s Calculus Formula. As shown in figure 4, regional D is a close area surrounded by polygons A1,A2…… , and set its area as A.  So that the area of the regional D for A=

4. Software Design Systematic software basically has the following three parts: GPS data receiving and reading, GPS data conversion and storage, the area calculation and display. The GPS data is mainly received by the hardware Gs tar-89m-J satellite receiving engine, which gets current GPS data around the location every short interval. Then it can read the information of latitude, longtitude and height by the data. GPS data conversion formulas as the ļĽľhave shown. As to data storage, dynamic data storage is used in the scheme combined with area calculation formula .To display, call the program after the finish of calculation of area, assume the attachment between the last survey point and starting point which composes a simulative polygons to display before a no t complete measurement, which can provide access to view the area during the measurement.   The software design flow chart is shown as the figure 5.  5. Results and Analysis After mapping ten pieces of areas of different size by two measurement instruments every time with markķ(the author developed) and markĸthe difference, and finally conclude the data as the Table 1 shows : From the above table of data, it is known that the meas urement area differs from the actual area in some errors, but this error is not very big, the minimu m error is 0.2635%, the maximum error is 3.086%. At the same time we can calculate the average error is 1.172496%. To improve the accuracy, the author thinks that the following aspects can be lucubrated: 1.Take the average number of latitude as the projection latitude to reduce the errors in the conversion formulas. 2. Take the average height as the set height, do not fix on a certain height value.3.Use more sophisticated GPS reciever.4.Use the optimal algorithm, so as to improve the accuracy of conversion value and area value, which, however, is difficult to achieve for it is not so easy to come up with. 265  Wenjie Tong et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  261 – 266 
 6 Conclusion Methods based on the GPS land area measurement have developed for irregular measurement instruments. The experimental results show that the instrument is able to quickly and efficiently achieve the function of the land area of irregular measurement. And for some projec ts related to area, the instrument, whose prospect is inestimable, has special application value.
