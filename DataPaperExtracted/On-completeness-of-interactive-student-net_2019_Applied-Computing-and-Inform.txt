The completeness of interactive student networks are investigated in this paper, which can be used toimprove middle school students’ independent environment for their study outside class. This paper takescovering approximation spaces as mathematical models of interactive student networks and character-izes completeness of interactive student networks by connectivity of covering approximation spaces.Further, this paper gives a simpler and practical method to check completeness of interactive student net-works. Consequently, a way to communication among students is explored and applied in education./C2112017 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

1. IntroductionIn the world, middle school students’ knowledge acceptancemay be divided into three stages: preview before class, classroomlearning and review after class. We observe the three stages, theproblems arise more frequently in preview stage or review stagethan in class learning. The most part of the problems can be solvedin classes, but if they are solved outside class in previewing orreviewing, the effectiveness will be more beneﬁcial. However,due to students’ independent environments outside classes, it isdifﬁcult for students to solve these problems by themselves. Inthe past years, some more recent researches on using ‘‘social meth-ods” in education has aroused more and more scholar’s wide inter-ests and many interesting results were obtained [1,5,14,19]. Having gained some enlightenments from these researches, wecarry out the research for the following issue supported by a majorproject of Chinese postdoctoral scientiﬁc foundation.1.1. IssueHow can we make use of modern educational technology totransform middle school students’ environment in preview andreview such that students can contact each other.As an interesting exploration on the above issue, Z. Xia, the ﬁrstauthor of this paper, designed a interactive student network for agroup of twelve students in Suzhou No.3 High School (see the fol-lowing 1.4). Students, who use the interactive student network,can send and receive information each other. This network createda new environment for these students and would promote theinteraction among these students. We state the concept of interac-tive student network as follows, which is similar to wireless net-work system in[9].1.2. The interactive student networkðV;BÞA interactive student network is a pairðV;BÞsatisfying the fol- lowing conditions, whereVis a collection of some informationpoints andBis a collection of some base stations.(1) Every information point inVcan send information to somebase stations inBand receive information from these basestations inB.(2) Every base station inBcan send information to some infor-mation points inVand receive information from these infor-mation points inV.1.3.

1.1.4. Xia’s interactive student networkNow we state Xia’s interactive student network ðV;BÞ, which is described in the following table (Table 1). Here,V¼fu

Thus, any pair of students in Suzhou No.3 High School, who use informationpoints inðV;BÞ, can send and receive information each other. Asa further work, Xia tried to establish interactive student networksin a larger scale. However, it is necessary to design more informa-tion points and base stations in such an interactive student net-works, which make it complicated and difﬁcult to check thecompleteness of interactive student networks by the method ofenumeration. This brings the following question.1.5. The open questionFor a interactive student network, how to check its complete-ness? More precisely, are there a simpler and practical method tocheck completeness of interactive student networks?.To investigate the above question, it is necessary to analyzedata collected from interactive student networks. In the researchof modern sciences, in order to extract useful information hiddenin data, many methods in addition to classical logic and classicalmathematics have been proposed. Rough set theory, which wasproposed by Pawlak[15], plays an important role in applicationsof these methods. Their usefulness has been demonstrated bymany successful applications in information sciences and com-puter sciences[2,4,12,18,21,22]. In particular, rough set theory isalso applied in education widely[3,7,17,20]. In the past years, with development of information sciences and computer sciences,applications of rough-set theory have been extended from Pawlakapproximation spaces to covering approximation spaces in manyresearch ﬁelds[10,11,13,16,23,24].1.6. The purpose of this paperThis paper launches an investigation around Question 1.5 bycovering approximation spaces. The purpose of this paper is to givea simpler and practical method for checking completeness of inter-active student networks.2. Covering approximation spacesIn this section, we state basic concepts and theories of coveringapproximation spaces.Deﬁnition 2.124. LetU, the universe of discourse, be a ﬁnite setandKbe a family of nonempty subsets of U.(1)Kis called a cover ofUifSfK:K2K g¼U. (2) The pairðU;KÞis called a covering approximation space ifK is a cover ofU.Remark 2.2.LetðU;KÞbe a covering approximation space. If;2K andKis closed with respect to both the union and the ﬁnite inter-section of elements ofK, thenðU;KÞis a topological space[6]. Now we state connectivity of covering approximation spaces(see[8,9], for example) and give its discussion again.Deﬁnition 2.3.LetðU;KÞbe a covering approximation space andx;y2U.(1) A subfamilyfK

Thenthe relation for ‘‘chain connected” is an equivalent relation, i.e.,the following hold for allx;y;z2U.(1)xis chain connected tox.(2)xis chain connected toy)yis chain connected tox. (3)xis chain connected toyandyis chain connected toz)xis chain connected toz.Proof.Obviously, (1) and (2) hold. Letxbe chain connected toy, andybe chain connected toz. Then there areK

So (3) holds.hDeﬁnition 2.5.A covering approximation spaceðU;KÞis called connected if for each pairx;y2U;xis chain connected toy, i.e., there is a chain betweenxandy.As a classical result in topology, a topological space ðX;TÞis connected if and only ifðX;TÞhas no non-empty clopen propersubset. Note that there is not concept for clopen subset for coveringapproximation spaces. So we need to introduced a class of newsubsets of covering approximation spaces, which has relation withthe following covering upper approximation operator.Deﬁnition 2.6.LetðU;KÞbe a covering approximation space. ForeachX#U, Put

ThenSH:2U/C0!2Uis called a covering upper approximation opera-tor, andSHðXÞis called a covering upper approximation of X.
The above covering upper approximation operator SH is calledthe second type of covering upper approximation operation in [24].Deﬁnition 2.7.LetðU;KÞbe a covering approximation space andX#U.Xis called an SH-subset ofðU;KÞifSHðXÞ¼X. The following theorem is an important result of this paper,which characterizes connectivity of covering approximation spacesby their SH-subsets.Lemma 2.8.LetðU;KÞbe a covering approximation space and x2U. Put X¼fu2U:x is chain connected to ug.I fX¼U, thenðU;KÞis connected.Proof.Assume thatX¼U. Letu;

Suppose thatðU;KÞis connected. LetXbe a non- empty SH-subset ofðU;KÞ. ThenSHðXÞ¼X–;. We only need to prove thatXis not a proper subset ofU, i.e.X¼U. Letx2U. Picky2X, thenyis chain connected tox, i.e., there areK

This proves thatSHðXÞ#X. On the other hand, It isclear thatX#SHðXÞ, and henceSHðXÞ¼X. Thus,Xis a SH- subset ofðU;KÞ, it follows thatX¼U.B yLemma 2.8,ðU;KÞ is connected.h3. The method of checking completeness of interactive studentnetworksIn this section, we establish a relation between completeness ofinteractive student networks and connectivity of covering approx-imation spaces. By this relation we give a method to check com-pleteness of interactive student networks.Proposition 3.1.LetðV;BÞbe a interactive student network. Forevery base station B inB, let K
Bbe a set of some information points inV such that u2V is an information point in K
Bif and only if u and B have a contact. Put U¼V andK¼fK
B:B2B g. ThenðU;KÞis a covering approximation space.Proof.It sufﬁces to prove thatKis a cover ofU. Letu2U, i.e.,uis an information point inV. By 1.2(1), there is a base station BinB such thatuandBhave a contact. Souis an information point in K
B, i.e.,u2K B. This proves thatKis a cover ofU.h By the above proposition, we can take covering approximationspaces as mathematical models of interactive student networks.Here, the covering approximation spaceðU;KÞis called to be induced by the interactive student network ðV;BÞ.Lemma 3.2.LetðV;BÞbe a interactive student network, and letðU;KÞbe a covering approximation space induced by ðV;BÞ. Then the following are equivalent for all u ;
v2V¼U.(1)u and v have a contact inðV;BÞ.(2)There is a chain between u and v inðU;KÞ.Proof.(1))(2): Letuand
vhave a contact. Then there are some infor-mation pointsu
1;u2;...;u n2Uand some base stations B
1;B2;...;B n/C012Bsuch that for eachi¼1;2;...;n/C01, not onlyu
iandB ihave a contact but alsou iþ1andB ihave a con- tact, whereu
1¼uandu n¼v. Note thatðU;KÞis induced by ðV;BÞ. For eachi¼1;2;...;n/C01;K
Bi2K, we putK i¼K Bi. ThenK

1;K2;...;K n/C01is a chain betweenuand v. (2))(1): LetK

i;uiþ12K Bi, i.e., not onlyu
iandB ihave a contact but alsou iþ1andB ihave a contact. This proves thatuand
vhave a contact.hByLemma 3.2, we obtain the following theorem immediately,which shows that the completeness of interactive student net-works and the connectivity of covering approximation spaces areequivalent.56 Z.-H. Xia et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 54–58Theorem 3.3.LetðV;BÞbe a interactive student network, and letðU;KÞbe a covering approximation space induced by ðV;BÞ. Then the following are equivalent.(1)ðV;BÞis complete.(2)ðU;KÞis connected.Now we give a simpler and practical method for checking com-pleteness of interactive student networks.Method 3.4.LetðV;BÞbe a interactive student network. Themethod for checking completeness ofðV;BÞconsists of the following ﬁve steps.(1) ByProposition 3.1, we convertðV;BÞto a covering approxi- mation spaceðU;KÞ, whereðU;KÞis induced byðV;BÞ. (2) ByDeﬁnition 2.6, we endow the covering upper approxima-tion operatorSHonðU;KÞ.(3) ByDeﬁnition 2.7, we obtain all SH-subsets ofðU;KÞby a sim- ple algorithm.(4) By the above (3) andTheorem 2.9, it is known that whetherðU;KÞis connected.(5) By the above (4) andTheorem 3.3, it is known that whether
ðV;BÞis complete.4. Some applicationsIn this section, we give some applications to show that ourapproach does work. This work is to assess completeness of inter-active student networks.4.1.

However, if we establish interactivestudent network in large-scale, then voluminous informationpoints and base stations should be designed in general. It is note-worthy that the method for checking their completeness is thesame, which can be achieved by some simple algorithms underthe help of computer technology.5. ConclusionConclusion 5.1.The main results of this paper are to investigatecompleteness of interactive student networks. Here, interactivestudent networks are used to transform middle school students’independent environment in preview and review such that
students can contact each other by using the complete interactivestudent networks. In order to investigate completeness of interac-tive student networks by mathematical methods, this paper takescovering approximation spaces as mathematical models of inter-active student networks and establish a relation between com-pleteness of interactive student networks and connectivity ofcovering approximation spaces. Further, this paper introduces SH-subsets of covering approximation spaces to characterize theirconnectivity. By converting completeness of interactive studentnetwork to connectivity of covering approximation spaces, thispaper gives a simpler and practical method for checking com-pleteness of interactive student network. In the end of this paper,two examples are given to demonstrate applications of thismethod.Remark 5.2.This paper focuses on check of completeness of inter-active student networks, without dealing with the method ofestablishing them. How do we establish a complete interactive stu-dent network? This is an interesting question, which deals witheither mobile communication project or virtual organizationframework. We will discuss this question in our future work.References[1]V. Balakrishnan, T.K. Liew, S. Pourgholaminejad, Fun learning with Edooware –a social media enabled tool, Comput. Educ. 80 (2015) 39–47
