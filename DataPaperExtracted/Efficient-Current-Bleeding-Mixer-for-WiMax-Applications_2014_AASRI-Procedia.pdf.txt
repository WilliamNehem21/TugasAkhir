Abstract 
The Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, or WiMax, is a wireless communication technique based on IEEE 802.16 standards. Its advantage of sending high-data rates over long distances, while using a single base station to cover a large area, has made this technique a flexible and reliable soluti on for public wireless networks. In this paper, a current- bleeding Gilbert Cell down-converter mixer is proposed for WiMax direct-conversion receivers. With 5.1 dB of conversion gain, 1.5 dBm of IIP3, 36 dBm of IIP2 as well as 11.6dB and 8.4dB of single sideband and double sideband noise figure, respectively, the proposed 0.15mm InGaAspHEMT mixer largely meets the WiMax standards as demonstrated though successful comparison with published designs.

1. Introduction The ever-increasing demand for secured high-spe ed high-data rates communication links, preferably accessible through laptops and smartphones via wireless connections, is making the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, or WiMax, on e of the most promising technologies to explore. Furthermore, WiMax systems can cover long distance areas with fewer base stations compared to other wireless technologies, thus involving lower costs in ma intenance, operation, and management (J.

2010). In WiMax technologies, the most widely -used RF transceiver is the Direct-Conversion Architecture m ainly because of its high level of integration and less component requirements, leading to reduced power dissipation (Huanget al., 2007; Antonopouloset al., 2008; Atallahet al., 2007) . In a WiMax receiver, the down converter mixer is o
 ne of the most important devices to consider. Depending on the desired performance, various parameter objectives should be targeted while designing a mixer, such as high conversion gain, 1dB compression point (P -1dB), port-to-port isolation, input second- order intercept point (IIP2) and input third-order intercept point (IIP3) as well as low noise figure (NF) and v
oltage supply. In practice, these parameters cannot be  achieved simultaneously. So, based on design constraints and standard specifications, different mixer types and topologies can be considered.  However, the Gilbert-cell down converter mixer is one of the most suitable for WiMax applications (Wei et al., 2010;Hsiao et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2010). In fact, The Gilbert-cell mixer exhibits major advantages over sing
 le and single-balanced mixers due to inherent port isolation,  relativ
 ely high gain, moderate linearity, and efficient cancellation of even-order harmonic distortion. In the last few years, significant work has been done to improve the Gilbert cell mixer performance, lead
ing to folded mixers, current reuse mixers, and current bleeding mixers. In this paper, a current-bleeding Gilbert Cell do
 wn-converter mixer is proposed for WiMax direct -conversion receivers. The design was ach
 ieved using the 0.15mm InGaAspHEMT technology processfrom Win Semiconductor Crop .0. With 5.1 dB
  of conversion gain, 1.5 dBm of IIP3, 36 dBm of IIP 2 as well as 11.6dB and 8.4dB of single sideband and double sideband noise figure, respectively, the proposed mixer largely meets the WiMax standards as demonstrated though successful comparison with published designs.  2. Proposed Mixer Design Gilbert cell mixers are widespread u
tilized due to their high port isolation, excellent gain, and cancellation of all even harmonics. However, they require staking more transistors leading to more bias supply and power dissipation as well as poorer noise figure and linearity (Krcmaret al., 2007;Su et al., 2008). Therefore, some tech
 niques have been proposed to enhance the conventio nal Gilbert cell mixer performance, leading to folded mixers, current reuse mixers, and current bleeding mixers  (Krcmaret al., 2007;Su et al., 2008; Karanicolas, 1996; L
 in et al., 2006). In this work, the current bleeding technique ha s been
  retained as a suitable tool to improve the mixer respon se. In the proposed design (Fig. 1), the RF signal is applied to the gate of the differential transistors (M1 and M2). Such configuration produces relatively cons tant gain, cancels the even harmonics, and converts the M1 and M2 RF input signal voltage to outp ut current. The LO signal is applied to M3 -M6. These transi
 stors operate near pinch-off region in order to accomplish the multiplication of the RF amplified signal w
ith the LO signal.  A current mirror stage (M9 and M10) provides the re qu
 ired current for the circuit. Finally, two source follower buffers (M7 and M8) areadded to match the IF+/IF - outputs with baluns. In order to get high conversion gain, the RF transist ors s
 hould be larger than the LO transistors. On the other side, large size transistors increase DC and LO power consumption.  Therefore, a current bleeding block (R
1 and R 2) was added to M1 and M2 to enhance the conversion gain by increasing the current in the RF stage. This current should be enough to operate M1 and M2 in the saturation region while reducing the current in the LO stage; therefore, the voltage is dropped in the load resistors R
6 and R 7.(Tsai et al., 2007;Khyet al., 2010; Wuet al., 2010). The transistor is sized based on min
imum noise figure, power consumption and maximum frequency, i.e., 2×25 μm . Moreover, such small transistor size provides the ability to apply the current bleeding to reduce the circuit voltage. 94   A.M. Almohaimeed and M.C.E. Yagoub  /  AASRI Procedia   9  ( 2014 )  92 – 98

3. Results The mixer design, achieved in the commercial circuit simulator Agilent -
InGaAspHEMT technology process provided by Win Semiconductor Crop. 0. A link budget was performed to ded uce the desired specifications for the down-converter mixer to be designed (Table 1). The simulator was s
 et up for input signal frequency from 3.493 to 3.507 GHz and LO signal frequency of 3.5 GHz in order to get the IF output frequency of 7 MHz. As seen in Fig. 2 (a)  an optimum LO power of -3 dBm allows reaching the h
 ighest conversion gain value, i.e., 7.3 dB.  However, as displayed in Fig. 2 (b), the above LO power gives a relatively high single sideband noise f
igure of around 10 dB. Therefore, as compromise, we selected a LO power of 0 dBm, corresponding to a conversion gain of about 6 dB and a noise figure of 9. 3 dB for single side band and 6 dB for double sideband, respectively. Figure 3 shows an IIP3 of 1 dBm while the IIP2 was found to be 39 dBm.

 As for the co-simulation (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5), the obtained conversion gain is displayed in Fig. 4 (a)  while th
 e noise figure for both single side and double side bands is shown in Fig. 4 (b). The corresponding IIP2 and IIP3 are found to be 36 dBm and 1.5 dBm, respectively (Fig. 5).  The co-simulation layout is illustrated in
