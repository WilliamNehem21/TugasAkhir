The speed difference between high-performance CPUs and energy-efficient CPUs, which are found in asymmet-
ric performance multicore processors, affects the current form of Amdahl’s law equation. This paper proposes
two updates to that equation based on the performance evaluation results of a simple parallel pi program
written with OpenCilk. Performance evaluation was done by measuring execution time and instructions per
cycle (IPC). The performance evaluation of the parallel program executed on the Intel Core i5 1240P processor
did not indicate decreased performance due to asymmetric performance. Instead, the program with efficient
work-stealing advantages from OpenCilk performed well. In the case of using the execution time of the P-CPU
as a reference to obtain speedup, the evaluation results in a sublinear speedup. Conversely, in the case of using
the execution time of the E-CPU as a reference, the evaluation results in a superlinear speedup. This paper
proposes two updates to Amdahl’s law equation based on these two evaluation results.
1. Introduction
Since 2021, Intel has introduced two generation of asymmetric
performance multicore processors. The architecture is similar to the
Little-Big architecture [ 1]. Asymmetric performance multicore proces-
sors integrate two different types of core processors. The first type is
high-performance cores (P-Cores), designed to leverage single-threaded
performance by boosting their frequency clock. They are also capable
of hiding latency by simultaneous multithreading. The second type
is energy-efficient cores (E-Cores), designed to leverage performance
efficiency through multithreaded programming. Both E-Cores and P-
Cores share the same instruction set, so they can perform in parallel to
execute a multithreaded process.
The emersion of the Intel asymmetric performance multicore prod-
ucts will further enliven the use of AMPs architectures for broader
applications. For better application and the best practices in software
development, it is necessary to understand their performance behavior
well. For simple writing purposes in this paper, we rewrite the CPU of
P-Core as P-CPU and CPU of E-Core as E-CPU.
This paper discusses two issues related to the emergence of AMPs
architecture. The first issue is the implications of AMPs on Amdahl’s
law equation, and the related issue is the problem of unfair work
distribution in AMPs.
When it comes to AMPs, it is necessary to revisit the equation form
of Amdahl’s law [ 2]. The primary reason for this is that the equation,
as shown in Eq. (1), assumes that all 𝑁processors have the same
✩In this work we demonstrate performance of OpenCilk on the Single ISA Hybrid Multicore Architecture.

namely 𝑁and𝑓, which represent the number of processors and the
parallel fraction, respectively. However, with AMPs, there are dynamic
and static variations in CPU speed. Dynamic variations in CPU speed
refer to changes in the speed of CPUs caused by changes in their clock
frequency. These changes are temporal and occur on processors. This
cause is also known as dynamic voltage-frequency scaling. Static speed
variations refer to variations in speed among a number of 𝑁processors
spatially. Static speed variations occur on CPUs operated at different
clock rates and/or CPUs with different microarchitectures.

In the context of discussing AMPs, the speedup factor expresses the
ratio of speed between faster processors and slower processors. Even
though the idea of the speedup factor is nothing new, and regardless of
how we derive its value, it is appropriate and a novelty to incorporate
the speedup factor into the equation form of Amdahl’s law. specifically
how the speedup factor allows for sublinear and superlinear speedup
from the perspective of Amdahl’s law.
Amdahl’s law is a tool used to estimate the speedup of parallel
programs on parallel computers. However, the Amdahl’s law equation
makes certain assumptions that are not in line with the latest develop-
ments. Several related studies have attempted to extend Amdahl’s equa-
tions. The first work that extends Amdahl’s law and Gustafson’s law

simultaneously is presented in [3]. The result is the memory-bounded
speedup model.
The memory-bounded speedup in [4] can initially explain the phe-
nomenon of how superlinear speedup can occur in cases involving
problems with large sizes on a computer cluster. With a large problem
size, a single node may run slowly due to memory limitations. By
adding a number of nodes, the program speed per node becomes faster.
Memory-bounded speedup can also explain how superlinear speedup
can occur on symmetric multicore processors [5,6]. If the memory
capacity increases with the increase in the number of nodes on a
computer cluster, whereas in a symmetric multicore, the capacity of
cache memory increases with the increase in the number of CPU cores
used. From here, investigating whether compute-bounded workloads
can encounter superlinear speedup events is an interesting question to
investigate.
In [7] Hill and Marty proposed a performance model for Asym-
metric Multicore processors. In their proposal, they assumed the use
of processors with asymmetric multicore architecture, consisting of r
base equivalent cores and one powerful core with perf(r) capabilities.
In their extension, the authors proposed to accelerate the sequential
fraction with a powerful core, while the parallel fraction was acceler-
ated by some base cores. However, is it always useful for the fastest
CPU to execute serial fractions?
To enhance comprehension of the design of various types of many-
core processors, revised versions of Amdahl’s law model are presented
in [8]. These modifications are based on the performance model out-
lined in [7]. The revised model introduces a variable Sc, which repre-
sents the normalized performance of the efficient core relative to the
powerful core.
A re-evaluation of Amdahl’s law has also been conducted and pre-
sented in [9]. The paper assumes that all BCE resources are composed
of a number of powerful cores, resulting in a symmetric performance
multicore model. This assumption expects to enhance the performance
gain. The extension model is then built using these assumptions.
The normal form heterogeneity model is presented in [10]. It ap-
pears that the normal heterogeneity model can accurately model su-
perlinear speedups, but it may not be effective in modeling cases of
sublinear speedups. Sublinear speedups are bound to occur if the fastest
CPU is used for the serial execution, which serves as the baseline.
In general, the existing speedup law cannot accurately describe the
performance behavior of AMPs. Specifically to the AMPs, superlinear
speedup can occur if code that was previously executed by a slow
processor core is then enhanced by one or more faster processor cores.
Conversely, sublinear speedup can occur in cases where serial execution
time is obtained from serial execution using the fastest CPU. This
research gap is the basis for this research.
For the sake of simplicity, this paper will only discuss the static
variation of CPU speed among the CPUs of AMPs. The main analysis
is based on the asymmetric performance that statically exists among
the CPUs of AMPs.
Not only is there variation in speed in AMPs that undermines the
applicability of Amdahl’s law, but idleness is also not factored into
the equation, leading to deviations in speedup prediction. Moreover,
the difference in speed between P-CPUs and E-CPUs can lead to an
inequitable workload distribution. In the case of regular workloads with
static scheduling, P-CPUs may remain idle for longer periods compared
to E-CPUs, resulting in the execution time being bound by the slowest
CPU. Therefore, this paper proposes a sub-problem of unfair workload
distribution as an example case, which is addressed through work
stealing.
Several studies have attempted to address the issue of unfair work-
load distribution by ensuring that the P-CPUs obtain more workload
through static and dynamic scheduling. However, potential issues still
exist. Static scheduling requires adjustments to the task grain size for
different cases to achieve optimal performance, while dynamic fine-
grain task scheduling provides load balancing at the cost of additional
works [11].Although work-stealing has been proposed as a solution to overcome
the problem of unfair workload distribution in dynamic heterogeneous
distributed computers, shared memory work-stealing on AMPs has not
been investigated to the best of our knowledge. Distributed work-
stealing in distributed computers has different characteristics than
work-stealing in shared memory multicore architectures such as AMPs.
Specifically, work-stealing operations that use communication channels
contribute to overhead. On the other hand, there is no communication
for work-stealing on AMPs, which means that it does not contribute to
overhead. Therefore, investigating the performance of work-stealing on
AMPs is still an interesting topic to discuss.
To address the issue of unfair workload distribution among AMPs,
we utilize OpenCilk, which possesses work-stealing capabilities and
non-blocking multithreading. OpenCilk is an ideal choice for shared
memory system architectures like AMPs. It operates on lazy task cre-
ation and employs THE protocol, resulting in minimal overhead during
task creation and stealing. By utilizing work-stealing and non-blocking
multithreading, OpenCilk anticipate that faster processors will handle
a greater workload compared to slower processors. Consequently, we
expect to achieve superior load balance, utilization, and speedup of
AMPs.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
present some discussions on related works. Mainly we applied OpenCilk
and make comparisons on other papers. Section 3 is to discuss detailed
experimental works, tools and configurations. We present and discuss
our results in Section 4 and make some comparison with the results of
recent papers in Section 4. We conclude this work in Section 5.
2. Related works
The effects of asymmetric performance of a Multicore processor
were first studied in [12]. The study approximated asymmetric per-
formance by controlling the frequency of each core of Intel Xeon
multiprocessors. A similar idea was presented in [13], which simu-
lated asymmetric performance by controlling the frequency and ex-
perimented with X10 work-stealing. However, our work differs as we
applied OpenCilk to AMPs, which resulted in lower task creation and
steal overheads and different results. We also excluded the frequency
variation factor in one of our experiment scenarios by setting the
frequency of all CPUs to the same frequency of 2.57 GHz on real
asymmetric multicore CPUs. Additionally, we proposed two updates to
the equation form of Amdahl’s law based on our study.
The authors of [14] presented research on the performance evalu-
ation of heterogeneous multicore processors on multi-threaded work-
loads. In the paper, they demonstrated that heterogeneous multicore
is more efficient than homogeneous multicore when handling a multi-
threaded workload. The authors deduced efficiency from the weighted
speedup, which is calculated by dividing the total IPC of all running
threads by the total IPC of the single slowest core. In this case, the
authors conducted IPC measurements in a constant time window.
The authors of [15] presented a study on the obligatory nature of
AMPs for achieving the highest area or power efficiency. This research
suggests that heterogeneous multicore chips will be the most effi-
cient design to handle broad-type application workloads with varying
characteristics.
Attention has been drawn to the importance of workload fairness in
scheduling for single-ISA heterogeneous multicore processors in a study
presented in [16]. The study has demonstrated that equal-progress
scheduling enhances performance on multit-threaded workloads. As the
two types of cores on the AMPs have asymmetrical performance, a
similar effect to the load imbalance scenario will occur during barrier
synchronization. Equal-progress scheduling has served as an OS layer
load balancer between a high-performance and efficient core.
This work demonstrated a solution to the unfairness problem in
multi-threaded computations, which differs from [16]. Other authors
present research that also makes attention to fair scheduling in [17].Array 19 (2023) 100311

All the works mentioned above focused on the OS-level fairly
scheduling for the multi-programmed environment. However, our work
tested the fair work distribution among the E-CPUs and P-CPUs in a
multi-threaded program. Our point of view regarding fairness is that
we argue that the faster CPUs should endure more works of parallel
fraction than the slower ones as other works presented Speedup and
Power Scaling Models in [10] and AID in [18]. As authors indicated
in [19], unbalanced task distribution causes poor performance.
The OS-level mechanism ensures that each kernel-level thread re-
ceives a fair share of CPU time while working in the multiprocessing
domain. On the other hand, the user-level mechanism allows a mul-
tithreaded application to efficiently utilize multiple CPU/core time
and improve parallelism. To achieve this, programming for multicore
systems uses multithreaded programming with a one-to-one mapping
approach, where each user-level thread maps to a kernel-level thread.
However, if a user-level thread becomes idle (for instance, while wait-
ing for other threads due to load imbalance during computation),
the CPU time it receives is wasted. In this case, idle threads do not
contribute to the performance of multithreaded programs. Unfortu-
nately, the kernel does not support the management of user-level
threads [20]. Thus we need a user-level load-balancing mechanism such
as work-stealing for multithreaded applications on AMPs.
Even more so in the era of multicore and manycore, parallel pro-
grams tend to utilize fine-grain parallelism to take advantage of the
abundant parallelism of computing units. Fine-grain parallelism neces-
sitates minimizing scheduling costs, as it is well-known that thread
scheduling at the user task level is much lower than at the OS level.
From the perspective of a slower processor, an unfair distribution
of work can be considered as an excessive workload. In the context of
work stealing, there may be benefits for faster processors to prioritize
stealing tasks from slower processors. For this purpose, victim selec-
tions [21–23] can be applied. Combining victim selection and stealing
half or multiple items work stealing [24–26] may reduce the workload
of slow victims and decrease the overhead of the thief.
A heterogeneous asymmetric multicore chip has the potential to
offer more efficient performance than symmetric multicore, as pre-
sented by the authors in [7]. Although the authors wrote a retrospective
paper in [27] regarding their previous model, they made a relevant
recommendation that researchers should continue investigating this
asymmetric multicore chip, including dealing with scheduling and
overheads. Our work in this paper presents performance evaluation
results where we assigned threads to the efficient core CPUs first and
enhanced execution with the higher performance core.
Some of the papers we identified [7,28,29], based on Amdahl’s law,
suggest accelerating the critical path using the fastest CPU. Similar
ideas to assign the fastest CPU to the critical path tasks are presented
in [30,31].
Regarding our proposal to integrate the speedup factor into Am-
dahl’s law equation, there is a need to estimate the speedup factor.
Predicting this factor is a challenging task [32]; however, it is highly
useful in determining the required type and number of CPUs for AMPs.
In this work, we demonstrated that OpenCilk [33,34], which was
Cilk [35], overcame the problem of unfair work distribution as Open-
Cilk is capable of load-balancing by work-stealing [36]. When a worker
is out of a task from its ready queue, it selects another worker as the
victim and then steals a task from the victim’s ready queue. Not only
is the load-balancing capability the advantage of OpenCilk, but as the
available parallelism is significantly more than the number of proces-
sors [37], OpenCilk workers tend to run on the fast clone. Furthermore,
efficient reducer hyperobject implementation [38] features OpenCilk.
All these features result in many workers being busy with work, less
stealing operations, and finally, it has a low total overhead.
In this work, we also demonstrated that OpenCilk might perform
a superlinear speedup, in which case the parallel program pinned the
threads to E-CPUs first, and then P-CPUs give an assist. OpenCilk also
might perform a sub-linear speedup, in which case the parallel program
pinned the threads to the P-CPU first, and then E-CPUs give an assist.
For these cases, we proposed an update to Amdahl’s law equation.3. Material and experimental configuration
In our experiment, we collected performance data from the Intel
Core i5 1240P. The processor has four P-CPUs and two E-CPU clusters,
each cluster consisting of 4 cores. Both P-CPU clusters are implemented
with the Golden Cove microarchitecture, while the E-CPUs are im-
plemented with the Gracemont microarchitecture. Therefore, the Intel
Core i5 1240P is an asymmetric performance multicore processor.
Each of the P-CPU cores is equipped with 1280 KB of L2 cache
memory, while all cores in each E-CPU cluster share 2048 KB of L2
cache memory. At a higher level of the cache memory hierarchy, all
cores of both P-CPU and E-CPU share 12 MB of L3 cache memory. At
the lowest level of the cache memory hierarchy, each P-CPU gets 48 KB
L1 for data and 32 KB L1 for instructions. As for the E-CPU clusters,
each of them gets 64 KB L1 for instructions and 32 KB L1 for data.
P-CPUs are capable of two-ways simultaneously multithreading,
while E-CPUs do not. Therefore, the processor provides a total of 16
logical CPUs. As shown in Table 1, P-CPUs are numbered from 0 to 7,
while E-CPUs are numbered from 8 to 15. P-CPUs have a maximum
clock speed of 4.4 GHz, while E-CPUs have a maximum clock speed of
3.3 GHz.
3.1. Experimental scenarios and configuration
In this work, experiments were conducted in a number of scenarios.
The scenarios indicate the order of adding CPUs in such a way as to see
the difference in scalability between E-CPU first and P-CPU first. E-CPU
first means that threads occupy E-CPU first until none are left and then
P-CPU. Conversely, P-CPU first means that threads occupy P-CPU first
until none are left and then E-CPU. To achieve that goal, the benchmark
program utilized the Linux CPU affinity library [39] to determine which
CPU to use.
The first scenario involves executing the benchmark solely on the
physical performance cores while scaling up the number of threads to
the maximum number of available physical CPUs. In this scenario, the
P-CPUs operate in non-hyperthreading mode, and the CPU mask is set
to [0, 2, 4, 6].
The second scenario entails running the program on the E-CPUs
exclusively. For the efficient core only scenario, the CPU mask is set
to [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
The third scenario is the hybrid scenario, which involves executing
the program on both P-CPUs and E-CPUs. In this scenario, threads are
scheduled to the P-CPUs first before the E-CPUs, and the CPU mask is
set to [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
In the fourth scenario, called SMT, all threads alternate between
populating the physical and logical P-CPUs. The CPU mask is set to [0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The fifth scenario is similar to the fourth, but it
assigns threads to the physical CPU first before its logical pair. In this
scenario, the CPU mask is set to [0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]. The sixth scenario is
the hybrid SMT, which is similar to the hybrid scenario, but all threads
are assigned to all P-CPUs first before E-CPUs. In this scenario, P-CPUs
work in hyperthreading mode. The last scenario is the hybrid SMT
physical first scenario, which utilizes both physical P-CPUs and E-CPUs
before remaining logical P-CPUs. Table 2 summarizes all the scenarios.
In our execution platform, the ID number from 0–7 identifies all P-
CPUs, and the ID number starts from 8 to 15 and identifies all E-CPUs.
To determine which CPU program schedules threads, this experiment
uses the Linux thread affinity library (sched.h). To factor out the effect
of clock-speed variation on performance in some other experiments, we
set all CPUs to a clock frequency of 2.57 GHz.Array 19 (2023) 100311

3.2. Benchmark software
Regarding the benchmark software, we have written an OpenCilk
implementation for numerical integration to estimate the value of pi.
The program is highly parallel, and therefore, we can assume that the
parallel fraction f is equal to 1. The numerical integration method
used is the rectangle rule with a problem size of 2 billion iterations.
Table 3 provides a summary of the software environment setup for this
evaluation.
Creating a parallel version of a serial program using OpenCilk is
easy. Creating a parallel program with OpenCilk only requires adding
the necessary keywords. The basic keyword, Cilk_spawn, is the first
keyword to be used. This keyword can be used for both regular and
irregular parallelism. An example of regular parallelism is Fibonacci
recursion, while an example of irregular parallelism is a program to
solve the n queen problem.
One can use the keyword ‘‘cilk_spawn’’ to create a child parallel
task that can run in parallel with its parent task. Then, ‘‘cilk_sync’’
can be used to make the parent task wait for all child tasks to com-
plete. Additionally, one can use the keyword ‘‘cilk_scope’’ to define a
structured block of codes that contains a number of parallelized tasks.
‘‘Cilk_spawn’’ can be nested within a serial loop to create multiple
parallel tasks. If the number of iterations can be predetermined, as is
typical in a ‘‘for’’ loop construct, it is highly recommended to transform
the loop using the divide and conquer method.
For regular cases of parallelism, such as parallel loops, one can use
the keyword ‘‘cilk_for’’. ‘‘cilk_for’’ applies a recursive divide and con-
quer algorithm. In this study, the parallel pi program is implemented
using the cilk_for keyword. To overcome the race condition problem
that arises in read–modify–write operations on shared variables in
parallel, a reducer hyperobject is used.
The serial program implementation includes a parameter to choose
the CPU on which to schedule, while the OpenCilk implementation of
the parallel program includes a parameter that the program requires to
pick off an operating mode, as described in Section 3.1. The programTable 4

also has the second parameter to specify the number of threads involved
in execution. The mode option determines the CPU mask and indirectly
determines the order of the assigned CPUs when the program increases
the number of threads. For example, two options, which select the CPU
mask [8:15,0,2,4,6] and nine threads, will make eight threads occupy
E-CPUs first and then one thread occupy a P-CPU. Then increasing the
number of threads to ten will make eight threads occupy E-CPUs first,
and two threads occupy two P-CPUs with ID 0 and 2. In addition, our
experiments collect performance data repeatedly with Python script.
Python script also sets an environment variable CILK_NWORKERS.
4. Results and discussion
The results presented in Fig. 1 and Table 4 indicate that the P-CPU
to E-CPU speedup ratio is greater than their clock speed ratio. ThisArray 19 (2023) 100311

suggests that the superior microarchitecture of P-CPUs has contributed
to better performance. Even when we reduced the clock speed to
match that of E-CPUs, P-CPU still resulted in better execution time.
At the same frequency of 2.57 GHz, P-CPU is twice as fast as E-CPUs.
Therefore, we can take the P-CPU to E-CPU speedup factor, denoted as
𝑠𝑓, to be 2.
The performance evaluation results in Fig. 2 show the execution
time of various configurations. ‘‘Cilk_perf_core’’ indicates the execution
time using a number of physical CPUs (P-CPUs). ‘‘Cilk_efficient_core’’
indicates the execution time using a number of efficient CPUs (E-CPUs).
‘‘Cilk_hybrid _mode’’ indicates the execution time using a combination
of P-CPUs and E-CPUs. ‘‘Cilk_smt_mode’’ indicates the execution time
using a number of P-CPUs with simultaneous multithreading capability.
‘‘Cilk_smt_pf’’ indicates the execution time using a physical P-CPU and a
number of threads from the same core (SMT mode). ‘‘Cilk_hybrid_smt’’
indicates the execution time using all available threads from P-CPUs
(SMT) and enhanced by a number of cores from E-CPUs.
Fig. 2 presents the results of the performance evaluation. The figure
demonstrates that P-CPU performs faster than E-CPU. Interestingly,
the time of pinning eight threads on E-CPUs was almost comparableto pinning four workers on P-CPUs. The hybrid mode, which utilizes
both P-CPUs and E-CPUs, slightly improved performance in asymmetric
performance scenarios. However, due to a slowdown in clock speed,
performance did not scale linearly when the number of workers ex-
ceeded two. Execution time increased slightly when the number of
workers equaled 12. This increase was not caused by critical path over-
head but rather by increased temperature in the CPUs after continuous
use. In the simultaneous multithreading mode (annotated with an SMT
label), using more than two threads on the same core did not improve
performance.
Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling is widely used to balance
performance needs and power consumption. The operating point of
the voltage and frequency core is known as the p-state. The lower
the p-state, the higher the frequency and voltage, and vice versa.
Depending on the workload, software, hardware, or a combination of
both can select the most appropriate p-state. A limited number of cores
can operate at the lower p-state, as long as they remain within the
permissible operating limits such as the number of active cores, power
consumption, and temperature. If the requirements for the number of
active cores or temperature are no longer met, the active governor
chooses to use a higher p-state. Therefore, a single-threaded program
can run at a lower p-state than a multithreaded program. In this case,
the change in the p-state from low to high when scaling the number of
CPUs affects the speedup measurement.
Table 5 shows working frequencies and parallel execution times,
which provide evidence of decreased clock frequency while the CPUs
ran in multithreading and power-saving mode as we increased the
number of workers.
In this paragraph, we will discuss and analyze the performance
scalability generated by using the cilkscale tool [ 40]. Cilkscale firstArray 19 (2023) 100311

executes both serial and parallel programs, and then performs met-
ric measurements such as serial execution time ( 𝑇1) and Span ( 𝑇∞).
Parallelism is calculated by dividing 𝑇1by𝑇∞. In some of the figures
presenting scalability visualizations, the parallelism horizon line may
not be visible if its value falls beyond the y-axis [ 41].
Fig. 3 presents the scalability analysis of scenario 3 on AMPs.
Until the number of threads equaled two on two P-CPUs, the speedup
indicated linear scalability. However, scaling the number of CPUs with
more than two P-CPUs resulted in a deceleration of speedup due to
slowdowns in clock frequency. Further scaling of the number of CPUs
to more than four CPUs switched to the asymmetric performance mode.
The scalability in the asymmetric performance mode was sublinear due
to the performance gap compared to the P-CPU as its reference. This
phenomenon is clearly observed when we alternate both the P-CPUs
and E-CPUs, as shown in Fig. 4. However, alternating P-CPUs and E-
CPUs did not scale performance linearly after the number of workers
equals or greater than 2.
According to the work law [ 42], the execution time Tp on P proces-
sors has a lower bound of as in Eq. (2):
𝑇𝑃≥𝑇1
𝑃(2)
However, in the case of the AMPs, which may provide at least two
versions of 𝑇1, there will be at least two versions of 𝑇𝑃. The value of 𝑇𝑝
depends on the clock speed, the number of CPUs P, and the 𝑇1used as
its sequential execution time of reference. Moreover, clock speed can
decrease with the increase in the number of processors.
To simplify the problem, this paper eliminates the clock speed
factor. Thus, our problem is confined to the static variation of speed
among the P processors. Let us observe the performance of the same
program at a lower clock speed and P-CPU as a base point, as shown
in Fig. 5. Eq. (2) still holds as the CPUs had symmetric performance. In
Fig. 5,𝑇1equals 3.449, which differs from 𝑇1in Fig. 3. In Fig. 5, there
was no slowdown in clock speed, and it scaled the performance of P-
CPU linearly. As the experiments enhanced the number of CPUs that
switched to the asymmetric mode, speedup rate indicated a sublinear
due to the lower speed of E-CPUs. Thus, for the AMPs, we rewrite
Eq. (2) as Eq. (3), where P is the number of P-CPUs and E is the number
of E-CPUs. The constant of 𝑠𝑓is due to our experiment, which showed
that E-CPUs are empirically slower, with 𝑠𝑓times folds than the P-CPU.
𝑇𝑃≥𝑠𝑓×𝑇1
𝑠𝑓×𝑃+𝐸(3)
By alternating between the P-CPUs and E-CPUs and operating them
at a clock frequency of 2.57 GHz, a similar pattern was observed
as shown in the previous figure ( Fig. 6). Eq. (4) expresses the total
speedup, including a serial fraction. In the equation for the totalspeedup, 𝑠𝑓represents a speedup factor that only enhances the parallel
fraction and not the serial fraction for the scenario discussed.
𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑝 (𝑓, 𝑃, 𝐸, 𝑠𝑓 ) =1
1 −𝑓+𝑠𝑓×𝑓
𝑠𝑓×𝑃+𝐸(4)
In the best practices for evaluating performance scalability, it is ap-
propriate to derive speedup based on the fastest execution time of
the sequential version of the same solution. In cases of asymmetric
performance with multicore processors, the shortest execution time
is obtained from the execution run of the fastest CPU, i.e., P-CPU.
However, what if we evaluate scalability starting with the slower CPU
(E-CPU)? This paper argues that using 𝑇1from E-CPU as the reference
is appropriate. This approach makes sense and is precise as long as the
performance evaluation is still based on the same optimized code.
Fig. 7 presents the scalability of the asymmetric performance mode,
starting with the use of E-CPUs before scaling up with the P-CPUs.
All CPUs were set back to their default high clock speed. As P-CPUs
were faster than E-CPUs by a factor of 𝑠𝑓, each additional P-CPU
increased the speedup by 𝑠𝑓. Since E-CPUs scaled performance linearly,
additional P-CPUs contributed to a superlinear speedup.
Setting the clock frequency at a lower rate (2.57 GHz) causes both
work ( 𝑇1) and span ( 𝑇∞) to increase, as shown in Fig. 8. In this
case, parallelism remained sufficient, resulting in linear speedup of the
performance of E-CPUs. Enhancing the execution with extra P-CPUs
resulted in superlinear speedup, as predicted by Eq. (5). Now, 𝑇𝑃can
be predicted using Eq. (5), where 𝑇1is the work of E-CPUs. As long as
parallelism is sufficient, the critical-path overhead is small enough to
contribute to 𝑇𝑃.
𝑇𝑃≥𝑇1
𝑠𝑓×𝑃+𝐸(5)
𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑝 (𝑓, 𝑃, 𝐸, 𝑠𝑓 ) =1
1−𝑓
𝑠𝑓+𝑓
𝑠𝑓×𝑃+𝐸(6)
If we assign one P-CPU to the serial fraction and assign the E-
CPUs first to the parallel fraction before the P-CPUs, we obtain a total
speedup according to Amdahl’s law, as shown in Eq. (6). The term
𝑠𝑓represents the speedup factor that indicates the relative speed of
the P-CPUs to the E-CPUs. This paper presents evidence that efficient
work-stealing techniques can overcome the problem of unfair load
distribution on AMPs. The evidence shows that faster processors do
not lose performance even in asymmetrical mode. Table 6 shows that
the P-CPUs did not experience a nominal decrease in IPC when P-CPU
and E-CPU cooperated in asymmetric mode. Except for CPU 11, E-CPUs
also did not experience nominal changes in IPC. Work-stealing appears
to keep the P-CPUs’ nominal IPC the same as when they executed the
same program without the E-CPUs.Array 19 (2023) 100311

Table 7 presents some comparison between recent related papers
and the proposed method. The contribution of this paper is two up-
dates of Amdahl’s equation and the interpretations. The first equation
suggests that the performance of multithreaded programs can lead to
sublinear speedups, which is supported by our experimental results.
Using 4 P-CPUs and 8 E-CPUs, we obtained a sublinear speedup of
6–7.5 times. The second equation suggests that the performance of
multithreaded programs can lead to superlinear speedups, which is also
supported by our experimental results. Using 8 E-CPUs and 4 P-CPUs,
we obtained a superlinear speedup of 15 times.Our works provide evidence that work-stealing strategy performs
well on AMPs. We propose to apply work-stealing to solve the problem
of asymmetric performance. If work stealing were unable to overcome
the problem, then applied work stealing should result in the P-Cores
being more idle and experiencing a decrease in the nominal IPC value
when operating in asymmetric mode rather than operating exclusively.
However, this is not the case, as the evidence suggests otherwise. To
state it more clearly, we found that there is no performance loss due
to asymmetric performance on the Intel Core i5 1240P, and there is no
decrease in nominal IPC on the P-Cores.Array 19 (2023) 100311

A recent paper presented some results of performance evaluation
on flexible-AID [43]. The results show that the flexi-AID shows com-
parable performance on most cases presented and only shows sig-
nificant improvement on three cases. In the study, the authors com-
pared normalized performance of flexible-AID to the SB’s normalized
performance.
In our study, we have found that the speedup factor is approxi-
mately 2. This finding can be confirmed by dividing the nominal IPC
value of the P-Core by the nominal IPC of the E-Core in Table 6.
Moreover, a recent paper on evaluating Intel Thread Director [32] has
also reported an estimated speedup factor of 1.97.
5. Conclusion
Amdahl’s Law is still relevant. What we need to do is to consider the
number of processors along with their speedup factor, and incorporate
them into the Amdahl’s Law equation. This will result in a suitable
extension model for the environment of asymmetric performance mul-
ticore processors, where the values of P and E are combined into an
appropriate number of processors.
We evaluated an example of an asymmetric multicore processor by
using a compute-intensive parallel program written in the OpenCilk
language. Our findings indicate that the OpenCilk parallel program for
rectangle integration performs well on the Core i5-1240P. Furthermore,
we observed no decrease in IPC’s nominal value in the faster CPUs, in-
dicating that OpenCilk effectively resolves the asymmetric performance
problem in shared memory multicore processors.
When we assign the P-CPUs first, there is a small slowdown in the
speedup. However, the slowdown is due to the drop in clock frequency
as we increase the number of P-CPUs for the program. When we stay
with the same scenario and increase the number of CPUs with the E-
CPUs, the speedup rate reduces by a factor of 0.5. This is because we use
the performance of the P-CPU as a base point, whereas the performance
of the E-CPU is two times slower than the P-CPU. On the contrary, when
we assign the E-CPU first before the P-CPU, the program performance
exhibits a linear speedup. By scaling up the program execution with
the P-CPUs, the performance evaluation shows a superlinear speedup.Even though the two cases show different speedups, in the end, both
cases have the same performance when they use the same total number
of P-CPUs and E-CPUs, which equals 12.
