The degradation and desertiﬁcation of grasslands pose a daunting challenge to China's arid and semiarid areasowing to the increasing demand for them in light of the rise of animal husbandry. Monitoring grasslands by usingbig data has emerged as a popular area of research in recent years. As grassland degradation is a slow and gradualprocess, the accurate identiﬁcation of grassland cover is key to monitoring it. Vegetation coverage is currentlymonitored mainly by combining inversion-based methods with ﬁeld surveys, which requires signiﬁcant human effort and other resources and is thus unsuitable for use at a large scale. We proposed to use time series from theenhanced vegetation index (EVI) in capsule network-based methods to identify grasslands. The process classi ﬁed grassland coverage into four levels, high, medium, low, and other, based on Landsat images from 2019. Theaccuracy in classifying the grasslands at each level was higher than 90%, with an overall accuracy of 96.32% anda kappa coefﬁcient of 0.9508. The proposed method outperformed the SVM, RF, and LSTM algorithms in terms ofclassiﬁcation accuracy.
1. IntroductionThe grassland is the largest terrestrial ecosystem in China, coveringmore than 40% of the country's territory. About 78% of this grassland islocated in arid and semiarid regions ( Ren et al., 2016), and it plays a critical role in facilitating animal husbandry and environmental conser-vation (Akiyama and Kawamura, 2007). Grassland degradation has been a worldwide issue in recent decades, and about 90% of the entire useablegrassland in China has degraded to varying extents ( Nan, 2005). The degraded area in China accounted for 22.7% of the total area of grasslandfrom 1982 to 2010 (Zhou et al., 2017).To quickly and accurately monitor the degradation in grassland, oneuses the critical proxy of vegetation coverage to estimate essential pa-rameters and functions of the ecosystem through remote sensing ( Lehnert et al., 2015). Two approaches are widely used with satellite remotesensing datasets: spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and empirical models(Ge et al., 2018). The former decomposes each pixel in an image into alinear component of the reference spectrum, referred to as an endmem-ber (Jiapaer et al., 2011). The model of pixel dichotomy is a simpli ﬁed linear SMA to simulate vegetation cover rapidly. Empirical modelsrepresent the relationship between remote sensing data and data fromﬁeld surveys. The remote sensing data of a band or a combination ofbands have been used. Van et al. (2008) used Landsat ETM þdata to estimate urban vegetation cover. They obtained accurate values for theregression of vegetation coverage as well as bands 2, 3, 5, and 7 of remotesensing images. Remote sensing data can also be converted into vegeta-tion indices (Patel et al., 2007;North, 2002;Rundquist, 2002).Kergoat et al. (2015)showed that the ratio of the 1.6
μm and 2.1 μm bands ac- quired with a ground radiometer was well suited for retrieving thefraction of vegetation cover in cropﬁelds, fallows, and grasslands.Compared with empirical models, the output of the SMA can be lessaccurate (Liu et al., 2014). Therefore,Duan et al. (2019)integrated the vegetation index (VI) and a large amount of information from the SMA toimprove the estimation accuracy of rice yields. The results showed thatthis method could better predict the yields than the VI alone. However, tofurther improve accuracy, empirical models require many samples fromﬁeld surveys and thus are unsuitable for use at a large scale. Methodsbased on machine learning (Lehnert et al., 2015;Goetz et al., 2003) and artiﬁcial neural networks (Xie et al., 2009) can be alternatives. Machine learning can be more accurate than the traditional regres-sion model. However, their accuracy is affected by the modes of deter-mining the required parameters and the choice of training samples(Huang et al., 2008).Ge et al. (2019)developed a gradient regression lifting-tree algorithm using hyperspectral image data acquired during

They used it to establish a model to estimate soil moisture contentbased on geographically weighted regression. This model has a highinversion accuracy.Due to their impressive feature extraction and expression capabilities,deep learning algorithms are commonly employed to monitor changes invegetation based on remote sensing images ( Dinh et al., 2018). Marc et al. (2017) used a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to classifycrops coupled with a time series of satellite images. The results showedthat it was more accurate for crop classiﬁcation than the convolutional neural network (CNN) and supper vector machine (SVM) algorithms.Han et al. (2015)proposed a framework to detect geospatial objects bycombining a weakly supervised learning (WSL) approach with advancedfeature learning. The experimental results with three optical datasets inbenchmark tests veriﬁed its effectiveness compared with severalstate-of-the-art methods for object detection. Pan et al. (2018)proposed a multi-granularity scanning method, using the spectral relationship be-tween different bands and the spatial correlation among adjacent pixels.In the context of a limited number of samples, they used asemi-supervised method to generate a convolution kernel. The techniquewas superior to some of the most advanced hue, saturation, and intensity(HSI) classiﬁcation approaches on small datasets.Although the deep learning approach generally has a higher accuracyof change assessment, it requires many samples for training. The capsulenetwork method, a deep learning method proposed by a team led byGeoffrey Hinton (Sabour S. et al., 2017), originated in the context of the loss of location information in a neural network ( Lecun et al., 1998). It overcomes the shortcoming of CNN algorithms whereby they are notsensitive to location information by adjusting their structure. Themechanism of the reception and identiﬁcation of visual information by the human eye forms the archetype for the capsule network. The brainparses a hierarchical representation of the visual scene and matches thelearned patterns with relationships stored by it ( Sara G et al., 2019). Compared with other deep learning methods, it has a signi ﬁcant advantage in accurately identifying targets using a small amount of data.We used the capsule network method with a one-dimensional (1-D)convolution as the feature extraction layer to adequately extract featuresfrom time-series data.One of the difﬁculties in monitoring grassland coverage throughremote sensing is cloud cover and human-related factors. We used thetime series of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to eliminate the cloudeffects in a given remote sensing image. The EVI re ﬂects vegetation growth and reduces interference by soil as background ( Huete et al., 2002). It solves the problem whereby the normalized difference vege-tation index (NDVI) is quickly saturated in high vegetation coverage andis easily affected by soil in low vegetation coverage ( Wang et al., 2006). In addition, the EVI can compensate for the absorption of red light byresidual aerosols (Rocha et al., 2009). Seasonal trend analysis (STA) wasperformed using an enhanced monthly EVI time series from 2005 to 2016that was edited from MOD13Q1 products (MODIS Terra, https://lads web.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov) used to detect changes in mangrovecover in Sinaloa state of northwestern Mexico ( Berlanga-Robles and Ruiz-Luna, 2020). Despite the coarse resolution, the MODIS EVI productshelped distinguish short- and long-term changes in mangrove cover,particularly in large ecosystems.2. Materials and methods2.1. Study areaThe study area (latitude 43
/C14340–43/C14530N, longitude 82/C14500–83/C14550E), located in the middle reaches of Kashi River, is part of Nileke County inXinjiang, China. Xinjiang has the third largest area of grassland and oneof theﬁve largest pastoral areas in China ( Zhang et al., 2013). The grassland guarantees animal husbandry and provides the last line ofdefense against desertiﬁcation in the region.The sites selected (Fig. 1) have a temperate and semiarid continentalclimate with an average annual temperature of 5.6
/C14C(Yi et al., 2006). Precipitation is plentiful but unevenly distributed in the region, with

27more in the eastern than western parts and more in the mountain thanplain. Snow accumulates for 20–160 days every year, with a 40–50 cm thickness, and a maximum thickness can be around 90 cm on average inthe early spring. Snowfall accounts for about one-third of the precipita-tion. The average annual evaporation is 1471.6 mm, increasing fromwest to east. The mild climate and sufﬁcient waterﬂow created abundant grassland.Land use in the study area is dominated by grass land, accounting for87.51% of the county's total area, followed by other land types accountingfor 11.01%, and developed areas accounting for only 1.47%. The studyarea is a pastoral area with grassland and forest land dominance.2.2. DataGrassland in the study area grows from late April to late September.We downloaded 14 Landsat datasets from May to the end of September2019, including Landsat-8 OLI and Landsat-7 ETM þdatasets (Table 1). Sample data for classiﬁcation were obtained from Landsat-8 OLI onAugust 11, 2019. The Landsat data were subjected to calibration andatmospheric correction using the fast line-of-sight atmospheric analysisof hypercubes (FLAASH) algorithm ( Cooley et al., 2002). The algorithm is widely used for atmospheric correction owing to its high calibrationaccuracy and easy operation.Two Chinese GF-1 (Table 1) optical images (Panchromatic band)were used for visual interpretation. Aﬁeld study was conducted in July 2019 to verify the visual interpretation accuracy.Table 1Main parameters of Landsat and GF-1 datasets.

28Thirty-one samples were collected around the center of the study siteby using a global positioning system (GPS) unit and a tape measure. Overa selected sample area (30 m/C230 m), we recorded the range of grasslandcoverage by visual estimation, which was fast and adequate for ourpurposes (Fig. 2). In total, were recorded eleven high-, nine medium-,and four low-coverage grasslands, four areas of bare land, and three typesof other land covers.2.3. Methods2.3.1. Improved capsule network algorithmA capsule network is composed of convolutional, capsule, andreconstruction layers. It removes the original pooling layer of the CNNthat causes the loss of location information. The capsule network usesconvolutional layers to extract features, and the capsule layers areresponsible for learning the features. The reconstruction layer regularizesthe capsule network to prevent overﬁtting. The network has a different routing algorithm from that of a typical neural network. The routingalgorithm determines data transmission between the capsule layers andthe safety of all information and eliminates the defects of the CNN (SaraGe et al., 2019). Three relevant parameters here are the similarity mea-sure (b), coupling coefﬁcient (c), and weight matrix (W).iandjare capsules in the current and subsequent capsule layers, respectively, andare associated with the routing algorithm.

More similar capsules can helpderive more information from the lower capsule layer that can be used toidentify minor differences robustly.It should be noted that the described capsule network is designed fordata with multiple dimensions. According to the above characteristics ofthe capsule network, we propose a pixel-oriented approach to classi ﬁca- tion toﬁt the 1-D EVI data to extract features from the time series data. Wechange the feature extraction layer to a 1-D convolution layer, and the ﬁnal model is composed of two convolutional layers, two capsule layers, andtwo reconstruction layers.

Model settings2.3.2.1. Selecting the samples.To ensure accurate and efﬁcient moni- toring of grasslands at a large scale, we propose a method to classifygrassland coverage into four levels according to China's system to classifyland use and land cover (LULC) types based on remote sensing moni-toring data (National Standard of the People's Republic of China, 2017 ). The four classes were: high-coverage grassland ( /C2150%), medium-coverage grassland (20%–50%), low-coverage grassland (5%– 20%), and bare land (/C205%). Because other types of cover, includingbarren, water, and developed areas, occupied a small space in the studyarea, we eventually used the four grassland classes and others. Werandomly selected representative samples and divided them into atraining set and a test set with a ratio of 4:1 based on experience(Table 2).2.3.2.2.

1¼6,C 2¼7.5, andG(gain factor)¼2.5 (Merchant, 2000).A total of 14 Landsat images (Table 1) were used. The cloud covers were less than 7% inﬁve images, 10%–20% in four, 35%-50%was in two, and higher than 50% in two. The Landsat-7 ETM þimages had an additional gap of about 15% due to the failure of the scan line corrector.Areas with cloud cover were mainly distributed in mountainous areasand affected the identiﬁcation of low-coverage grassland and bare land.To eliminate their effects in the EVI time series, we used the quality bandof the remote sensing images to identify pixels representing cloud cover.These pixels and gap pixels were linearly interpolated using the nearestvalid values before or after the time step ( Zhong et al., 2019). The result is shown inFig. 4. Landsat-7 data were at intervals 1, 3,…, and 13, but Landsat-8 datasets at intervals 2, 4,…, and 14.The EVI time series were extracted from both Landsat 7 ETM þand Landsat 8 OLI ing images. Given that each Landsat 7 ETM þremote image had a gap of up to 15%, we constructed two EVI time series for thesake of comparison. We used the method mentioned in the previoussection for processing to obtain theﬁrst EVI time series. The second time series retained only the EVI of the corresponding Landsat 8 images in theﬁrst time series. We were able to eliminate the in ﬂuence of some clouds in the Landsat 8 remote sensing images. However, the disadvantage ofthe second EVI time series was that its interval was long, up to 16 days,whereas the interval of theﬁrst EVI time series was eight days. Wetrained two classiﬁers of the capsule network over 50 rounds using thesame parameter settings (Table 3).Table 2Numbers of training and testing samples for each class.

292.3.3. Algorithms for comparisonThe SVM algorithm canﬁnd an optimal hyperplane using structuralrisk minimization. It ensures that the distance between data samples onboth sides of the plane and the hyperplane is maximized ( Hoteling H et al., 1993).Burai et al. (2015)used the algorithm to identify 20 kinds ofalkaline grassland vegetation with an overall accuracy of classi ﬁcation of 82.60%. They found that the algorithm was not sensitive to the numberof training samples and was suitable for classi ﬁcation when the number of training samples is limited.The random forest (RF) model consist of decision trees. Each tree is aclassiﬁer, and the RF model integrates multiple decision trees. Theintegration of multiple classiﬁers improved accuracy (Verikas et al.,2011). Thes model has been applied to make spatial predictions offractional wood coverage in the Molopo area by training a random forestalgorithm with the forward feature variable selection. Spatialcross-validation revealed a prediction error of 12% ( Ludwig et al., 2019). The long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is a particularrecurrent neural network (RNN) (Zazo et al., 2016). It can eliminate unnecessary information, retain valuable information for prediction, andthus deal with long-term dependence. The LSTM NN is widely used intime series processing because its unique structure helps identify thecharacteristics of time series samples.3. Results3.1. Classiﬁcation of grassland coverage based on capsule networkWe used the improved capsule network to classify grassland coveragein the Kashi River basin in 2019 (Fig. 5). Areas with low, medium, and high grassland coverages are shown in the light, lime, and forest greencolors. Other land cover types are in black. The low-coverage grassland

30was mainly distributed in the western part of the study area, and themedium-coverage grassland in the mountains and the north. The vastmajority of high-coverage grassland was around on both sides of theriver.Table 4shows that the proposed method records a good extractionaccuracy on the four types of grassland coverage. It is 90% or higher foreach class, with an overall accuracy of 96.32%. The kappa coef ﬁcient was 0.9508. Except for its performance on the low-coverage grassland(92.2%), the proposed method had an accuracy higher than 95% inidentifying the other types of coverage. The accuracy in delineating thehigh-coverage grassland was the highest, at 98.45%.To compare the classiﬁcation accuracy of the proposed method withobservations of the samples, we combined the map of vegetationcoverage with that of the sampling points, obtaining an overall accuracyof 90.32% (Fig. 6). Of the 31 samples, the vegetation coverage of onlythree was inconsistent with the results of classi ﬁcation obtained by the capsule network.3.2. Effect of EVI time series on the accuracy of classi ﬁcationThe capsule network used the marginal loss as an indicator of theeffects of training. We used the same loss function in this study. Thecurves of the loss function (Fig. 7) of both classiﬁers show that the training yielded the best results.As shown inTable 5, the effect of classiﬁcation of classiﬁer I was generally better than that of classiﬁer II for all types of land, but espe-cially for other land cover types. Although the Landsat 7 data occupied arelatively large proportion, the EVI time series with a short intervalgenerated better results.Table 4Kappa coefﬁcients (%) of the capsule network approach.

31Values of the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation ofcloud cover in the EVI time series were 0.09%, 100%, 30.58%, and34.7%. To understand the impact of the proportion of cloud cover in theEVI time series on classiﬁcation, we analyzed the response relationship ofcloud cover with the ratio of incorrect classi ﬁcation (Table 6). The results showed no signiﬁcant impact (Landsat 7) on the classiﬁcation results. However, all 11 phases of the time series data affected were sporadic, andsix pixels were not representative of the study area. When three phases ofdata in the EVI time series were impacted, the error rate was close to zero.When more phases were affected, the error rate was between 1% and 5%.Thus, remote sensing images with less cloud cover were more suitable foridentifying vegetation cover.4. DiscussionTo verify the accuracy of the proposed capsule network in terms ofestimating grassland coverage, we conducted a comparative experiment(Table 7) involving the SVM, RF, and LSTM algorithms.Compared with the other three methods, the proposed methodimproved the extraction accuracy of four different coverage grasslands.The accuracy of grassland coverage monitoring and the overall accuracyand kappa coefﬁcient reached 96.32% and 95.08%. Although the accu-racy of extraction of the SVM algorithm for bare land was higher thanthat of the LSTM NN, its accuracy in identifying low-coverage grasslandwas only 78.65%. Its overall classiﬁcation accuracy was lower than thoseof the LSTM and RF methods. The RF algorithm had the highest classi-ﬁcation accuracy of the three compared methods, but its accuracy ofidentifying low-coverage grassland was less than 90%. While the LSTMNN is widely used for time series processing, it yielded less than 80%classiﬁcation accuracy. Only on high-coverage grassland did it performwell, with an accuracy of 98.75%. Its overall classi ﬁcation accuracy was only slightly higher than that of the SVM algorithm.To analyze the accuracy of the capsule network in extracting spatialinformation on grass coverage, we compared its results with those of theSVM, RF, and LSTM algorithms, as shown in Fig. 8. These four methods have no signiﬁcant differences in the other category but are mainly re-ﬂected in the classiﬁcation of grassland coverage. To compare the capsulenetwork approach and the three algorithms, we subtracted the resultingmap of the former from that of each of the latter. The consistency of theclassiﬁcation accuracy between the capsule network method and eachmethod is given inTable 8. The classiﬁcation results of the capsule network matched those of the SVM, RF, and LSTM algorithms at 84.66%,85.03%, and 84.49%, respectively. There were very few cases in whichthe results did not match. In most of them, the capsule network hadidentiﬁed a given area as high coverage, whereas the other networks hadclassed it as medium coverage or vice versa. This is because high-coverage and medium-coverage grasslands are challenging to distin-guish. Because of the complexity of samples considered and the inherentadvantages of the deep learning used in the capsule network, the pro-posed method was more accurate on all four coverage types than theother methods and thus had a higher overall accuracy. It was.Table 5Kappa coefﬁcients (%) of the capsule network approach with two EVI time series.

325. ConclusionsThis study proposed a quick and efﬁcient method to classify grassland coverage that can classify grasslands into four quantitative types: high,medium, low, and other. EVI time series data of the cycle of grass growthwere used to predict grassland coverage. We used the capsule network toclassify remote sensing images. The proposed method yielded an accu-racy of classiﬁcation higher than 90% on each grassland class, with anoverall accuracy of 96.32%. Its kappa coef ﬁcient was 0.9508. It also outperformed the SVM, RF, and LSTM algorithms in accuracy assessmentin the comparative analyses.Declaration of interestsThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in ﬂuence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the International Science and Technol-ogy Cooperation Project of Sichuan (2020YFH0067) and the ChinaAcademy of Sciences Strategic Leading Science and Technology Project(XDA20060303).References
