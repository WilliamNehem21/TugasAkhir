Graph embedding is an important representational technique that aims to maintain the structure of a graph
while learning low-dimensional representations of its vertices. Semantic relationships between vertices contain
essential information regarding the meaning of the represented graph. However, most graph embedding meth-
ods do not consider the semantic relationships during the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel
semantic graph embedding approach, called SemanticGraph2Vec. SemanticGraph2Vec learns mappings of
vertices into low-dimensional feature spaces that consider the most important semantic relationships between
graph vertices. The proposed approach extends and enhances prior work based on a set of random walks of
graph vertices by using semantic walks instead of random walks which provides more useful embeddings
for text graphs. A set of experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of SemanticGraph2Vec.
SemanticGraph2Vec is employed on a part-of-speech tagging task. Experimental results demonstrate that
SemanticGraph2Vec outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines methods in terms of precision and F1 score.
1. Introduction
A graph is a data structure that represent the relationships between
different types of objects. One of the core goals of graph-based al-
gorithms is to extract structural information from graphs, including
summary graph statistics and local graph neighborhood structures [ 1].
The goal of graph embedding is to learn graph mappings into low-
dimensional vector spaces in which the extracted features of vertices
can be learned with respect to actual graph structures. Therefore, each
vertex is represented as a vector.
A semantic graph is a network that represents the semantic rela-
tionships between different concepts [ 2]. Network vertices represent
concepts and network edges represent the semantic relationships be-
tween concepts. A text semantic graph is used to encode plain text
and represent its meaning in the form of a graph. An example of a
semantic network is WordNet [ 3], which contains lexical databases of
different natural languages, such as Arabic and English. In WordNet,
words are grouped into sets of synonyms called ‘‘synsets’’ that represent
the semantic relationships between synonyms.
Graph embedding has recently become an important and interesting
research topic [ 4]. Graph embedding aims to learn low-dimensional
representations of a graph or any of its components (e.g. vertices and
edges), while preserving the structure of the graph and any other
additional information, (e.g. vertex attributes). Such representations
are used for machine learning models and Natural Language Processing
(NLP) applications [ 5]. Many researchers have proposed graph embed-
ding algorithms as components of dimensional reduction techniques,

Embedding (LLE) [ 9], and Laplacian Eigenmaps [ 10]. Graph embed-
ding algorithms are used to calculate the similarity between pairwise
data points to construct similar graphs that can be embedded into a
new low-dimensional space.
Because graph embedding represents a graph as low-dimensional
vectors while maintaining the graph’s structural integrity, it differs
from graph representation learning. Graph representation learning, in
contrast, does not rely for low-dimensional representations [ 11]. For
instance, a vector representation of a graph’s vertex will have the same
number of dimensions as the input graph’s vertex count.
Graph embedding techniques can be categorized into three main
types [ 12]: factorization-based, random-walk-based, and deep-learning-
based techniques. Factorization-based techniques represent the connec-
tions between vertices in the form of a matrix and the matrix is factor-
ized to obtain a graph embedding. Factorization-based methods, such as
LLE and Laplacian Eigenmaps, cannot learn the structural equivalence
of a graph unless the corresponding information is explicitly included in
their objective functions. Factorization-based approaches are incapable
of learning specific functions, such as functions for describing network
connectivity. Additionally, they cannot learn structural equivalences
unless the corresponding information is explicitly included in their
objective functions.
Random-walk-based techniques employs random graph walks to
approximate various attributes in a graph, including node similarity

and centrality. A random walk from a vertex 𝑣𝑖, denoted as 𝑊𝑣𝑖,
consists of a set of vertices 𝑊1
𝑣𝑖,𝑊2
𝑣𝑖,…,𝑊𝑘
𝑣𝑖chosen randomly from
the neighbors of vertex 𝑣𝑘. A set of random walks is used to ex-
tract structural information from a graph. Random-walk-based methods
are useful in applications where graphs are only partially observed.
DeepWalk [13] and Node2Vec [14] are two examples of random-walk-
based techniques. The main advantage of Random-walk-based methods
is that they accommodate small changes in graph structures without
requiring global re-computation, and the learned model can be updated
with new random walks in the modified region of a graph. According
to Deng [15], deep learning is a branch of machine learning that
makes use of numerous levels of representation (layers) that comprise
information processing units (neurons). Deep learning offers improved
data representation, which can improve machine learning approaches.
Deep learning can be used to represent words in textual data and create
word embeddings that can be applied to various machine learning
algorithms. Instead of manually creating features, deep learning is used.
The process of handcrafting features takes a lot of time and is frequently
lacking. Deep learning, on the other hand, offers beneficial features
and numerous levels of representation that raise the effectiveness of
machine learning models. Deep autoencoders are used in deep learning
techniques to reduce dimensionality based on their ability to model
the nonlinear structures of data. SDNE [16] and DNGR [17] are two
models for deep learning graph embedding that use deep autoencoders
to generate embedding models that capture nonlinearity in graphs.
Deep-learning-based methods can learn combinations of community
and structural equivalences from a graph. The weights of an autoen-
coder can be used as a structural representation of a graph in deep
learning methods.
The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. The main
research objectives and contributions are outlined in Section 3. In Sec-
tion 2, the related work on graph embedding are briefly reviewed. Sec-
tion 4 describes the proposed model. Experimental results are discussed
in Section 5. The conclusions are summarized in Section 6.
2. Related work
Recently, eight different graph embedding approaches are used
in the literature works, namely: DeepWalk, LINE [18], GraRep [19],
Node2Vec, DNGR-Deep, Attributed Random Walk [20], DeepGL [21],
and MetaGraph2Vec [22].As illustrated in Table 1, random walks are the most common
technique used for graph embedding and unweighted graphs are the
most commonly targeted graph type in experiments. DeepWalk is the
first random walk approach developed for graph embedding, thus it
is considered as a baseline algorithm in many recent studies [26].
DeepWalk consists of two components: a random walk generator and
update process. Initially, parametrized number of random walks of a
predefined length are generated. Each random walk samples from the
neighbors of a visited vertex until the parametrized maximum length
of random walks is reached. In the update process, the SkipGram [27]
and hierarchical softmax [28] algorithms are used to update graph
representations. Many enhancements and customized versions of Deep-
walk are proposed in the literature works, such as LINE and Node2Vec.
LINE [18] preserves local and global graph structures by capturing
the first-order and second-order proximity of graph vertices. Grover
et al. [14] proposed Node2Vec, which learns the continuous features
of vertices. Node2Vec uses breadth-first sampling (BFS) and depth-first
sampling (DFS) to configure the process of generating of random walks
and reduce the number of random moves. GEMSEC, which was pro-
posed by Rozemberczki et al. [23], aims to maintain social communities
in social networks using a clustering machine learning approach. The
key concept of GEMSEC is the creation of social clusters based on social
properties, which are embedded and isolated from each other. Finally,
dyngraph2ven [25] is a deep learning model that learns the temporal
changes in a graph using a deep architecture composed of dense and
recurrent layers. Dyngraph2vec uses multiple nonlinear layers to learn
structural patterns in graphs and uses recurrent layers to learn temporal
changes in graphs.
Over the past years, most proposed graph learning models have
focused on preserving the structures of represented graphs, rather
than on maintaining the semantic relationships between vertices. Meta-
Graph2Vec is the first model considering semantic relationships be-
tween vertices during the learning process. For semantic graph embed-
ding, the MetaGraph2Vev model learns more informative embeddings
by capturing rich semantic relationships between different types of ver-
tices. It guides random walks in heterogeneous information networks to
encode the semantic relationships between different types of vertices
and generate heterogeneous walks through different types of vertices.
It should be noted that there are many different datasets used for
evaluating various methods and there is no common benchmark dataset
that can be used for comparison. This makes it difficult and ambiguous
to compare the proposed method to other methods. The majority ofArray 17 (2023) 100276
3W. Etaiwi and A. Awajan
researchers use Macro-F1 and Micro-F1 as evaluation measures to
evaluate their approaches and demonstrate improved results compared
to previous approaches and baseline algorithms [ 26]. This is a clear
indication that greater attention has been paid to this research area
in recent years. Additionally, most existing models have enhanced the
baseline algorithm (DeepWalk) in terms of how walks are generated.
For example, LINE uses the BFS algorithm to select steps from a target
graph, and node2vec uses both the BFS and DFS algorithms for the same
purpose.
In this paper, a semantic graph embedding model is proposed to
represent semantic graphs in a low-dimensional vector space. The
proposed model guides random walks based on the semantic relation-
ships between vertices. Semantic relationships are ordered according
to their priority, where high-priority relationships are more likely to
be included in generated paths. Therefore, the term ‘‘random’’ is no
longer used in the proposed model.
3. Research objectives and contributions
There have been very few studies on graph embedding that have
considered the semantic relationships between graph components
(e.g., vertices or subgraphs). Additionally, most semantic graph embed-
ding approaches focus on a specific application or specific type of graph
(e.g., MetaGraph2Vec [ 22], which focuses on heterogeneous graphs).
Therefore, the broad objective of our research is to develop a novel
semantic graph embedding model in which the semantic relationships
between words are considered during the walk generation process to
enhance various NLP tasks, such as textual entailment and Part-of-
Speech (POS) tagging. To summarize, the main contributions of this
research are:
•A novel semantic graph embedding model that considers the
semantic relationships between text components (words) called
SemanticGraph2Vev.
•Enhance the performance of the DeepWalk model in terms of
random walk generation process to achieve better results for NLP
tasks.
It is worth to mention that POS tagging is considered as a case study
to compare the performance and impact of baseline graph embedding
with that of SemanticGraph2Vec. Therefore, the experiments conducted
in the paper research do not seek to achieve the best POS tagging
performance.
4. SemanticGraph2Vec: Semantic graph embedding
The SemanticGraph2Vec model is proposed to preserve the semantic
relationships between graph vertices (documents, phrases, or words) in
a text graph. Semantic preservation in text graph embedding is a dif-
ficult task because semantic relationships vary based on text language
and are difficult to capture in some languages.
The SemanticGraph2Vec model has three main steps, As shown in
Fig. 1: Extract semantic relationships, generate semantic walks, and
learn vertex representations. The first step is to extract the semantic
relationships from the semantic graph that represents the original text,
and then to prioritize the semantic relationships. The second step
involves extracting a set of walks from the semantic graph taking into
consideration the semantic relation priorities. The final step is to learn
the vertices representation and produce the output vectors.
4.1. Extract semantic relationships
In SemanticGraph2Vec, provided the semantic graph that represents
the original text, semantic relationships are dynamically ranked by the
frequency. In order to rank the semantic relations, the semantic graph is
built on the basis of the dataset used, and the semantic relations are ex-
tracted and sorted according to their presence in the text. For example,
Fig. 1. SemanticGraph2Vec framework.
Fig. 2. Semantic graph.
the ‘‘subject’’ relationship has the lowest rank (highest priority) because
it is the most frequently appearing relationship in text. Appendix lists
semantic relationship ranks based on the semantic graph proposed by
Etaiwi and Awajan [ 29].
4.2. Generate semantic walks
In this subsection, the problem of semantic graph embedding is
formalized and some preliminary definitions are presented.
Definitions 1. A semantic graph 𝐺is defined as a directed graph 𝐺=
(𝑉 ,𝐸,𝑊 ), where 𝑉is a set of vertices (mainly representing concepts, words,
or sentences), 𝐸is a set of edges (where 𝐸 ⊆ 𝑉 ×𝑉), and 𝑊is a set of
semantic relationships, where ∀𝑤∈𝑊∶𝑤∈𝑆𝑅and𝑆𝑅is a set of
semantic relationships.
Examples 1. A semantic graph that represent ‘the boy ate an apple and an
orange‘ statement is illustrated in Fig.2. This graph consists of five vertices
and four semantic edges, where 𝑆𝑅is listed in Table A.4inAppendix .
Definitions 2. Given a semantic graph 𝐺, we define a semantic walk as
a sequence of vertices 𝑆= {𝑣1,𝑣2,…,𝑣𝐿}of length 𝐿, in which, For each
𝑣𝑖(1≤𝑖≤𝐿) in𝑆,𝑣𝑖∈𝑉and for each 𝑣𝑖(1< 𝑖≤𝐿) in𝑆, (𝑣𝑖−1,𝑣𝑖)
∈𝐸.
Examples 2. For the semantic graph 𝐺in Fig.2, a possible semantic walk
of length 𝐿= 3is𝑠= {𝑎𝑡𝑒,𝑎𝑛𝑑,𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 }.
Definitions 3. The semantic walk with the highest priority is the semantic
walk that has the minimum summation of its edges ranks, therefore, 𝑆=
{𝑣1,𝑣2,…,𝑣𝐿}is the semantic path with the highest priority when for each
𝑣𝑖(1≤𝑖≤𝐿) in𝑆, the rank of edge 𝑒(𝑣𝑖−1,𝑣𝑖)is the minimum rank among
all possible edges 𝑒1,𝑒2,…,𝑒𝑛, where 𝑒𝑛(𝑣𝑖−1,𝑣𝑛)and𝑒𝑛∈𝐸.
4.3. Learn vertex representations
The semantic walk generation process can explore semantic graphs
according to semantic priorities. For each vertex in the semantic graph,Array 17 (2023) 100276
4W. Etaiwi and A. Awajan
a set of semantic walks of length 𝐿is generated. The top- 𝑛semantic
walks with the lowest rank (highest priority) are selected during the
sampling process. The sum of all semantic relationship ranks present in
each semantic walk is calculated according to this selection procedure,
the semantic walks are then ordered based on their semantic rank,
and finally the most important semantic walks with the lowest ranks
are considered in the vertex learning process. Inspired by the skip-
gram model [30], a vertex representation is learned by optimizing
the semantic neighborhood objective using Stochastic Gradient Descent
with negative sampling [31] as per proposed by DeepWalk model.
5. Experiments and evaluation
The ability of SemanticGraph2Vec model to improve NLP tasks
that use graph embedding in their techniques was evaluated. In the
experiments, the POS tagging problem is used as a case study. The ex-
periments’ main purpose is to address other baseline graph embedding
models that are used for improving NLP tasks, rather than achieving
better POS tagging performance.
5.1. POS tagging: Case study
POS tagging is the process of tagging words in a given body of
text automatically based on their context, role, or relationships with
other words. Used tags (called the tag set) may include nouns, verbs,
adjectives, and adverbs. POS tagging is considered to be a classifi-
cation problem in which the output represents the targeted classes.
Additionally, POS tagging is a fundamental NLP task that is used in the
preprocessing phase of many NLP approaches, such as those proposed
in [32–34].
Examples 3. The statement ‘‘The boy plays football’’ is POS tagged
according to the Stanford POS tagger1as ‘‘The/DT boy/NN plays/VBZ
football/NN’’ where DT denotes a determiner, NN denotes a noun, and VBZ
denotes a verb (third-person singular present).
POS taggers can be classified into three main types [35,36]: rule-
based taggers, statistical taggers, and hybrid taggers. A set of predefined
rules is used for assigning POS tags to each word in a rule-based tagger.
In a statistical tagger, frequencies and probabilities are used to identify
the most appropriate tag for each word. Finally, in hybrid approaches,
a set of rules is applied based on various statistical calculations.
5.2. Dataset
To evaluate the ability of the proposed model to improve the task
of POS tagging, a custom dataset extracted from news articles was
used in the experiments. This dataset was compiled from an Arabic
news website called AlJazeera News.2It consists of more than 3500
words that were annotated with their corresponding POS tags using the
Farasa POS tagger [37]. Farasa is an open-source text-processing toolkit
that offers many Arabic text processing libraries for lemmatization,
POS tagging, dependency parsing, and name-entity recognition. The
Farasa results are chosen as the reference tag because they provided
high-quality POS tagging results with 98.1% accuracy [38].

5.3. Experiments
Experiments were performed to evaluate the ability of Semantic-
Graph2Vec to improve POS tagging tasks compare with other baseline
graph embedding models. The evaluation metrics considered were
precision, recall, and F-score. Precision is the proportion of correct
decisions made over the total number of decisions for a given class.
Recall refers to the fraction of correct decisions provided by the POS
tagger over the total number of POS tags for a given class. The eval-
uation process is a conditional decision-making process in which the
judgement of the proposed model is considered to be correct if and only
if it is compatible with the ground truth labels in the data collection.
Finally, the F-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
The sensitivity of the semantic walk length and total number of
semantic walks for each vertex was measured and analyzed in separate
experiments. Table 2 lists the accuracy results of applying the proposed
model to various parameters.
The sensitivity analysis focused on two parameters: the total number
of semantic walks for each vertex and the semantic walk length 𝐿.
The results of the experiments revealed that the greatest accuracy was
obtained when the walk length was 𝐿= 10 and the total number
of walks was 50. In the experiments, the impact of the proposed
SemanticGraph2Vec method was evaluated. The performance of the
proposed model was measured based on the average results of 20 runs,
which each divided the original dataset into a training dataset (70% of
the original dataset) and testing dataset (30% of the original dataset).
As indicated in the related work section (Section 2), none of the
approaches listed in Table 1 are proposed to handle semantic graphs.
As a result, the proposed model is compared with the baseline models
that researchers employ as a benchmark. The results are compared to
those of the main baseline graph embedding models, namely Deepwalk
and Node2Vec. Deepwalk is selected for comparison because it is the
first random-walk-based graph embedding model and it is used as a
baseline method to compare with (see Table 1). Furthermore, since the
proposed SemanticGraph2vec is a graph embedding model to represent
vertices, node2vec is selected for comparison because, according to
Goyal and Ferrara [12], it outperforms other graph embedding methods
on the task of vertex classification. Results for these models (shown
in Table 3) were obtained by applying them the same datasets as the
proposed model. Three separate evaluation measures are considered:
precision, recall and F-score. The results demonstrate that the proposed
model outperforms the baseline models on most of the assessment
metrics.
The performance of the proposed model depends on a variety of
factors, including the consistency of the input semantic graphs and the
values of the semantic walk parameters. Because SemanticGraph2Vec
considers the semantic relationships in input graphs, semantic walks
provide richer knowledge regarding the relationships between words
compared to the baseline models. This significant difference betweenArray 17 (2023) 100276

SemanticGraph2Vec and the baseline models explains the efficiency
improvement of NLP tasks. Additionally, DeepWalk can produce redun-
dant pathways that yield smaller distinct sample sizes, which can affect
the overall performance of the model.
6. Conclusion
In this paper, a semantic graph embedding model called Seman-
ticGraph2Vec is proposed. SemanticGraph2Vec considers the semantic
relationships in input semantic graphs during the process of generating
semantic walks. Semantic relationships are ranked according to their
frequency in the input text and the most commonly used semantic
relationships are assigned lower ranks (higher priority). The final se-
mantic walks consist of vertices with the highest cumulative priority of
semantic edges. The SemanticGraph2Vec model was evaluated based
on its ability to improve the task of POS tagging. The Arabic language
was considered as a case study in our experiments. Experimental results
demonstrated that SemanticGraph2Vev improves the efficiency of POS
tagging compared to two baseline models: DeepWalk and Node2Vec.
