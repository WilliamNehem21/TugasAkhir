Transformation techniques ABSTRACT  
Various transformation techniques are known for transforming continuous-time to discrete-time domains and 
vice-versa, among which only two techniques are used in application frequently. This paper attempts to access 
both the techniques presenting a suitable consequence of their sole importance. The assessment of these two 
techniques is made on the basis of computation of reduced order model of discrete-time interval systems. 
Approximate models obtained after the transformations lead to the same response, and the outcome in favor of 
one technique. As a conclusion, the appropriate transformation is mathematically preferred over another based 
on its simplicity and ease of computation. Examples illustrating the comparisons are accompanied. Eventually, 
the assessment demonstrated in this article would be helpful to the mathematicians, mathematics educators and 
researchers working in the area of model order reduction.   
1.Introduction 
Discretization is an important data processing task and includes 
many advantages as; it is less prone to variance in estimation from small 
fragmented data; amount of data under consideration is reduced as 
redundant data can be recognized and neglected; provides better per-
formance for the rule extraction. There are numerous ways of trans -
formation from continuous-time domain to discrete-time domain and 
vice-versa and can be accessed in Refs. [1–4]. But well-known and 
easily accessible are i) Eulers Forward differentiation method, ii) Eulers 
Backward differentiation method, iii) Zero Order Hold (ZOH) method, 
iv) Tustins method with frequency prewarping, or Bilinear trans -
formation, and v) Matched Pole-Zero mapping. All these transformations 
fall under frequency-domain. In addition, time-domain transformations 
are impulse-invariance and step-invariance methods. Each of the 
transformations has their own practical and theoretical importance with 
differences among each other, which when studied would be lengthy 
and exhaustive. At par, their individual study is out of scope for this 
article. However, an attempt to present an appropriate transformation 
techniques for its wide application to order reduction methodologies in 
discrete-time domain is made here. 
Till date, to the authors ’ knowledge, no discussion is available that 
specifies, which of the either transformation is more accurate or preferable for obtaining reduced order models. This sets the motive of 
the paper to attempt for a convincing difference between the two 
transformation methods based on their simplicity and ease of compu -
tation via order reduction of discrete-time interval systems. Moreover, 
this assessment of the frequently used transformation techniques would 
be helpful to the researchers who work on a higher order system for 
improvement of the system performance. Also, this paper does not 
provide any new outcome, but attempts to offer a firm justification, in a 
manner to directly aim which of the two transformation techniques is to 
be used. 
In this exploration, focus is on the two frequently used discretization 
techniques, which are different from the computation point of view. A 
brief about the outcome of the discussion made in this submission is 
presented in section 1 followed by a literature survey section 2, for the 
methodologies available for order reduction using different trans -
formation techniques. In section 3, the two transformation techniques 
chosen for realization or assessment in the presented illustration is re-
ported. Section 4 comprises the preliminaries required throughout the 
discussion to validate the statement of proof for the conclusion derived. 
This section is divided in two subsections a) reduction methodology 
used and b) the performance measure of the obtained results via two 
transformations. Section 5 aim to present some numerical examples to 
solidify the findings via varied transformations. Assessment and

2validation of the obtained results through step responses of the higher- 
order and obtained reduced-order systems is in section 6 along with 
the computed errors. The limitation found during the findings of the 
outcome from this article is discussed in section 7. Finally, the key dif-
ference between the two methods is offered in section 8 as conclusions 
with a possible future scope. 
2.Literature survey 
Systems with huge parameters are represented through finite dif-
ferential equations, resulting in an overall higher order system transfer 
function. It then becomes anticipated for researchers to represent such 
models by an approximate model of lower order. Here, outburst the idea 
of order reduction, to estimate the original large-scale system by a 
smaller model, which recovers the former information numerically by 
integrating the model of reduced size. The reduced models also preserve 
fewer of the dynamic characteristic like time moments, markov pa-
rameters, and stability. Literature in Refs. [5–11] extensively provide 
numerous techniques for order reduction of non-interval, which now 
have advanced to interval systems. 
With time span and easy access of digital signals and systems, 
discrete-time systems gained their consideration over analogue systems 
for control and analysis. Since, the study and analysis of such systems of 
higher order in their raw form is uneasy; they also demand their order 
reduction for easy access. Order reduction techniques available in 
literature showcase the advancement of fewer order reduction tech-
niques in continuous-time domain directly to the discrete-time domain, 
both for non-interval and interval systems. Such type of algorithms in-
cludes Pade approximation, balanced truncation, direct truncation, ag-
gregation. Apart from these, an algorithm like Routh approximation in 
the continuous-time domain is not applicable to discrete-time domain 
directly. A vast range of algorithms based on Routh approximation is 
consisted in Ref. [12]. This call for an appropriate discretization tech-
nique of the discrete-time systems to continuous-time and vice-versa 
with an ease of computation. Precisely, the transformation modifies 
the discrete-time system to continuous-time system; order reduction 
methodology applied, and finally, an appropriate inverse transformation 
results in the desired reduced model in discrete-time domain. 
From the literature available, transformation techniques used widely 
for either discrete-time non-interval or interval systems are namely 
Tustin or bilinear or trapezoidal method [13–21] and Eulers Forward 
differentiation method [22–25]. In recent literature, Ruchira [26] 
employed bilinear transformation and Potturu and Prasad [27], used 
linear transformation. In 2020, Deveerasetty and Nagar [28] proposed 
reduction of discrete-time interval systems using both linear and bilinear 
transformations. 
Available library of literature represent the possible dilemma of the 
researchers in terms of which transformation technique to be employed 
for better outcome. The present article might be a possible solution to 
such researchers. 
3.Transformation techniques 
Conversion from discrete-time to continuous-time domain is impor -
tant in a manner to apply the continuous-time algorithms to discrete- 
time systems. As stated in introduction, there are many transformation 
techniques but only two of them, namely, Tustin and Forward difference 
transformation techniques are considered in this paper, as these are 
applied widely for order reduction of discrete-time systems as survey in 
section 2. Here, they have been chosen to establish their grandness in the 
area of discrete-time interval system, stating a significant difference 
among each other. Short discussion about both the techniques is offered 
in this section for their better understanding [29]. Their integral ap-
proximations can be seen in Fig. 1 for bilinear or Tustin or trapezoidal 
transformation (w-domain) and Fig. 2 for forward difference 
respectively. 3.1. Bilinear or tustin or trapezoidal transformation (w-domain) 
In z-plane, the frequency appears as zejωt, and its response loses 
the simplicity of logarithmic plots. It is to be noted that the z-trans -
formation maps the primary and complementary strips of the left of the 
s-plane into the unit circle in the z-plane. Thus conventional frequency 
response methods, do not apply to the z-plane. To overcome this diffi-
culty, the pulse transfer function in the z-plane is transformed to w- 
plane. The w-transformation states z(
1TE2w
1 TE2w)
, where T is the sam-
pling period. The inverse transformation is w2
T z 1
z1)
. 
Through the z-transformation and the w-transformation, the primary 
strip of the left half of the s-plane is first mapped inside the unit circle in 
the z-plane and then mapped to the entire left half of the w-plane. The 
origin in the z-plane maps to the point w 2
T in the w-plane. 
As s varies from 0→jωs
2 along jω axis, z varies from 1 to  1 along the 
unit circle in z-plane, and w varies from 0 to 1 along the imaginary axis 
in the w plane. The difference between the s-plane and w-plane is that 
the frequency range  1
2ωs≼ω≼1
2ωs in the s-plane maps to the range in 
the w-plane, where v is the fictitious frequency. Thus, there is a 
compression of the frequency scale. Although, the w-plane resembles the 
s-plane geometrically, the frequency axis in the w-plane is distorted. 
3.2. Forward difference or linear transformation (p-domain) 
Tustin transformation had fever difficulties in its application to filter 
design, thus calling for matched z-transformation where zept. This 
was successfully implemented and used in digital control systems. It’s a 
simpler version where z1p and is prevailed by employing forward 
Euler rule to the matched z-transform equality and retaining the first two 
terms in the resultant expansion. Such transformations are of special

3significance in the design of audio and telephone networks. 
3.3. Comparison between the techniques based on stability 
In terms of stability transformation from z-to-w or p-domain can be 
better understood by the figures below. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, illustrates 
stability region Re(s) < 0 mapped on the complex z-plane for the for-
ward difference and trapezoidal approximation respectively. By using 
forward difference approximation, the stability region (LHP) is mapped 
to the half-plane to the left of 1 on the complex z-plane. Thus, with 
forward difference approximation, it is possible that a stable discrete- 
time controller will be approximated by an unstable continuous-time 
controller. 
The bilinear transformation (trapezoidal or Tustin approximation) 
maps the left half s-plane into the unit disc. Hence, stable discrete 
(continuous) controllers are approximated by stable continuous 
(discrete) controllers and unstable continuous (discrete) controllers are 
mapped to unstable discrete (continuous) controllers. In practice, the 
Tustins approximation (bilinear transformation) is the approximation of 
choice for converting continuous-time (discrete) controllers to discrete- 
time (continuous) controllers. 
4.Preliminaries 
This section is divided under two subheadings to understand the 
discovery of the paper through a) Reduction methodology applied for 
the approximation and b) the Performance Analysis of the obtained 
systems on the basis of error computation and step response. 
4.1. Reduction methodology 
Till date, there are numerous order reduction methodologies avail-
able both in continuous-time as well as discrete-time domain ranging 
from non-interval systems to interval systems. Any of the prevailing 
reduction algorithms can be chosen for deriving the reduced models. 
The methodology considered here is available from the literature as 
Gamma-Delta approximation [13]. The desires of the reductions meth -

4.1.2. Euler forward difference transformation (p-domain) 
For analysis through this transformation, replace z in the higher 
order transfer function (1) by z1p and proceed through algorithmic 
steps from (3) to (11) and apply inverse transformation pz 1 to get 
the system in z-domain. 
4.2. Performance Analysis 
Gamma-Delta approximation, is used to retain the dynamic charac -
teristic of the reduced model comparable to higher order system. Step 
response, a common analysis tool and Integral Square Error, most 
practiced performance measure (both available in literature) is used to 
validate the obtained reduced models after the two transformations. 
Since, the paper deals with discrete-time interval systems, perfor -
mance measure J is modified as weighted error sum over a fixed interval 
of time, determined by the error between the transient responses of the 
higher order system, and the lower order system, expressed as; 
J̂∞
k0ynk ykk2(12)  
where ynkand ykkare the step responses of the higher order Tnz
and reduced order system Rkzrespectively. 
The obtained reduced system is guaranteed to be approximate when 
J is minimum. For this analysis, the higher and reduced systems are 
considered as, 1) Transfer function with only lower limits and 2) 
Transfer function with only upper limits. Thereafter, J is computed 
independently for the two transfer functions for observation under the 
error column for lower limit and upper limit as shown in the tables in 
section 6. The stated section also offers the step responses of the higher 
and reduced order interval systems. 
5.Experimental results 
Two examples with the same reduction methodology, but varied in 
the realization of transformation are provided here to solidify the ob-
servations made in the previous sections. This would help in under -
standing the difference between the two techniques.

This section attempts to assess the transformation techniques based 
on the computation of errors and step responses obtained between the 
higher-order and reduced lower-order models obtained through the 
different transformation techniques. Errors obtained for the Examples 1 
and 2 from section 5 are shown in Tables 4 and 5 correspondingly. The step responses of the reduced models and higher order systems 
for Example 1 and 2 are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 respectively. The heavy 
solid line represents the response of the higher-order system and the 
other dotted lines depict the responses of the reduced models through 
both transformation techniques respectively. 
From Figs. 6 and 7, it can observed that the step responses of the 
higher order and reduced order systems for both the examples via two 
transformations are almost identical. Similarly, the errors in Tables 4 
and 5 respectively are comparatively minimum and can be considered 
accordingly. Thus, the above results and thorough observations of the 
methodologies, evoke that p-domain discretization technique is quite 
simple and easy to transform, making it preferable over the w-domain 
techniques to produce similar reduced models. 
Briefly, the validation of the obtained reduced models is performed 
on the basis of minimum error computation and approximate tracking of 
the step responses. 
7.Limitation 
A feasible query developed or the limitation about the offered 
assessment is its relevance for comparison of the performance based on 
the model reduction as the result may depend on the reduction tech-
niques as well as the numerical examples. The answer is; yes, they are a 
major factor to be considered but on a large scale of simplification, the 
linear transformation can be applied directly to obtain an acceptable 
result. 
8.Conclusions 
The analysis of the two transformation techniques having their own 
advantages and disadvantages is outlined individually in this paper. The 
main goal to examine which of them supplies more convenient dis-
cretization with ease is performed successfully. It is found in general 
that, forward difference achieves the advantages of being easy and 
simple at every step. The main reason is its form of linearity i.e. z1p 
instead of using rational form as z 1w

. These observations indicate 
that any of the two techniques can be used; as both of them result in 
almost equivalent reduced forms but for convenience and ease of 
computation, p-domain proves to be superior. The achieved results are 
found a basis for further work in the area of discrete-time to continuous- 
time transformation and vice-versa. Overall, the conclusion is that the Table 3

6latter technique is much simpler, matches as many moments as the 
former one does and hence appears to be better than the former tech-
nique. Lastly, the attempt made in this paper is believed to be helpful to 
the researchers working on higher order systems. A future work devel -
oped from this presented discussion is its practical approach on physical system models.
