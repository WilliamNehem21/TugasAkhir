1. Introduction Short-circuit test of transformer is an important me thod for the study of transformer features. The simulation method for short-circuit test of transformer is  useful to investigate the working principle and characteristic of transformers. And there are many kinds of software to finish the simulation, MALAB/Simulink is one of the most popular software in this field. Some application such as the model and simulate the dynamic behavior of ac-powered electromechanic al contactors[1], the integration of Matlab and Excel to conceptualize the relationship between abstr act mathematical models to practical situations[2], using specially designed exercises about substation lightning protection in teaching high voltage course in Matlab[3], modeling of power systems on the transient analysis[4], the surge modelling of a transformer[5], etc. in this

 paper, based on the simulation process of transforme r test[6], consider the influence of shunt capacitor and different frequency source, the short-circuit test is applied in Matlab/Simulink. 2. Short-Circuit Test of Transformer By the short-circuit test of transformer, the copper losses of the transformer can be obtained. Short-circuit test of transformer, which shown in figure 1, is c onducted by shot-circuiting the secondary terminal of transformer, then applying a reduced voltage to the primary side. When the rated current flowing in the second windings, the input voltage of the primary side is Vsc, the input of current of the primary side windings is Isc
the input active power is Psc, and the input reactive power is Qsc.

According to reference[6], the short-circuit resistance Rsc and the short-circuit reactance Xsc can be calculated as follows.  Rsc=Psc/(Isc^2)                                             (1)  Xsc=Qsc/(Isc^2) (2) Then, the inductance Lsc is  Lsc=Xsc/(2*pi*f) (3) 3. Resonant Capacitor And Variable Frequency Power Supply  In a circuit containing at least one inductor and one capacitor, resonance is the condition which exists when the input impedance of the circuit is purely resistive. During the short-circuit test of transformer, in order to reduce the current of the power supply, a capacitor can be paralleled with transformer and composing an parallel resonance circuit. As we know, in the parelled resonance circuit, the capacitor can be calculated as follows.

 In the calculation of resonant capacitor, if we increase the frequency of power supply, the capacitor will be reduced. So, we can use the high frequency power source in the short-circuit test of transformer to get the reduced parallel capacitor.  Considering the engineering realization, the third harm onic generation power supply is used in this work. 4. The Simulation System Design   For the sake of evaluation, we use the transformer parameters from reference[6]. A 50KVA, 2400/240V, 50Hz transformer is used in this simulation. Its rated current of the primary side I1e=50000/2400=20.8333(A), and the secondary side current I2e=50000/240=208.333(A). The equivalent circuit parameters of the transformer tested is R1=0.7488, RC=33,391, X1 =1.00224, XM =5,008, R2 =0.007488, X2=0.0100224. The ideal parameter in this simulation is   Rsc=R1+100*R2= 0.7488+100*0.007488=1.4976                                 (5)   Xsc=X1+100*X2=1.00224+100*0.0100224=2.0045                       (6) Lsc=2.0045/(100*pi)=0.0064                                    (7) Based on the Matlab/Simulink platform, a simulation model is built shown as figure 2. In this model, the short-circuit parameters are calculated by equation (1-3). Their values are Rsc=1.496 Xsc=2.002 Lsc=2.002/(100*pi)=0.006371 A capacitor can be paralleled with the transformer and its value can be calculated based on equation (4).  C1=L/[R2+(2
fL)2]= 0.0064/(1.4976^2+(2*pi*50*0.0064)^2)= 0.0010 (F)                          (8) When the third harmonic generation power supply is  used, the frequency is 150 Hz instead of 50 Hz. Simaliar with figure 2, the simulation with 150 Hz powe r supply and shunt capacitor is shown in figure 3.  The ideal capacitor value when the pararel resonance occurs is:   C2=0.0064/(1.4976^2+(2*pi*3*50*0.0064)^2)= 1.6569e-004 (F)                 (9) In the simulation model, when C2=1.6109e-004(F), the pararel resonance apppears.   The ratio of the capacitor under 50 Hz source and 150 Hz source is:   R=C1/C2=0.0010/ 1.6109e-004= 6.2077                     (10) 649  Wang Lidi et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   3  ( 2012 )  646 – 651

 5. Conclusions and Future Works  In this work, the simulation model of short-circuit test of transformer is designed. And the variable frequency power supply and shunt capacitor are consid ered. From the simulation results, use the shunt capacitor, the power supply can be reduced. Use the high frequency source, the capacitor can be reduced as well. This has significance in transformer test research and engineering application.  Under the different frequency source and shunt capacitor, the short-circuit test parameter may be variable in a small scale. The short-circuit test features should be studied in the experiments is the next work.
