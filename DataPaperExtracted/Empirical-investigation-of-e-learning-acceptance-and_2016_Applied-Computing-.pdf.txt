KEYWORDSE-learning;LMS;Technologyacceptance model;TAM;TAM3;Structural equationmodelingAbstract E-learning has become progressively more vital for academia andcorporate training and has potentially become one of the most signiﬁcantdevelopments and applications in Information Technologies (ITs). This studyused a quantitative approach seeking a causative explanation of the decisionbehavior of individuals toward the acceptance and assimilation of e-learning inacademic settings. A survey of 286 participants (students) was conducted to col-lect the research data. Our study framework was based on the third version of theTechnology Acceptance Model (i.e., TAM3) and the data were analyzed usingstructural equation modeling in order to determine the factors that inﬂuencethe learners’ intention to use e-learning. Results show the predicting (promot-ing/inhibiting) factors of e-learning technology acceptance, while also examiningsome related post-implementation interventions expected to contribute to theacceptance and assimilation of e-learning systems. Our results also indicate thatTAM3 holds well in the Arabian culture and also outline valuable outcomes suchas: managerial interventions and controls for better organizational e-learningmanagement that can lead to greater acceptance and effective utilization. Hope-fully, this study provides a roadmap to more understanding of the success factors

1. Introduction
The Internet and networks, as the backbone for modern communications, trans-formed our world into ubiquitous connectivity; that is, anytime, anywhere, accessis always available to the digital network and digital services. The evolution (andrevolution) in information and communications technologies (ICT), that recentlyfueled remarkable economic and social changes, will only pick up the pace as weapply managerial interventions and controls for better ICT acceptance andassimilation.
The Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC) inSaudi Arabia has launched a longitudinal study which asserts that Internet pene-tration is relatively high among educational institutions, as 75% of them are beingconnected to the internet[16]. However, a striking ﬁnding of the study, declaresthat only 39% of university/college students are able to access the Internet by2007 and that e-learning is also not very popular among the educationalinstitutions in Saudi Arabia.
Technology-assisted learning via ICT (or e-learning) has become progressivelymore vital for academia and corporate training. Furthermore, e-learning haspotentially become one of the most signiﬁcant developments in ICTs [46]. Motivated by such compelling advantages as: geographical reach, learner control(in terms of ﬂexibility and convenience), and cost effectiveness in course deliveryand management, educational institutions and professional organizations areembracing e-learning by implementing an expanding array of technology-enabled platforms[27].
Recently, Saudi Arabia has called for a national plan to adopt IT spanning thecountry. The plan strongly recommends the implementation of e-learning anddistance learning, and their prospective applications, in higher education. In amajor transformation of conventional education, the Saudi Ministry of HigherEducation has recently launched the National Centre of E-learning & DistanceLearning, set up a repository to organize the change, and prepare e-learning mate-rials to help universities adopt the system and transform to a scheme of e-learningquickly[39].
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM3) by Venkatesh and Bala [44]provides valuable rational explanations into how and why individuals make a decisionabout the adoption and use of ITs, particularly the work on the determinants ofperceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Moreover, TAM3 enlightensmanagers to make informed decisions about interventions that can be in charge28 S.S. Al-Gahtaniof greater acceptance and effective utilization of ITs. This study draws heavily onthe seminal work of Venkatesh and Bala[44]and Baker et al.[9]due to their interrelated nature dealing with IT acceptance and adoption testing as a commonthematic issue. More speciﬁcally, Venkatesh and Bala [44]provide TAM3 as a theoretical base model while Baker et al.[9]provide the quasi replication andtesting approach of a theoretical model in a different culture.
This study sets out an empirical research for investigating e-learning acceptanceand assimilation in Saudi Arabia as having a unique culture that is different fromthe Western culture where TAM originated. The fundamental contribution of thisstudy is to exploit TAM3 to predict technology acceptance of e-learning in SaudiArabia as a developing country, in addition to inquiring for some related post-implementation interventions that might contribute to the acceptance and assim-ilation of e-learning systems in developing countries. The speciﬁc objectives of thisstudy are: (i) to develop a customized Technology Acceptance Model using TAM3for the determinants of the acceptance and assimilation of e-learning; (ii) toemploy survey research to test the customized e-learning model per se; and (iii)to outline outcomes of the study, such as, the antecedents of e-learning technologyacceptance and managerial interventions and control for better organizationale-learning management. It is hoped that this project provides a roadmap to a bet-ter understanding of the success factors and post-implementation interventionscontributing to the acceptance and assimilation of e-learning systems in develop-ing countries in general.
1.1. Related work
Mirza and Al-Abdulkareem[30]reviewed the current situation of e-learning in theMiddle East (ME). They presented drivers and barriers to e-learning, the differenttypes of e-learning initiatives, steps being taken toward overcoming the challenges,and a possible future of e-learning through a case study of ongoing developmentsof e-learning in Saudi Arabia. Educational organizations in the ME are varying intheir engagement in e-learning as some are pioneering while the majority are pro-gressing visa-vis those that are still laggards.
To provide more insight into how to promote e-learning acceptance amongstudents in Saudi Arabia, Al-Harbi[7]investigated the factors that inﬂuencee-learning by analyzing the perceptions and attitudes of Saudi university studentsusing a survey conducted to investigate the acceptance of e-learning as perceivedby students. Al-Harbi used a combined factor model of the original TAM and theTheory of Planned Behavior (TPB)[3]to explain signiﬁcant perceptional andattitudinal factors related to the acceptance of e-learning. The ﬁndingsdemonstrated that attitudes toward e-learning, subjective norms, perceivedbehavioral control as well as e-learning system attributes were criticaldeterminants of students’ behavioral intention to use e-learning.Empirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation 29Advanced technologies facilitating a new environment of higher educatione-learning have been investigated in Saudi Arabia such as the adoption of smartphones and tablets which is known as mobile learning or m-learning [13,32,37]. These studies report prevailing of these technologies to some extent indicating thatthe acceptance and adoption level of m-learning is on rise as the majority of stu-dents express positive attitudes toward m-learning due to the ﬂexibility of learningmethods and timings, and improved communication among learners. However,Chanchary and Islam[13]pointed out that there are many more challenges stillto overcome like giving proper training to students (a type of intervention asper TAM3) so they can have a sense of security in the new environment in anattempt to take full advantage of e-learning.
Jordan is a good example of developing countries in the ME, exemplifying anIT hub for the region, ﬁrst introduced e-learning in the Arab Open Universityin 2002[1]. Abbad et al.[1]and Al-Adwan et al.[4]explored students’ acceptanceof e-learning in Jordanian universities using the original TAM. Their ﬁndings,respectively, indicated that students’ beliefs about usefulness and ease of usepartially mediate the relationships between external factors (subjective norms,internet experience, system characteristics, self-efﬁcacy, and technical support)and intention to use and actual use of e-learning systems; and that intention touse e-learning systems is only predicted by perceived usefulness as students’attitude did not signiﬁcantly affect intention to use e-learning, while perceived easeof use was found to signiﬁcantly predict both usefulness and attitude towarde-learning.
Lately, Singh and Hardaker[38]conducted a broad search of the literature (formore than 300 articles) regarding barriers and enablers to the adoption and diffu-sion of e-learning that were analyzed as three main categories: (1) macro-levelstudies investigating the higher education context of e-learning, (2) micro-levelstudies probing on individual and social factors, and (3) studies probing onmanagement issues of the adoption and diffusion of technological innovations.Fortunately, our study seeks an empirical investigation of e-learning acceptanceand assimilation using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM3) as a frame-work covering the second and third categories suggested by Singh and Hardakerbeforehand.
1.2. Theories of technology acceptance – Technology Acceptance Model 3
The original TAM[19,20]proposed that two belief constructs, perceived useful-ness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU), are primary determinants of anindividual’s behavioral intention (BI) to use an IT. BI was theorized as the pri-mary predictor of actual usage behavior. There were successive developments ofTAM: TAM2, UTAUT, and ﬁnally TAM3. Fortunately, the original TAM,TAM2 and UTAUT were tested in the Arabian context and showed to hold verywell[5,9,6], respectively).30 S.S. Al-GahtaniIn this study, following Baker et al.[9], TAM3 is tested in the context of SaudiArabia, a technologically-developing Arab nation. Since the TechnologyAcceptance Model is built on the foundation of an individual’s beliefs, it isrational to expect that the application of any given Technology Acceptance Modelin the two different cultural contexts could produce different results [9]. It is hoped that the ﬁndings of this study shall help to improve our understanding about theantecedents of e-learning technology acceptance and assimilation in Saudi Arabia,thereby providing us an opportunity to reﬁne the model to suit this country’sunique cultural context and offering a path to investigate technology adoptioncharacteristics in other developing countries[5,9]. This paper was part of a scien-tiﬁc project which evolved over more than 3 years since 2010. The agenda for thisproject was summarized and published in the second international conference ofe-learning and distance education by the ministry of higher education in SaudiArabia[22].
1.3. Technology Acceptance Model 3 – TAM3
The most recent and comprehensive developments of TAM are manifested inTAM3. Venkatesh and Bala[44]synthesized prior research on TAM and devel-oped a theoretical framework that represents the cumulative body of knowledgefrom TAM research that accumulated over the years, that results in four differenttypes of determinants of PU and PEOU – individual differences, system characteristics, social inﬂuence, and facilitating conditions . According to Venkatesh and Bala[44], ‘‘individual difference variables include personality and/or demo-graphics (e.g., traits or states of individuals, gender, and age) that can inﬂuenceindividuals’ perceptions of PU and PEOU’’, while, ‘‘system characteristics arethose salient features of a system that can help individuals develop favorable (orunfavorable) perceptions regarding the usefulness or ease of use of a system’’,whereas, ‘‘social inﬂuence captures various social processes and mechanisms thatguide individuals to formulate perceptions of various aspects of an IT’’, ﬁnally,‘‘facilitating conditions represent organizational support that facilitates the useof an IT’’ (p. 276). In summary, Venkatesh and Bala[44]combined TAM2[42] and the model of the determinants of PEOU[41], and developed an integratedmodel of technology acceptance which they called: TAM3. TAM3 presents a com-prehensive nomological network of the determinants of individuals’ IT adoptionand use, as shown inFig. 1.
In the context of IT adoption and use, social inﬂuence processes (i.e., compli-ance, identiﬁcation, and internalization) represent how important referents believeabout the instrumental beneﬁts of using a system[42]. Prior individual informa-tion and perceptions – about how easy a system is to use from important referents– are unlikely to be stable as individuals need to form these stable perceptionsbased on their own general computer beliefs and hands-on experience with the sys-tem[21]. In TAM3, three constructs – subjective norms (SN), image (IMG), andEmpirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation 31voluntariness (VOL) – capture the social inﬂuence processes on perceived useful-ness[44].
However, according to Venkatesh and Bala[44], the inﬂuence of cognitiveinstrumental processes on perceived usefulness is captured by four constructs:Subjective NormExperience Voluntariness

Al-Gahtanijob relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, and perceived ease of use.‘‘The core theoretical argument underlying the role of cognitive instrumental pro-cesses is that individuals form perceived usefulness judgment in part by cognitivelycomparing what a system is capable of doing with what they need to get done intheir job’’[42, p. 190]. TAM3 theorizes that job relevance and result demonstra-bility directly affect perceived usefulness while output quality operates as amoderator of the relationship of job relevance with perceived usefulness. Table 1 presents the constructs deﬁnitions of social inﬂuence processes followed by thecognitive instrumental processes.
Four anchors were suggested by TAM3: ‘‘computer self-efﬁcacy, computeranxiety, computer playfulness,andperceptions of external control(orfacilitating conditions). The ﬁrst three of these anchors represent individual differences (are)general beliefs associated with computers and computer use. Computer self-efﬁcacy refers to individuals’controlbeliefs regarding his or her personal abilityto use a system. Perceptions of external control are related to individuals’ control beliefs regarding the availability of organizational resources and support structureto facilitate the use of a system. Computer playfulness represents the intrinsic motivationassociated with using any new system’’[44, p. 278]. Notably, Venkatesh and Bala[44]also suggested that ‘‘while anchors drive initial judgments of per-ceived ease of use, individuals will adjust these judgments after they gain directhands-on experience with the new system’’ (p. 278).
Perceived enjoyment and objective usabilitywere – two system characteristic-related adjustments – suggested by Venkatesh and Bala [44]to be included in TAM3 as determinants of perceived ease of use with enduring effects even afterindividuals gain experience with the new system. Following Venkatesh [41], Venkatesh and Bala[44]theorized that, in TAM3, the role of two anchors –computer self-efﬁcacy and perceptions of external control – will continue to be

Moreover, TAM3 theorized thatwith more hands-on experience with the system, the effects of adjustments –perceived enjoyment and objective usability– on perceived ease of use wereescalating. The constructs deﬁnitions of anchors and adjustments are shown inTable 2.
TAM received special attention from prominent scholars in the IS ﬁeld. TheJournal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS) devoted a special crit-ical issue (volume 8, issue 4, April 2007) about TAM ‘‘Quo Vadis TAM – Issuesand Reﬂections on Technology Acceptance Model’’[26]. The scholars’ reviews varied dramatically from ‘‘TAM is a blessing and indisputable’’ on one end to‘‘TAM is a curse’’ on the other end. TAM3 was ﬁrst developed and publishedin May 2008 which resolved a number of shortcomings with the TAM model.Viswanath Venkatesh, Fred Davis (as the innovator of TAM), and Mike Morriscommentary on the JAIS special issue was ‘‘We conclude that there has been excel-lent progress in technology adoption research. However, as a next step, we call forresearch focused on interventions, contingencies, and alternative theoretical per-spectives (to the largely social psychology-based technology adoption research’’[43, p. 267]. Hence, TAM3 came as a response to the JAIS special issue to focuson interventions, and therefore, we believe that TAM3 is a sound theoreticalframework to investigate the factors affecting individual acceptance and assimila-tion of e-learning in various settings which is much more developed than previouseditions of TAM. Several previous studies (e.g.,[4,7,1,36]used old versions of TAM as a framework to study e-learning from different perspectives. Moreover,this study – to the best of our knowledge – is the ﬁrst one to use the latest versionof TAM (i.e., TAM3) as a framework to study e-learning.

Al-Gahtani2. Research model and hypotheses
TAM3 is the most recent reformulation of TAM as reﬂected in the seminal workpublished by Venkatesh and Bala[44]. The nomological network of TAM3 as perFig. 1reveals that both social inﬂuence processes (subjective norm (SN), volun-tariness (VOL) and image (IMG)) and cognitive instrumental processes (job rele-vance (REL), output quality (OQ), result demonstrability (RES), and perceivedease of use (PEOU)), establish the determinants of perceived usefulness (PU).The anchors (computer self-efﬁcacy (CSE), perceptions of external control(PEC), computer anxiety (CANX), and computer playfulness (CPLY)), and theadjustments (perceived enjoyment (ENJ) and objective usability (OU)) establishthe determinants of perceived ease of use (PEOU). PU, PEOU, and subjectivenorm (SN) determine behavioral intentions (BI) to use an IT. Ultimately, BI deter-mines IT usage behavior. Venkatesh and Bala[44]reported that TAM3 accountedfor 52–67% of the variance in usefulness perceptions, 43–52% of the variance inease of use perceptions and 40–53% of the variance in usage intentions.
However, this study research model differs from TAM3 in three basic aspects.Firstly, in this study, our survey data on the model constructs were collected at asingle point in time, as opposed to a longitudinal methodology (i.e., collectingseveral measurements over time). Our focus is on how well the social inﬂuenceprocesses, the cognitive instrumental processes, the anchors and the adjustmentspredict e-learning technology acceptance, in particular the implicit cultural effectson these processes and factors which affect technology acceptance and assimila-tion. Secondly, the usage construct of TAM3 model was excluded, because weintend to collect cross-sectional data at a single time point, instead of longitudi-nally, the choice to measure technology acceptance with intention is appropriate,since measuring usage would require assessments of people’s beliefs and attitudesin a preceding period. Thus, the use of intention is appropriate for our study andallows us to measure acceptance and beliefs contemporaneously [2].
Objective Usability (OU) used to be operationalized consistent with the key-stroke model from human–computer interaction (HCI) research and prior useracceptance research[41]. The suggested guideline for operationalizing this con-struct is to compute a novice-to-expert ratio of effort. Speciﬁcally, the time takenby an expert to perform a set of tasks using the system in an error-free situation iscompared with the time taken by a novice (subject)[41]. Accordingly, a set of e-learning tasks should be assigned and completed by the respondents (students).The time taken by each individual student to complete the tasks should berecorded by the Learning Management System (LMS), which will be comparedlater to the time taken by an expert to arrive at a ratio that would serve as the mea-sure of OU for the particular subject (student). The higher the OU estimate(student-to-expert ratio), the harder the system is to use from an objectivestandpoint[41]. Unfortunately, the LMS technology used in our university(Blackboard) does not support the keystroke model to measure OU. Therefore,Empirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation 35this construct was dropped from the research model which reﬂects the third differ-ence of this study from TAM3.
In view of that, the current research main hypotheses are as follows:
H1: The original TAM will hold well in the Saudi Arabian environment.H
2: The extended TAM (TAM3) will hold well but differently from Westerncultures (i.e., the culture where TAM3 originated).H
3(a): The social inﬂuence process variable (SN) will signiﬁcantly inﬂuencebehavioral intention (BI) to use the e-learning system,H
3(b): The social inﬂuence process variables (SN and IMG) will signiﬁcantlyinﬂuence perceived usefulness (PU) of the e-learning system,H
3(c): The social inﬂuence process variable (IMG) will mediate the inﬂuence ofsubjective norm (SN) on perceived usefulness (PU) of the e-learning system,H
3(d): The social inﬂuence process variable (VOL) will signiﬁcantly moderatethe inﬂuence of SN on behavioral intention (BI) to use the e-learning system,H
4(a): The cognitive instrumental process variables (REL, RES, and PEOU)will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence perceived usefulness (PU) of e-learning system,H
4(b): The cognitive instrumental process variable (OQ) will signiﬁcantly mod-erate the inﬂuence of JREL on perceived usefulness (PU) of the e-learningsystem,H
5: The four anchor variables (CSE, PEC, CANX, and CPLY) will signiﬁcantlyinﬂuence perceived ease of use (PEOU) of the e-learning system,H
6: The adjustment variable (ENJ) will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence perceived ease ofuse (PEOU) of the e-learning system,H
7: Experience (EXP) as a moderator in TAM3 will signiﬁcantly moderate theseven intended paths as shown inFig. 1.
3. Research methodology
3.1. Sampling procedure
A ‘‘convenience sample’’ amalgamated with ‘‘quota sample’’ was thought to be themost appropriate sampling procedure for this study. Convenience sampling wasdeemed appropriate by the virtue of the researcher’s accessibility to the respon-dents while quota sampling was considered appropriate in terms of achieving rel-ative proportions of respondents in different categories such as gender, coursemajor, and study level[12]. Six sites, (three male colleges: Science, Business, andEngineering, and three female colleges: Science, Arts and Literature, and Girls’Study Center), as subsidiaries of a large Saudi Arabian university in the southernregion, were chosen according to this sampling procedure for data collection.These sites were mature in e-learning experience and provided with high speedinternet connectivity. To achieve this goal, the data collection method thoughtto be most appropriate was a survey questionnaire. Newsted et al. [33]argue that36 S.S. Al-Gahtanisurveys are among the more popular methods used by the information systems(IS) research community.
3.2. Structural Equation Modeling approach
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques are a second-generation multi-variate technique[24]that has been widely used for instrument validation andmodel testing in research in the ﬁeld of marketing and organizational behavior.The SEM technique has also been introduced to MIS and started gaining popular-ity among researchers in the ﬁeld who have adopted this approach in several stud-ies recently reported in the literature. Conceptually and practically, SEM is similarto using Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA). However, causal models developedfollowing the SEM approach are superior to MRA in many ways. As this studyseeks a causative explanation of the decision behavior of individuals toward theacceptance and assimilation of e-learning, SEM came in front of other potentialapproaches to achieve this purpose. Chau et al.[14]reported that Bagozzi[8]enu- merated the advantages that causal models developed using the SEM approachpossesses, such as: ‘‘(1) they make the assumptions, constructs, and hypothesizedrelationships in a researcher’s theory explicit; (2) they add a degree of precision toa researcher’s theory, since they require clear deﬁnitions of constructs, opera-tionalizations, and the functional relationships between constructs; (3) they permita more complete representation of complex theories; and (4) they provide a formalframework for constructing and testing both theories and measures’’ [14, p. 314].
The most widely used statistical software packages that adopt the SEMapproach include LISREL and PLS. Although they are both SEM based, theyare quite different in their estimation approaches and objectives. The primarymeasures used in LISREL are overall goodness-of-ﬁt measures that assess howwell the hypothesized model ﬁts the observed data. Hence, the analysis is‘‘theory-oriented, and emphasizes the transition from exploratory to conﬁrmatoryanalysis’’[29, p. 270]. PLS-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) isbased on least squares estimation with the primary objective being to maximizethe explanation of variance in the dependent constructs of a structural equationmodel. PLS is essentially targeted for causal-predictive analysis as PLS is moreappropriate to analyze highly complex causal models with low theoretical substan-tiation for the purpose to maximize the determinants’ predictive power toward thedependent construct.
In summary, the researcher decided to use PLS-SEM to analyze this study datafor several reasons:
1) PLS-SEM is, as the name implies, a more ‘‘regression-based’’ approach thatminimizes the residual variances of the endogenous constructs [25].Empirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation 372) Indeed, TAM3 is relatively a new theoretical model developed by Venkateshand Bala[44]that presently undergoes empirical test in the Arabian culture.Because of its prediction orientation, PLS-SEM is, thus, the preferredmethod when the research objective is theory development and prediction[25].3) PLS-SEM can be a powerful method of analysis because of the minimaldemands on measurement scales, sample size, and residual distributions[15]. In fact, our study sample size is comparatively small with skewed vari-ables indicating that it is not normally distributed.4) Hair et al.[25]conclude that PLS-SEM path modeling, if appropriatelyapplied, is indeed a ‘‘silver bullet’’ for estimating causal models in many the-oretical models and empirical data situations.
3.3. Research instruments
All the survey items used to operationalize the constructs investigated in ourresearch model were adapted for this study from Venkatesh and Bala [44]. However, these scales were originally developed and tested in the English lan-guage, and therefore developed in a different environment and culture. To adaptthem for the current research in Arabic, the Brislin[11]back translation method was used. The items were translated back and forth between English and Arabicby two teams of bilingual professors. The process was repeated until both versionsconverged. The Arabic version instruments that emerged were subject to twoArabic judges to make sure that the instruments are suitable for application forthe present research project.
4. Data analysis
4.1. Sample analysis
Six hundred copies of a ﬁve page questionnaire were distributed among the tar-geted six colleges. The returned and usable responses were 286, thus achieving aresponse rate of 47.67%.Table 3shows the sample distribution by gender andstudy major.
5. Results
Following Baker et al.[9], the research model shown inFig. 1was analyzed using SmartPLS 2.0, a Partial Least Squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM)software tool Ringle et al.[35]. One of the essential features of SmartPLS is thesimultaneous assessment of the psychometric properties of the measurement model (i.e., the reliability and validity of the scales used to measure the model variables),as well as the estimation of the parameters of thestructural model(i.e., the strength38 S.S. Al-Gahtaniof the path relationships among the model variables). The subsequent paragraphspresent the analysis results of the psychometric properties of the measurementmodel and the estimation of the parameters of the structural model.
5.1. The measurement model
The measurement model testing results revealed a strong evidence of the robust-ness of the constructs’ measures denoted by their internal consistency reliabilitiesas manifested by their composite reliabilities presented in Table 4. The range of the composite reliabilities of the measures was 0.70–0.91. Almost all of these reliabilityindices properly exceed the threshold of 0.70 recommended by Nunnally [34]. Additionally, the average variance extracted (AVE) for each measure far exceedsthe lower bound threshold value of 0.50 recommended by Fornell and Larcker[24], as the AVEs for the measurement constructs ranged from 0.763 to 0.919.
Smart PLS generates the convergent validity tests of the scales by extracting thefactor loadings and cross loadings of all items (indicators) to their own respectiveconstructs.Table 5presents these results indicating that all items (after droppingtwo items: CSE1 and ENJ3): (1) loaded on their own particular constructs from alower bound of 0.700 to an upper bound of 0.909 (the bolded factor loadings), andTable 3Respondents distribution by gender and study major.

0.78340 S.S. Al-Gahtani(2) loaded more highly on their own particular construct than on any otherconstruct (the non-bolded factor loadings). According to Yoo and Alavi [40],a common rule of thumb to indicate convergent validity is that all items should loadgreater than 0.7 on their own construct, and should load more highly on their ownrespective construct than on the other constructs. Moreover, our measurementanalysis shows that each item’s factor loading on its respective construct washighly signiﬁcant (p< 0.001).Table 4presents the loadings conﬁrming the con-vergent validity of the measures for the research model latent constructs.
5.2. The structural model
The results of the structural model are presented inFig. 1. The direct inﬂuence of each exogenous construct on the endogenous construct is indicated by the betavalue of the path coefﬁcient presented numerically on the solid arrow leading fromthe exogenous construct to the endogenous construct with asterisk(s) of the signif-icance level. Those insigniﬁcant relationships are presented in dotted arrows. Thefollowing is a summary of the signiﬁcant connections between the factors of ourstudy. The current research ﬁndings conﬁrm that BI (as the primary dependentfactor) is predicted by three factors: PU, PEOU and SN whereas PEOU is signif-icantly moderated by experience while SN is signiﬁcantly moderated by both expe-rience and voluntariness. PU is predicted by PEOU, SN, Image, and job relevancewhereas PEOU and SN are signiﬁcantly moderated by experience while job rele-vance is signiﬁcantly moderated by output quality. Finally, PEOU is predictedby computer self-efﬁcacy, perceptions of external control, computer anxiety, andperceived enjoyment with the latter signiﬁcantly moderated by experience. Detailsare found in the discussion and implications section.Fig. 1also presents the vari- ance explained (R
2) in each of the four endogenous constructs by their predictors.
6. Discussion and implications
In interpreting the results presented inFig. 1, this study draws on the guidelinesprovided by Chin et al.[15]. The results of the direct and moderator effects andpost-implementation interventions are discussed subsequently.
6.1. Direct effects
All of the direct relationships between the core constructs of the original TAMexhibited strong positive effects. More speciﬁcally, perceived ease of use(PEOU) attained a strong positive direct inﬂuence on PU (beta = 0.206, p< 0.001). In addition, PEOU simultaneously showed a strong direct effect on behavioral intention(BI) (beta = 0.252,p< 0.001). PU achieved a strong positive directinﬂuence on BI (beta = 0.374,p< 0.001). These results strongly indicate thatthe original TAM holds very well in the Arabian culture. Hence, H
1is supported.Empirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation 41Additionally, our ﬁnding related to the PU strong impact on BI supports similarﬁndings by Al-Adwan et al.[4].
All social inﬂuence process variables and all cognitive instrumental processvariables (except result demonstrability) exhibited signiﬁcant relationships asdeterminants of perceived usefulness. Also, all anchor variables (except CPLY)and computer enjoyment as the single adjustment variable exhibited signiﬁcantrelationships as determinants of perceived ease of use. Besides that, experienceexhibited ﬁve out of seven signiﬁcant moderating relationships speciﬁed inTAM3. Furthermore, by comparing the variance explained ( R
2) in this study vs. TAM3: BI (0.420/0.400), PU (0.424/0.520), and PEOU (0.450/0.440), respectively,one can conclude that they are similar with regard to BI and PEOU but differentin PU. As a result, TAM3 holds well in the Arabian context but somehow differ-ently from Western cultures (i.e., the culture where TAM3 originated).
The main dependent variable in this study is behavioral intentions (BI) of stu-dents to accept and use an e-learning system which solely predict and determineactual system usage and, consequently, the success of new ITs, as per TAM3.However, rather than PU which exhibits the strongest inﬂuence on BI in Westernculture, this study reports that subjective norm (SN) exhibits the strongest inﬂu-ence on BI (beta = 0.349,p< 0.001 compared to the insigniﬁcant SNﬁBI rela- tionship in (TAM3: Venkatesh and Bala[44]). Indeed our ﬁnding conﬁrms apronounced effect of SN on BI in Saudi Arabia, a ﬁnding which is not usuallyobserved in Western contexts. This adds further evidence and supports the impor-tant role of SN reported by Al-Harbi[7]. Therefore,H
2is supported.
Social inﬂuence captures various social processes and mechanisms that guideindividuals to formulate perceptions of various aspects of an IT. Social inﬂuenceprocesses (SN, IMG, VOL) proved to signiﬁcantly affect perceived usefulness bothdirect (SNﬁPU = 0.349,p< 0.001 and IMGﬁPU = 0.133,p< 0.001) and moderating relationships (by EXP and VOL) besides SN to signiﬁcantly affectBI both direct (SNﬁBI = 0.349,p< 0.001) and moderating relationships (byEXP and VOL) to be explained below. Additionally, SNﬁIMG relationship is signiﬁcant (SNﬁIMG = 0.435,p< 0.001). Therefore,H
3(a),H 3(b),H 3(c)are fully supported.
TAM2 postulates that three social inﬂuence mechanisms – compliance, identi-ﬁcation, and internalization – will play a role in understanding the social inﬂuenceprocesses[42]. These three mechanisms can be brieﬂy interpreted in the context ofIT adoption and use such that:compliance: represents a situation in which an indi-vidual adopts and uses an IT in order to attain certain rewards or avoids punish-ment; whereasidentiﬁcationrefers to an individual’s belief that adopting and usingan IT will elevate his or her social status within a referent group because importantreferents believe s/he should do so; however,internalizationis deﬁned as the incor- poration of a referent’s belief into one’s own belief structure. This would ensurethe adherence to the compliance and identiﬁcation of the social inﬂuence42 S.S. Al-Gahtanimechanisms. However, the internalization mechanism will be manifested as aresult of continuous adherence of individuals to the compliance and identiﬁcationmechanisms as it is expected that with time the incorporation of important refer-ent’s belief into one’s own belief structure will take place.
We believe that underpinning the notion of IT acceptance and assimilation ontothese three social inﬂuence mechanisms in the bounds of Saudi Arabia’s culturalcontext with the pervasiveness of the Saudi hierarchical conforming society inthe workplace[10]would open a new outlook in this issue. Accordingly, we con-tend that Saudi individuals would show a high regard for authority and wouldconform to the expectations of those elites/managers who occupy senior roles inthe organizational hierarchy while embracing IT take-up tendency, would leadto IT acceptance and assimilation. This perspective is ‘‘especially true in light ofthe heavy promotion of technology adoption through governmental policy andwhere there are typically more rigid cultural and organizational structures ofauthority between managers and subordinates’’[9, p. 49].
In TAM3, four constructs – job relevance, output quality, result demonstrabil-ity, and perceived ease of use – capture the inﬂuence of cognitive instrumental pro-cesses on perceived usefulness. This study proved that two cognitive instrumentalprocesses (REL and PEOU) signiﬁcantly affect perceived usefulness as per TAM3(RELﬁPU = 0.380,p< 0.001; PEOUﬁPU = 0.206,p< 0.001) while OQ signiﬁcantly moderate RELﬁPU relationship (explained below). Result demon-strability (RES) was the only exception, as RES did not signiﬁcantly affect PUwhich might indicate that participants do not believe that the results of usingthe LMS are tangible, observable, and communicable[31]. Hence,H
4(a)is par- tially supported.
The anchors suggested by TAM3 arecomputer self-efﬁcacy, computer anxiety,perceptions of external control(orfacilitating conditions),andcomputer playfulness. The ﬁrst three of these anchors proved to signiﬁcantly affect PEOUin this study (CSEﬁPEOU = 0.176,p< 0.001; CANXﬁPEOU =/C00.105, p< 0.05; PECﬁPEOU = 0.454,p< 0.001). However, computer playfulnessdid not signiﬁcantly affect PEOU indicating the absence of intrinsic motivation associated with using the LMS. Perceptions of external control exhibited thestrongest effect among anchors indicating how individuals’ controlbeliefs regard- ing the availability of organizational resources and support structure facilitate theuse of the system. This ﬁnding supports the important role of perceptions of exter-nal control reported by Al-Harbi[7]. Hence,H
5is partially supported.
As indicated earlier, only one system characteristic-related to adjustments – thatis,perceived enjoyment– was investigated in this study which proved to play a con-siderable role in determining perceived ease of use after individuals gain experiencewith the system. This study proved that enjoyment signiﬁcantly affects PEOU(ENJﬁPEOU = 0.201,p< 0.001). Therefore,H
6is supported.Empirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation 436.2. Moderators effects
TAM3 posits that subjective norm (SN) has a positive signiﬁcant effect onbehavioral intention (BI) and to continue in voluntary usage contexts. Our ﬁnd-ings indicate that SN has positive direct effect on BI and that voluntariness(VOL) positively moderates the effect of SN on BI (VOL·SNﬁBI = 0.14) indi- cating that the positive direct effect of SN on BI will not attenuate in voluntaryusage contexts. The positive interaction of voluntariness on the effect of SN onBI could be interpreted such that, users in more voluntary usage contexts areinclined to be positively affected by signiﬁcant others’ opinions regarding theirintention to use LMS. In this milieu, it is likely that the effect of subjective normon intention to use LMS will not diminish with increasing voluntariness, asreported in Venkatesh and Davis[42]. Speciﬁcally, they found that SN inﬂuencedBI only in mandatory usage contexts, and that in voluntary usage contexts, SNhad no direct effect on BI. We contend that the signiﬁcant effect of SN on BI,in both mandatory and voluntary usage contexts, can be explained within SaudiArabia’s cultural context. In light of these Saudi cultural impacts, even if the con-text of usage was voluntary, SN would continue to be a signiﬁcant predictor of BI.Indeed, our ﬁndings do conﬁrm a pronounced effect of SN on BI in Saudi Arabia,a ﬁnding which is not usually observed in Western contexts. Hence, H
3(d)is supported.
Venkatesh and Davis[42]deﬁned job relevance as the degree to which an indi-vidual believes that the target system is applicable to his or her job. This studyreports on a strong positive direct effect of job relevance (REL) on perceived use-fulness (PU) that will increase with higher output quality. OQ positively moder-ated the effect of REL on PU (OQ x RELﬁPU = 0.152). Job relevance andoutput quality will have a moderating effect on perceived usefulness such thatthe higher the output quality, the stronger the effect job relevance will have on per-ceived usefulness as reported in Venkatesh and Davis [42]. Thus,H
4(b)is supported.
The positive direct effect of subjective norm on both behavioral intention andperceived usefulness will attenuate with increased experience. EXP negativelymoderated the effect of SN on BI (EXP·SNﬁBI =/C00.10) and PU (EXP·SNﬁPU = -0.05). These relationships are supported. These negativecoefﬁcients could be interpreted to indicate that more experienced individualsare possessing stable perceptions about LMS usefulness besides their afﬁrmedintention to use LMS regardless of referent opinion in this issue. In other words,more experienced users’ tendencies are less likely to be affected by signiﬁcantothers’ opinions regarding their perceptions of LMS usefulness and their intentionto use LMS. In this context, contrary to the ﬁndings of [42], our ﬁndings indicate that it is likely that the effect of subjective norm on perceived LMS usefulness andon intention to use LMS will diminish as users gain more experience with the sys-tem. Hence, management should concentrate on users to acquire more experience44 S.S. Al-Gahtaniwith the system, instead of relying on referent opinions, to ensure higher levels ofsystem acceptance and assimilation.
The positive direct effect of ease of use on both behavioral intention and per-ceived usefulness willnotattenuate with increased experience. EXP positivelymoderated the effect of EOU on BI (EXP·PEOUﬁBI = 0.101) and PU (EXP·PEOUﬁPU = 0.083). These relationships are supported. We interpretthese positive coefﬁcients as an indication that more experienced individuals arestill inclined to be affected by signiﬁcant system ease of use regarding the perceivedusefulness of, and intention to use, LMS. In this context, it is likely that the effectof ease of use on perceived usefulness and intention to use a system will notdimin- ish with increased experience. In fact our ﬁndings conﬁrm a pronounced effect ofPEOU on both PU and BI in Saudi Arabia, which should not be overlooked dur-ing system design.
EXP did not signiﬁcantly moderate the negative inﬂuence of computer anxiety(CANX) on PEOU (EXP·CANXﬁPEOU = -0.035). In this context, it is lesslikely that the effect of computer anxiety on system ease of use will diminish withincreasing experience, as reported in Venkatesh and Davis [42]. This is a sign of the impediment effect of anxiety with LMS users which persists even with increasingexperience. However, EXP didpositivelymoderate the positive inﬂuence of enjoy-ment (ENJ) on PEOU (EXP·ENJﬁPEOU = 0.076). Hence, it is likely that theeffect of system enjoyment on ease of use will increase with increased experience,as reported in Venkatesh and Davis[42].
Computer playfulness (CPLY) is theorized to signiﬁcantly affect perceived easeof use (PEOU) as per TAM3. However, our ﬁndings indicate that computer play-fulness fails to impact LMS ease of use which indicates that participants couldnotachieve an acceptable level of intrinsic motivation while using the LMS in order tofoster their perceptions regarding LMS ease of use. Thus, users feel that the systemhas no playfulness merit which otherwise would let users to perceive the system aseasy to use rather than being awkward and complex. This situation did not changewhen the CPLYﬁPEOU relationship was moderated by experience(EXP·CPLYﬁPEOU = 0.007). The insigniﬁcant interaction of experience onthe effect of CPLY on PEOU could be interpreted such that, gaining moreexperience has an unconstructive role with regard to how computer playfulnessimpetus LMS’ ease of use. In other words, even experienced users still perceiveLMS with no playfulness merit because they couldnot achieve an acceptable levelof intrinsic motivation which in turn fails to inﬂuence their perceptions regardingLMS ease of use.
Venkatesh[41]posited that the effects of adjustments on perceived ease of use(PEOU) were stronger with more hands-on experience with the system. Our studyconﬁrmed that the positive effect of enjoyment (ENJ) on PEOU (ENJﬁPEOU) relationship was signiﬁcant when moderated by EXP (EXP·ENJﬁ PEOU = 0.076,p< 0.05). Although this study lacks a longitudinal merit, ourﬁndings indicate that more experienced users will enjoy using the system which willEmpirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation 45enable them to perceive the system as more easy to use. In summation, experience(EXP) as a moderator variable was signiﬁcantly moderating ﬁve paths of the sevenrelationships identiﬁed in TAM3 as shown inFig. 1. Therefore,H
7is partially supported.
7. Interventions
It has been advised by academics and practitioners that managers need to developand implement effectiveinterventionsin order to maximize end-users’ IT adoptionand use[28]. Therefore, identifying interventions that could inﬂuence adoptionand use of new ITs can aid managerial decision making on successful IT imple-mentation strategies[28]. TAM3 paved the way to comprehend the role of inter-ventions in IT acceptance and assimilation contexts, based on delineating thepredictors of PU and PEOU. In TAM3, Venkatesh and Bala [44]classiﬁed inter- ventions into two categories:pre-implementationandpost-implementationinterven- tions motivated by the stage models of IT implementation and type of intervention(e.g., design characteristics, user participation, incentive alignment, training, orga-nizational and peer support). TAM3 also contributes to management with respectto interventions by supporting managerial decision making with two complement-ing alternatives[44]: Firstly, managers are provided with a framework to decidewhat interventions to apply during pre- and post-implementation stages and forwhat types of systems. Secondly, managers can decide on resource allocationfor each speciﬁc intervention anchored by the impact of such intervention on dif-ferent determinants of IT acceptance and assimilation, and system type.
As noted earlier, this study has the shortcoming of lacking a longitudinal meritand thus cannot justifypre-implementationinterventions from the ﬁeld. However,participants clearly acknowledged that they strongly desire to be given the choicebetween LMS alternatives based on ample presentations and demonstrations inorder to alleviate initial resistance and develop genuine perceptions of system fea-tures, capabilities, and relevance to enhance future system acceptance andassimilation.
7.1. Post-implementation interventions
Post-implementation interventions represent a set of organizational, managerial,and support activities that take place after the deployment of a system to enhancethe level of system acceptance by users[44]. Post-implementation interventions canbe vital so that users are able to go through the initial shock and react favorably tochanges associated with the new system. The core theme of post-implementationinterventions should be to make users feel that the new system is an opportunityto enhance their job performance, and give them the ability and necessaryresources to use the new system smoothly[44]. TAM3 suggests a group ofpost-implementation interventions: training, organizational support, and peer46 S.S. Al-Gahtanisupport that will be particularly relevant to each of the determinants of PU andPEOU.
In the following, we reﬂect on the concept of post-implementation interventionsto our study ﬁndings by giving an example of one determinant of perceived useful-ness and one determinant of perceived ease of use which were not signiﬁcant andapply the suitable intervention, as alleviation, to each case.
(a) Our study reports that result demonstrability as a predictor of perceived use-fulness was not signiﬁcant which might indicate that participants do notbelieve that the results of using LMS are tangible, observable, and commu-nicable[31]. In order to alleviate this situation, TAM3 suggests a bunch ofpost-implementation interventions such as: training, organizational support,and peer support which will be particularly relevant in this situation.(b) Our study reports that computer playfulness as a predictor of perceived easeof use was not signiﬁcant which might indicate that participants could notachieve an acceptable level of intrinsic motivation while using the LMS soas to perceive LMS as easy to use. In order to soothe this situation,TAM3 suggests training as the sole post-implementation intervention whichwill be particularly relevant and adequate to let users feel spontaneous andplayful while using the system.
8. Limitations
Our study has its own limitations. This study was set to utilize TAM3 to empiri-cally investigate the acceptance and assimilation of e-learning in a developingcountry. However, our study is not an exact replication of the study conductedby Venkatesh and Bala[44]to develop TAM3. Our study applied cross-sectional design and used a sample from a single organization compared to theVenkatesh and Bala study which used a longitudinal design with a sample of sub-jects included from four different organizations. Venkatesh and Bala [44]used conventional regression analysis (MRA), as the statistical technique to analyzetheir data. In contrast, our study employed PLS-based structural equation model-ing (PLS-SEM), a more powerful technique to conduct the data analysis. We hopethis analytical technique is a credit providing additional support for the validity ofthe results of our model.
With this study only having tested a single LMS technology (Bb) in one devel-oping country, the generalizability of our ﬁndings are quite limited as well. Thereis a need to conduct additional studies applying TAM3 to developing nations togain further support for the ﬁndings of this study as discussed below in the futurestudies of e-learning acceptance.Empirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation 478.1. Future studies of e-learning acceptance
Singh and Hardaker[38]suggest that future studies of e-learning acceptanceshould target both the micro-level reﬂecting on several aspects such as: individu-alist perspective considering the different backgrounds, experiences and motiva-tions of individual academics; and the macro-level considering variousorganizational and environmental settings. This study supports this recommenda-tion and suggests that future research needs to close the gap between these twoapproaches by developing a more integrated theoretical framework that providesa means to diminish the overshadow effects of organizational roles and organiza-tional and environmental settings over the personal characteristics inspiring fruit-ful future research ﬁndings.
Additionally, future studies could be conducted to examine TAM3 using sam-ples of students and instructors from different geo-locations and a wider range ofe-learning systems. This could involve testing TAM3 by including the technologyusage behavior construct omitted from our research model, which would increasethe predictable levels of e-learning acceptance. Furthermore, the full TAM3 modelcould be tested in future studies by including the objective usability constructwhich needs special research design to enable the key stroke model which wereferred to in the research method above.
9. Conclusions
Contemporary organizations spend vast amounts of resources in ITs which arebecoming progressively complex, and implementation costs are tremendouslyescalating with time. Implementation failures of many of today’s ITs cost millionsof dollars to organizations. In addition, low acceptance and adoption manifestedin high underutilization of ITs have been a major problem for organizations.
This study develops our understanding of the determinants of e-learning accep-tance and assimilation in a developing country by testing a nomological networkbased on TAM3 using structural equation modeling. It also partially advocates theconcept of interventions – as per TAM3 – that can favorably inﬂuence these deter-minants so that management can proactively decide on implementing the rightinterventions to minimize resistance to this relatively new IT, and maximize itseffective utilization.
All hypotheses of direct effect relationships, as per TAM3 in Fig. 1, were sup- ported except two relationships: computer playfulness (CPLY)ﬁperceived ease of use (PEOU) and result demonstrability (RES)ﬁperceived usefulness (PU).Seven out of nine hypotheses of moderating effects relationships, as per TAM3inFig. 1, were supported. We hope that this adds further conﬁdence in ourresearch design and we also hope that future studies can refer to these ﬁndingsfor comparison and discussions.48 S.S. Al-GahtaniAcknowledgment
