Abstract 
A sentence alignment model based on combined clues and Kernel Extensional Matrix Matching (KEMM) method is proposed. In this model, a similarity matrix for sentence aligning is formed by the similarities of bilingual sentences calculated by the combined clues, such as lexicon, morphology, length and special symbols, etc.; then this similarity matrix is used to construct a select matrix for sentence aligning; finally, obtains the sentence alignments by KEMM. Experimental results illustrated that our model outperforms over the Gale’s system on handling any types of sentence alignments, with 30% total sentence alignment error rate decreasing.

1. Introduction In various fields of research on natural language processing, the importance of bilingual corpus is more and more obvious. Different applications call for aligne d bilingual corpus of different granularities and corresponding technology, which includes article, paragraph, sentence, phrase and word level. Sentence level aligned bilingual corpus is indispensable to example based machine translation.

 A sentence alignment model based on combined clue s and KEMM method is proposed. In this model, a similarity matrix for sentence aligning is formed by the similarities of bilingual sentences calculated by the combined clues; then this similarity matrix is used to construct a select matrix for sentence aligning; finally, obtains the sentence alignments by KEMM. 2.  Similarities of Bilingual Sentences Calculated By the Combined Clues To the translations needed to have sentence alignmen t for Chinese text C and Japanese text J, we assume that the number of C is m and to be expressed as C=CS
1CS 2…CS m , the number of J is n and to be expressed as J=JS
1JS2…JS n. The similarities of all bilingual sentences calculated  by the combined clues included lexicon, morphology and length. Results by each approach are summed up after multiplied by different weights and then plus special symbols similarity to be the final similarity between Chinese and Japanese sentences. The formula to calculate similarity of Chinese sentence CS
h and Japanese sentence JS k:

It can be thought base d on statistic that Pr(P|<CS,JS>) is only decided by matching pattern match(P) of P and the length of CS and JS.  Since the Bayesian theory:

Based on Special Character Numbers (such as 1978, 03, 24, etc.), English characters (such as China, Henry, etc.), quotation marks and brackets are used to calculate the similarity of Chines e and Japanese special characters. The maximum value of special characters’ similarity (SValue) is set as 0.2. When CS
h and JS k have the same special characters, SValue(CS
h,JSk) is added 0.05, and it’s added to 0.2 for max. It is a supplement for the similarity calculating of SimDict,SimMorph and SimLength. 2.5. Multi-alignment Penalty Factor Multi-alignment penalty factor is to deal with alignm ent conflict. For an instance, when aligned conflicts happen and judge if the style is 1-2 or the two aligned 1-1 and 0-1, we need to calculate the similarity of these three kinds and then multiply the corresponding penalty factor. Then we can compare their similarity modified. We stat the proportion of different alignment in Chinese and Japanese corpus including 9679 aligned sentences. Combining researches to set the penalty factor (ȟ) as the table 1 shows.

 3. SentenceMatching Based on Kernel Extensional Matrix Method 3.1. Alignment Similarity Matrix and Alignment Selecting Matrix       An alignment similarity two-dimensional matrix  (SimMatrix) is constructed by Chinese and Japanese sentences that the number of them is m and n. The element in the matrix is the similarity.

Each element is the sorting information of the alignment similarity. 3.2. Sentence Matching       Sentence matching is to choose the alignmen t results from the sentence alignment selecting matrix. 1) Select the Alignment in “1/1” Row       Six steps are included in this process.       Step1: According to the SelMatrix to select the location where "1/1" is. And then construct a 3h3 matrix to calculate similarity and check the probability if there is some multi-alignment.        Step2:To calculate the probability of the multi-alignment. 
  If SelMatrix[i-1][j-1] = “1/1” and SelMatrix[i+1][j+1] = “1/1”; 
 NCA = (CSi)-(JSj);   Else If SelMatrix[i-1][j-1] or SelMatrix[i+1][j+1] is not "1/1"

      If MutiSim is larger than NCA, we put the mu lti-alignment into CandSet. Otherwise turn to step5.       Step3:To judge the style of new member of CandSet. Processing is according to its style.       Step4:The new multi-alignment processing can be consider ed as 10 categories, and one of them can be made formal to : If

      Step5:Add the ensured alignment in the aligned queue and record the aligning status of sentences.       Step6:To judge whether all "1/1" locations are dealt with. If not, turn to step1.  2) Select the Alignment not in “1/1” Row       This processing is to look for the locations without "1/1" and look for the minimum sum of similarity in its row. And then to judge whether cross-aligned will be happened in this location.       And the processing in column is similar with the processing above.3) Spatial Alignment Processing        Step1:To look for unaligned row. 472   Wu Honglin et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  468 – 473 
 
       Step2:To select the point "1/1" in the previous row and back row. And then to calculate the similarity of the unaligned row with previous row and back row.       Step3:To compare the modified multi-alignment similarity with the point.       Step4:Accoring to the comparing results to deal with them further.       Step5:To store the results and record the alignment status. And to look for if there is any unaligned row. 4. Expriments and Results Analysis       The test set used in sentence alignment expri ment is randomly selected from the Chinese and Japanese chapter-aligned corpus and they are artifically marked standard answers of stence alignment.The test set includes 558 alignments, the style distribution shown as table 2.        To verify the effectiveness of the model put forward in this paper, we achieve the sentence alignment system with the method given in this paper. We test th e error rate of the system we construct on the test set and compare the results with Gale system which is famous in sentence alignment field.

Table 3 shows the distributionof all kinds of alignment style in our test set and corpus. We can see that the distribution of our test set is approaching the distribution of our corpus. So our test set is representative, it can represent the test result of our corpus.

We achieve the align method in Gale as beseline sy stem. But the test results of the system have differences from reference (it’s worse than the results in  reference). So the data is not faith to Gale system. We use the better experimental results from Gale shown in reference. As shown in table 3, the distribution of our test set is approaching the test set in Gale. So this comparison is faithful. Test set in Gale includes some rare alignment and they don’t appeared in our test set. Since the experiental results in Gale show that the error rate of processing the styles is 100%, the difference cannot make effects. So the comparison is sloped to Baseline. In summary, we try our best to ensure the faith and accurate in experiment. Table 4 shows the experiental results of sentence alignment.       From the table 4, we can know that our system  has a lower error rate. We analysis the test results and find that the reson for lower error rate is to use the KEMM to avoid error spreading phenomenon.        On all kinds of alignment styles our system always has a lower error rate than Gale system. The error rate of our system is 2.3% and Gale is 3.5%. The ex primental results and analysis above fully prove the effectiveness of our calculating model. 473  Wu Honglin et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  468 – 473

5. Conclusion       A sentence alignment model based on combined clues and Kernel Extensional Matrix Matchingmethod is proposed in this paper.       In this model, a similarity matrix for sentence a ligning is formed by the similarities of bilingual sentences calculated by the combined clues, such as lexicon, morphology, length and special symbols, etc.; then this similarity matrix is used to construct a select matrix for sentence aligning; finally, obtains the sentence alignments by KEMM.       Experimental results illustrated that our model out performs over the Gale’s system on handling any types of sentence alignments, with 30% total sentence alignment error rate decreasing. These can prove the effectiveness of our model proposed in this paper.
