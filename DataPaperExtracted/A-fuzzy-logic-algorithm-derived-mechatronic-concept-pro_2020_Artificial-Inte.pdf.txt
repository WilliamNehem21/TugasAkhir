Keywords:Intra-row weed controlMechatronic prototypeFuzzy logic algorithmPlant damageWeeding efﬁciencyCrop damage during the intra-row weed eradiation is one of the biggest challenges in intercultural agriculturaloperations. Several available mechanical systems provide effective weeding but result in excess crop damage.On the other hand, chemical based systems have been raising serious environmental and food concerns. Thisstudy presents development of a cost-effective mechatronic prototype for intra-row weeding operation. The pri-mary focus was on incurring minimal crop damage. The system integrates time of ﬂight and inductive sensing into fuzzy logic algorithm for electronic control of a four-bar linkage mechanism (FBLM). The crank of FBLMwas connected to the vertical rotary weed control shaft with weeding blades. The crop sensing triggers the elec-tronic control to laterally shift the control shaft away from crop, proportional to the forward speed and soil con-ditions. The developed algorithm incorporates varied conditions of soil, forward speed, and plant spacing tocalculate dynamic lateral shift speed (SRPM). The prototype was evaluated to determine the relationships be-tween the operating conditions and electronic control parameters. Moreover, the plant damage was assessedunder varied conditions of plant spacing, forward speeds, soil cone index, operational depth and electronic con-trol parameters. The derived SRPM was established as the ultimate governing factor for avoiding crop damagethat varied signiﬁcantly with electronic response time and soil strength ( Pb0.05). Plant damage increased signif- icantly under higher forward speeds and lower plant spacing ( Pb0.05). Preliminaryﬁeld evaluation of the devel- oped prototype showed a signiﬁcant potential of this system for effective control on weeds ( N65%) and crop damage (b25%).© 2020 The Authors.

1. IntroductionWeeds are the non-native species of plants that restrict or deterio-rate the quality crop production in agriculture ( Tu et al., 2001). Weeds compete against crops for nutrients, water, sunlight etc. ( Slaughter et al., 2008) and signiﬁcantly reduce the crop yield. In the row crops,theﬁeld is invaded by inter and intra-row weeds. Weeds in the intra-row zone reduce cop yield up to 33% or more ( Knezevic, 2002;Peruzzi et al., 2007). Therefore, timely and well-planned management practicesare essential. Several systems are available that provide effective weedcontrol in the inter-row zone, whereas, weed control in the intra-rowzone is still a huge challenge. The biggest challenge during intra-rowweed control is damage to main crop plants. A tractor hitched lightweight weeding equipment is reported to incur a maximum yield lossbelow 4%. This is in comparison to the yield from zero post-drillingﬁeld trafﬁc treatment. On the other side, heavy weeding equipmenthas been reported to incur yield losses between 1.2% and 8.7% ( Van Dooren, 1994;Kouwenhoven, 1997). Such situation demands systemsthat are light weight and efﬁcient in intra-row weed control withoutany interference with main crop plants.Manual methods of weed control are the smoothest but demand ex-cessive labor and costs. Besides, manual methods demand continuoushuman bending and at times exposure to infectious weeds species.Overall, manual methods pose health risks and have been thereforeabandoned in major developed countries ( Tewari et al., 1993;Tu et al., 2001;Weide et al., 2008;Tewari et al., 2014a;Tewari et al., 2014b; Chandel et al., 2018a;Chethan et al., 2018a, 2018b). Several mechanical systems have been developed and modiﬁed for intra-row weed control while intending no crop interference. These include ﬁnger weeder, tor- sion weeder, brush weeder, spring tine harrows, rotary weeder and cul-tivators. However, these require specialized conditions of soil and plantsArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 116 –126

Chemical methods of weed control have also been extensively explored. How-ever, increasing health hazards, environmental concerns, herbicide re-sistant weed species, demand for low cost and chemical freeproduction have challenged researchers to explore alternative ap-proaches for weed control (Astrand and Baerveldt, 2002;Kurstjens, 2007;Dedousis et al., 2007;Tillett et al., 2008;Norremark et al., 2008; Chethan et al., 2019). Biological methods have also been explored forweed control, but target distraction and uncontrolled insects result inpoor efﬁcacy (Harris, 1971). Soil steaming, laser radiation andﬂaming are other approaches of intra-row weed control and keeping heat toler-ant crop plants unaffected (Raffaelli et al., 2013;Fontanelli et al., 2015). These methods are effective only under particular soil and plant condi-tions. Moreover, demand for extra steam and ﬂame generation systems make them excess fuel consuming and expensive ( Melander and Kristensen, 2011;Marx et al., 2012).Based on the current state of intra-row weed control, advent of non-invasive sensors and instrumentation integrated to mechanical actuatorsystems (Tewari et al., 2017;;Chandel et al., 2018a, 2018b;Chethan et al., 2018a, 2018b;Tewari et al., 2018;Nare et al., 2019;Ranjan et al., 2019) may provide reliable crop damage control during the operation.Such mechatronic systems can potentially provide site and species-speciﬁc weed-plant discrimination. Autonomous decision-making algo-rithms can assist in effective plant damage and weed control withoutenvironmental risks (Slaughter et al., 2008;Christensen et al., 2009; Bakker et al., 2010;Shaner and Beckie, 2013;Young et al., 2014; Bajwa et al., 2015). Some of the recently developed mechatronic sys-tems for intra-row weed control are robovator (Frank Poulsen Engi-neering Aps., Hvalsø, Denmark), robocrop (Tillett and HagueTechnology Ltd., England), IC-cultivator (Machinefabriek Steketee BV,Netherlands) and remoweed (Costruzioni Meccaniche Ferrari, Italy),(O'Dogherty et al., 2007;Tillett et al., 2008). All these intelligent intra- row weeding systems incorporate extensive imaging, processing andcontrol systems. Although a satisfactory control over crop damage isachievable, a wide plantation spacing is required. This compromisescrop yield without any signiﬁcant difference in weeding as comparedto the non-intelligent systems (
Fennimore et al., 2014;Melander et al., 2015). Inclusion of expensive cameras, electronic and hydraulic controlsfurther increase the system and operations costs ( Melander et al., 2015). Crop damage persists to be the major challenge during intra-rowweed control. Crop damage due to sensing and actuation errors duringweeding have been reported within 5% to 23.7% ( Norremark et al., 2008;Cordill and Grift, 2011;Manuel et al., 2014). However, several low-cost non-invasive sensors available today can potentially discrimi-nate weed and crop plants under variedﬁeld conditions. Recent studies have reported a signiﬁcant difference between crop and weed heightsduring the weeding recommended period. This is prominent for major-ity of the widely spaced crops (Van der et al., 2006;Mcdonald et al., 2009;Karimmojeni et al., 2010;Andujar et al., 2012). The study utilizes this concept, to integrate low cost time of ﬂight sensors to discriminate crop and weeds during the intra-row weed control process. Speci ﬁco b - jectives are (1) development of an intra-row weeding prototype withmechanical, electronic and algorithmic controls for real time crop detec-tion, and damage avoidance and, (2) assessment of the system actuationparameters and varied operating conditions on crop damage along withpreliminaryﬁeld evaluations.2. Material and methodsThe study is focused on development of a weeding system that canavoid crop interference in real time through sensors and automatedfuzzy logic control algorithms. Steps toward development of such sys-tem and its evaluation are described below.2.1. Design of intra-row weeder for crop interference avoidanceA prototype of intra-row weeder was developed with four bar link-age (FBL) mechanical actuator, electronic, sensing and control systems(Fig. 1). The actuator unit consists of a vertical axis rotary shaft that ro-tates about its own axis and shifts laterally about the FBL axis. This shaftmounts an iron ring towards the ground end. This ring has weedingblades mounted at its periphery, perpendicular to the plane of rotation.Shaft rotation about its own axis is aimed at weed eradication in theintra-row zone. Whereas, the lateral shift is meant to avoid the crop in-terference during the operation (Fig. 2). The working principle for weed control shaft is shown through a block diagram ( Fig. 3. The system func- tioning is initiated by the crop plant detection using an ultrasonic sensorin real time (28015 PING, Parallax Inc., Rocklin, CA, USA). Ultrasonic sen-sor was used for its low cost and capability of sensing the signi ﬁcant dif- ferences in crop and weed height during the weeding period. Theultrasonic sensor was placed on a telescopic rod at a certain distanceahead of the weeding shaft. This distance was calculated from the oper-ating delay associated with signal processing and control system. The

Kumar et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 116 –126sensor was placed above the average crop-weed height differencewithin theﬁeld and is customizable based on the crop conditions. Thetime ofﬂight is sensed for interference and signal is transmitted to a mi-croprocessor (ATmega 2560). Fuzzy logic algorithm developed in themicroprocessor environment calculates the actuation parametersbased on sensor response, soil, forward speed and plantation conditions.Actuation signal is then transmitted to the motor controller (HB-25, Par-allax Inc., Rocklin, CA, USA). The controller then actuates the DC motor(WORMDRV-G200-12, Parramatta, NSW, Australia) through pulsewidth modulation (PWM) for lateral shift of the rotary arm for thetime, estimated from algorithm.Three inductive type proximity sensors (18 –14 DP2, Autonics, Navi Mumbai, India) were also integrated within the system for positionsensing. First proximity sensor (P1) was mounted on a ground wheelto calculate the forward translation speed of the system. This dynamicparameter is used as an input to the control algorithm. Rest twoproximity sensors (P2 and P3) were placed at extreme ends to restrictthe shaft movement within the operating zone.2.2. Fuzzy logic algorithm for plant damage avoidanceMechanical systems for weed control do provide an acceptableweeding efﬁciency however, the major disadvantage is high plant dam-age. Plant damage can be prevented by pulling out the weeding instru-ment (tool or rotary shaft) from the crop row at right time. Such controlis possible with electronic sensing and appropriate algorithm directedcontrols. Therefore, a fuzzy logic algorithm was integrated to the devel-oped weeding system to direct shaft withdrawal (i.e. lateral shifting)from the crop row within the safe time. The developed algorithm is ini-tiated by a continuous signal stream received from the ultrasonic sensoron detection of crop plant presence. Other dynamic operating parame-ters in the algorithm include forward speed of operation, intra-row

Kumar et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 116 –126crop spacing and control shaft position. Electronic control parameters oftotal response (TRT), actuation (AT), delay (DT) and hold times (HT) arethen calculated on plant to plant basis. The ﬂow chart of integrated fuzzy logic algorithm is presented inFig. 4. As per the stated view of intra-row weeder as a ﬁnite state system, the control process is divided intoﬁve sequential states (1) plant not de-tected and control shaft in crop row (S0), (2) plant detected but controlshaft in crop row (S1), (3) control shaft shifting away from crop row(S2), (4) control shaft held at an extreme position from crop row (S3)and (5) control shaft position retaining towards the crop row (S4).These states are initiated by three independent timers (Timer1,Timer2 and Timer3) interfaced to the microcontroller. Firstly, (setup()) all the initializations were made and a timer interrupt of one secondwas conﬁgured in Timer2 to rescan the soil cone index (CI) and forwardspeed and calculate all delay intervals. Secondly, instantaneous lateralshift speed of the control shaft (SRPM) is calculated as a function of for-ward speed and CI within same interrupt. This process utilizesfuzziﬁcation and defuzziﬁcation equations derived from simple me-chanics. Thirdly, the distance between crop plant and ultrasonic sensoris compared with the set threshold distance (DSP) in each iteration. DSPselection is based on excluding the sensor values at two conditions(1) no crop plant in front of sensor and (2) crop plant in front of sensor.If the distance is less than the DSP, then the state S1 is switched byTimer1 at an interval equal to delay time (DT). After DT, the systemstate is switched from S1 to S2 where the DC motor actuates for timeAT conﬁgured in Timer3. After AT, the system state shifts to S3 andthe DC motor halts for a hold time (HT) con ﬁgured in Timer3. The hold position is detected by the P3. Passage of HT shifts the systemstate to S4 where DC motor actuation reverses (-SRPM) to retain thecontrol shaft in the intra-row zone. Retainment continues until a nega-tive external interrupt is received from P2 at the initial shaft position.The error time between S3 and S4 is also recorded for the currentcycle and incorporated in the next actuation cycle. After the external in-terrupt is received from P2, the DC motor stops and system state shiftsto S0 for next actuation cycle.2.2.1. Process parameters for the electronic shaft controlThe forward speed of operation (v, m/s) was consistently calculated(1) from a falling edge external interrupt P1 during system state varia-tion. P1 counts the metal bids (count) per second, placed at eight dia-metrical ends on ground wheel (diameter = D, m). The AT (ms) isthen calculated (Eq.(2)) as an inverse function of forward speed. Mini-mum AT was set to 100 ms and actuation was set to start 50 mm beforethe crop plant location to avoid interference. The DT for shaft actuation50 mm before the crop plant is calculated as a function of forward speedand distance between ultrasonic sensor and control shaft ( x, m). An ad- ditional time interval of HT (ms) is also calculated to hold the controlshaft at extreme end, off the crop row. HT is calculated as a function offorward speed (v) and crop length (calculated from a series of ultrasonicsensor signals,y, m). The total response time (TRT) during the shaftcontrol process was calculated as the summation of AT, HT and DT(Eq.(5)). The schematic showing AT, HT and DT presented in Fig. 5.v¼

CI is the measure ofsoil strength that may affect the forward speed of operation andSRPM. SRPM will be apparently higher for a lesser actuation time andhigher CI. The fuzzy matrix (Table 1) was designed for three ranges ofCI and AT. The triangular membership functions (Eqs. (6), (7)) were found suitable for CI and AT fuzziﬁcations (Fig. 6) among trapezoidal, Gaussian and triangular functions. The weightage matrix ( Table 2) was then constructed by using minima (Eq. (8)) of CI and AT functions from their corresponding low, medium and high range values. Similarly,the SRPM defuzziﬁcation was calculated using maxima of the CI and ATmembership functions (Eqs.(9), (10), (11)). SRPM was then calculated using combinations of fuzziﬁcation and defuzziﬁcation equations (Eq.(12))(Witold, 1994;Victor et al., 2013). W:CI3½/C138 ¼W:CI

Performance evaluation of the instrumented prototype in soil binThe developed prototype was tested in the instrumented soil binunder varied operating conditions. Firstly, the effect of operating condi-tions on electronic control parameters was evaluated. Secondly, the sys-tem behavioral parameters such as torque employed during weedingring operation in soil, draft force encountered during lateral shift of con-trol shaft were observed. Lastly, the effect of system and operating con-ditions was observed on the plant damage.2.3.1. Instrumentation arrangement for system evaluationThe developed prototype was mounted on externally controlled me-chanical trolley provisioned for a varied range of forward speeds anddepth arrangements. A torque transducer of 200 Nm capacity(T20WN, Hottinger Baldwin Mesurements, Darmstadt, Germany) wasalso installed between the DC motor and ﬁnal drive mechanism to de- termine the torque employed during the weeding ring operation inthe soil. Two load cells (L1 and L2) of 12 kN capacity (F 214, NovatechMeasurements Limited, East Sussex, England) were installed betweenthe implement trolley and prototype to measure the draft force encoun-tered during the operation. An additional load cell (L3) was installed be-tween the DC motor and control shaft to measure the force encounteredduring the lateral shifting. All the transducers were connected to a datalogger (1-MX840-PAKEASY, Hottinger Baldwin Mesurements, Darm-stadt, Germany) that was interfaced to a remote computer for realtime data recording. A liquid crystal display (LCD) was installed withthe control system inboard the developed prototype to display the lat-eral shift speed(SRPM), AT, TRT and DT.2.3.2. Operating conditions setupThe soil bin setup was prepared as per the ﬁeld conditions typically as observed during the weeding recommended period. Sandy clay loamsoil was collected from the research farm and prepared for a bed depthof 0.5 m and a moisture content of 15 –18% dry bulk. To establish the var-ied soil conditions, soil compactness (strength, CI) was varied using var-ious tillage and soil preparation implements on-board the trolley. The CIwas then measured using a cone penetrometer with a calibrated ringtransducer. A series of well grown plants were then planted in the soilbin for evaluation of effects on plant damage. The heights of these plantswere maintained well above the generalized weed heights. Moreover,the plantation heights and widths were maintained non-uniformly toensure dynamicity during system evaluation. The ultrasonic sensorheight was then adjusted to the minimum plant height amongst theplanted series.2.3.3. EvaluationThe evaluation study was designed for four independent operatingparameters viz. forward speed, plantation spacing, operational depthand cone index. These parameters were divided individually into threedifferent levels to determine the most suitable plantation, soil and sys-tem conditions for minimum plant damage during weeding operation.Three operational speeds of 0.96, 1.71 and 2.58 km/h were selectedthat were within the recommended ranges ( Dedousis et al., 2007; Ahmad, 2012). Similarly, CIs of 300 kPa, 400 kPa and 500 kPa were se-lected for soil conditions. Operational depths of 20 mm, 40 mm and60 mm and plantation spacings of 300 mm, 400 mm and 500 mmwere selected for prototype evaluation. A total of 81 operating condi-tions were obtained (Table 3) and evaluation at each condition was rep-licated thrice. As a result, the percentage damaged plants (Eq. (13))a n d SRPM behavior were recorded as response variables during the experi-mental trials. A plant was considered to be damaged if uprooted by thecontrol shaft during the operation. The effects of operating parameters

The ﬁeld was uniformly prepared using the primary and secondary tillage equipment. The cropswere planted at an inter and intra-row spacings of 50 cm. The developedarrangement was mounted on a frame and then on to the tractor three-point linkage. The rotary motion was provided by the tractor PTO. Theaverage soil compaction of 473.42 kPa was observed from 10 randomsamples within theﬁeld. The tractor was operated at the best speed ofoperation observed from the soil bin evaluations (1.8 km/h) and corre-sponding SRPM of 175 rpm was selected. This is also the speed which isrecommended for general weeding operations ( Dedousis et al., 2007; Ahmad, 2012). The operation depths were set to 20 and 40 mm for allthe speeds of operation and were approximately maintained using thecalibrated position and draft control levers on the tractor. The weedingefﬁciency (Eq.(14)) was calculated based on the number of weeds be-fore and after the operation. The average weeding ef ﬁciency for all trials was calculated from 5 random locations, sampled using the aluminumframes. Moreover, the plant damage (%) was also assessed from 10rows of operations for both the crops. Each row was planted with 50

The relation-ships obtained for AT and TRT wereﬁrst veriﬁed using one-way ANOVA at different operating conditions. Secondly, the SRPM modelled fromfuzzy logic algorithm was analyzed using stepwise multiple regressionanalysis as a function of independent operating parameters and their in-teractions. Similarly, the DP was also analyzed using stepwise multipleregression. Lastly, the effect of SRPM on DP was also analyzed. Fitnessof resultant regression models were assessed using ANOVA. A two-samplet-test was used to compare the weeding ef ﬁciencies and plant damages forﬁeld evaluations.3. Results and discussion3.1. Fuzzy logic algorithm derived control shaft lateral shift speed pramatersThe lateral shift of control shaft was observed for an average AT(Fig. 7a) of 310.07 ms (SE: ±8.35 ms) at a forward speed of 0.96 km/h. Similarly, the average lateral shift ATs of 238.63 ms (SE: ±11.62 ms) and 167.89 ms (SE: ±8.64 ms) were recorded at the forward

Kumar et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 116 –126speeds of 1.71 and 2.58 km/h, respectively. The average lateral shiftTRTs (Fig. 7b) of 1000.22 ms (SE: ±29.13 ms), 676.23 ms (SE: ±30.80 ms) and 386.89 ms (SE: ±21.19 ms) were recorded at forwardspeeds of 0.96, 1.71 and 2.58 km/h, respectively. Similarly, the averagelateral shift SRPMs (Fig. 7c) of 154.85 rpm (SE: ±4.38 rpm),176.41 rpm (SE: ±3.44 rpm) and 191.60 rpm (SE: ±2.24 rpm) were ob-tained at the forward operational speeds of 0.96, 1.71 and 2.58 km/h, re-spectively. Furthermore, the SRPMs modelled from the fuzzy algorithmincreased with decreasing AT (Fig. 7d) and increasing CI. The averageSRPM values of 163.41 rpm (SE: ±5.03 rpm), 173.77 rpm (SE: ±4.42 rpm) and 183.67 rpm (SE: ±3.33 rpm) were obtained at CIs of300 kPa, 400 kPa and 500 kPa, respectively. The results of one-wayANOVA indicate variation in AT to be signi ﬁcantly dependent on for- ward speed of operation (F
1,79= 109.38,Pb0.001). Similarly, the TRT of the entire lateral shift movement was also affected by the forwardspeed of operation (One-wayANOVA,F
1,79= 248.65,Pb0.001). The multiple regression analysis further veri ﬁed that the SRPM modelled in the fuzzy algorithm was signiﬁcantly affected by the combination ofAT and CI (R
2=0.65,F 2,78=7 1 . 9 2 ,Pb0.001), however, their interac- tion was insigniﬁcant. Since, AT had strong dependence on forwardspeed, the SRPM was also found to be dependent on forward speed(Ahmad, 2012;Home, 2003). Furthermore, SRPM was unaffected bythe operational depth. Since, the AT, TRT, SRPM held strong relation-ships with the forward speed, it was solely used to avoid cofounding ef-fect in the multiple regression analysis. The relationships designed forsystem parameters within the fuzzy logic algorithm were veri ﬁed under all operating conditions. SRPM was obtained as an indirect dy-namic function of forward speed that is entirely dependent on soil prop-erties, system slippage and other unknown internal and externalmechanical interactions. Therefore, SRPM is the ultimate parameterthat guides the control shaft for efﬁcient weed removal while also avoiding crop plant interference (i.e. DP). This SRPM may be more sen-sitive under dynamicﬁeld conditions (Abidine et al., 2004). However, these conditions are more likely to be within the range of operating con-ditions considered during the system evaluation.3.2. Effects of electronic control and operating parameters on plant damageThe analysis of crop plant damage was conducted as an effect ofprominent electronic control and operating conditions. The crop plant

Kumar et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 116 –126damage (Fig. 8) increased signiﬁcantly with the forward speed of oper-ation, intra-row plant spacing and their interactions ( Multiple Regres- sion,R
2=0.98,F 3,77= 1530,Pb0.001) (Home, 2003;Abidine et al., 2004;Perez-Ruiz et al., 2012). The average plant damages of 2.90%(SE: ±0.47%), 3.53% (SE: ±0.56%) and 4.07% (SE: ±0.63%) were ob-served at forward operational speeds of 0.96, 1.71 and 2.58 km/h, re-spectively. Similarly, the average plant damages of 6.89% (SE: ±0.18%), 3.62% (SE: ±0.15%) and 0% were observed at the intra-row plan-tation spacings of 300 mm, 400 mm and 500 mm, respectively. Theplant damage was signiﬁcantly affected by the SRPM (Linear Regression, F
1,79= 24.91,Pb0.001) but remained unaffected by the operationaldepths. This analysis reveals that the plantation spacings and forwardspeed of operation need to be optimized in order to achieve minimumplant damage (Ahmad, 2012). However, the dynamicﬁeld conditions may demand more accurate selection of these parameters. The dynamicforces (draft and lateral shift) and torque encountered during controlshaft lateral movement were also assessed. The values were well withinthe recommended limits of weeding operation. A cycloid soil pro ﬁle (Fig. 9) obtained after the system operation indicated the intended mo-tion of the control shaft to avoid any plant interference (i.e. damage).During the preliminaryﬁeld evaluation of the system (Fig. 10), aver- age weeding efﬁciencies of 77.54 (±2.45) and 79.07% (±3.75) were ob-served for operation depths of 20 and 40 mm, respectively in the greenchili plantation. However, these differences were non-signi ﬁcant (Two- sample t-test,t
18=−1.08,P= 0.15). Similarly, the average plant dam-ages of 15.04 (±2.82) and 16.59 (±3.58) were observed at pertinentdepths and were not signiﬁcantly different (Two-sample t-test,t
18= −1.07,P= 0.30). In the tomato plantation, average weeding ef ﬁciencies of 65.64 (±3.30) and 64.87 (±3.07) and average plant damages of 18.4(±2.03) and 25.52 (±2.19) were observed at respective depths of 20and 40 mm of operation. The difference in weeding ef ﬁciencies were non-signiﬁcant (Two-sample t-test,t
18=0 . 5 4 ,P= 0.60) whereas, that in plant damages were signiﬁcant for the tomato plantation (Two-sam- ple t-test,t
18=−7.53,Pb0.001). The plant damage was slightly higherand weeding efﬁciency was slightly lower for the tomato plantation ascompared to chili plantation(Fig. 11). This can be attributed to the higher soil moisture level visible in the tomato crops that would resistthe free rotation of the weeding blade. Moreover, the larger spread ofroots of the tomato crop could have also resulted in the excess cropdamage. This suggests for crop speciﬁc feature additions in the operat- ing fuzzy algorithm for intra-row shaft shifting. Further detailed analy-sis on the agronomic causal factors for resultant plant damage andweeding efﬁciency was out of the scope of this study. A uniform soilbed preparation with uniform plantation will be critical for ef ﬁcient op- eration of the intra-row weeding systems. Future scope will include in-corporation of an automated provision to measure the soil compactionlevels in real time for real time adjustments of the SRPM. Overall, suf ﬁ- cient weeding efﬁciency and plant damage avoidance was achieved bythe developed system. The unique four bar linkage actuated weedingshaft can be integrated to various other sensor networks for effectiveeradication of the weeds in the intra-row region. Our future studieswill also include assessment of the soil properties in various sectionsof theﬁeld and their impact on intra row weeding operation. Moreover,the impact of the tractor wheel slippage on weeding ef ﬁciency and plant damage would also be assessed. These parameters will be consideredfor further reﬁnement of the system as per the crop and ﬁeld dynamics.4. ConclusionsThe fuzzy logic algorithm based on time of ﬂight and positions sen- sors provided signiﬁcant inputs for electronic control of the four-barlinkage mechanism. Pertinent actuation response timings and lateralshift speed (SRPM) parameters were found to be signi ﬁcantly depen- dent on forward operation speed, system and soil parameters. Thecrop plant damage was found to be signiﬁcantly affected by the forward operation speeds and plantation spacing and was considerably high forhigher forward speeds (higher SRPM) and lower plant spacing. Prelim-inaryﬁeld evaluations showed this system to be effective for intra-rowweed (N65%) and plant damage control (b25%) at optimum operational parameters. However, challenges pertinent to dynamic synchronizationof the electronic control, mechanical actuations and plantation charac-teristics may be consistently explored and optimized for effectiveintra-row weeding in row crops.CRediT authorship contribution statementSatya Prakash Kumar:Conceptualization, Software, Data curation,Laboratory &ﬁeld evaluation, Writing - original draft.
