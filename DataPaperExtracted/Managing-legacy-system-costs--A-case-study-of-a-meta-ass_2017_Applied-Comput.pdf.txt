KEYWORDSLegacy system costs;IT valuation;Assessment models;Solutions;Case studiesAbstractFinancial services organisations spend a signiﬁcant amount of their IT budgets maintain-ing legacy systems. This paper identiﬁes the characteristics of legacy systems and explores why suchsystems are so costly to maintain and support. Three models for the assessment and management oflegacy system costs are examined and a new meta-model that addresses differences between theexisting models is proposed. The new meta-model is then applied to a large UK ﬁnancial servicescompany - FinCo. Input data for the new meta-model are provided by the company’s senior busi-ness and IT executives and the results compared with the ﬁrm’s actual legacy system managementplans. The paper concludes by identifying improvements the company should make to these currentlegacy system management plans and its longer-term strategy for managing legacy systems.

1. IntroductionThe ﬁnancial services industry is one of the biggest spenders onIT but the majority of this spend is on maintenance activitiesrequired to keep legacy systems operational [1]. By some esti- mates, seventy-ﬁve per cent of the IT budgets of banks andinsurance companies are consumed maintaining existing sys-tems[2,3]. Consequently, identifying and implementing appro-priate solutions to contain the maintenance cost of legacysystems is a signiﬁcant requirement for many organisations.Over ﬁfteen years ago Bennet et al.[4]observed that research into legacy system assessment approached the subjectas a technical issue rather than as a broader business problem.More recently Alkazemi et al.[5]recognise this technical‘‘bias”, noting the need for tools for senior management tobe able to make informed decisions about legacy systems,while Plant[6]identiﬁes the difﬁculty of engaging seniormanagement in such decisions.Extant literature proposes a number of models for use inassessing legacy systems and recommending approaches forhow these systems should be managed to minimise their

However, while the earlier publishedmodels include a wide range of assessment criteria they do notinclude more contemporary architectural considerations suchas extensibility and interoperability. Conversely, a recentmodel by Alkazemi et al.[5]lacks recognition of detail suchas lines of code and control ﬂow as proposed by De Luciaet al.[7]. In an attempt to address these anomalies and unifythe positive features of the varying approaches, this paper pro-poses a new meta-model derived from a range of existing mod-els. The utility of the meta-model is then assessed through itsapplication to FinCo - a large UK ﬁnancial services company.By using a case study we seek to answer the following researchquestions: is the meta-model effective for analysing thecompany’s core IT system, Customer Service System(CSS), to assess whether it is a legacy system? And, if so,does the meta-model identify appropriate solutions tocontain the maintenance costs for CSS? Further details ofour research methodology, ﬁndings and conclusions arediscussed below.2. What is a legacy system?In 2001, Brooke and Ramage[9]concluded that no standarddeﬁnition of a legacy system exists. Some of the current sugges-tions include the following:/C15old information systems that remain in operation within anorganisation[10, p. 314]./C15any business critical software systems that signiﬁcantlyresist modiﬁcation and their failure can have a signiﬁcantimpact on the business[11, p. 36]./C15a legacy application or system may be based on outdatedtechnologies, but is critical to day-to-day operations [12]. Many of today’s legacy systems were built in a time whencomputer processing and storage capacity were far moreexpensive than they are today[15]. Consequently, efﬁciencyfrequently took precedence over a system being understoodor maintainable, with the inevitable consequences in terms ofdegradation[13]. System degradation can also be caused bypoor documentation and version control amongst other fac-tors, but as De Lucia et al.[7]observe, whatever the cause suchdeterioration inevitably increases maintenance costs. This lar-gely explains the high proportion of total IT expenditureorganisations commit to system maintenance. Furthermore,Alkazemi et al.[5]contend legacy systems do not reﬂect con-temporary architectural advances such as the emphasis on pro-gram reuse and construction of component libraries. Thesemore recent approaches facilitate the constant evolution of sys-tems and help prevent systems becoming legacy with theirresultant high maintenance costs.The deﬁnition of a legacy system adopted in this paper is asystem that is business critical and demonstrates one or moreof the following additional characteristics: old age, obsoletelanguages, poor if any documentation, inadequate data man-agement, a degraded structure, limited support capabilityand capacity, changed to meet business needs, increasing main-tenance costs, and lacking the necessary architecture to evolve[14,10,9,17]. It is this deﬁnition of a legacy system that isapplied to FinCo to determine whether the company’s systemcan be identiﬁed as legacy.3. Legacy system cost management solutionsA number of solutions to minimise the cost of maintaininglegacy systems have been proposed. For example, De Luciaet al.[7, p. 642]refer to ‘‘ordinary maintenance, reverse engi-neering, restructuring, reengineering, migration, wrapping,replacement with commercial off-the-shelf software and dis-carding”. These authors acknowledge that there is confusionin the use of some of these terms in the literature, notingreengineering and migration as examples.Bennet et al.[4]are more concise in proposing, ‘‘discard ”, ‘‘wrap”, ‘‘outsource”, ‘‘freeze”, ‘‘carry on”and ‘‘reverse engi-neering”as potential solutions. As it is unlikely that out-sourcing would negate the need to implement one of theother solutions proposed, the suggestion that outsourcing
offers a solution for managing legacy systems must be ques-tioned. The viability of carry on as a solution for an indeﬁniteperiod also seems questionable for a business critical system.Additionally, it is highly likely that even a very stable old sys-tem will need some form of remediation at some point. Forexample, if the availability of people with the skills requiredto support an obsolete language is in decline this will requiresome form of corrective action.Where there is consistency in the legacy system literature isin recognising that a decision on the best option to managesuch systems should be based on a structured assessmentincorporating economic and quality factors. These decisionsmust be taken and supported by a broad range of stakeholderswithin the organisation and not limited to technical consider-ations alone[14,18–20]. Additionally, research by Khadkaet al.[11]suggests that the characteristics of an organisationoperating and supporting the legacy system must be consid-ered. It is essential that organisational factors such as resis-tance to change and/or weakness in systems support bereﬂected in any proposed system solution.4. A new legacy system assessment modelRansom et al.[8], De Lucia et al.[7]and Alkazemi et al.[5] each propose models that assess a legacy system based ondeﬁned business and technical attributes and then proposesolutions to manage the system. Each model emphasises differ-ent attributes. De Lucia et al. provide more detail than theothers on business value and technical quality. However, Ran-som et al. offer important insights into gaps in organisationalcapability and culture that must be mitigated in an implemen-tation plan. Alkazemi et al., in turn, add a number of contem-porary architectural considerations. Each model thereforeincorporates valuable features but without being as compre-hensive as it could be. To address this issue we propose anew meta-model derived from the three existing models com-bining business and technical factors with contemporary archi-tecture attributes and organisational considerations to producea more extensive, uniﬁed approach that recognises the real-world complexity of legacy systems (Fig. 1).The model output can then be plotted on a decisionalmatrix[14]that indicates a recommended solution (Fig. 2). In the case of FinCo the model’s output was compared withthe company’s actual legacy system management plans to iden-tify areas of divergence and thus potential improvements inthese plans.176 J.

Figure 2Legacy system decisional matrix.Managing legacy system costs 1775. Research methodologyGiven the organisational nature of the subject under investiga-tion and the design of the meta-model it was clear that a casestudy that provided the basis for situational analysis was anappropriate research approach[21,22]. Time and resource con-straints combined with access opportunities meant a singlecase study was both a pragmatic course of action while alsoproviding the necessary exploratory device/pilot study to testthe utility of the meta-model[23]. As a large ﬁnancial servicescompany with four million accounts FinCo was identiﬁed as ahighly relevant case study, not least because in common withmany other similar companies FinCo estimates that mainte-nance of its core system, CSS, which supports the majorityof the ﬁrm’s business operations, accounts for 75–80% of theannual IT budget.A questionnaire administered face-to-face to ten of FinCo’ssenior business and IT executives was chosen as the mainmethod for data collection (seeAppendix Afor details of par-ticipants). The questionnaire focused on the following:/C15The applicability of the proposed deﬁnition of legacy sys-tems to FinCo’s CSS system./C15The applicability of the proposed meta-model’s businessand technical attributes to FinCo./C15An estimated measure of each business and technical attri-bute for FinCo’s core system./C15The applicability of the proposed meta-model’s organisa-tional attributes to legacy system solution selection forFinCo./C15An estimated measure of each organisational attribute forFinCo.Documentary analysis was also conducted on FinCo’s cur-rent IT plans to determine the actual decisions FinCo hadmade about its core system, CSS. The research data were anal-ysed using the meta-model proposed in Section 4, and the results applied in the decisional matrix. The model’s outputwas then compared with the company’s actual legacy systemmanagement plans to identify areas of divergence and thuspotential improvements in these plans.6. Analysis and ﬁndings6.1. Is CSS a legacy system?This section examines whether CSS is a legacy system or not inaccordance with the deﬁnition presented in Section 2. Eleven of the characteristics associated with legacy systemsdiscussed in Section2were investigated (Table 1). Respondents were asked to indicate which, if any, of thesecharacteristics they would associate with FinCo’s coresystem, answeringyes,no,maybeordon’t knowfor each characteristic.With 11 system characteristics and 10 respondents therewere a total of 110 responses for this part of the questionnaire.75 of the 110 responses agreed the characteristics were applica-ble to CSS and 29 said they may be. Six of the responses werenegative and none answered,don’t know. The high proportionof positive responses to these questions suggests that FinCo’sCSS platform conforms to the deﬁnition of legacy systemsproposed in Section2and should be treated as such. No legacysystem attributes other than those already identiﬁed in theliterature were proposed in response to the open questionasking for suggestions of new attributes that should beconsidered.6.2. Use of business value attributes and calculation of businessvalue index in legacy system assessmentThe meta-model has ten business value attributes. When askedwhether the 10 business attributes are used in assessing theCSS legacy platforms in FinCo, 71 of the 100 responses werepositive, nine were negative and two were don’t know (Table 2).For each individual business attribute, the very lowtovery highanddon’t knowanswers by respondents were re-coded asvalues from 1 to 5 and 0 respectively, to facilitate plotting onthe decisional matrix. Questionnaire responses with the samevalue for each of the business value attributes were aggregatedacross the ten FinCo respondents and results tabulated inTable 2. 66% of the 100 attribute values were recorded as high
orvery high. Only 5% were ratedloworvery low.

aD/K = Don’t know.178 J. Crotty, I. HorrocksThe business value for each attribute is calculated fromrespondents’ re-coded answers and then a consolidated busi-ness value is determined as shown inFig. 3.The results of these calculations are presented in Table 2. The consolidated business attribute value for FinCo’s CSS is4.12. This compares with a maximum value of 5 and placesCSS in the top two quadrants of the decisional matrix. Thehigh business value indicates that the solution recommendedby the assessment will be to conduct extensive re-engineering,replacement by a commercial off-the-shelf system (COTS) ifavailable, or continue normal system maintenance. The techni-cal value is required to complete the assessment and identify arecommended solution.6.3. Use of technical value attributes and calculation of technicalvalue index in legacy system assessmentThe meta-model has 23 technical value attributes. When askedwhether these are used in assessing the legacy systems inFinCo, 60% of the 230 responses were positive and 13% werenegative (Table 3). The highest concentration ofdon’t knowresponses was in the maintainability category. The 18 negativeresponses were distributed across 17 attributes.As for the business attributes, the technical attribute mea-sure answers were re-coded to provide an attribute value.The common re-coded values for each of the 23 technical attri-butes were aggregated across the FinCo respondents and aretabulated inTable 3.6.4. Application of decisional matrixWhen plotted in the decisional matrix the consolidated busi-ness attribute and technical attribute value for FinCo is inthe High Business Value - Low Technical Value (HBV-LTV)quadrant (Fig. 4).Maintainability attributes account for 72% of all don’t knowresponses by FinCo. To explore the impact of this con-centration ofdon’t knowresponses on the overall results, theanalysis was rerun excluding all the maintainability responses.Though the outcome is an increase in the technical value forFinCo’s CSS from 2.32 to 2.63, the combined business andrevised technical value remains in the same quadrant whenplotted in the decisional matrix.Table 2Use of business value attributes in legacy system assessment and derived value index.

Inﬂuence of organisational attributes on legacy systemsolution selectionMore than a third of respondents demonstrate uncertaintyabout the six organisational attributes identiﬁed in the litera-ture inﬂuencing legacy system remediation plans in FinCo(Table 4). This doubt is reinforced by FinCo’s IT plans whichshow limited signs of these factors being considered. The inter-nal development and maintenance value index is 4.4 comparedwith a maximum value of 5 and lower index values for all ofthe other attributes. This suggests that FinCo may have agap between its emphasis on internal development and mainte-nance and its organisational capability to deliver its legacy sys-tem management plans through these means.6.6. Legacy system management actions proposed by FinCoThe remediation actions planned by FinCo for its legacy sys-tem were identiﬁed by reviewing the company’s IT plans.These plans conclude that no suitable COTS is available toreplace FinCo’s CSS platform. This ﬁnding is consistent withthe high business value placed on the specialist functions per-formed by CSS.The remediation plans involve major reengineering of Fin-Co’s legacy platform including addressing architectural styleand consumption constraints, source code translation, operat-ing system and hardware replacement and outsourcing of datacentre management. These extensive plans are consistent withthe recommendations made by Sommerville [14]for systems mapped in the HBV-LTV quadrant when no COTS is avail-able. While the plans involve outsourcing of the data centresto capitalise on external expertise in this area, there is little evi-dence of any other limitations in FinCo’s organisational attri-butes inﬂuencing the legacy system remediation plans or beingaddressed as part of these plans.7. Conclusions and recommendationsIn this paper we set out to construct a legacy system assess-ment meta-model and then carry out situational analysis ofthe utility of this device by applying it to a real case – FinCo.In so doing we accept the argument that one rationale forusing a single case study is that it can conﬁrm or challengewhether a theory’s or model’s propositions are correct[22,23]. Our aim was therefore to use FinCo to examine theeffectiveness of the meta-model for analysing IT systems andassessing whether these are legacy systems, and, if so, the util-ity of the meta-model for identifying appropriate solutions tocontain legacy system maintenance costs.As the analysis in the previous section demonstrates, Fin-Co’s core operating platform, CSS, is business critical andexhibits a very high proportion of the characteristics attributa-ble to legacy systems. It therefore conforms to the legacy sys-tem deﬁnition we proposed in Section2and should be assessed

The high proportion of positive questionnaireresponses also indicate that the business and technical valueattributes proposed in the meta-model are valid for use inlegacy system assessment. We would add, however, that thisis not a particularly surprising ﬁnding given our meta-modelcombines business and technical factors with contemporaryarchitecture attributes and organisational considerations fromthree existing, research based, models – as discussed in Sec-tion3. The value of the uniﬁed meta-model is therefore thatit provides a holistic approach that recognises the real-worldcomplexity of legacy systems. Thus, while we accept the widelyheld view that generalising from a single case study is difﬁcult,our view is that given the meta-model’s construction it couldprove a useful analytical device for any organisation in a sim-ilar situation to FinCo.That said, there are several important observations to makeon the meta-model by way of concluding this paper. The ﬁrst isto note that despite the disparate knowledge of the FinCorespondents all but one of the individual outcomes plot intothe HBV-LTV quadrant when mapped onto the decisionalmatrix. This is also true for the mapping of the consolidatedresponse and the consolidated response excluding all answersfrom the maintainability section. Thus we conclude thatalthough the technical knowledge of the assessment partici-pants varied considerably the results show a high degree ofconsistency in the output of the meta-model.Second, given our knowledge of the FinCo respondents weattribute the high number ofdon’t knowresponses to the main-tainability section of the technical attribute list compared withbusiness attributes as due to the limited technical knowledge ofthe senior business respondents. By comparison, members ofFinCo’s technical team were better placed to offer a view onboth business and technical attributes. This suggests that bias-ing the assessment participant selection in favour of seniortechnical representatives may lead to a more informed analy-sis. However, such an approach would serve to perpetuatethe concerns discussed earlier in the paper about the lack ofbroad business participation in such important and potentiallyvery expensive decisions for FinCo, as well as ownership of theoutcome[4–6]. An alternative approach would be to share theoutput of the meta-model and decisional matrix with all theFinCo respondents in a group meeting to help foster discus-sion on the results and build greater common understandingand ownership across the institution. Another approach mightbe for respondents to complete the questionnaire in a jointforum where all of the participants have the opportunity togain a greater understanding of the questions and foster debateabout potential concerns.Finally, we note that FinCo’s IT plans to reengineer toimprove quality are consistent with the actions expected fora system assessed as being in the HBV-LTV quadrant of thedecisional matrix when no COTS is available. This indicatesthat the meta-model has identiﬁed an appropriate solutionfor FinCo to contain its CSS maintenance costs, as asked inthe research questions. However, these plans do not reﬂectthe organisational constraints identiﬁed through the compre-hensive, real-world assessment provided by the meta-model.While a very high percentage of FinCo responses indicatethe legacy system solutions selected are inﬂuenced by theorganisational attributes explored, there is only limited evi-dence of this actually happening in FinCo’s IT plans. Thisweakness in the proposed plans may have become evidentand constructively debated had the questionnaire been com-pleted in a joint forum or the results of the questionnaire dis-cussed in such a forum. They were not. Our view is, therefore,that failure to consider organisational constraints when formu-lating legacy system solutions is likely to have a signiﬁcantdetrimental impact on FinCo’s ability to execute its plans –as it would for organisations more broadly, we would argue.Ultimately, then, we would argue that the meta-model basedassessment of FinCo’s CSS legacy system suggests the com-pany re-examine its plans to ensure it has the organisationalcapabilities to deliver on them. Furthermore, by applying themeta-model to each of the platforms in its portfolio of systems,FinCo has the opportunity to establish an understanding ofthe relative needs of its platforms from a legacy system man-agement perspective and incorporate this portfolio assessmentinto its long-term IT strategy.Appendix AThe questionnaire was administered face-to-face to ten of Fin-Co’s senior business and IT executives. The FinCo participantswere as follows:– CEO– CIO– Senior Business Data Steward– Head of Business Change Management– Head of IT Strategy & Architecture– Head of Business Management for IT– Head of IT Development– Head of IT Change Delivery– Head of IT Governance & Security– Head of IT Production ServicesReferences
