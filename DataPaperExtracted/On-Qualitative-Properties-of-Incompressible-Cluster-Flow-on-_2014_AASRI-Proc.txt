2. Ring network A ring network is a 
set of rings on the plane. Rings touch each other in the common nodes. Multiplicity (number) of touches in one node is not more than two. Let ‚Äôs classify ring networks by num
ber of touches, number of common nodes for one ring. This value is constant, except rings, which are located on the border of the network. Besides, the notion "regular networks" includes equidistribution of common nodes on the ring. 3. Isolated movement of uniform clusters Isolated movement of clusters in the ring network is a movement of each cluster on its own ring in a certain
 direction with the rule FIFO (first input, first output) of common nodes. Let all clusters be un
iform. That is, they have equal density and, therefore eq
ual velocity. Since the relative measure of the set of initial co nditions, that lead to the competition of clusters for a common node within a limited period of time, equal to zero, we will not consider possible scenarios of settling conflicts. However, if it is significant, we can consider the equiprobable method of regulating movement of two clusters through a common node .

4. Quantitative characteristics of movement Quantitative characteristics of movement both on a se p
 arate contour and in the network as a whole are considered. As previous researches have shown
[1],[2],[3], the movement in such networks, and for close movement rules of masses, has a number of interesting properties, such as self -adjustment of the system with m
 inimization of conflicts (synergy), complete stoppage of movement (collapse), spectrum of velocities and others. Further the average velo
city in the network v*nw is a relative measure of moving clusters in the fixed m oment. Since each cluster either stops or moves with eq ual velocity, the average velocity is equal to constant v
0 with relative measure of those part of clusters, which is moving now. Further let be 10 v. Similarly, the average velo
city on the ring, with assumptions we have made above, is a relative measure of time in movement conditions of appropriate cluster. Th ere are possible local manifestations of synergy and collapse, and other scenarios of complicated move ment, which is also an object of research.

If x i, 0 ‚â§ i ‚â§ 1 are the lengths of clusters, every initial condition  where a common node belongs to only one cluster is acceptable. Proposition 5.1: If x
1 + x 2  ‚â§ 2œÄ, then for all acceptable initial positions, the system goes into a synergy state du ring the time of a complete turn. Proof: Is evident. Proposition 5.2: If x

1 + x 2, with velocity equal to 1. The time of a complete turn of each cluster during f ree movement is equal to 2œÄ. Thus, the relative part of m
 ovement is defined by equation (1). 6. Two-element closed necklace The simple variant of the network with two nodes on each contour is considered.  Proposition 6.1: If
 x 1 + x 2  ‚â§ 2œÄ, then synergy starts after limited period of time for all initial conditions. Proof: Is evident. Proposition 6.2: If
 min(x 1,x2) > œÄ, then collapse starts for all acceptable initial conditions. Proof: If the cluster K
2 is approaching common node B. Then K 1 must go through this node at this period of  time, since node A is occupied by K
2. Obviously, K 2 can't go through B and stops, so K 1 can't go through A. Proposition 6.3: If
 min(x 1,x2) < œÄ, then

Proposition 7.2: If I = 1, ‚Ä¶,  2n ‚Äì 1; x i + x i+1 < 2œÄ, then there are initial conditions, that are leading to s ynergy. Proof: The biggest cluster is selected. Furth
er, it is connected to the neighbor cluster. Each neighbor is connected to their neighbor cluster and this gets a conflict -free distribution for the open necklace at the initial m
 oment of time. Proposition 7.3: If

f !  then there are initial conditions, that are leading
  to collapse for a short period of time. Proof: Structure from Fig. 5. It is significant to note that  an
 y cluster can be turned against the direction of movement and the system goes from partial to absolute collapse.  Proposition 8.2: If

 qual to half of the turnover period. Proof: If any i-cluster is located in both nodes, then at the current time (i-1) and (
i+1) clusters are located in  one node and the same arrangement with appropriate  neighbor clusters. Then there is a cluster with length g
 reater than œÄ. This cluster is the last one without a node in
 this odd chain, so we receive a contradiction. Proposition 8.3: If 
2nilxS

at are leading to synergy. Proof: Follow from Fig. 5. Proposition 8.4: If 
I, 1 ‚â§ I ‚â§ 2n then x i + x i+1 ‚â§ 2œÄ, is true and there are initial conditions that lead to s ynergy in a time period, equal to the turnover period.  Proof: The structure from  Fig. 5. All clusters are located symmetrically to (for example) position
 œÄ/2 at the initial period of time. 9. Potential flow function A closed necklace consisting of 2n rings is considered. The location of the cluster has been described on each co
ntour by the indicator function f (t,x,K) = {1, x 
¬è K; 0, x ¬ê K}, K i = [a i (t),b i (t)], f i (t,x) = f (t,x,K i). The potential flow function is a function

Some properties for function U are specified.  120   A.P . Buslaev and P .M. Strusinskiy   /  AASRI Procedia   9  ( 2014 )  114 ‚Äì 122

i and K j doesn't in tersect and U(t) is equal to the maximum possible value 2nd. Proof: For both closed and open two-element necklaces this feature is verified using the following method: currentl
y, each node is assigned one of three values X
i:1, if the proper item is nearly equal to t and is constant. T hus, there is a defined partially-linear function in the ordered and consecutively numbered set of nodes with v
alues 0,1,-1, according to vectors X = (X
1,..., X 2n). It's easy to see, that the sum of coordinates of this periodical v ector gives us a criterion of monotony U(t): 
21() 0 , .iniiXt t  t¬¶  There is a one-to-one correspondence between each coordinate -1 of vector X and coordinate 1. Indeed, co
 ordinate -1 means, that neighbor contours don't interact,  and are in anti-phase, moreover one of the clusters is located
  before the node, for example, on the right. Thus, on the right of coordinate -1 there is coordinate 1. W
 hile on the left of coordinate -1 there can't be coordinate -1. So, the sum of coordinates of vector X is non- negative. From another point, there are nodes with inter a
 cting contours if the system didn't reach maximal value. In this case, in order for the rate of change of the potential function to be equal to zero, it is necessary for interacting clusters and neighbor clusters with a negativ e velocity to be located in a definite location, that excludes constancy of the potential function. Proposition 9.3: If |K

del software allows for the creation of a cluster movement simulation in a clo sed necklace consisting of 2n rings. You can locate clusters, specify
 length and density of clusters and set the number of rings in the necklace n. Adjacent nodes are marked by a vertical li
ne, which is crossing proper contours. The software calculates and simulates a movement of  cl
 usters and creates a diagram of the potential function U(
t). As a result, by means of the NODE mo
del software, some statements about the potential function U(t), previou sly specified, are proven. Particularly, we proved that the function U(t) is a monotonous function and it reaches its maximal value 2nd in all initial conditions in a limited period of time.  121  A.P . Buslaev and P .M.
