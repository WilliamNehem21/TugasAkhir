Strong convective systems and the associated heavy rainfall events can trig-ger ﬂoods and landslides with severe detrimental consequences. These events have a high spatio-temporal variability, being dif ﬁcult to predict by standard meteorological numerical models. This work proposes the M5Images method for performing the veryshort-term prediction (nowcasting) of heavy convective rainfall using weather radar data by means of a con-volutional recurrent neural network. The recurrent part of it is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neuralnetwork. Prediction tests were performed for the city and surroundings of Campinas, located in the SoutheasternBrazil. The convolutional recurrent neural network was trained using time series of rainfall rate images derivedfrom weather radar data for a selected set of heavy rainfall events. The attained pre-diction performance wasbetter than that given by the persistence forecasting method for different prediction times.
1. IntroductionThe rainfall associated with strong convective systems usually trig-gersﬂoods and landslides that hit countless parts of the world every year,causing substantial socioeconomic damages. According to ( Kron, 2003), 50% of the damage caused by natural disasters is due to ﬂashﬂoods, which are bound to a limited area, and present a fast dynamic ( Cristiano et al., 2017). Flashﬂoods are usually due to high rainfall associated withstrong convective events (Li et al., 2022). Therefore, heavy rainfall pre- dictions may feedﬂood forecasting systems able to issue early warningsto affected areas ((Caseri et al., 2016), (Santos et al., 2017)). In partic- ular, such warnings are more relevant for tropical countries like Brazil,which frequently present strong convective rainfall events. Heavy rainfallevent can be deﬁned by 24-h accumulated rainfall more than 64.5 mm asheavy rainfall, very heavy rainfall as more than 124.5 mm, and extremelyheavy rainfall as more than 244.5 mm ( Pune, 2017). In the last years, artiﬁcial intelligence methods have been increas-ingly used to complement numerical models in the prediction of complexphenomena (Schmidhuber, 2015). Such methods are typically based on amachine learning algorithm, which is ad-justed/trained using knownobservational data of a given phenomenon in order to detect it from newdata. One of the most commonly employed algorithms are neural net-works. As an example in Meteorology ( Aoki, 2017), used a ConvolutionalNeural Network (CNN) (Springenberg et al., 2014),) method for rainfall detection and estimation using satellite images (NOAA GOES Imagery).Other examples, more related to this work, are ( Shi et al., 2015) and (Heye et al., 2017) that applied a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)recurrent neural network for rainfall forecasts using weather radar data.Additional approaches using NASA Global Precipitation Measurement(GPM) satellite data include a model based on a convolutional LSTM topredict short-term precipitation events ( Kumar et al., 2020), and a CNN-LSTM neural network for rainfall nowcasting ( Gamboa-Villafruela et al., 2021). Other CNN-LSTM models were developed to make ﬂow predictions in order to simulate hydrological rainfall-runoff models, like(Deng et al., 2022)o r(Li et al., 2022), using two dimensional rainfall radar maps, and tested for German watersheds.This work proposes the very nowcasting of heavy rainfall events bymean of a deep learning approach, a machine learning algorithm usingweather radar data. According to the World Meteorological Organiza-tion
1, nowcasting refers to up to 6 h forecast. These rainfall events have ahigh spatio-temporal variability, being dif ﬁcult to predict by standard numerical models. Weather radars allow the real-time monitoring ofconvective rainfall, thus providing time series of images that can beemployed by the machine learning algorithm, in this case, a convolu-tional recurrent neural network.In this study, a new method called M5Images is proposed for heavy

The recurrent part of it is a LongShort-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The area of study is the cityof Campinas, in the Southeastern Brazil, and its surrounding areas.Weather radar data was processed to yield a time series of 2D images ofprecipitation rate. M5Images is a predictive algorithm intended to pre-dict rainfall rate values above a deﬁned threshold for the pixels of the considered grid. The use of a rainfall rate threshold was suggested by(Mason and Graham, 1999), and adopted here with a value of 5 mm/h,similarly as in (Caseri et al., 2020). The proposed approach differs fromprevious ones by using only data of heavy and very heavy rainfall eventsin the training phase of the neural network, besides proposing a newcorrection factor to improve the predictions.The attained prediction performance of the M5Images method for theconsidered test cases was better than that given by the persistence fore-casting method (PFM), taken as a reference method, for different pre-diction advance times. The PFM simply considers the last observation as aforecast for the next observation. This article presents the followingsections: Section2describes the methodology including the proposedneural network, data partitioning and validation scheme, and the numberof input sequence of images in the training/validation and test phases.Section3is about the about the location, radar data and rainfall rateimages. Section4shows the prediction results, and the prediction per-formance analyzed and discussed using standard metrics. Finally, Section5contains conclusions andﬁnal remarks, as well as suggestions for futureworks.2. The proposed convolutional recurrent neural networkThe neural network used here derives from the CNN-LSTM of(Hochreiter&Schmidhuber, 1997), proposed to solve the problem ofvanishing gradient, a particular problem with recurrent neural networks.In the training phase, network weights are iteratively updated using anerror gradient in order to correct the network output. However, thecalculation of such gradient may yield zero due to the large number oftime steps of a temporal sequence. The LSTM neural network is a type ofrecurrent neural network with the ability dealing better with the van-ishing gradient problem and thus being suitable for prediction problemsinvolving time series. LSTM networks are based on a cell with anentrance gate, an output gate, and a forgetting gate, which regulate theﬂow of information in and out of the cell, in a way that some neuronvalues are preserved at arbitrary time intervals ( Sherstinsky, 2018). The historical meteorological series of 2D precipitation rate maps isseen as a data cube, where the third dimension is time. The 3D CNN-LSTM neural network was only trained with time series of imagesrelated to a set of heavy and very heavy rainfall events, thus learning thecharacteristic patterns of such events, including their evolution trends.This CNN-LSTM neural network is of the kind many-to-one, i.e. an inputsequence with any number of rainfall images sorted in time is used tooutput a single image. Here, an image is given by a ﬁnite set of grid points covering the area of study, with a rainfall rate in mm/h at each one.In this work, the size of the input sequence of images used in thetraining and test phases are denoted by TSI and PSI, respectively.Different values of TSI and PSI were evaluated, resulting in the adoptionof a 5:1 ratio for the training/validation phase (TSI equal to 5), whichmeans that a sequence of 5 images feeds the neural network to predict the6th next image. For the test phase, 3:1 and 2:1 ratios were adopted (PSIequal to 2 or 3), corresponding to a sequence of 2 or 3 images feeding theneural network to predict the 3rd or 4th next images, respectively. Thesevalues for TSI and PSI resulted in a better prediction performance, asshown in Section4.Fig. 1presents the proposed neural network architecture, which in-cludes four 2D–CNN–LSTM layers and a single 3D –CNN–LSTM layer. Images have 150/C2150 pixels or grid points. In the training phase, eachsequence of 5 images (ordered in time) traverse successively the four2D
–CNN–LSTM (each one applying a 3/C23 kernel to the image) and the resulting 5-image set is then merged into a 5/C2150/C2150 array in the 3D–CNN–LSTM layer that uses a 3/C23/C23 kernel. Finally, each of these arrays is fed to a fully connected layer rendering a 150 /C2150 output image. The only difference in the test phase is the input, given by 2-imageor 3-image sequences.After each layer, a normalization is performed. The same paddingscheme was applied to all layers, thus preserving the spatial dimension ofthe input data. The activation function is one particular non-linear sig-moid (S-shaped) function, the logistic function, which allows nodes tolearn complex structures (Chandra, 2003). As in most neural networks, the training involves the updating of the set of weight matrices in order tominimize the loss function, that evaluates the difference between pre-dicted and observed precipitation rates. Here, the loss function is givenby the Mean Square Error (MSE) metric. In the training of a neuralnetwork, an epoch is deﬁned as the number of times that the training isperformed using all the instances/samples of the training set. Thetraining set is split in to equal-size batches, and for each batch, theweights and bias of the network are adjusted as a function of the lossfunction, using a backpropagation scheme. It is expected that along theepochs, the neural network converge, minimizing the loss function. Here,each sample/instance is composed of the sequence of 5 consecutive im-ages, each one with the rainfall rates of all pixels. In order to ﬁnd an optimal number of epochs, some tests were performed for 10, 30, 50, andeven more than 50 epochs in the training phase. The prediction errordecreased from 10 to 30 epochs, but there was no signi ﬁcant change above 30 epochs, and therefore, the adopted number of epochs was 30.The proposed CNN-LSTM model is trained and validated with data ofa selected set of heavy and very heavy rainfall events in the chosen areaof study. Temporal resolution of the time series of images is 10 min, butthe training employs 5-image sequences (TSI equal to 5) extracted fromthe time series with N images of a given event using a sliding window ofsize W¼5 that advances one image (10 min) each step, thus rendering a

9total of (N–Wþ1) sequences for each event of the training set. Thesesequences allow the CNN-LSTM network to assimilate the temporalevolution of the rainfall events.In addition, a correction scheme for the rainfall forecasts is alsoproposed in order to deal with the rainfall forecast underestimationobserved in the tests, providing more reliable forecasts. The schemeemploys a multiplicative correction factor derived from the ﬁst observed image, as follows. Considering predictions for 10, 20 and 30 min, themean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is calculated for all pixels be-tween observation and theﬁrst prediction (10 min). The MAPE is thenused to derive the correction factor to be applied for the further 20 and30 min predictions, being applied to all the pixels. This study was per-formed using the R language with the following packages: keras, ten-sorﬂow, raster, Metrics, MLmetrics.Evaluation of the prediction/forecast performance was done by themetric Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the ROC (Receiver OperatingCharacteristic) curve2, and also the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). TheRMSE is calculated using the rainfall rate continuous values of the pixelsof the predicted and of the observed images. However, the ROC AUCmetric is deﬁned for a binary classiﬁer/predictor, not for continuous values as in this case. This issue was solved by assigning a pixel as beingrainfall occurrence if it presents a rainfall rate above the de ﬁned threshold of 5 mm/h or the opposite if below the threshold, thus de ﬁning two classes: occurrence or not of rainfall. The ROC curve is a x-y plot thatshows the balance between true positives (y values) and the false posi-tives (x) for a binary classiﬁer, with the linear curve with 45
/C14slope corresponding to a random classiﬁer. The ROC AUC ranges between0 and 1, with the latter value expressing a perfect classi ﬁer, and a value of 0.5 corresponding to a random classiﬁer.3. Case study location and dataThe proposed approach was applied to the city and surroundings ofCampinas (Brazil) using data of 2016 and 2017, mostly in summertime.The choice of this location was due to the record of numerous ﬂood events in recent years. The weather radar is a mobile X-band radar, thatprovided full coverage of the area of study, as shown in Fig. 2. It has dual- polarization (vertical and horizontal) and electronic beam openingcapability, providing a complete volume scan every 10 min. Radar spatialresolution corresponds to 200 m
2in the horizontal plane, but was reduced to a 1 km/C21 km resolution yielding images with 150/C2150 pixels. The use of dual-polarization weather radars is recent in Brazil,contributing to improve the associated research in Meteorology ( Seron et al., 2019).Campinas is located in a transition zone, during the summer, pre-cipitation is mostly convective and modulated by the presence of theSouthern Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). Campinas has more than 1million inhabitants and shows impressive urban growth. Its demographicgrowth, like most Brazilian cities, has occurred in a chaotic way with alack of organization and infrastructure. This disorderly growth contrib-utes to the increase in the frequency and magnitude of ﬂoods and extreme events causing socio-economic damage in the region ( Vicente et al., 2004).A selection of heavy and very heavy rainfall events in the area of studywas made using the historical series of images with 10 min resolutionobtained by the mobile X-band weather radar installed in Campinas.Radar reﬂectivity values (Z, in mm6/m3) were mapped to rainfall rates(R, in mm/h) using a suitable Z-R relation (Marshall-Palmer). The rainfallrate threshold of 5 mm/h was adopted for the selection of the rainfallevents, in order toﬁlter out events with low rainfall rates.Table 1shows, for each selected rainfall event, the starting date andtime, duration in hours, and maximum observed rainfall rate summing upall pixels, and considering all time steps of the event. In this table, the 12heavy and very heavy rainfall events were selected using the threshold of5 mm/h. All these events lasted less than 24 h and presented rainfallamounts between 83 and 191 mm. Considering the Southeast of Brazil,one single event may represent the amount of rainfall of an entire month.These totals are shown to illustrate the severity of these rainfall events,but were not employed in the prediction tests.These twelve events were divided into training and test sets, with 9and 3 events, respectively. Considering the training events, 95% of theimages were taken for training and the remaining 5% for validation. Thevalidation phase is intended to optimize the neural network hyper-parameters, in this case, the loss function (given by the MSE), batch sizeand number of epochs. The training/validation set includes a total of 133h or 798 images sampled with 10 min resolution, resulting by the slidingwindow scheme in (794–5þ1) or 794 sequences of 5 consecutive images(TSI equal to 5). The test set comprehends 31 h or 186 images sampledwith 10 min resolution, resulting in (186 –5þ1) or 182 sequences of 5 consecutive images (TSI equal to 5).

104. Rainfall forecast resultsThe CNN-LSTM neural network was trained, validated and testedusing the radar data described in the preceding section. As mentioned,after the training phase, the validation phase allowed to optimize thenetwork hyperparameters, and the network was then used for the testphase. In addition, experimentation allowed to optimize the size of thesequence of images used in the training phase (TSI), as well as the size ofthe sequence of images used for prediction in the test phase (PSI).Performance evaluation of the prediction was performed for TSIrange of 5–7 and PSI range of 2–5, as shown inTable 2and3for the ROC AUC and the RMSE, respectively, both considering a threshold of 5 mm/h. The best combination was TSI/PSI of 5/3 (only slightly better than 5/2) considering ROC AUC, and thus was adopted henceforth in this work.As mentioned above, in the training and validation phases, consecu-tive sequences of 5 images (TSI equal to 5) were also employed to predictthe 6th next one with a 5:1 ratio, but in the test phase, a 2:1 ratio (PSIequal to 2) was used for the 3rd image (10-min prediction), and addingthe just predicted grid, a 3:1 (PSI equal to 3) ratio was then used for the4th and 5th images (20-min and 30-min predictions, respectively).These predictions correspond to the rainfall rate images with antici-pation of 10, 20 and 30 min.Fig. 3presents aﬂowchart summarizing the main steps and methods of the proposed approach.Fig. 4shows the rainfall forecasts generated by the M5Images methodfor prediction times of 10, 20 and 30 min, compared to the observed data,for a particular instant of time (2016/11/28 20:10 h), considering thearea of study. It shows that the prediction performance worsen with theincrease of prediction time. Although the 10-min prediction is verysimilar to the observed rainfall, the predictions for 20-min and 30-minwere not able to identify the rainfall zone and rainfall intensity for thecorresponding pixels. The high variability of these rainfall events andtheir low spatio-temporal correlation render the prediction dif ﬁcult for higher prediction times (Caseri et al., 2020). As already mentioned, the evaluation of the prediction/forecast per-formance was done by two standard metrics, the Area Under the Curve(AUC) of the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve, and also theRoot Mean Square Error (RMSE) comparing the pixels of the predictedand of the observed images. RMSE is calculated employing the contin-uous rainfall rate values of the pixels, while ROC AUC required a kind ofbinarization based on the adopted threshold of 5 mm/h. A value ofrainfall rate above the threshold is mapped as a rainfall occurrence,whereas a value below, as not.These metrics were calculated for each sequence of 3 predictedconsecutive images, taking into account all the pixels of these images.The same metrics were applied for the PFM, which considers the lastimage as the forecast for the next grid, pixel to pixel. Therefore, suchmethod was adopted as a reference for the proposed approach.Fig. 5shows the AUC of the forecasts produced by the M5images andthe PFM methods, considering three prediction times (10, 20 and 30min), and a threshold of 5 mm/h of rainfall. For both methods, theprediction performance decreases as the prediction time increases, butthe M5Images method performed better, even for a 30-min predictiontime. Considering the shortest 10- minute forecast, the M5Images AUCROC was close to 1, while the PFM one was close to 0.7.Finally, as shown inFig. 6, the RMSE mean values of the M5Imagesforecasts were 2.0, 3.3 and 3.6 mm/h, respectively, for 10, 20 and 30 minprediction times, while the corresponding RMSE mean values of the PFMforecasts were 4.0, 4.5 and 4.7 mm/h. As expected, the higher the pre-diction time, the lower is the prediction performance.5. ConclusionRainfall nowcasting is essential for early warning systems, especiallyin regions characterized by heavy rainfall events. This work presents theM5Images method that employs a Machine Learning approach, a CNN-LSTM convolutional recurrent neural network for the prediction ofrainfall rate images using temporal series of rainfall rates derived fromTable 2AUC ROC results (threshold 5 mm/h) for different combinations of TSI and PSI(number of input images for training and test, respectively), and for differentprediction times.

11weather radar data. An innovative aspect is the training phase of thenetwork, which is performed using only images corresponding to heavyand very heavy rainfall events in the considered area of study.Tests were performed for prediction times of 10, 20 and 30 min forthe area of study, the Brazilian city of Campinas and its surroundings. Asexpected, the higher the prediction time, the lesser the prediction accu-racy, since ensuing predictions employ the former ones. These rainfallrate forecasts made by the M5Images method were compared to thecorresponding rainfall rates derived from weather radar data, and also tothe forecasts given by the Persistence method. All forecasts were evalu-ated by the ROC-AUC and RMSE metrics, showing the better predictionperformance of the M5Images forecasts. Considering time series of im-ages with 10-min resolution, the CNN-LSTM network of the M5Imagesmethod is trained using input sequences of 5 consecutive im-ages (TSIequal to 5), and perform predictions using input sequences of 2 or 3consecutive images (PSI equal to 2 or 3) to predict the next images using asliding window of consecutive images (10 –30 min). Optimal values of TSI and PSI, as well the number of epochs of the training phase (30) weredeﬁned by experimentation.It is foreseen to employ GPU processing, since the training phasedemands 3–4 days on a standard PC, and there are speci ﬁc machine learning libraries for GPU use. Future work also includes the imple-mentation of ensemble schemes that consists of generating not one, butseveral forecasts using the same input data for a ﬁnite set of different predictors. The ensemble yields aﬁnite set of forecast images, being the

12resulting forecast given by averaging pixel-to-pixel these images. As anexample, a set of different predictors can be obtained using a drop-outtechnique that randomly erases one of the fully-connected outputlayers that render the network output. Another ensembles can result fromusing different network architecture or different weight initializationscheme for each predictor. In addition, the prediction performance of theM5Images method performance will be evaluated for prediction timeslonger than 30 min, since for nowcasting, the higher the prediction time,the better the usefulness for early warning systems.Declaration of competing interestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in ﬂuence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgmentThe authors thank the Fundaç~ao de Amparo/C18a Pesquisa do Estado de S~ao Paulo (FAPESP) Grant Numbers 2015/50122 –0, 17/00275–0 and 15/14497–0; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientí ﬁco eTecnol/C19ogico (CNPq) Grant Number 420338/2018- 7 and DFG-IRTGGrant Number 1740/2 for theﬁnancial and research supports.This study wasﬁnanced in part by the Coordenaç~ao de Aperfeiçoa- mento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001.ReferencesAoki, P.M., 2017.
