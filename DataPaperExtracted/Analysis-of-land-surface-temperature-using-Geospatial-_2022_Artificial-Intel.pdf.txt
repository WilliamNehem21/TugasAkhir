Article history:Received 22 February 2022Received in revised form 26 May 2022Accepted 20 June 2022Available online 23 June 2022Degradation of vegetation cover and expansion of ba rren land are remained the leading environmental problem at global level. Land surface temperatur e (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference B arren Index (NDBaI), and Modiﬁed Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) were used to quantify the changing relati onships using correlation analysis. This study attempted to analyze the relationship between LST a nd NDVI, NDBaI, and MNDWI using Geospatial tech- nologies in Gida Kiremu, Limu, and Amuru districts in Western Ethiopia. All indices were estimated byusing thermal bands and multispectral bands from Landsat TM 1990, Landsat ETM+ 2003, and LandsatOLI/TIRS 2020. The correlation of LST with NDVI , NDBaI and MNDWI were analyzed by using scatter plot. Accordingly, the NDBaI was positive correlation with LST (R
2= 0.96). However, NDVI and MNDWI were substantially nega tive relationship with LST (R
2= 0.99, 0.95), respectively. The result shows that, LST was increased by 5 °C due to decline o f vegetation cover and increasing of bare land over the study periods. Finally, our result recommend ed that, decision-makers and environmental ana- lysts should give attention on the importance of vege tation cover, water bodies and wetland in climate change mitigation, particularly, LST in the study area.© 2022 The Authors.

1. IntroductionThe majority of human activities are the primary cause of the contin-uous loss of vegetation cover on the earth's surface ( Sahana et al., 2016). The decrease in vegetation was a contributing factor to the increase inland surface temperature (LST).Song et al. (2021)highlights that vege- tation is the main inﬂuencing factors that driven LST. The LST is one ofthe crucial indicators of ecological functioning of the environment. TheLST is indicates the temperature of the Earth's skin, which is an impor-tant component in regional and global land surface processing studies(Thanh et al., 2018). The LST is increasing at global level due to landuse land cover conversion (Moisa et al., 2022a). Studies conducted in different parts of Ethiopia conﬁrmed that there is a substantialincreasing trend of LST (Moisa et al., 2022b;Wolteji et al., 2022; Merga et al., 2022;Dissanayake et al., 2019). Similar to LST, the atmo- spheric temperature is signiﬁcantly increasing as a results of land useland cover change (Gemeda et al., 2020;Gemeda et al., 2021;Gemeda et al., 2022;Moisa et al., 2022c).To quantitatively describe degraded land, the Normalized DifferenceBarren Index (NDBaI) and the Modiﬁed Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) were used (Gao, 1996;Zha et al., 2003). The LST were compared to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index(NDVI), NDBaI, and MNDWI to provide ambient environmental condi-tion for living things (Qinqin et al., 2012). Vegetation based indices can indicates the existence and abundancies of vegetation cover(Moisa et al., 2022a;Iang and Tian, 2010).Analysis of spatialﬂexibility of the NDVI, LST, NDBaI, and MNDWIare tremendously crucial for decision making and natural resourcesmonitoring in natural and environmental investigations ( Zareie et al., 2016). In addition, NDVI has been used to con ﬁrm the importance for represent distribution of green space ( Yuan and Bauer, 2007). Further- more, several scholars raised that, remote sensing indices like NDVIArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 6 (2022) 90 –99

journal homepage:http://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/artificial-intelligence-in-agriculture/and MNDWI were gradually declined due to forest ﬁres, deforestation, expansion of urbanization, agricultural land expansion, and expansionof grazing land from which NDBaI, and LST were increased ( Zhou and Wang, 2011;Mimbrero et al., 2014).Although these indices have been used to model LST in previousstudy (Chen et al., 2006), only a few of them have compared index re-sults from different years to monitor surface temperature. Even though,agricultural expansion is the main causes that aggravated climatechange particularly LST in western parts of Ethiopia. No research hasbeen conducted around Gida Kiremu, Limu, and Amuru district. It is ob-vious that the LST has increased over time due to a decline in vegetationcover for agricultural expansion. In addition, wetland degradation andthe increment of barren land were other causes for the rising of LST.Therefore, this study attempted to analyze LST based on remote sensingindices such as NDVI, NDBaI, and MNDWI in western Ethiopia. Thispaper is organized as follows: theﬁrst section introduces the general in-troduction on LST and its correlation with different indices; Section twodescribes materials and methods which includes the study area descrip-tions, data types and sources, and method of data analysis; Section threepresents' results and discussions and the ﬁnal section concludes the ﬁndings of the study.2. Materials and methods2.1. Description of the study areaThis study is conducted in East Wollega and Horo Guduru WollegaZones and located between 9

2).2.3. Socio economic activitiesMixed agriculture namely crop production and livestock production are the most popular income sources of smallholders farmers. From crop pro-duction, Maize, groundnut, niger seed, lentil, beans, and peas and some veg-etables (potato, onions, garlic) and fruits like mango, papaya, oranges andbananas are mostly dominants agricultural products of the study areas.The agricultural activity of the study area is mainly depending on rain-fed.2.4. Data types and sourcesLandsat images from three years were used in this study. The USGS(http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) provides free downloads of the ther-mal and multispectral bands of Landsat TM 990, Landsat ETM+ 2003,and Landsat OLI/TIRS 2020. Detailed information regarding these datais presented in (Table 1). Software used for this study were, ArcGIS10.3 version and ERDAS imagine 2015.2.5. Method of data analysisThe LST, NDVI, MNDWI, and NDBaI were calculated in this study. Themethodologyﬂow diagram of the study was presented in ( Fig. 2).2.5.1. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)This index was used to calculate the amount of vegetation coveringthe earth's surface. The NDVI was estimated using multi-spectralbands from Landsat images collected over the course of the investiga-tion. Band 4 was used to measure near-infrared bands on Landsat 5and 7, and band 5 was used for Landsat 8. The red band of the Landsatdata were measured using band 4 for Landsat 8 and band 3 for Landsat5 and 7. The formula for this index is presented in (Eq. (1))NDVI¼
NIR/C0RNIRþR ð1ÞThe NDVI scale spans from−1.0 to 1.0. For healthy and dense vege-tation, the NDVI values are always between 0.2 and 0.9 ( Bustos and Meza, 2015). Vegetation such as rock, water, and barren plains, on theother hand, were represented by values less than 0.1 ( Fu and Burgher, 2015).2.5.2. Modiﬁed normalized difference water index (MNDWI)When modelling the thermal environment, the MNDWI is assignedto represent water areas, which typically display notable variations inthermal characteristics (Xu, 2008;Zhifeng and Jianjun, 2012). The for- mula was developed using the green band (band 2 for landsat 5 and 7,band 3 for Landsat 8) and middle infrared (band 5 for Landsat 5 and 7,band 6 for landsat 8) reﬂectance values (Eq.(2)).MNDWI¼Green/C0MIRGreenþMIR ð2Þ2.5.3. Normalized difference barren index (NDBaI)When estimating the thermal environment, NDBaI was chosen torepresent barren terrain areas, which often show large variances inthermal characteristics (Zhifeng and Jianjun, 2012). It is estimated using the reﬂectance of medium infrared (band 5 for Landsat 5 and 7,band 6 for Landsat 8) and thermal infrared (band 6 for Landsat 5 and7, band 10 and 11 for Landsat 8) satellites (Eq. (3)).NDBaI¼

Retrieval of land surface temperature (LST)The mono-window algorithm (Qin et al., 2001), single channel, was created from Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS data ( Jiménez-Muñoz and Sobrino, 2003). LST was extracted from Landsat 8 data with onebands using mono window method from band 10. LST is determinedby employing the brightness temperature of the two bands of ThermalInfrared (TIR), as well as the mean and difference in land surface emis-sivity (Cheng et al., 2015).2.5.4.1. Step I: Conversion of DN in to radiance.A. Mono window algorithmBefore calculating the brightness temperature, the mono windowtechnique converted the digital data into an at-sensor radiance sensor.The TM and ETM+ DN value ranges between 0 and 255 (Eq.

Result and discussion3.1. Analysis of land surface temperatureThe spatial pattern of LST in the study area was determined forthe years 1990, 2003, and 2020, respectively. In all of the years stud-ied, the northeastern and southwestern parts of the study area hadhigh LST (Fig. 3). The increasing of LST in the study area is associatedwith the declining of vegetation cover and increasing of bare land.

94Due to the existance of substantial vegetation cover, the eastern,central, and western parts of the research region experienced rela-tively low LST.The mean LST gradually increased from 23.70 °C in 1990 to 24.30 °Cin 2003 to 28.70 °C in 2020. From 1990 to 2020, an average temperaturewas increased by 5 °C. Comparable result has been reported by Moisa et al., 2022a, which found an increment of LST by 5.6 °C in Anger RiverSub-basin between the year 1991, and 2020. As compared to 1990,and 2003, the year 2020 is the most extreme temperature. The increas-ing trend of LST is associated with the declining of vegetation cover and

95wetland degradation driven by expansion of agricultural land. The LST isexpected to increase due to global warming. For instance, Rasul et al. (2012)predict that by 21 century, the temperature will have increasedby 1.40 °C to 5.80 °C during the twentieth century which con ﬁrmed the present study.3.2. Correlation between LST and NDVILST values were discovered to range from maximum temperature(43.2 °C) to minimum temperature (16.9 °C), whereas NDVI valuesa r ef o u n dt or a n g ef r o m0 . 5 0t o−0.53 maximum to minimum. The re-sults show that LST and NDVI have a strong negative correlation (R
2= 0.99).Wolteji et al. (2022)found a moderate negative relationship be-tween NDVI and LST over the Rift Valley Region of Ethiopia. It showsthat high LST are more closely related to low vegetation cover andvice versa. The distribution of NDVI over the study period is presentedin (Fig. 4). The relationship between the two factors (LST and NDVI) in2020 is shown in (Table 2andFig. 5). This result of study is in line with (Alemu, 2019;Wedajo et al., 2019;Merga et al., 2022)t h e yconﬁrmed that, LST was increased as decline of vegetation cover andboth of them had strong negative relationship.3.3. Correlation between LST and NDBaIBarren land of the study area is increasing due to agricultural ex-pansion and decline of vegetation cover. The results demonstrate asubstantial positive correlation between LST and NDBaI (R2= 0.96). It demonstrates that high LST can be found on degraded orbarren terrain with a high NDBaI value ( Fig. 6). The relationship between two parameters was shown in ( Fig. 7).

Theresults shows that a negative strong association between LST andMNDWI, with coefﬁcient determination of (R2 = 0.95). MNDWI ishigh in the northern and southern parts of the study area ( Fig. 8). Theﬁndings reveal that high LST are more commonly recorded inlow-water locations. The relationship between LST and MNDWIwas presented in (Fig. 9). The result is agreed with the result of pre-vious studies (Zhou and Wang, 2011;Zhifeng and Jianjun, 2012). The relationship between LST and other indices were reported in(Table 2). The NDBaI has a direct association with LST, while NDVIand MNDWI have an inverse relationship with LST.3.5.

ConclusionsIn this article, we use remote sensing data to assess the spatial-temporal LST in relation to NDVI, NDBaI, and MNDWI indicesin three districts of western Ethiopia: Gida Kiremu, Limu, andAmuru. Between 1990 and 2020, the tem perature of the earth's sur- face increased by 5 °C. Our results concluded that the NDVI andMNDWI have a substantial negative relationship with LST, whereasNDBaI has a positive correlation with LST. Expansion of agriculturalland is the main cause for decline of vegetation cover in the studyarea. Decline of vegetation cover is the cause for decrement of veg-etation water content (wetland)and increasing of barren land.Moreover, LST is increasing over time and expanded to all directionsin study area. Based on ourﬁndings, this study recommended thecommunity awareness creation to promote the wise use of naturalresources for its sustainability.In addition, further studies on the impacts of LST agricultural production can enhance our understand-ing of the impacts of environmental changes on communitylivelihhoods.Consent for publicationThe authors agreed to publish the manuscript on Arti ﬁcial Intelli- gence in Agriculture.Availability of dataAvailable in this manuscript.FundingNo funding received for this research.Author contributionsMBM involved in research design, data collection, data analysis, anddraft manuscript writing.
