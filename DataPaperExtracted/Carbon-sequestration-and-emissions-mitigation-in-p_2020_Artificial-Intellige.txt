Keywords:Soil organic carbonGreenhouse gas emissionsExogenous carbon additionTillage practicesWater and fertilizer managementThe DeNitriﬁcation–DeComposition (DNDC) model is a process model with a series of carbon and nitrogen bio-geochemistry in agro-ecosystems. It incorporates the driving factors of the ecological environment and aims tosimulate the carbon and nitrogen cycle in the terrestrial ecosystem. Furthermore, the model can be applied effec-tively in a paddy ecosystem. Based on an investigation and literature review, this study summarized and analyzedthe impact of agricultural practices such as water management, fertilizer application, and straw incorporation ongreenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon storage. After years of improvement, the DNDC model can presently beused effectively to evaluate the carbon sequestration and emissions mitigation potential of various agriculturalpractices. However, the related details of scienti ﬁc processes of agricultural management, such as biochar incor- poration and plastic mulching in paddy ﬁelds, should be added or modiﬁed and combined with experimental cases of actual agricultural practices to complete the calibration of the model, provide theoretical support forits promotion, and establish a reliable method of evaluating carbon sequestration and emissions mitigation inpaddyﬁelds.© 2020 The Authors.

1. IntroductionThe agricultural ecosystem provides the food people require andalso crucially carries carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in the C and N cycle.The ecosystem is affected by numerous natural and human factors,such as soil, climate, crops, and agricultural practices. All these factorsare connected to each other through substance and energy exchange,forming a complex biogeochemical system. However, because ofhuman activities, the agricultural ecosystem is a critical source of non-carbon dioxide (non-CO
2) greenhouse gases (GHGs), which accountfor 56% of anthropogenic emissions of non-CO
2GHGs (IPCC, 2014). Methane (CH
4) emissions from the global agricultural ecosystems are3.22 × 10
6Gg CO 2-eq yr−1and nitrous oxide (N 2O) emissions are 5.99 × 10
6Gg CO 2-eq yr−1(FAO, 2020). Paddyﬁelds are vital parts of an agricultural ecosystem, and their harvest area accounts for 23% ofthe total area of cereal crop cultivation worldwide ( FAO, 2020). Because of prolongedﬂood water management, soil has been maintained in ananaerobic reduction condition during rice growing seasons, which pro-vides favorable conditions for CH
4production. CH 4emissions from paddyﬁelds account for 18% of emissions from agricultural sources(FAO, 2020). In addition, the application of N fertilizer, water-saving ir-rigation, and certain other agricultural practices promote N
2O emissions from paddyﬁelds. Annual N
2O emissions in China are approximately 33Gg N, accounting for 14% of the emissions from agricultural soils ( Aliyu et al., 2019). Furthermore, the improvement of the C storage of paddyﬁelds is crucial in mitigating global warming. The C storage of upperpaddy soil (0–30 cm) in China is 1.6 Pg C, and the C sequestration poten-tial is 0.9 Pg C (Qin et al., 2013). Therefore, when stabilizing rice produc-tion, the adoption of agricultural practices that increase the C poolcontent of paddy soil and reduce GHG emissions (C sequestration andemissions mitigation for short) is a crucial measure for coping withglobal climate change.To accurately assess the impact of agricultural practices on the C se-questration and emissions mitigation potential of paddy ecosystems, un-derstanding the C and N cycle of paddy ecosystems is crucial. Much basicdata has been accumulated throughﬁeld observation and simulation ex-periments for understanding the scientiﬁc process of the C and N cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. With the continuous improvement of science andtechnology as well as the deepening awareness of the C and N cycle'smechanisms, scientists have begun to develop models to quantify andpredict the substanceﬂow of ecosystems. Among them, the process-oriented model, based on the biogeochemical process of C and N dynamicmigration, collects the key processes and their control factors in the agri-cultural ecosystem. The process-based model can effectively expand thescope of analysis from limited site experiments to unlimited scales intime and space and also provide a practical method for quantitative mea-surements of the C and N cycle in the agricultural ecosystem.At present, a series of process models are recommended in IPCCguidelines for national GHG inventories, including the Century, RothC,CH4MOD, and DNDC-Rice (originating from the DNDC model) models.The DNDC model, developed byLi et al. (1992), has been used in various countries and regions to simulate the C and N cycle in agricultural, wet-land, forest, and grassland ecosystems. In a paddy ecosystem, the DNDCmodel is mainly used to evaluate soil C and N dynamics and GHG emis-sions. After years of development, the DNDC model can perform simula-tions effectively and its efﬁcacy has been recognized by numerousresearchers.Based on a series of biogeochemical processes, the DNDC modelcombines ecological driving factors, environmental factors, and corre-sponding physical and chemical processes to study the C and N cyclein the terrestrial ecosystem. In the past few decades, many scholarshave jointly used and developed the DNDC model, adding newsubmodules and biogeochemical process formulas and parameters.The function of the model has been continually expanded, forming mul-tiple forms such as Manure-DNDC, DNDC-online model, which can beused to evaluate C and N dynamics, GHG emissions, nonpoint sourcepollution, GHG economic beneﬁts, and other data (Gao et al., 2014; Gilhespy et al., 2014;Jiang et al., 2017), and it has been widely veriﬁed and applied worldwide. This review mainly introduces the researchprogress regarding the DNDC model in evaluating the effects of agricul-tural practices on C sequestration and emissions mitigation in paddyecosystems.2. Biogeochemical process of the DNDC modelThe DNDC model is composed of an input interface, biogeochemicalﬁeld, and core process. Users input the environmental driving factors(including meteorological data, soil parameters, crop parameters, andagricultural practices) of the target ecosystem through the input inter-face. The target environmental characteristics are used to build the bio-geochemicalﬁeld and to transform the driving factors into drivingforces of chemical element movement. The core process determinesthe biogeochemical reactions beforeﬁnally completing the calculation and simulation of C, N, and moisture in the ecosystem. In the book Bio- geochemistry: Scientiﬁc Basis and Model Method(Fig. 1),Li (2016)elabo- rated the detailed submodules and processing mechanism process ofthe model and also discussed the scientiﬁ
c basis and calculation process supporting the model.2.1. Soil climateDNDC model can be used to simulate the gas from soil, such as CO
2, CH
4,N2O, NH 3, etc. The formation of CO 2,C H 4, and N 2O in soil is mainly the result of soil microbial activities, which are impacted by soil envi-ronment. Therefore, correct simulations of soil climate, including soiltemperature, moisture, pH, and electrical potential (Eh) and relatedsubstrate concentration, are critical for tracking GHG emissions.The model uses the parameters of heat transfer rate, speci ﬁch e a tc a - pacity, and thermal conductivity of soil to calculate soil temperaturelayer by layer and balances the relationship of input water and outputwater to calculate the soil moisture of each layer. In the paddy ecosys-tem, the key to simulating CH
4and N 2O emissions accurately is to com-bine soil temperature, water dynamics, and gas ﬂux. Toﬁt the model to a cold and snowy environment, the rain –snow submodule was modi- ﬁed and agricultural snow cover model (snowMAUS) was embeddedin the DNDC model, enabling it to more effectively simulate the effectsof rain and snow on soil temperature and moisture ( Cui and Wang, 2019). The DNDC-Rice model improved the simulation of soil leakageand evapotranspiration and it calculates the soil water content layerby layer in an hourly step, alters the soil water content with the param-eters of irrigation time and duration, and de ﬁnes the water leakage rate (leakage to the 50-cm-deep soil layer at 1 mm day
-1rate), thereby implementing the dynamic simulation of water in continuous ﬂooding and alternating dry–wet treatment (Katayanagi et al., 2012). To141 S. Yin et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 140 –149accurately simulate the GHG emissions of paddy ﬁelds in India,Pathak et al. (2005)increased the leakage rate of certain reaction substratesin soil in the model, such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate.The results of the optimized model greatly reduced CH
4emissions at the high leakage point but had no effect on those at the low or mediumleakage point.2.2. Plant growthPlant growth is closely related to the dynamics of C and N in the ter-restrial ecosystem, which is also the basic step for the DNDC model tocorrectly simulate the dynamics of C and N in the soil –crop–atmosphere cycle. To accurately simulate crop growth, the model developersestablished crop submodules and integrated relevant crop growthmodels, such as the simple empirical equation, PnET (Photosynthesis-Evapotranspiration), EFEM (Economic Farm Emission Model), NEST(Northern Ecosystem Soil Temperature), and general crop modelMACROS (Modules of an Annual CROp Simulator) ( Zhang et al., 2002; Li et al., 2004;Zhang and Niu, 2016).The optimized model can simulate the daily growth of crops, the ab-sorption of soil water and N elements by crops, the potential productiv-ity of crops, the growth of crops under the conditions of water andnutrient constraints, and the DOC of a reaction substrate transportedinto soil by plant root secretions (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the optimized model can track the circulation of C, N, and water in the ecosystem dur-ing plant growth. It uses nine crop parameters (maximum biomass pro-duction; biomass fraction of grain, leaf, stem, and root; biomass C/Nratio; annual N demand; thermal degree days for maturity; water de-mand; Nﬁxation index; optimum temperature; and vascularity) to de-ﬁne rice plant and simulate the daily growth and potential productivityof rice. The DNDC model calculates the stress index of water and N toevaluate the absorption of soil water and N by crops. The DOC of a reac-tion substrate transported to soil by plant root secretion is calculated totrack the circulation of C, N, and water in the ecosystem during ricegrowth. At present, crop parameters in the DNDC model mainly comefrom observed values in North America and China. Users can use the de-fault values or create their own simulated crops. Katayanagi et al. (2013)veriﬁed the N balance in the DNDC-Rice model using rice cropparameters in Japan. The results indicated that the observed values of

Yin et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 140 –149grain, stem, and root biomass were consistent with the simulated values(root-mean-square error [RMSE] = 13, 16, and 7%, respectively), butthe leaf area index, leaf biomass, and leaf N content were overestimated(RMSE = 125, 60, and 37%, respectively), mainly because of the overes-timation of rice N absorption and leaf N assimilation.2.3. Carbon dynamicsSoil organic carbon (SOC) content is a crucial indicator of soil fertil-ity. In DNDC model, soil organic carbon residues in agro-ecosystem di-vide into 4 major pools: residues, microbe, humads, and passivecarbon (Fig. 3). Each pool has 2 or 3 sub-pools with speci ﬁc default de- composition rates, which affected by soil temperature, soil moisture,soil texture and substrate concentration, etc. SOC is utilized by plantsand microorganisms andﬁnally participates in the C and N cycle. The ac-cumulation of crop residues, manure, biochar, and microbial residues inpaddy soil constitutes a critical source of soil's SOC pool. According totheir physical and chemical properties, exogenous carbon sources areallocated to different subpools of SOC with default decompositionrates. The decomposition process is affected by many factors, such as or-ganic matter type and soil texture (Li, 2016). The DNDC model can accu- rately simulate SOC and its dynamic change under speci ﬁcc l i m a t e s (R
2= 0.96) and can also complete long-term estimation ( Zhang and Shao, 2017;Ku et al., 2019).2.4. Greenhouse gas emissionsThe production and consumption of CO
2,C H 4, and N 2Oi ns o i lo c c u r through different redox reactions (decomposition, nitri ﬁcation/denitri- ﬁcation, and methane production) (Fig. 4). Eh determines whether a re- action can occur. The model constructs the “anaerobic balloon,”uses the Nernst equation to calculate Eh in the system, and then uses Eh to judgewhich redox reaction should occur. The balloon uses the Michaelis – Menten equation to quantify the kinetic effect of substrate concentra-tion on the reaction rate, realizing the conjugate calculation of the ther-modynamics and kinetics of the redox reaction generated by GHGs.Moreover, the model deﬁnes the interior of the balloon as a relativelyreduced soil microarea and the exterior as an oxidized one and allocates

Yin et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 140 –149the reaction substrate (such as DOC, NH 4+,N O 3−, and O 2) to the interior and exterior of the balloon proportionally to produce reduction or oxi-dation reactions, respectively. The DNDC model calculates the con-sumption and concentration changes of DOC, O

2,C H 4,a n dN 2O(Li et al., 2004).Because of the special water management mode of paddy ﬁelds, the soil waterﬂuctuates frequently between states of saturation andunsaturation, and the range of Eh variation can be from +650 to−350 mV. CH
4and N 2O can only be produced under speciﬁcE hc o n d i - tions (CH
4,−300 to−150 mV; N 2O, 200 to 500 mV) (Li, 2016). In the model, O
2,N O 3−,M n4+,F e3+,a n dS O 42−are added as electron acceptors and H
2and DOC are used as electron donors to more effectively trackthe change of soil Eh, determine the reaction rate of each oxidation/re-duction reaction, and calculate the generation and consumption of CH
4
and N 2O(Fumoto et al., 2008;Katayanagi et al., 2012).3. Carbon sequestration and emissions mitigation of paddy ﬁeldsThe DNDC model employs the climate, soil, crop, and agriculturalmanagement of the ecosystem as the environmental driving factors;constructs the soil biogeochemicalﬁeld, including temperature, mois-ture, pH, Eh, and substrate concentration; adopts the biogeochemicalprocess in the C and N cycle as the core process; and ﬁnally, completes the dynamic simulation of the C and N cycle of the ecosystem. TheDNDC model combines agricultural practices such as crop growth,water management, fertilizer management, and tillage. After agricul-tural practices are input, the change of the biogeochemical ﬁeld in the model affects the C and N cycle in the system, thereby affecting the C se-questration and emissions mitigation effect of the paddy ecosystem(Fig. 5). In a paddy ecosystem, agricultural practices affect the C and Ncycle and have a critical impact on its C sequestration and emissionsmitigation potential (Table 1).3.1. Carbon sequestration potential of a paddy ecosystem3.1.1. Effect of exogenous carbon addition on the carbon sequestration po-tential of a paddy ecosystemAgricultural practices are the main reason for SOC change. SOCchange is induced by two processes: (1) the consumption of SOC by mi-croorganisms through heterotrophic respiration and (2) the addition ofexogenous C. The model calculates the daily change in SOC storage bycalculating the C output (soil respiration and DOC leaching) and Cinput (such as straw return, plant litter, and manure input) of soildaily and accumulates the daily change in SOC storage to obtain the an-nual change (Li, 2016).Exogenous C input, such as straw return, manure input, or biocharapplication, can promote the accumulation of soil SOC. Yan et al. (2011)found that the average organic C content in the surface soil(0–20 cm) of cropland in China increased from 11.95 g kg−1during 1979–1982 to 12.67 g kg
−1during 2007–2008, with an average annual growth rate of 0.22%. Based on the Geographic Information System(GIS) database of soil properties and agricultural management systems,the C sequestration of farmland soil for the next 30 years was estimated.The estimations revealed that the soil in East Sichuan is in a state of con-tinuous C sequestration under current management practices ( Zhang and Shao, 2017). The main reason is the increase of crop yield and exog-enous C caused by straw return, which is an effective measure for soil Csequestration. With the increase of the straw return proportion inChina, SOC will continue to increase; however, the decomposition rateof straw left on the surface is higher than that of straw buried in thesoil, which is not conducive to the accumulation of SOC. Adding tillagemethods and the amount of straw return to the model can help simulateand evaluate the effect of different depths of straw return on Csequestration.Without straw return or manure application, the SOC of a paddyﬁeld will continue to decrease. Fresh straw return and decomposedstraw manure application can increase soil SOC content by 9% and11%, respectively (Ku et al., 2019). Manure application can promotethe increase of soil SOC content mainly because its decomposition rateis lower than that of fresh straw. The combined simulation results ofDSSAT crop model and the DNDC model indicate that soil SOC stockcan be increased by 28% with the combined application of chemical fer-tilizer and manure (Naher et al., 2020). When straw and other biomassare cracked into biochar, their properties become stable and they arebeneﬁcial for C sequestration when applied to cropland. Stable biocharcanﬁx more C in the soil. A meta-analysis revealed that biochar couldsigniﬁcantly increase the SOC content of farmland surface soil ( Liu et al., 2016). In the model, biochar is classiﬁed into inert C pools with low decomposition rates. However, biochar contains some easily de-composable components, and its stability varies depending on thesource. Therefore, determining how to use the model to evaluate the Csequestration potential of soil after biochar application remains to becompleted.

Effect of tillage practices on the carbon sequestration potential of apaddy ecosystemIn addition to the application of exogenous C, the long-term use ofplowing tillage, rotary tillage, and other traditional tillage methods inthe agricultural ecosystem has effects on soil mineralization, thereby af-fecting SOC accumulation. No-tillage practices can ﬁx C by reducing the disturbance of soil and the decomposition rate of the C pool. However,according to the results of the DNDC model, the potential of no tillagefor soil C sequestration is highly limited. In Jiangsu, China, the soil C se-questration potential at 0–30 cm soil depth under reduced tillage, notillage, and combined tillage (reduced tillage and 30% straw incorpora-tion), was quantitatively estimated, which indicated that the applica-tion of reduced tillage and no tillage could increase the accumulationof SOC in some paddyﬁelds, and combined tillage had twice potentialfor C sequestration than in reduced tillage ( Xu et al., 2012b). Site exper- iment and model simulation results in Ningxia and Hunan province alsoshowed that the effect of no tillage combined with straw return on soil Csequestration was superior to that of no tillage only ( Huang et al., 2012). However, some studies have conﬁrmed that no tillage practices lead tosoil hardening and affect soil aeration and crop yield ( Pittelkow et al., 2015). Therefore, comprehensive consideration is required whenassessing the C sequestration potential of tillage practices.3.2. Greenhouse gas emissions mitigation potential of a paddy ecosystem3.2.1. Effects of water management measures on the emissions mitigationpotential of a paddy ecosystemCH
4is produced by methanogenic bacteria using soil humus, riceroot exudates, soil microbial residues, and organic materials as sub-strates. In the root exudation area (around the root) or soil micro-oxidation area, some CH
4is oxidized to CO 2and H 2O by methanotrophic bacteria, and some CH
4that is not oxidized is discharged into the atmo-sphere through rice plants, bubbles, and liquid diffusion. The modelbuilds a module based on an anaerobic balloon, which can effectivelyimplement and stimulate CH
4and N 2O emissions inﬂooded paddy ﬁelds.Flooded paddyﬁelds are a critical source of CH
4emissions, and the key to reducing such emissions is to optimize water management.Mid-season drainage not only inhibits the ineffective tillering of ricethrough water stress but also reduces CH
4emissions through promoting the oxidation of CH
4. Compared with continuousﬂooding, mid-season drainage can signiﬁcantly reduce the total CH
4emissions from paddy ﬁelds by 36% to 77% (Zou et al., 2005;Wang et al., 2012b).Li et al. (2004, 2005)used the DNDC model to evaluate the potential of paddyemissions mitigation in China, and their results indicated that mid-season drainage water management could reduce CH
4emissions by 4.2–4.7 Tg CH
4-C yr-1while increasing N 2O emissions by 0.13–0.20 Tg N
2O-N yr-1from paddyﬁelds in China. Compared with the practice ofsingle drainage, multiple drainage can further reduce CH
4emissions during rice growth (Sander et al., 2016), which is consistent with simu- lation results of the model (Minamikawa et al., 2016). Compared with ﬂooding, single and multiple drainage in 2051 –2060 reduced CH
4emis- sions by 21.9–22.9% and 53.5–55.2%, respectively, under the RCP4.5 sce-nario (Minamikawa et al., 2016).In addition, the DNDC model can deﬁne numerous water manage- ment modes. This enables the simulation analysis of GHG emission sce-narios under various types of water management to effectively predicttheir emissions mitigation potential in time and space scales. After pa-rameterizing two rice varieties, namely M206 (a high-yield and semi-dwarf variety) and Koshihikari (a traditional variety), Simmonds et al. (2015)simulated the grain yield and CH
4and N 2O emissions of rice under different N loads and water management types with water-seeding and dry-seeding cultivation. The results indicated that DNDCcould distinguish the rice yield of the two varieties and reproduce theCH
4emission dynamics under different management scenarios.Water-saving irrigation management, such as controlled irrigation andalternate wetting and drying, can signiﬁcantly reduce CH4emissions but may also promote N
2O emissions (Zhou et al., 2020). Field experi- ment and model evaluation results revealed that alternate wettingand drying effectively reduced CH
4emissions during rice growing sea-sons but also simultaneously stimulated N
2O emissions; furthermore, the comprehensive global warming potential (GWP) was only one-third of that underﬂooding management (Katayanagi et al., 2012). The model could also effectively simulate the dynamics of CH
4emission peak values in the rice–dry crop rotation system, which was basicallyconsistent withﬁeld observation results (Zhang, 2013;Chun et al., 2016).3.2.2. Effect of nitrogen management on emissions mitigation potential of apaddy ecosystemChemical N fertilizer and manure provide the substrate source forsoil nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation microorganisms, which is the mostcritical factor affecting N
2O emissions. The global annual N 2O emissions from the application of chemical N fertilizer and manure were 2.0 ± 0.8Tg N and 0.6 ± 0.4 Tg N, respectively ( Li and Ju, 2020). The N
2Oe m i s - sions caused by theﬁeld fertilization practice accounted for 33% oftotal N
2O emissions. The continuously increasing amount of fertilizerbeing applied has been the main reason for the global N
2O emissions in- crease. Many studies have conﬁrmed that soil N
2O emissions increase linearly or exponentially with the increase of N application(Shcherbak et al., 2014;Wang et al., 2018). To reduce the application amount of N fertilizer, improve the utiliza-tion rate, and reduce the N
2O emissions of cropland soil, many scientistshave summarized a concept and technology based on the optimizationof N management called the 4Rs: right fertilizer rate, right applicationtime, right place, and right source. The submodule of N application inthe model includes factors such as the type, amount, time, and modeof application, which provide a foundation for the estimation of the im-pact of 4R technology on GHG emissions.Based on DNDC model, the simulated value of crop yield was ﬁtted the measured value well in rice-wheat rotation system under differentN application, which reﬂected the relationship between crop yield andN application; when N fertilizer application reached 60% of the conven-tional amount, the increase in N no longer promoted a signi ﬁcant in- crease in crop yield, whereas the comprehensive greenhouse effectdecreased by 43% compared with the conventional practice ( Li, 2012). After the rice varieties were parameterized by Simmonds et al. (2015), the model could reproduce the CH
4emission dynamics under differentamounts of N fertilizer and differentﬂooding times. The results of DNDCestimation indicated that GHG emissions could be reduced without af-fecting the crop yield through reducing the amount of N applied basedon the current amount. At present, a large potential exists for reducingthe use of chemical N fertilizer in China. The paddy yield will be stabi-lized when the amount of N fertilizer is reduced by 0.88 Tg per year.In the main rice growing regions of China, such as Jiangsu, Yunnan, Gui-zhou, and Hubei provinces, GHG emissions can be reduced by as muchas 40% through N fertilizer reduction ( Chen et al., 2016).3.2.3. Effect of exogenous carbon addition on the emissions mitigation po-tential of a paddy ecosystemThe reasonable addition of exogenous C can affect CH
4emissions in paddyﬁelds. Numerous studies have shown that all types of exogenousC, such as straw, green manure, and organic manure, provide rich sub-strates for methanogens and can signiﬁcantly promote CH
4emissions from riceﬁelds (Wang et al., 2012b;Zhou et al., 2020). Compared with no exogenous carbon addition, manure input and straw incorpora-tion enhanced CH
4emission per unit of rice yield signiﬁcantly, with 54% and 107% increase respectively (Zhao et al., 2019b). Straw return or ma- nure application can suddenly increase the content of soil organic mat-ter, but it will be gradually decomposed by soil microorganisms,providing a rich substrate for methanogens and other microorganisms.The model constructed the effect of environmental conditions on146 S. Yin et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 140 –149microbial decomposition activity, which can accurately reproduce thebiogeochemical process of exogenous C addition.In addition, CH
4emissions increased signiﬁcantly under the scenar- ios of high straw return and manure application ( Wang et al., 2012a). The results of model simulations andﬁeld experiments indicated that N
2O emissions were affected by straw return amount, return type, andreturn depth. Returning straw to theﬁeld after incineration resulted in signiﬁcantly higher N
2O emissions than returning to theﬁeld directly (Chen et al., 2015). After the indices of alfalfa and broad bean were pa-rameterized in the DNDC model, the observed values and simulated re-sults ofGao et al. (2016)revealed that the application of alfalfa andbroad bean straw during rice growing season signi ﬁcantly increased CH
4emissions, and the effect of broad bean straw was greater thanthat of Alfalfa straw. In different rice rotation systems, the GHG emissionof a rice–Chinese milk vetch rotation system was lower than that of arice–wheat rotation system (Zhang et al., 2019b). However, the model cannot accurately express the effect of biochar treatment on CH
4and N
2O because no speciﬁc input parameter exists for biochar in themodel (Wang, 2013).3.2.4. Effect of coupling agricultural practices on the emissions mitigationpotential of a paddy ecosystemIn actual rice production, the pairing of water and fertilizer and otheragricultural practices is often used to stabilize the yield and reduce GHGemissions. A reduction in N application by 15.7% would not reduce riceyield in China, and the combination of shallow irrigation and appropri-ate fertilization could reduce GHG emissions by 34.3% while increasingthe rice yield by 1.7% (Chen et al., 2016). The most effective measures for GHG emission mitigation in paddyﬁelds are upland rice cultivation Nshallow irrigationNuse of ammonium sulfate instead of urea or am-monium bicarbonateNmedium-term sun dryingNstraw return in nonrice-growing seasonNapplication of slow-release fertilizerNcontin- uousﬂooding irrigation (Li et al., 2006).Tian et al. (2018)paired the DNDC model with the DSSAT model and Agro-Ecological Zone modelto evaluate the balance relationship between GHG emissions and yieldunder Chinese rice-planting conditions. The simulation results showedthat CH
4and N 2O emissions could be reduced while the yield was guar-anteed under the double management measures of mid-season drain-age and balanced fertilization. The DNDC model can also be used toanalyze the N balance and N use efﬁciency of paddyﬁelds under differ- ent irrigation, fertilization, and controlled drainage conditions. Whenwater-saving irrigation is applied and the amount of N applied doesnot exceed 180 kg N ha
-1, the soil N pool of paddyﬁeld is loss (54.7–- 127.6 kg N ha
-1). Except for shallow irrigation–deep storage–medium level N application and shallow irrigation –deep storage–high N applica- tion, the N deﬁcit of controlled drainage treatment was greater than thatin conventional drainage treatment. The combination of shallow irriga-t i o n ,d e e ps t o r a g e ,m e d i u ml e v e lN ,a n dc o n t r o l l e dd r a i n a g ew a st h eo p -timal water and fertilizer treatment mode ( Liu and Shao, 2013). The application of plastic mulching cultivation technology can solvethe problem of winter irrigation of paddy rice in northwest China, and itis also a crucial form of agricultural management for CH
4emission mit- igation. Compared with continuousﬂooding, plastic mulching could sig-niﬁcantly reduce CH
4emissions by 86% while maintaining rice yield(Zhang et al., 2013). Moreover, compared with aﬁeld without mulching, the soil climate of aﬁeld with mulching was signiﬁcantly dif- ferent, mainly with respect toﬁeld evapotranspiration, heat exchange,and soil aeration, which affected the soil temperature and moisture, mi-crobial activity, and gas diffusion emissions. Many studies have modi-ﬁed and optimized the mulching submodule of the DNDC model ( Han et al., 2014;Zhang et al., 2019a;Zhou et al., 2019). The model can sim- ulate the soil temperature and moisture accurately under differentmulching density scenarios. However, few studies have been conductedon GHG emissions simulation under the condition of paddy ﬁeld mulching.In addition, cultivating and selecting varieties with excellent droughtresistance and high yield play crucial roles in water saving and emissionsmitigation. In recent years, China has developed a new variety of culti-vated rice, namely water-saving and drought-resistant rice (WDR),which differs from lowland and upland rice varieties. WDR has the char-acteristics of high-yield and high-quality rice and the water-saving anddrought-resistant properties of upland rice. When irrigation was reducedby 50%, the yield and quality of WDR were the same as those of traditionalrice (Luo, 2018). When irrigation was reduced by 70%, its CH4emissions decreased by 51–77% while the yield remained relatively stable ( Sun et al., 2016). The emergence of WDR combines the advantages of thehigh yield of lowland rice and low water demand of upland rice. Thewater demand, root exudates, and root oxygen secretion ability differfrom those of conventional lowland rice, resulting in the speci ﬁcity of GHG emissions and N loss. How to make more effective use of theDNDC model to evaluate its potential in paddy ﬁeld emissions mitigation is one of the directions for model improvement and optimization.4. ConclusionIt is critical to recognize the potential of C sequestration and emis-s i o n sm i t i g a t i o ni np a d d yﬁelds for dealing with global climate change.Many studies have made numerous achievements in case studies of Csequestration and emissions mitigation. Since the establishment of theDNDC model, researchers worldwide have used their ﬁeld data to verify and correct the model, which has caused the continual increase of itscredibility and continual expansion of its functionality and scope. Themodel can now be used in various terrestrial ecosystems to predictcrop growth, soil C and N dynamics, GHG emissions, and N loss.After modiﬁcation and calibration, the model has been applied to theassessment of GHG emissions and the SOC sequestration potential of Csequestration and emissions mitigation measures such as straw return,water management, and N reduction. Moreover, it is necessary to fur-ther analyze the effects of various management measures —such as straw return to theﬁeld, biochar application, and water managementfromﬂooding to water-saving irrigation —on the comprehensive poten- tial of C sequestration and emissions mitigation in paddy ﬁelds; thus, the timing for exogenous C application and water management can bearranged and the C sequestration and emissions mitigation potentialof this measure can be maximized.With the aggravation of environmental problems and the improve-ment of agricultural practices, expectations for the prediction functionof the model are increasing. In the future, it will be necessary to evaluatethe comprehensive effects of various farmland measures on SOCchange, GHG emissions, food security, and ecological environments.How to make more effective use of the DNDC model to serve the low-C production of rice from the point to regional scale as well as how toestablish a reliable prediction and evaluation system under agriculturalpractices and climate scenarios are the development trends for themodel's application.CRediT author statementShan Yin: Conceptualization, Writing - Original Draft; Xianxian Zhang: Conceptualization, Writing - Original Draft; Junyao Lyu: Writ- ing - Original Draft;Yuee Zhi:Investigation, Resources;Feng Chen:I n - vestigation, Resources;Longqin Wang: Investigation, Resources; Chunjiang Liu: Writing - Review & Editing, Project administration;Sheng Zhou: Writing - Review & Editing, Project administration.AcknowledgementsThis study wasﬁnanced by the National Key Research and Develop-ment Program of China, China (2017YFD0800204), and Shanghai Agricul-ture Applied Technology Development Program, China (G2016060301and 2018(1-3)).147 S.
