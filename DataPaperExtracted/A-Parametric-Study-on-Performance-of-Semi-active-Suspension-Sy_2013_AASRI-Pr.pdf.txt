Abstract
The research paper involves modeling of semi -active suspension system using quarte r car model in Simulink environment.
In orde r to modulate the damping coeffici ent value, fuzzy logic controller is modeled using Fuzzy Tool Box. Three
different damping coefficient limits  are selected for analyzing the response of system in terms of ride comfort. Road 
disturbance profile comprising a combination of two sinu soidal curves is modeled and the threesemi-active suspension 
systems are simulated. Suspensio n displacement and velo city parameters are selected as  the indicators of ride comfort.
The results manifest supremacy of the system having damp ing coefficient limit of 4000 N s/m. The optimized system
performs well fulfilling the requirements of minimum p ercentage overshoot and rapid stabilizing time .

ability to modulate the damping coefficient of damper but the direction of damping force is dependent on the relative velocity across the sprung and unsprung masses.  I n  c a s e  o f  a n  a c t i v e  s uspension, an actuator is incorporated that provides force without being influenced by relative velocity. A semi-active suspension system performs better in improving the ride comfort and road handling keeping the complexity and cost at minimum. The system incorporates a damper that can modulate its damping coefficient. Semi-active systems are classified as systems where the characteristics can be changed rapidly (typically in less than 100 milliseconds) [1]. These systems can still store energy (springs) or dissipate energy (dampers). Adjustment of the orifice area in the damper  regulates the damping force that ultimately alters the fluid flow resistance. The development of electrorheological (ER) and magnetorheological (MR) fluids has boosted research in the field of semi-active suspensions [1]. Nowadays, the mentioned conflicting requirements cannot be met with passive suspension systems; therefore, the application of active and semi-active suspensions is mandatory [2].  It was in early 1970s that active vehicle suspension systems were developed focusing on the optimization of tradeoff between ride quality and road handling [3 ]. Published research reveals significant improvements have been made in terms of ride quality and road handling using prototype active suspensions compared to passive suspension systems. The active suspension systems are complex, bulky and expensive and therefore, they are not commonly used in commercial vehicles. Issues related to the design and control aspects in active suspension systems appear to be the real challenges. An excessive power is required that results in heavy loads on the engine.  Semi-active suspension is a better choice than active suspension at the cost of ride comfort and road handling but there is not a significant degradation of the performance [3]. Semi-active suspensions need a damper and few sensors for adequate performance. Th e damping force can easily be varied instantaneously with the introduction of MR fluid dampers. Semi-activ e technology can materialize the variation of damping between the softer and harder limits in accordance with the situation as compared to the passive system [4]. The paper describes modeling of semi-active suspension systems based on variable damping coefficient limit. The models are designed in Simulink while the fuzzy logic controller is incorporated through Fuzzy Tool Box. Section 2 describes the modeling of systems and road disturbance profile. Section 3 explicates the design scheme of fuzzy logic controller. Section 4 describes the simulation and results. A parametric analysis is presented based on the statistics. Conclusion is elaborated in Section 5. 2. Modeling of Systems For simulation purpose, quarter car parameters have b een taken from reference data [5]. Road disturbance profile comprises combination of two sinusoidal inputs. The Simulink model is depicted in Fig. 1. 2.1. Modeling of Semi-Active Suspension Systems For a semi-active suspension Simulink model, the damp ing coefficient needs to be varied. In order to incorporate the varying capability of damping coefficien t, a fuzzy logic controller in added in the Simulink model as shown in Fig. 2. Three fuzzy based systems are designed on the basis of different damping coefficient limits of 3000, 4000 and 5000 N s/m.      156   Abroon Jamal Qazi et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  154 – 159

3. Design of Fuzzy Logic Controller Fuzzy logic control system is depicted in Fig. 3. Error signal is fed into the fuzzy logic controller. Fuzzification converts the crisp values into fuzzy variables. Fuzzy inference system besides control rules process the fuzzy values and finally the fuzzy variables are transformed back to crisp values through defuzzification [6]. The fuzzy logic controller designed in this research comprises two inputs of relative displacement and relative velocity across the suspen sion and an output of damping coefficient.  4. Simulation Results and Discussion This section describes the simulation and analyzes the results in detail. The simulation results of suspension displacement are displayed in Fig. 4 for different values of maximum damping coefficient limit. System having damping coefficient limit of 4000 N s/m exhibits best performance for having no overshoot and fastest stabilizing time. System having damping co efficient value of 3000 N s/m performs the worst.

5. Conclusion Semi-active suspension systems have been designed based on variable damping coefficient limit. The system having damping coefficient limit of 4000 N s/m performs the best in terms of ride comfort. The optimized system manifests its better performance owing to minimum stabilizing time and zero percentage overshoot. The system is validated for its performance in relation to a combination of two different disturbance inputs. Future work may include prototyping of the quarter car suspension model for subsequent testing in the loop.
