We present an interdisciplinary approach to data clustering, based on an algorithm originally developed for theBig Data Modelling of Sustainable Development Goals (BDMSDG). Its application context combines mechanics ofmachine learning techniques with underlying pedagogical domain knowledge –unifying the narratives of data scientists and educationists in searching for potentially useful information in historical data. From an initialstructure masking, results from multiple samples of identi ﬁed set of two toﬁve clusters, reveal a consistent number of three clear clusters. We present and discuss the results from a technical and soft perspectives tostimulate interdisciplinarity and support decision making. We explain how the ﬁndings of this paper present not only continuity of on–going clustering optimisation, but also an intriguing starting point for interdisciplinarydiscussions aimed at enhancement of students performance.
1. IntroductionThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals SDG [ 1] iden- tiﬁes good quality education as the foundation for creating sustainabledevelopment, improved quality of life, innovation and creativity. In-vestment in the sector of education and pedagogical innovations arewell–documented, especially in the developed world. However, despiteall the evidence on its impact on our livelihood, we are still witnessinghuge gaps and variations in attainment and performance across theworld. This paper presents an interdisciplinary approach to Big DataModelling, based on an algorithm designed for machine learning tech-niques. The main motivation of this paper is to expand pathways foreducationists and researchers in attaining uni ﬁed efforts to uncover and analyse such factors in interdisciplinary contexts. It seeks to address theforegoing challenges by tracking undiscernible and potentially usefulinformation hidden in multiple data attributes. Unlike in Miguis et al.[2], Brooks et al. [3] and Hua Leong and Marshall [4], where the focus was on the segmentation of the dynamics of static groups, this papertakes a Big Data modelling approach to tracking potential triggers ofperformance among University students (3639 observations on 19 vari-ables) over an 11-year period (2005–2016). This work follows national guidelines of the Commission for Academic Accreditation (CAA) withinthe Ministry of Education (MoE) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)which is authorized to license educational institutions, accredit programsand grant degrees and other academic awards across the country.The Standards that guide the foregoing processes and the criteria thatinstitutions must meet are speciﬁed in the Standards for InstitutionalLicensure and Program Accreditation [ 5]. It is clearly stipulated in SILPA [5] that institutions offering programs in professional ﬁelds such as medicine and other health-related disciplines, education, engineeringand others must have to provide opportunities for learning throughworkplace experience, such as internships or practicums. Internshipsprovide a structured practical learning experience where students areacademically supervised and undergo a rigorous process to complementtheir theoretical learning. At the university degree level, internships areusually required, as a part of the major's curriculum and as such they

Research shows that through internships, students add morevalue to their knowledge by getting exposed to real life experimentallearning experiences and opportunities. The paper is organised as fol-lows. Section1presents the background, motivation, research aim, ob-jectives and a brief review of relevant literature. Section 2details the methods–data description and modelling techniques, followed byimplementation, analyses, results and general discussions in Section 3. Finally, concluding remarks are drawn in Section 4, highlighting poten- tial new research directions.1.1. MotivationAttaining good quality education is the ideal dream of all learners,institutions and nations across the world Pumilia [ 6], Meusburger [7]. The United Nations identiﬁes good quality education as the foundationfor creating sustainable development, naturally leading to improvedquality of life, innovation and creativity. In the modern era where wegenerate more data than we can process, the issue becomes both achallenge and an opportunity. In a typically academic environmentwhere thousands of multilateral demographic students study multiplemodules at different levels, the underlying and resulting data attributesare highly correlated sources of Big Data [ 8,9]. Just what type of data, how much of it and how fast it changes are questions that researchershave to deal with routinely. A key motivation of this paper is to expandpathways for educationists and researchers in attaining uni ﬁed efforts to uncover and analyse such factors in interdisciplinary contexts. It is ex-pected that this work will contribute to the work of the Center for HigherEducation Data and Statistics (CHEDS) that collects vital educational datafor the MoE. CHEDS [10] makes evidence-based decisions, inﬂuencing higher education policies and planning at both institutional and nationallevels. This helps the educational sector to enhance their strengths andranking in the increasingly competitive world of higher education. Re-ports and analyses will help in advancing students learning experiencesand curriculum designs.1.2. Research aim and objectivesThe aim of this paper is to highlight robust pathways for applyingmachine learning techniques in real –life applications in an interdisci- plinary context [11]. It seeks to address the problem around optimising naturally arising patterns in large datasets –applying a clustering technique within an integrated generic algorithm in detecting andmodelling potentially relevant educational performance data attributes.Its objectives, listed below, are two–fold. Objectives 1 through 3 focus onthe technical aspects of the work, while 4 and 5 are on the underlyingdomain knowledge.1. To capture multiple data attributes on students' performance acrossdisciplines and carry out data cleaning, data wrangling and initialexploratory analyses for the purpose of gaining insights into the data.2. To explore initial data for indications of inherent patterns based onselected key attributes–specialisation, level of study, gender and theirpotential impact on performance.3 To assess the performance of a novel algorithm based on the me-chanics of a standard clustering algorithm.4. To highlight pathways for educationists, data scientists and otherresearchers to follow in engaging policy makers, developmentstakeholders and the general public in putting generated data to use.5. To shareﬁndings with colleagues across disciplines and contributetowards uniﬁcation scientiﬁc research.1.3. Preliminary studies
Attwell and Pumilia [6] emphasised the need for forging pedagogicalcompetences in analysing and sharing results across disciplines. Theyparticularly reiterated the use of open –source material in higher educa- tion, mainly for providing scholars and learners with easy access to data,information and knowledge. Data–driven investigations into aspects ofteaching, learning and assessment have attracted interests of many re-searchers and professionals, not least educationists and data analysts formany years. This paper looks at the two as homing in to a commoninterdisciplinary problem and solution. While the former seek to enhancethe learning process, the latter focus mainly on the tools, techniques thatare deployed for learning enhancements. On face value, the two may beseen as representing soft and technical skills respectively, but togetherthey form an interdisciplinary fabric upon which the learning process canthrive. In recent years, interdisciplinarity has been widely promoted as alearning methodology. For example Aikat et al. [ 12], see an interdisci- plinary gap in graduate education, as it “…remains largely focused on individual achievement within a single scienti ﬁc domain.”They argue that lacking interdisciplinary pedagogy deprives students ofdata-oriented approaches that could help them “…translate scientiﬁc data into new solutions to today's critical challenges. ”Thus, they propose a data-centered pedagogy for graduate education that uni ﬁes the efforts of the educationist and the data scientist. This paper has been stronglyinﬂuenced by the foregoing narratives [ 6,12], which despite a ten–year gap between them, they didn't exhibit a strong data –driven evidence. In searching for potentially useful information in the students data attri-butes, we shall be adopting their narrative.2. MethodsWe present the study methodology as a collection of projects, relatingto cause-effect relationship between knowledge&development in a spatio–temporal context. The methodology, described below, focuses ongaining insights into the learning fabric of the sampled students, usingidentiﬁable attributes as drivers, to learn the concept via unsupervised.Its original ideas are in derive from predictive modelling derive from [ 8, 9], where it has been applied to map and deliver knowledge about so-cietal SDG clusters.2.1. Data sourcesA total of 3639 observations of individual students on 19 variableswere obtained from a University data repository, in the United ArabEmirates, spanning across the period 2005 through 2016 inclusive. Theﬁnal data attributes, summarised inTable 1, were the result of a laborious data preparation and cleaning process involving 4366 observations.2.2. Implementation strategyImplementation strategy is driven by model optimisation achieved byharmonising data variability through Sampling-Measuring-Assessing(SMA)Algorithm 1[8,9,13]. The algorithm can be adapted for bothunsupervised and supervised modelling scenarios and, in a typical un-supervised learning, where the goal is to cluster data objects according tosome measures of homogeneity (heterogeneity), the focus is on param-eter estimation and likelihood. Implementation starts with ExploratoryData Analysis (EDA), presenting the data in

The SMA algorithm also caters for association rules, which can beused to investigate associations among the data attributes in Table 1and data clustering, for investigating variations among the variables and thenaturally emerging natural structures. The estimates can be obtained invarious ways, one of the most common method is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, based on the original ideas of Markov Chain MonteCarlo (MCMC) simulation techniques [ 17], that allow for sampling from probability distributions as long as the density function can be evaluated.2.3. Sequence of analysesImplementation goes through a sequence of logical steps. We deployExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to provide initial insights into thegeneral behaviour of the student data attributes. Ideally, EDA shouldguide through understanding interpretation of the analyses and resultsfrom data visualisation and other summaries. Based on the data insightsfrom EDA, we adopt unsupervised modelling is implemented bydeployingAlgorithm 1based on Afﬁnity Propagation Clustering (APC) algorithm as originally described in [ 18] and illustrated in [19]. Its original ideas are to merge data clusters until satisfactory levels of sim-ilarity (or dissimilarity) are achieved. This type of cluster merging is onlypossible if the dataset has inherent clusters not less than the initialnumber stipulated by the algorithm, hence the rationale for EDA.Further, it should be possible to repeatedly extract samples from the datathat could then be merged into a cluster Frey and Dueck [ 18]. describe the merged clusters as exemplars that maximize the levels of averagesimilarity. By repeated sampling and validation, we shall gain a betterunderstanding of the inﬂuential factors in the formation of clusters. In thenext exposition, we describe the mechanics of propagated clustering asdeployed viaAlgorithm 1[8,9]. If we letX¼/C2x

3. Implementation, analyses and resultsImplementation goes through a sequence of logical steps. Insightsgained from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) guide the applications ofAlgorithm 1based on Afﬁnity Propagation Clustering algorithm asoriginally described in [18] and illustrated in [19]. EDA plays a crucial role in deﬁning the research problem and objectives. We adopt it here asan initial step in grouping students according to some measures ofsimilarity.3.1. Graphical data visualisationThe two panels inFig. 1provide basic insights into existing frequencystructures in the data based on three key attributes –specialisation, level of study and gender. The most popular courses are law, education andbusiness administration at bachelors and diploma levels. Females have asigniﬁcant representation in the three most popular courses. Theydominate in education, have a fare share in business administration andthey make over 34% of law enrolment.Alongside the key performance metrics, we shall use the baseline
statistics above as the focal points of our analyses. The six panels in Fig. 2 provide the underlying distributional patterns of the Grade Point Average(GPA) metric and they generally provide a rough idea about the numberof clusters, hence highlighting the path towards unsupervised modelling.Our implementation strategy is driven by the structures in the two Figs. 1 and 2.

4The six panels inFig. 2exhibit the overall GPA distributions betweenprior and post–intern semesters, appearing to be fairly similar. As ourinterest is in detecting naturally arising structures in, we can examine thedistributions from different bandwidths. Fig. 3shows that only at very low bandwidths we can detect underlying structured in each of the GPAcategory–more pronounced in the before semester than in the other two.The average GPAs before, in–semester and after semester are 2.74,3.11 and 2.84 respectively, suggesting either spurious clusters or mask-ing in the top left panel inFig. 3. In the next exposition, we carry outfurther explorations by looking at the densities of the individual domi-nating categories–Law, Education and Business Administration.

Fig. 4show patterns for two, three,four andﬁve clusters, clock–wise from top left respectively. They bothindicate a separation not based on the average GPA. Hence, we take acloser look at the data to establish the basis of the clusters ’formation.

The remaining columnsrepresent data from the attributesSpecialisationandGender.Table 2b shows the average GPA levels in each of the selected categories. Thesestatistics are potentially useful in the sense that the choice of a course,specialisation and performance are conditional on various factorsincluding the quality of teaching and delivery, course organisation andgeneral management as well as assessment and feedback students receive[20]. Such statistics could help the [ 10] in the UAE in making evidence-based decisions to guide and inﬂuence higher education pol- icies and planning at all levels.

7The two panels inFig. 5correspond to values inTable 2a and2b respectively. The horizontal axis on the left hand side panel correspondsto the three specialisation categories and gender in the order given in thetwo tables and the vertical axis represents the category percentage. Thehorizontal axis on the right hand side panel displays the 14 clusters asshown in theﬁrst column ofTable 2a, while the vertical axis shows the average GPAs. By visual inspection through the line, cluster overlappingis evident–those on the same horizontal line have similar scores.
As noted earlier, the clusters inFig. 4heavily overlap. Thus, to determine the optimal number of clusters in the sampled data, we referback to the densities inFig. 3and the enrolment proportions and GPAaverages inFig. 5. Repeated sampling throughAlgorithm 1yields in the consistent GPA average performance densities in Fig. 6.
The patterns inFig. 6are the best representations of the underlyingstructure in the sampled data. They were obtained based on multiple runsof sampling through the data inside the clusters in Fig. 4. Both panelspresent a clear conclusion that in terms of GPA performance based on thesampled data, we can isolate three distinct clusters, centered aroundGPAs of 3.5, 3.0 and between 2.5 and 2.0. It is important to note thatthree clusters are dependent on both level and gender, which the twopanels do not distinguish. While a table detailing the dominance in each
category may be useful, it is imperative to interpret such data inconjunction with other relevant attributes, such as the left hand sidepanel ofFig. 5. The data for each of the 14 clusters is available for po-tential future examinations.

8focused on the technical aspects of Big Data Modelling, for which itdeployed the afﬁnity clustering algorithm [18,19] based on the me- chanics of the SMA algorithm [8,9]. On the other hand, it focused on thesoft, interdisciplinary aspects of BDM –i.e., applying machine learning techniques to real–life applications in an interdisciplinary context. Ob-jectives 1 through 3 were met in sub–sections3.1 and 3.2. It is imperative to note that more analyses could have been carried out based on thesettings in this paper. However, the scope for this application wasconﬁned to 3 of the original 19 attributes–i.e., Specialisation, Level and Gender, so as to accommodate the technical aspect of the set objectivesunder limited interdisciplinary interpretations. The ﬁndings presented in this paper are therefore intended to fulﬁl objectives 4 and 5–i.e., they should open new discussions and highlight novel paths for interdisci-plinary research involving data scientists and educationists.Even within this limited application, ourﬁndings show that there are great potentials in incorporating interdisciplinary approaches in uni-versity curricula, bringing together domain sciences on the one side anddata science on the other. Further tests and evaluations of the SMA al-gorithm can conducted using a wide range of unsupervised and super-vised techniques, with any combination of the 19 data attributes.Algorithm 1is also capable of handling association rules –originally developed for analysing shopping transactions Agrawal et al. [ 21]. In this particular application, association rules can play a unifying role betweenunsupervised and supervised modelling in that they can capture under-lying rules of association among the students ’data attributes. We expect the technical and soft aspects of the paper to increasingly attract atten-tion to collaborative, interdisciplinary research activities in varioussectors.Finally, and as emphasised by Aikat et al. [ 12], our paper showed, via real data, that uncovering attainment and performance triggers cannot beconﬁned to silos of domain knowledge, neither to algorithms developedby data scientists. A uniﬁed understanding can only be achieved throughcross–institutional collaborative research, sharing data and ﬁndings. The outcomes of this work should provide useful inputs to the Center forHigher Education Data and Statistics (CHEDS) of the United Arab Emir-ates in forging interdisciplinarity for educational performanceenhancement.Declaration of competing interestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in ﬂuence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgementsThis paper is part of on–going initiatives towards Big Data Modellingof Sustainable Development Goals (BDMSDG) and the application of theDSF both authors have been involved in over the last three years.
