Abstract 
Albania is relatively rich with low up to the middle enthalpy, geothermal resources. Their temperature varies from 34°C up to 65.5°C to Kozani -8, the most important among the Albanian  geothermal wells. It had been drilled in 1989. The well is located on the hills, 26km SE of Tirana. It encounters limestone strata at 1819m, penetrating 10m into the section. The yield of the well is 10.3 l/s, and is stable from more than 23 years. The geographical position of the well, placed in the middle of a village, very close to the corridor 8, are the basic parameters on choosing these waters for our designs and calculations. The design provides the cascade and integral use, but not only. It also provide the electricity generations, through a hybrid system. The centre will be also equipped with SPA, open and closed pools, fitness, massages, and greenhouse & also aquaculture pools.  The economic analyses sh ows that this resource is completely competitive, and is 
ving standards for the local community.

 1. Introduction The Ishmi-
next to the Kruja historical city, the wonderful Adriatic Sea beaches & Lake of Ohrid. The demonstrative geothermal centre, with the cascade and integral use, but also combined with the solar panels (hybrid system), is designed for the Kozani-8 well waters. The choice had been made because of its temperature, on the value 
huge economical loses. Among different processes of the cascade, will be released CO 2 and H 2S, which will be used for food products (conservation) and medical pu rposes.  The hybrid system, combing of the middle enthalpy geothermal waters, with the solar panels, based on the fact that the Albanian climate allow such a thing (there are more than 280 sunny days on the area), will improve the economic efficiency of the project.

1.1. The geological structure of the region Kozani-8 geothermal well lies on the limestone structure of Kozani, which lies about 180 km, with a width of 4-5 km [6]. On the regional point of view, sink up to the depth of 10 km, where they are placed above the Triassic evaporites formation Aliaj et al., 1996. In this depth the temperature reach the values of 120-150°C. Important for this region is the presence of the tectoni c, related with the evaporites formations, Hyseni et al., 2000. Kozani-8 well is placed in the S-E of Tirana. The water comes from the interval 1816-1837 m of depth Frashëri et al., 2004. The formation temperature is 80° C, while the pressure is 191 bars. The wellhead pressure is 12 bars, while the temperature is 65.5°C. The mineralisation is 4.6 g/l, Frashëri et al., 2004. 
 
1.2. Energetic reserves evaluation of the Kozani limestone structure  
The formation heat is calculated through the relation Frashëri et al., 2004:

1.3. The scheme for the integral, cascade and hybrid use of the Kozani-8 geothermal waters It was thought by the group of authors, that the best and more efficient way to use the geothermal waters of Kozani-8 well is the constructions of a multicenter. Th e center will include the SPA, massage and fitness center, open and closed pools (with different sizes an d temperatures), greenhouse, aquaculture cultivation pools, conference rooms etc. The center will be heated through the geothermal direct use (through the installation of the heat exchangers) Ingersoll et al., 195 0, while for the cooling will be installed a geothermal heat pump, Harlow & Klapper, 1952. The roof will be covered will solar panels, whose will provide the 294   KODHELAJ Nevton et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   3  ( 2012 )  291 – 298 
 sanitary water and also a part of them, will circulate the geothermal water, increase its temperature, allowing so the electricity production (the hybrid system). This electricity will serve for the lighting system of the center (green energy). In the Fig. 2, is showed the frontal and lateral view of the center, while in the Fig. 3, the principal sketch of the cascade and the hybrid system.

 1.4. Heat looses The proposed centre will have several pools: 1 ge othermal pool (designed as a natural pond, sized 10*8*0.5 m, water temperature 38°C-degasified); 1 ope n Olympic pool (sized 50*23*3 m, water temperature 30°C); 1 sweet water pool (sized 10*5*1.5 m-escalate, wa ter temperature 38°C-degasified, lightly closed); 1 kids sweet water pool (sized 5*3*0.5 m-escalate, water temperature 30°C). The criteria for pool designing are: psychological and physiological comfort, roads width 1- 3 m, height of the closed pools 4 m, temperature & humidity level, easy maintenance and the noise level below 60 dB.  The thermal loads, based on their nature and effect on the thermal balance, can be calculated as loses or thermal increment. The heat loses of the system are influenced by a number of factors including the number of the guests, their  physical activity, the 
ctrical 
super dimensioning. In the Fig. 4 is showed the water  circulation scheme for the pools.  On the first cascade the water will be used for house-heating and also for pools.  The water discharged by the geothermal and hot water pool (38°C) will be used for the spirulina culti vation. On the first heat exchanger the water supply should be 22.69 t/h of water, for an installed capacity of 512 kW, Kodhelaj 2012. This amount of energy will be transmitted through the sweet water, heated at the le vel of 45-50°C. On the second heat exchanger are needed 15 [t/h of water] for an installed capacity of 480 kW. The water temperature in this heat exchanger should be in the range of 40-50°C, Kodhelaj 2012.
