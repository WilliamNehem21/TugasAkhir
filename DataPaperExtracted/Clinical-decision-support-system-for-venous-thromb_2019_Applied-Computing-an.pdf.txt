1. IntroductionVenous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious and potentiallyfatal disorder, and it often complicates the course of hospitalizedmedical patients. Although it can be fatal, this disorder can be pre-vented by screening patients based on the potential risks of devel-oping this condition. Many risk factors for VTE have been wellrecognized[1], and some basic and clinically relevant risk assess-ment models are available to facilitate VTE risk assessment in hos-pitalized medical patients[2,3]. However, as reported in ourprevious research[4], many researchers have found that a largenumber of high risk VTE patients go undetected and consequentlydo not get the proper treatment[5–7].In this paper we present a clinical decision support system topredict the risk of developing VTE for hospitalized patients. Basedon the patient’s medical record, the system can classify the risklevel of developing VTE into ﬁve levels ranging from low to high.The proposed system uses Artiﬁcial Neural Networks which areperfect ﬁt for Medicine, the science of uncertainty. Neural Net-works are especially effective when the nature of the problem isfuzzy and requires complex decision making process. Indeed, VTEis multifactorial with more than 35 different identiﬁed cumulativefactors. This makes the decision making process for identifyingpatient’s risk levels of developing VTE very complex [35]. The proposed system uses Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) feedforward neural network using Resilient Backpropagation algorithm(Rprop) to train the system. The system receives as inputs all of the35 risk factors identiﬁed by Caprini model [8]. The MLP network is trained using 150 medical records collected from Jordan UniversityHospital (JUH) with the consent of the patients.To implement the system, an experimental study was per-formed to choose the best structure of the neural network usedin the proposed decision support system. The network was thentrained, tested, and validated. Stratiﬁed ten-fold cross validationscheme was applied to assess the generalization of the proposedsystem. The results of the experiment showed that the accuracyof the system was 81%.The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the background and related work.

Section 4presents the experiment study which was conducted to train different neu-ral network designs in order to choose the best performing model.In addition, it presents and discusses the results obtained whenapplying ten-fold cross validation on the selected network design.Finally, Section5provides the conclusion and future work.2. Background and related work2.1. Venous thromboembolism (VTE)Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of morbidityand mortality and it is a serious health issue which often compli-cates the course of hospitalized medical patients. It results whena thrombus forms in a vessel and obstructs the blood ﬂow. Manyrisk factors for VTE have been well recognized [1]and a review of 1231 consecutive patients treated for VTE, showed that 96% ofthe patients had at least one recognized risk factor [9,10]. There is convincing evidence that VTE risk increases in propor-tion to the number of predisposing factors [1,35]. These risk factors are generally cumulative[11]and may include old age, cancer, sur-gery, prolonged immobilization, hip and knee surgery, multi-trauma, puerperium, spinal cord injuries, paralysis, heart failure,chronic lung conditions, acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, obe-sity, use of oral contraceptives, the antiphospholipid antibody syn-drome, and inherited thrombophilic conditions [1,8,12]. A previous study performed by our research team [4]addresses risk factors for VTE assessment and the use of heparin in JordanUniversity Hospital (JUH) in the Middle East as a prevention/treat-ment measure. It concludes with the importance of implementingstrategies such as educational sessions and standardized methodsfor identifying high-risk patients to ensure appropriate treatment.2.2. Feedforward multilayer-perceptron (MLP) neural networkArtiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) is a network of processing unitsdesigned in a way that imitates the biological neural networks ofthe human brain. They represent a powerful approach to processtasks that involve approximation or classiﬁcation based on a largeset of data, and they perform very well on these tasks [13]. Multi- Layer Perceptron (MLP) is one of the most popular networks usedfor predications in different scientiﬁc research [31–33]as well as in medical applications[14,29]. In this network, the processing units(perceptron; or commonly known as neurons) are arranged intomultiple layers. The input layer contains the processing units thatreceive the input to the network. The output layer consists of theprocessing units that trigger the output of the network, e.g. theappropriate classiﬁcation of the case entered as input. Betweenthe input and output layers, there can be any number of interme-diate layers; commonly called hidden layers. In MLP, data ﬂowsfrom input layer to the hidden layers and ﬁnally to the output layerin one direction only, and this is why this type of neural networksis called feedforward. The output of each neuron iin the MLP is a function of the sum of the weighted inputs in addition to the biasvalue,h, as demonstrated in the following formula:
Yi¼fXnj¼1Wij/C1Xjþh i ! ð1Þ
where Y iis the output of the ith neuron in the network, X 1to X nare the input values, and W
ijis the weight of thej’s input at thei’s neu- ron. This functionf, through which the combined sum of the input ispassed to generate the output, is called the activation function.
Activation functions are mathematical functions which convertthe combined input into the expected output. Researchers haveused various mathematical functions, and the most common func-tions are: Linear, Logistic and Tangent. In this paper, we use theHyperbolic Tangent function; TANH.Backpropagation is the common training algorithm used inMLPs. The concept of the algorithm it to calculate the error inthe output (the difference between the output result obtained bythe network and the desired output), and pass it backwards tothe network so that the weights of the inputs are updated in orderto minimize the error. Resilient backpropagation, Rprop, is anenhanced algorithm overcoming some of the major issues withthe standard Backpropagation algorithm [15]. Finally, to estimate the performance of a prediction model, e.g.MLP, in terms of its accuracy, and in order to improve its general-ization, cross-validation is commonly applied. A common practiceis to divide the data set into three sets: training set, validation setand testing set[16]. The training dataset is used to train the net-work by adjusting the input weights for neurons in the neural net-work. The validation dataset is used to minimize overﬁtting,ensuring that any increase in accuracy over the training datasetactually yields an increase in accuracy over a dataset that the net-work has not seen previously. Finally, the testing dataset is usedwhen the model design is iterated many times. In this case, afterselecting the model having the best performance on the validationset, the training set is used to assess the generalization of theselected model on unseen data.2.3. Application of clinical decision support systems in medical domainArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) in medicine has been an activeresearch domain since the early 1970s. Different AI methods areused as the core concepts of clinical applications; this includesbut is not limited to: diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of clini-cal outcome[27–30,34,36]. Many researchers proposed clinicaldecision support system (CDSS) to improve the ability of the physi-cians and the medical staff to diagnose diseases accurately. Kawa-moto et al.[17]studied seventy CDSS and found that these systemssigniﬁcantly improved clinical practice in 68% of the systems. Alarge number of CDSS use artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) as theirmain processing concept[18].Hawamdeha et al.[19]suggested the use of a multilayer Per-ceptron (MLP) feed forward neural network to predict the rehabil-itation protocol for patients with knee osteoarthritis. The result oftheir study showed that 87% of the system’s output were accu-rately predicted.Ho et al.[20]compared between three prediction models topredict disease-free survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)patients who have received hepatic resection. The three predictionmodels considered were artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), logisticregression (LR), and decision tree (DT). They concluded that ANNmodel gave the best prediction accuracy.Zecchin et al.[21]found that ANN improved the accuracy ofshort time prediction of glucose concentration. They proposed anapproach for short time glucose prediction using past CGM sensorreadings and information on carbohydrate intake. The approachcombined a neural network (NN) model and ﬁrst-order polynomialextrapolation algorithm, used in parallel to describe, respectively,the nonlinear and the linear components of glucose dynamics.Yan et al.[14]used MLP for heart disease diagnosis. Based on 40variables, the patient was diagnosed with one of ﬁve heart dis-eases. The system’s accuracy was found to be more than 90%.Durieux et al.[22]studied the effect of a knowledge based CDSSon physicians’ behavior when treating patients with a potentialrisk of VTE. The system collects patient’s information as well asthe physician’s prescription. The system can then show a warningmessage if it ﬁnds discrepancies between the current case and pastcases in the knowledge base.Z. Qatawneh et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 12–18 13Kucher et al.[23]as well as Piazza et al.[24]reported that the use of a computerized alert system identifying consecutive hospi-talized patients at risk of VTE has reduced the rates of VTE amonghospitalized patients. The system considers only eight commonVTE risk factors. Determining the risk of VTE is encoded in the sys-tem based on the expertise of the physicians who developed thestudy. The system thus does not take into consideration the pastcases of VTE, instead it looks at each patient’s medical record inisolation, and it generates an electronic alert to the treating physi-cian in case the patient is identiﬁed with high risk of VTE.Roy et al.[25]assessed the effectiveness of the use of handheldclinical decision support system to enhance the diagnostic work-up for emergency patients suspected with pulmonary embolism(PE). The software asks the physician to enter his/her own estimateof the patient’s PE risk, then it suggests appropriate and inappro-priate diagnostic tests, and it marks the least invasive test as‘‘recommended”. The recommendations of the system are basedon the expertise of the physicians who participated in the designof the study.3. Data encoding and system architectureIn order to design an affective medical decision support systemassessing the patient’s risk level of VTE, all risk factors for VTE asidentiﬁed by domain experts[2,3,8]were considered. In our previ- ous work[4], VTE risk factors were investigated, and this work isbased on the ﬁndings of our previous work. We hence use Caprinimodel to assess risk factors of VTE.Our proposed clinical decision support system is designed withtwo main components: Data entry and encoding, and risk assess-ment engine. The data entry and encoding component allowsentering patient’s data and encoding them according to the encod-ing scheme explained in Section3.1. For initial system training, Patients’ personal and medical data were collected from JordanUniversity Hospital (JUH). Experts from the domain assessed thecases according to the Caprini model [4,8], and they classiﬁed patients into ﬁve risk levels: low, lower-mild, higher-mild, moder-ate, and high; where the probabilities of developing VTE in theserisk levels are 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% respectively. The col-lected dataset was used for training, validating, and testing theneural network used in the risk assessment engine. The risk assess-ment engine is the main processing part of the system. It receivesthe patient’s encoded data, and then it determines VTE risk levelfor the patient. The risk assessment engine uses a neural networkwhich was trained with 150 patient’s records. The optimal struc-ture of the neural network (presented in Section 3.2) was deter- mined experimentally as explained in Section 4. In the next subsections we discuss the process of data collectionfor the dataset used to train and test the system along with theencoding scheme used to represent patient’s data, and then weintroduce the MLP-based architecture of the risk assessmentengine used in the proposed decision support system.3.1. Data encoding schemePatients’ data were collected from JUH, which is a busy tertiarycare medical center. The data set used to train and test the systemwas based on a sample of 150 complete medical records. The sam-ple was selected so that it contains 30 records from each risk level.Only patients who are above the age of 40 were considered for thisstudy.The sample data set was collected from medical records forboth walk-in patients and admitted patients. An informed consentform was obtained from all study subjects. The study was approvedby the hospital IRB as part of quality monitoring focused study togenerate hospital guidelines concerning VTE prophylaxis.From each medical record, the values of thirty-ﬁve risk factorswere extracted. These risk factors were categorized into six cate-gories as follows: Age, Obesity, Surgery, Disease, Women related,Genetic & Drugs, where:/C15Age: has only one risk factor. Its value considers 3 intervals ofage for patients over 40. Each interval gets a different risk score./C15Obesity: has only one risk factor. Its values considers 3 BMIintervals with different score of risk./C15Surgery: has 7 risk factors in total with different risk scores./C15Disease: has 17 risk factors in total with different risk scores./C15For Women: has 3 risk factors in total with different risk scores./C15Genetics &Drugs: has 6 risk factors in total with different riskscores.As demonstrated inTable 1, each risk factor is encoded as a riskscore ranging from 1 to 5.

Qatawneh et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 12–183.2. System architectureThe risk assessment engine uses a feedforward MLP neural net-work using resilient backpropagation algorithm (Rprop).The structure of the network; and particularly the number ofhidden layers and the number of neurons in each hidden layer; ischosen based on an experimental iterative process to determinethe best structure with the highest accuracy as demonstrated inSection5. As demonstrated inFig. 1, the adopted network structureconsists of:/C1535-input neurons in the input layer./C15Three hidden layers having 19 neurons in the ﬁrst layer, 10 inthe second layer, and 5 in the third./C15One output neuron in the output layer.TANH activation function was used for all hidden layers as wellas the output layer. The values 0.08, 0.0000001, and 6 were usedfor the initial delta, the performance goal error, and the numberof validation checks to avoid overﬁtting of the networkrespectively.The details of the network architecture are further explained inthe following subsections.3.2.1. Input layerThe input layer is designed with 35 neurons for the 35 risk fac-tors identiﬁed in Section3.1. Each risk factor is encoded as a riskscore ranging from 1 to 5 as demonstrated in Table 1.3.2.2. Hidden layersSince the process of determining the best number of hidden lay-ers and neurons in each layer is very complex as it depends on: thenumber of input and output neurons, the number of training cases,and the complexity of the classiﬁcation problem to be learned [31]; we applied an experimental iterative approach to determine thebest number of hidden layers and neurons within each layer. Basedon the experimental study, it was found that in order to obtain thebest accuracy, the system should consist of three hidden layers,with 19, 10, and 5 neurons respectively. Consequently, we adoptedthis architecture for the system. The experimental methodologythat was followed to ﬁnd the best performing network is discussedin Section4.3.2.3. Output layerThe output layer consists of one neuron. It displays the outputvariable, with a value normalized into ﬁve possible levels of riskof VTE: low, lower-mild, higher-mild, moderate, and high.4. Experimental study and system evaluationAn experimental study was conducted to choose the best archi-tecture for the system. The network with the best classiﬁcationaccuracy was then validated with ten-fold cross validation method.4.1. Model buildingIn the experimental study, we train several network models andthen we compare them based on their classiﬁcation accuracy. Thecross validation method was used to estimate the accuracy whichis determined by the overall number of correct classiﬁcationsdivided by the total number of instances in the dataset. A percent-age of 80%, 10%, and 10% data split of the complete data sampleswas applied to represent the training, validation, and test subsetsrespectively. Consequently, we obtained a total of 120, 15, and15, sample cases for the training, validation and testing subsetsrespectively.The whole process works as follows:(1) Set initial number of hidden layers NHL to 1(2) Calculate the initial number of neurons (N
f) in the hidden layer according to Eq.(2)

Stratiﬁed ten-fold cross validationTo ensure higher robustness of the evaluation, stratiﬁed 10-foldcross validation was applied as suggested by [26]. Consequently, the data set was stratiﬁed into 10 folds, where each fold consistedof 15 sample cases having 3 low risk cases, 3 lower-mild risk cases,3 higher-mild risk cases, 3 medium risk cases, and 3 high risk cases.The validation process went through 10 different runs of themodel, where each run used 9 folds for training and one fold fortesting. Each run used a testing fold that was not picked in anyof the previous runs. This guarantees that each fold would be con-sidered as a testing fold in one of the runs.In order to ﬁnd the classiﬁcation accuracy for the model, we cal-culated the classiﬁcation accuracy of the test fold in each run. Theoverall accuracy of the model was calculated as the average accu-racy of all 10 runs. The overall accuracy was calculated as follows:/C15First, the classiﬁcation accuracy for each fold is computed. Theclassiﬁcation accuracy Af
iof an individual fold f idepends on the number of samples correctly classiﬁed and is evaluated bythe formula:
Afi¼tn/C3100% ð3Þwheretis the number of sample cases correctly classiﬁed, and n is the total number of sample cases.
/C15Then, the overall model classiﬁcation accuracy is calculated asfollows:
Average Classification Accuracy¼110X10i¼1Afið4Þ
To summarize the results of the 10 test folds, Table 3illustrates the classiﬁcation accuracy for all runs. The average accuracy classi-ﬁcation obtained for all folds is 81%. We notice that the highestclassiﬁcation accuracy was obtained in run 5 and run 10 with anaccuracy of 100% and the lowest accuracy was obtained in run 7with an accuracy of 33.34%. Looking further at the testing fold ofrun 7, we noticed that most sample cases were border casesbetween two risk classes, which led to their misclassiﬁcation intoeither the class which is directly below the actual class or the classwhich is directly above it. Looking at each class of risk, the overallclassiﬁcation accuracy is 90%, 80%, 70%, 76.7%, and 86.7% for lowrisk, lower-mild risk, higher-mild risk, moderate risk, and high riskclasses respectively.To further analyze the performance of the classiﬁcation model,we provide the confusion matrix in Table 4. The confusion matrix helps visualizing the performance of themodel within each class of VTE risk by looking at the actual versusthe predicted class of risk for each class. The rows represent thepredicted classes for the sample cases from a speciﬁc class of risk.For example, the ﬁrst row shows that out of 30 actual low riskcases, the model correctly predicted 27 cases within the low riskclass, while it incorrectly classiﬁed the remaining three low riskcases as lower-mild risk class. The columns show the actual classi-ﬁcation of the cases that were predicted within a speciﬁc class ofrisk. For example, the ﬁrst column show that the model predicteda total of 31 low risk cases, while actually only 27 out of them wereactually low risk cases, and the other 4 were incorrectly classiﬁedas low risk while they were actually lower-mild risk cases. Conse-quently, the rate 27/30 shows the measure of the procedure accu-racy of the classiﬁcation for the low risk class (which is also calledthe Recall measure), while the rate 27/31 shows the user accuracyof the classiﬁcation model for low risk class (which is also calledthe Precision measure).Table 5summarizes procedure accuracy and user accuracy foreach VTE risk class.4.3. Observations and discussionThe results presented in the previous section show that the sys-tem provide very good accuracy values for both low and high risklevels of VTE, while it provides modest accuracy values for theclasses in between. Since in a medical setting, what is importantis to safely discharge patients with low risk of VTE while directlytreating patients with high risk of VTE, we can clearly see thatthe system achieves this objective.For high risk VTE, the user accuracy shows that all cases (100%)that are predicated as high risk of VTE are actually high risk of VTE.The procedure accuracy, on the hand, shows that the probabilitythat the system will accurately classify a high risk case into itsproper class is 90%. Based on the confusion matrix, we know thepercentage of misclassiﬁed high risk cases (10%) are classiﬁed bythe system as moderate risk; which is the adjacent class directlybelow the high risk class.In general, according to the confusion matrix, we can clearly seethat when a case is misclassiﬁed, it is incorrectly classiﬁed by onlyone adjacent risk level (directly below or directly above) the actualclass. This is an indication that the range of classiﬁcation errors is±1 adjacent class.

Qatawneh et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 12–18Consequently, we recommend the use of this system for screen-ing low/high risk levels of VTE. Additionally, we recommend thatthe physician manually checks cases identiﬁed as moderate riskssince there is a 10% probability that it can actually be a high riskcase.5. Conclusion and future workVenous thromboembolism (VTE) is a very common health issuewith complications that carry a high morbidity and mortality rates.Although VTE is a common disease, it is a preventable cause of hos-pital death if it is quickly identiﬁed by the treating physician.In this paper we propose a clinical decision system to automateand accurately predict the risk of VTE. This work represents a pre-liminary step in developing a methodology to predict VTE and clas-sify it into ﬁve levels of risk based on predisposing factors whichare chosen from Caprini score of VTE model as used in JordanUniversity Hospital.The proposed system uses Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN) inevaluating multifactorial health issue. Developing the systempassed through several steps starting from determining the factors,collecting and stratifying the data set, normalizing the data input,training and choosing the most accurate system model, and ﬁnallyvalidating the system.The system was developed using one of the most widespreadmachine learning techniques; MLP feed forward neural network.It was trained using the Rprop training algorithm, and it consistedof: an input layer with 35 neurons (representing the input vari-ables for each patient such as, age, gender, etc.), 3 hidden layers(where the number of neurons in the ﬁrst, second and third hiddenlayer were 19, 10 and 5 respectively) and an output layer (that pro-duced the type of the disease the patient suffered from).Stratiﬁed ten-fold cross validation was applied, and it showedthat the system had an overall user accuracy of 81.2% and an over-all procedure accuracy of 80.7%. It is worth noting that the systemaccuracy is very high for both extreme classes of risk: low risk andhigh risk. For the high risk class, the user accuracy obtained fromthe experiment is 100% and the procedure accuracy is 90%. Forthe low risk class, the user accuracy is 87.5% while the procedureaccuracy is 90%. When misclassiﬁcation occur, the system usuallymisclassiﬁes a case in either the class directly below the actualclassiﬁcation class or the one directly above it.Finally, in a future research we will consider comparing the per-formance of our system using different classiﬁers such as NaïveBayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree(DT). Additionally, we will consider classifying VTE into its twomajor types: Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) and PulmonaryEmbolism (PE).References
