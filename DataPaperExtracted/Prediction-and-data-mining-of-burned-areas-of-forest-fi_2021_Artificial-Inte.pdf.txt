Keywords:Wildﬁre feature selectionNon-regression machine learningData-matched prediction accuracyCumulative absolute error differentialsPredicting highly skewed distributionsAn optimized data-matching machine learning algorithm is developed to provide high-prediction accuracy oftotal burned areas for speciﬁc wildﬁre incidents. It is applied to a well-studied forest- ﬁre dataset from Portugal Montesinho Natural Park considering 13 input variables. The total burned area distribution of the 517 burnevents in that dataset is highly positively skewed. The model is transparent and avoids regressions and hiddenlayers. This increases its detailed data mining capabilities. It matches the highest burned-area prediction accuracyachieved for this dataset with a wide range of traditional machine learning algorithms. The two-stage predictionprocess provides informative feature selection that establishes the relative in ﬂuences of the input variables on burned-area predictions. Optimizing with mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) asseparate objective functions provides complementary information with which to data mine each total burned-area incident. Such insight offers potential agricultural, ecological, environmental and forestry bene ﬁts by im- proving the understanding of the key in ﬂuences associated with each burn event. Data mining the differential trends of cumulative absolute error and squared error also provides detailed insight with which to determinethe suitability of each optimized solution to accurately predict burned-areas events of speci ﬁc types. Such predic- tion accuracy and insight leads to con ﬁdence in how each prediction is derived. It provides knowledge to make appropriate responses and mitigate speci ﬁc burn incidents, as they occur. Such informed responses should lead to short-term and long-term multi-faceted bene ﬁts by helping to prevent certain types of burn incidents being repeated or spread.© 2021 The Author.

1. IntroductionRecent years have been unprecedented in the extent of burned areasof wildﬁres, particularly in forested regions across the world that in-creasingly impact substantial population areas. This highlights the ur-gent need to improve our ability to predict and better understand thefactors inﬂuencing total burned areas likely to occur in certain condi-tions (Finney et al., 2013), and real-time, wildﬁre-spread modelling (De Gennaro et al., 2017). This requires efﬁcient and penetrating data mining of datasets of historical wild-ﬁre incidents. It is essential to iden-tify the key factors inﬂuencing the impacts of forestﬁres in speciﬁcl o c a - tions and climatic zones as global climate conditions seem likely toevolve rapidly (Liu and Wimberly, 2016;Young et al., 2017)a n da s human land use expands (Montgomery, 2014). Alternative methods continue to emerge to suppress (Houtman et al., 2013), to prevent and to simulate (Rios et al., 2019) wildﬁres. Although human-caused and lightning-caused ignitions are common features in forest ﬁreinitiation (Veraverbeke et al., 2017) a range of meteorological and envi-ronmental factors inﬂuence their ability to spread and the speed atwhich they spread. These factors include local climatic conditions, to-pography and vegetation type. Also, the condition and density of vege-tation are fundamental factors that inﬂuence the behavior of wildﬁres and their ultimate wide ranging impacts on surrounding agriculture,ecology, environments and forestry.The majority of wildﬁres that spread rapidly occur in windy condi-tions. Forest wind proﬁles can be complex, especially in the sub-canopy due to vegetation structure ( Moon et al., 2019). Topography, and in particular canyons and junctions between canyons, tend to bewildﬁre hotspots in hilly or mountainous terrains, where localizedhigh winds fanﬂames (Raposo et al., 2018;Rodrigues et al., 2019). Inter- mittent and varying heatﬂux from wind-drivenﬂames (Tang et al., 2019) and coherent structures withinﬂames impacted by wind condi- tions (Miller et al., 2017)i nﬂuence the directions in which wildﬁ
res propagate and at what rates. Smouldering and ﬂaming wildﬁres behave quite differently (Santoso et al., 2019), and the spontaneous transitionbetween the two states is also inﬂuenced by complex relationships be-tween the prevailing weather and environmental conditions ( Yang et al., 2018).Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 24 –42

journal homepage:http://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/artificial-intelligence-in-agriculture/The rate of wildﬁre spread depends on a wide range of variablescombining with wind speeds and directions, displaying complex non-linear interactions. The condition of the fuel bed ( McAllister, 2019) and its geometry (McAllister and Finney, 2016)i nﬂuence the spreading rate of wildﬁres. Likewise the wind-driven transportation of ﬁrebrands (Caton-Kerr et al., 2019;Tohidi and Kaye, 2017;Manzello and Suzuki, 2017) and the nature of theﬁrebrands (Hedayati et al., 2019) impact how wildﬁres develop and spread in speciﬁc regions. The aerated condi- tion of the litter layer beneath the trees and shrubs, particularly its per-meability in broadleaf forests (Wang et al., 2019;Fehrmann et al., 2017), is inﬂuential because it affects the extent of wind driven convectionthrough the fuel bed (De Gennaro et al., 2017). This study is organized into the following sections:•Literature review (Section 2) •Materials and methods (Section 3) •Results and discussion (Section 4)2. Literature reviewForestﬁre prediction systems, especially the Forest Fire WeatherIndex (FWI) System developed for applications in Canada using mainlymeteorological data (Stocks et al., 1989;Taylor and Alexander, 2006), and the Forest Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) System developed for ap-plications in China incorporating satellite sensors ( Zhang et al., 2011) are widely used. They are suitable and exploited for worldwide applica-tions (Di Giuseppe et al., 2018) as they combine a wide range of relevantinput variables. Such systems and their component variables make itpossible to compile datasets with historic information recording awide range of prevailing conditions and geospatial data ( Forsell et al., 2009;Alkhatib, 2014) linked to the total burned area resulting fromeach incident. Such datasets are conducive to machine-learning applica-tions attempting to predict total burned area based on speci ﬁc condi- tions, and for data mining to extract useful comparative informationrelating speciﬁc events. Common challenges using such datasets areconsolidating data from diverse sources ( De Souza et al., 2015)a n d the positively skewed nature of burned area distributions ( Cortez and Morais, 2007). This requires careful feature selection to generate man-ageable models. In some locations speciﬁ
c variables are known to be highly inﬂuential, e.g. vapor pressure deﬁcit and fraction of spruce cover in the case of Alaska's boreal forests ( Cofﬁeld et al., 2019). There have been many attempts over recent decades to apply ma-chine learning and simulation methods to assist in the prediction of for-estﬁres (Finney, 1998;Yongzhong et al., 2004) and to evaluate the feasibility of wildﬁre prediction (Malarz et al., 2002). Additionally, var- ious models have evolved to assess multiple aspects of environmentaland ecological change inﬂuencing wildﬁre development (Recknagel, 2001). The machine-learning techniques evaluated include multi-variate regression, artiﬁcial neural networks (applying both multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis functions), support vector machines,decision trees, in some cases supported by genetic programming, ran-dom forest, and Markov chain decision process ( Garzón et al., 2006; Cortez and Morais, 2007;Li et al., 2011;Sitanggang and Ismail, 2011; Castelli et al., 2015;Mcgregor et al., 2016). Airborne and satellite imag- ery to provide detailed geospatial, and other information (e.g. surfacerelative humidity,Peng et al., 2006)), are the focus of some wildﬁre ma- chine learning studies (Sehgal et al., 2006;Saranya and Hemalatha, 2012;Subramanian and Crowley, 2017, 2018 ) with some applying fuzzy logic techniques to generate total burned-area predictions(Angayarkkani and Radhakrishnan, 2009 ).In recent years, a range of optimizers and machine learning modelshave been employed to assist in wildﬁre prediction. These include ge- netic algorithms coupled with windﬁeld and environmental models (Artes et al., 2016;De Gennaro et al., 2017). Some models distinguishing wind velocity and direction are exploited using domain decompositionof linear relationships within datasets ( Sanjuan et al., 2016)a n d probabilistic analysis (Quill et al., 2019).Zhang et al. (2019)developed a spatial prediction model for forestﬁre susceptibility employing a convolutional neural network veriﬁed with data from historicﬁre loca- tions in Yunnan Province, China. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference sys-tem (ANFIS) was applied to classify forestﬁre hotspot data in central Kalimantan, Indonesia (Wijayanto et al., 2017).Jaafari et al. (2019)eval- uated hybrid models combining neuro-fuzzy logic and metaheuristicoptimization to predict the probability of wild ﬁres spatially in the Hyr- canian region of Iran.However, there is much room for progress and improvement in theprediction accuracy of total burned areas associated with speci ﬁc wild- ﬁres. To date, limited research has been conducted to explore the poten-tial of new machine-learning techniques that avoid regressions, hiddenlayers and focus on transparency, as well as accuracy of individualpredictions.A common characteristic of the machine learning techniquestraditionally applied to predict total burned areas of forest ﬁres from data-driven models is that they involve regression, correlation and/orstatistical distribution analysis in their calculation processes, oftenwith hidden layers and difﬁcult to penetrate calculations contributingto the prediction of each forestﬁre event. Such models tend to be insuf-ﬁciently transparent in their calculations to be conducive to rapid anddetailed data mining of the datasets they are modelling. In this study,a recently developed optimized data matching model, the transparentopen box (TOB) network (Wood, 2018)i sc o nﬁgured and developed speciﬁcally to predict and data mine a well-studied forest ﬁre dataset (Cortez and Morais, 2007). This technique, for theﬁrst time applied here to assess a forestﬁre dataset, avoids using correlations, regressionsor statistical relationships between its variables. By doing so, it readilyreveals the details of each prediction it makes and the closely matchedhistoricalﬁres to each event. This makes the model much more condu-cive to detailed data mining applications, which are essential to betterunderstand historical forestﬁre datasets.3. Materials and methods3.1. Optimized-data-matching algorithm con ﬁgured for forestﬁre data miningThe TOB machine-learning method is now well described and hasbeen implemented with a range of dataset from different sectors(Wood, 2019a).Fig. 1provides a summary of the TOB workﬂow conﬁg- ured to predict total burned area associated with forest ﬁres based on forestry, weather and environmental variables. A novel aspect of the al-gorithm is that it is computed in two stages (1 and 2) and provides twoestimates, the second optimized. Comparing the two-stage estimateswith training and testing data subsets helps to identify and reject opti-mized solutions that overﬁt the underlying data variables.TOB establishes the best (Q≤10) data-record matches in a largetraining data subset for each speciﬁc data record in relatively smalltuning subsets of data records (between about 100 and 150 data recordsbased on sensitivity analysis). It does so by comparing the sums of thevariable squared differences (
VSD) for all the input variables betweenspeciﬁc data records in the tuning subset with all the data records inthe larger pool of training subset data records. Eq. (1)describes how weights are applied in the calculation to of the weighted sum of eachVSD.∑VSD

OptimumQand Wn values are located by the op-timizers to minimize the objective function. That objective function isusually root-mean-squared error (RMSE) or mean absolute error(MAE) of the dependent variable prediction; in this study totalburned area.3.2. Optimizers suitable for TOB applicationsVarious functional optimization algorithms could be used to performthe TOB Stage 2 optimization routine.Wood (2019b)has demonstrated that standard Microsoft Excel Solver optimizers (Frontline Solvers, 2020) are adequate, but to extract metaheuristic pro ﬁling information (Wood, 2016) and to fully code the optimization process a customized

26ﬁreﬂy optimizer and to fully code the optimizer customized ﬁreﬂyo p t i - mizer works well.Small tuning subsets of data records selected to sample the full rangeof total burned area values provide statistically repeatable total burnedarea predictions. That repeatability is con ﬁrmed using independent testing-subsets of data records involving about one hundred data re-cords not involved in the algorithm-tuning routines. To monitor repeat-ability and expose overﬁttingﬁve different cases are run each associatedwith different selections of tuning and testing subset data records. Foreach case three different optimizer algorithms were applied and eachwas run three times. This generated forty- ﬁve TOB-Stage-2 optimized tuned solutions to test. As well as applying those solutions to the inde-pendent testing subsets it is also informative to evaluate each optimizedsolution using the entire dataset (all data records). If the TOB stage 2 so-lutions generate lower prediction errors when applied to all data re-cords than the TOB Stage 1 solutions that veri ﬁes that the optimized solutions, found using small tuning subsets are not over ﬁtting the dataset as a whole.3.3. Measures of burned area prediction accuracy for forest ﬁre analysisThe assessment of burned area prediction bene ﬁts from comparing a number of well-established metrics that compute prediction accuracyfrom different statistical perspectives.

Characterization of a well-studied forest ﬁre dataset from portugalTable 1provides details and summary statistics for the 517 forest ﬁre incidents recorded in the Montesinho Natural Park (Portugal) betweenJanuary 2000 to December 2003 that resulted in 39 human deaths anddamaged to about 5% of the forest ( Cortez and Morais, 2007). The total burned areas of the incidents in this dataset constitute a highlypositive skewed, asymmetrical distribution requiring that metric to bebetter displayed and evaluated in terms of its natural logarithm(Fig. 2). About 48% of the recorded incidents resulted in small totalburned areas of less than 100 m
2.The data variables recorded in this dataset include spatial, temporaland meteorological factors. The four widely used wild ﬁre indices FFMC, DMC, DC and ISI (deﬁned inTable 1) are included as input variables inthis dataset. These indices are components of the Fire Weather Index(Stocks et al., 1989;Taylor and Alexander, 2006). FFMC combines mea- surements of rainfall, relative humidity, temperature and wind speed toprovide an indicator of the degree of moisture in forest ﬂoor litter, its likelihood to ignite, and the rate of likely spread of a ﬁre once ignited. DMC combines measurements of rainfall, relative humidity and temper-ature, while DC combines just rainfall and temperature. DMC and DC aretypically used as indicators of prevailing moisture content in the forestﬂoor organic layers. DMC and DC record conditions over much longerperiods, 12 past days and 52 past days, respectively, compared to thepast 16 h involved in FFMC. ISI involves a correlation between FFMCand wind velocity and is used as an indicator of how quickly a ﬁre is likely to spread.This dataset is important for the current study because previousstudies have published prediction accuracy of the total burned area(BA) applying several regression and/or statistically focused machinelearning methods (Cortez and Morais, 2007;Castelli et al., 2015). The method evaluated include:•Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming Decision Tree (GS-GP)•Standard Genetic Programming Decision Tree (ST-GP)•Support Vector Machine polynomial kernel (second degree) (SVM)•Random forests (RF)•Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP-NN)•Radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN)•Linear regression (LR)D.A. Wood Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 24 –42
27•Multiple regression (MR)•Isotonic regression (IR)The correlation matrices between these variables ( Table 2)a n d some of their ratios (Table 3) reveal that they a very poorly correlatedwith BA. Correlation coefﬁcients with BA are the highest for variablesMonth (0.1143), DMC (0.0672) and Wind (0.0670). These low correla-tions explain, to an extent, why correlation-based machine learning al-gorithm struggle to produce highly accurate predictions for this dataset.The ratios between input variables also show very low correlationswith BA. The correlation coefﬁcients with BA for ratios DC/Temp(0.0760), Wind/RH (0.0737), RH/Month (−0.0725) and Temp/Month (−0.0717) are slightly higher than those of their component variables(compareTables 1 and 2) suggesting that they should be evaluated aspart of feature selection.Variable relationships between burn area and the input variables arehighly non-linear displaying substantial scatter. A key characteristic ofthe data set is that it is substantially positively skewed ( Fig. 3). For this reason, previous prediction analyses of this dataset have electedto express the burn areas as their natural logarithms for the machinelearning calculations. The natural logarithm of the total burned area isalso used as the dependent variable in the TOB analysis presentedhere, although the prediction accuracy statistics achieved by thosemodels are expressed in actual burned area (hectare) value terms.Table 1Range, mean and units for the Montesinho Natural Park (Portugal) forest ﬁre dataset for 2000 to 2003 (Cortez and Morais, 2007;U C IMachine Learning Repository, 2008 ) recording 517 separateﬁre incidents.Variable code Description Unit Min P25 P50 Mean P75 MaxX East-West Coordinate (1 to 9) Integer series 1 3 4 4.67 7 9Y North-South Coordinate (1 to 9) Integer series 2 4 4 4.30 5 9Month (1 to 12) Integer series 1 7 8 7.48 9 12Day (1 to 7) Integer series 1 2 5 4.26 6 7FFMC Fine Fuel Moisture Code Index 18.7 90.2 91.6 90.64 92.9 96.2DMC Duff Moisture Code Index 1.1 68.6 108.3 110.87 142.4 291.3DC Drought Code Index 7.9 437.7 664.2 547.94 713.9 860.6ISI Initial Spread Index Index 0.0 6.5 8.4 9.02 10.8 56.1Temp Temperature

284. Results and discussion4.1. TOB Machine Learning analysis to predict burn area of Forest ﬁre datasetThe dataset evaluated by the TOB algorithm includes all twelve inde-pendent variables for which measurements are recorded ( Table 1)p l u s the Wind/RH ratio, making thirteen input variables in total. The ratioWind/RH was selected because it showed the highest correlation coef ﬁ- cient with BA (albeit a very low one) making it second to the “Month” variable in its degree of correlation with BA.4.2. Data matching feature selection and ranking of Most in ﬂuential variablesIn complex datasets, with non-linear relationships between multipleinput variables careful feature selection is essential. The highly skeweddistribution of the dependent variable means that just a few data re-cords with extreme values are located in the distribution tail. The TOBmethod offers three distinct prediction-performance insights to featureselection based on the input variables it includes in its data matchingprocedure.1. TOB Stage 1 BA predictions can involve data matching using all avail-able input variables, or in this case between 1 and 13 variables. Thesquared differences for the input variables selected are evaluatedwith equal variable error and Qﬁxed at 10.2. TOB Stage 1 BA prediction constrained to use the squared differencesfor all 13 variables and Qﬁxed at 10. This provides a useful bench-mark comparison for prediction insight 13. TOB Stage 2 BA optimized predictions allows the number of best datamatches and variable weights to vary (2≤Q≤10 and 0≤W
N≤1) and considers all 13 variables. However, this prediction is constrainedto use only the best record matches selected by prediction insight 1.Sensitivity analysis comparing the predictions for these helps thefeature selection to establish the best combination of variables to usefor data matching in TOB Stage 1. Using all data records, variables are se-quentially eliminated from inﬂuencing the data matching process to es-tablish an order of inﬂuence for prediction insight 1.Table 4compares the sequence of elimination of the input variables by this sensitivityanalysis with the ranking of input variables in terms of their correlationcoefﬁcient with BA.Tables 4 and 5reveal that the 1-Var sensitivity-case model (with DConly used for TOB Stage 1 data matching) generates the lowest RMSEvalue for BA prediction by TOB Stage 1. It also achieves the lowestRMSE and MAE values for BA by TOB Stage 2. Fig. 3illustrates the results of the feature selection analysis for TOB data matching for all thirteensensitivity-case models evaluated in terms of MAE and RMSE. Allmodel structures evaluated achieve credible performance accuracy interms of RMSE for TOB Stage 2 analysis. Models 1-Var, 2-Var and 3-Var provide superior TOB Stage 2 prediction performance accuracy forBA in terms of MAE for models with RMSE as the objective function(Fig. 3A). Models 1-Var and 3-Var also provide superior TOB Stage 2 pre-diction performance accuracy for BA in terms of RMSE ( Fig. 3B). For these reasons a 1-Var (DC) model is evaluated in more detail for thisstudy.4.3. RMSE versus MAE as objective functions for predicting highly skewedvariable distributionsRMSE is typically more sensitive to predictions of individual data re-cords that generate high errors than MAE. This is because those rela-tively few points with high prediction error values are squared as partof the RMSE calculation. Most of those high error points are associatedwith few high total burned area events located in the right-side tail ofTable 3Correlation matrix for selected ratios between the twel

29the total burn area distribution in the positively skewed distributionconsidered here. This fundamental characteristic tends to make RMSEa more effective optimization objective function for such highly skeweddatasets than MAE. However, MAE is also a useful objective function toconsider as it provides a distinctive insight.Fig. 4illustrates the signiﬁcance of prediction error contributions, interms of absolute error values, across the highly skewed BA distributionstudied. It also highlights the BA prediction improvements achieved bythe TOB Stage 2 optimizer. Some70% of the data records are associatedwith BA prediction errors of≤5Ha. The TOB stage 2 solution improveson the TOB Stage 1 solution by substantially reducing the absolute er-rors for a substantial number of data records with prediction errors ofless than 5 Ha. It is reassuring that the model is able to predict BA for70% or so of the data records to an accuracy of 5 Ha. This generates con-ﬁdence in applying the model for the majority of ﬁres that result inrelatively small burn areas. Burn events with prediction errors >12.72Ha constitute only about ~14% of the data records for this bestperforming prediction model (Table 4).4.4. Burned area prediction accuracy comparisons with Machine LearningalgorithmsThe prediction accuracy of the TOB model compares favourably withthat published for this same dataset using a range of regression and sta-tistical based machine learning algorithms applied to all twelve vari-ables with and without feature selection ( Cortez and Morais, 2007; Castelli et al., 2015).Cortez and Morais (2007)applied a trial and error feature selection procedure involving the evaluations of four dis-tinct combinations of some of the input variables were considered.Their feature selection analysis identiﬁed a high-performing SVM

31solution involving just four direct weather inputs (i.e. temperature, rain,relative humidity and wind speed) that performed well when consider-ing just wildﬁres with small-burned areas.The optimum TOB model achieves a more accurate best RMSE (62.21Ha; 1-Var (DC) model), when applied to the full dataset, compared tothe best RMSE value for published results for other machine learning al-gorithms (i.e., RMSE = 63.7 Ha for the SVM model of Cortez and Morais, 2007). That optimum TOB model achieves a similar best MAE of 12.717Ha applied to the full dataset. This almost matches the best MAE valuefor published results for other machine learning algorithms(i.e., MAE = 12.71 Ha for their SVM model of Cortez and Morais,2007). Other machine-learning models evaluated in that study onlyachieved MAE values ranging from 13.08 Ha to 18.61 Ha.These prediction accuracy comparisons con ﬁrm that the TOB model can generate prediction accuracy for the total burned area for thedataset studied comparable to the best prediction accuracy generatedby a range of regression and/or statistical based machine learning algo-rithms. Moreover, the TOB model has the additional bene ﬁt of transpar- ency and forensic access to the components involved in each of itspredictions. This additional attribute, which is considered a vital ecolog-ical beneﬁt for forest-ﬁre datasets, because it facilitates data mining andyields greater insight to the similarities of speci ﬁc events with other burn events recorded in the dataset. It also reveals over- ﬁtting as andTable 5Results of sequential removal of low contributing variables to form TOB stage 1 data matching models with less variables: TOB Stage 1 and Stage 2 predic tion performance compared in terms of MAE and RMSE.

32when it occurs. These additional attributes and their value are exploredinSection 4.5. The regression and/or statistical based machine learningalgorithms, for the most part, generate individual predictions in a“black-box”manner, which limits their usefulness in some of thesekey data mining tasks.4.5. Employing small tuning and testing subsets to ﬁnd high performing pre- diction solutionsA key question to evaluate for highly skewed distributions is, can thetuning of multiple small subsets of data records reveal solutions that canbe meaningfully applied to predict the dataset as a whole, avoiding bothoverﬁtting and underﬁtting? The TOB 1-Var (DC) model has been con-ﬁgured to tune and testﬁfty cases involving tuning subsets of 100 datarecords (about 19% of the full dataset) and tested with ﬁfty independent testing subsets (100 data records extracted distinctly from the datasetwithout replacement). This sampling of the dataset means that only60% of the data records remain as the training data against which thetuned subsets are matched and optimized. Each relatively small tuningand testing subset selected in each case evaluated is spread across theentire BA value range. This is achieved so that it is impossible for thesame records to be present in more than one of the testing, training ortuning subsets in each case. Each tuned subset is optimized twice,once with RMSE as the objective function and once with MAE as the ob-jective function.Tables 6 and 7display the key prediction performance statistics forthe optimized solutions (both MAE and RMSE) found for the 50 casesand evaluated against the 100-data-record testing subsets and the full517-data-record dataset, respectively. It apparent that there is less dis-persion of prediction accuracy for those models optimized with RMSEas the objective function (left-sideTables 6 and 7), compared with those optimized with MAE as the objective function. However, theMAE optimized casesﬁnd slightly lower MAE and RMSE best cases.Overall, MAE and RMSEﬁnd similar minimum (best) solutions forboth MAE and RMSE suggesting that both are viable objective functionsfor TOB to optimize.Table 8lists the variable weights applied to the best TOB Stage 2 so-lutions found by sensitivity analysis ( Table 5) and the tuning subset analysis (Table 7). The TOB Stage 1 data matching is restricted to justone variable (DC) for establishing the ten closest matching data records.Nevertheless, the TOB Stage 2 solutions have then gone on to exploitmost of the thirteen input variables in the best-matching data recordsavailable to improve their prediction performance.The best MAE values achieved by the TOB model (12.72 to 13.56 Ha,Table 8) straddle the the mean value achieved by 50 testing subsets(MAE =12.9 Ha) of the best performing GS-GP decision tree model re-ported byCastelli et al. (2015). The other machine learning modelsevaluated in that study achieved mean MAE values ranging from 13.6to 33.8 Ha.4.6. Data mining of the high-performing burned area prediction solutions4.6.1. Data mining to assess data records established as best predictionmatchesIn data mining terms, the TOB model can go far beyond total burnarea predictions with this and other forest ﬁre datasets. It can provide information concerning the broader similarities between conditionsand outcomes associated with speciﬁcﬁre incidents alongside each pre- diction. For the TOB algorithm to data mine the forest ﬁre dataset, se- quential sample numbers (identiﬁers) 1 to 517 have been assigned toeach data record in the order in which they are listed in the UCI databaseﬁle (UCI Machine Learning Repository, 2008 ).
Some details of the TOB prediction analysis for two representa-tive data records (#144 inTable 9; #369 inTable 10) illustrate the some of the detailed information that TOB makes available for eachstage of its prediction analysis. The upper half of Tables 9 and 10 shows the TOB Stage 1 prediction with the BA(Ln) prediction calcu-lations with the values expressed in normalized terms ( −1,+1) before being converted to actual BA(Ln) values (0 to 7 scale). Thelower half ofTables 9 and 10shows the TOB Stage 2 BA (Ln) predic-tion calculations. The last three lines of the table convert the depen-dent variable values (actual and predicted) into non-logarithmicterms. The TOB Stage 2 solution used for both #144 and #369 is the“Best Solution Found”column ofTable 8(i.e. optimizing all 517 dataset records for 1-Var (DC)).The sum of the squared error term (SumE) in the fourth columnfrom the right inTables 9 and 10combines the differences for eachinput variable between the records being matched. The individual vari-able differences can be easily accessed in the TOB model but are notshown in these tables. It is the last three columns on the right side ofthese tables that contain the key calculations that establish what frac-tional contribution each matching data record makes to the data recordbeing predicted. Letter formula are shown above these three columns inTables 9 and 10to explain these calculations.There is nothing unusual about the two data records considered(#144 and #369) and the TOB algorithm provides predictions with rel-atively low errors for both of them. There is an improvement on the ini-tial TOB Stage 1 predictions in both cases by the adjusted weights(deﬁned by the TOB Stage 2 solution applied with Q = 6) for the vari-able errors used in the TOB Stage 2 predictions. The TOB Stage 1 predic-tions list the top-ten matching data records and display them indescending rank order. The column second from the right shows thefractional contribution of each matching data record to the BA (Ln) pre-diction and those contributions are arranged in descending order for the

33TOB Stage 1 calculation. For data record #144 the top three matching re-cords contribute ~77% to the BA (Ln) TOB Stage 1 prediction. Thischanges to ~63% for the three matching solutions with the lowestsquared errors contributing to the BA (Ln) TOB Stage 2 prediction.

Identifying the Most inﬂuential data Records for Speciﬁc Prediction SolutionsIt is insightful to conduct comparative analysis of the cumulativeMAE and RMSE solutions for speciﬁc high-performing prediction solu-tions, such as those displayed inTable 8. For the data record sequence 1 to 517 (arranged in ascending order of BA values) each MAE (orRMSE) absolute error is progressively added to the previous cumulativevalue through the BA ranked (lowest to highest) sequence. The “Best Solution Found”(Table 8) is used as the benchmark and the cumulativevalues for that solution are subtracted from the cumulative values ofeach of the other high-performing solutions identi ﬁed. The cumulative solution differentials are shown inFig. 7in terms of MAE for three of the solutions displayed inTable 8.Table 7Prediction accuracy achievements for the best-case solutions established using 100-data-record tuning subsets, matched with the optimum TOB mode l structure (TOB Stage 1 data matching restricted to variable DC) and tested against all 517 data records.Prediction accuracies achieved for all data recordsStatistics for solutions from 50 (100-record) tuned subsets TOB stage 2 solution: optimized for RMSETOB stage 1 solution: TOB Stage 2 Solution: Optimized for MAEMAE (Ha) RMSE (Ha) MAE (Ha) RMSE (Ha) MAE (Ha) RMSE (Ha)14.265 63.67 Minimum 13.086 63.26←Best Cases→ 13.026 61.88 25 Percentile 13.288 64.35 All solutions applied to all data records in the ful dataset 13.491 62.9050 Percentile 13.407 64.49 13.578 64.61Mean 13.447 64.33 13.697 64.0875 Percentile 13.561 64.57 13.770 64.74Maximum 14.153 65.25 15.848 70.88Standard deviation 0.239 0.502 0.444 1.435Notes: (1) Assessed using all 517 data records in the studied dataset.

34Solution EvolM4_15 shows relatively poor MAE prediction perfor-mance (Fig. 7;Table 8) and its differential MAE increases progressivelyacross the record sequence relative to the benchmark “best”solution. Solutions Evol_6 (optimized for RMSE) and GRGM4_10 (optimized forMAE) show better MAE prediction performance overall but their perfor-mances are subtly different. Solution Evol2_6 substantially outperformsGRGM4_10 over the lower half of theﬁre incident sequence (mostly small-burned-areaﬁres). It is only the poorer performance in predictingthe last few data records (highest BA values) in the sequence that leadssolution Evol2_6 ending up with a lower MAE (13.098) than solutionGRGM4_10 (13.026). Both of these solutions show jumps at the samepoints in their cumulative solution differentials relative to the bench-mark solutions. Speciﬁcally, they predict data records in sequence posi-tions 21, 94, 197, 497, 502, 513 and 517 with substantially higher errorsthan the benchmark solution. It is, particularly, the predictions of datarecords 497, 502, 513 and 517 that have the greatest in ﬂuence on the MAE and RMSE of all these solutions. The predictions that the bench-mark solution makes for those data records are themselves not thatgood but they are better than for most of the other high-performing so-lutions (Tables 9 and 10).The cumulative solution differentials are shown in Fig. 8for squared errors (inﬂuencing RMSE) for three of the solutions displayed in Table 8. Solution EvolM4_15 shows poor squared-error prediction perfor-mance over most of the latter 80% of the data record sequence ( Fig. 8). However, by managing to predict the data record in the highest se-quence position (517, data record 239 with the highest BA value) sub-stantially more accurately than the other solutions, it ends up with thelowest RMSE overall, even better than that of the benchmark. SolutionEvolM4_15's success hinges entirely on its prediction performance ofthe largest burned area data record in the sequence. In the oppositesense, the fate of solution Evol2_6 for its squared-error cumulative dif-ferentials (RMSE) is also determined adversely by data record #517.Over most of the sequence, up to record #502, solution Evol 2_6 outper-forms the benchmark and solution GRGM4_15 (displaying a negativecumulative differential). However, the relatively poorer prediction per-formance of solution Evol2_6 for data records 497 to 517 (particularly#517) compared to the benchmark solution and GRGM4_15 results init ending up with a signiﬁcantly higher RMSE than the other solutionsdisplayed inFig. 8. These trends suggest that for the earlier part of thesequence (small total burned areas) solution Evol2_6 would likely pro-vide the best BA predictions (better than the benchmark solution). Onthe other hand, for the sequence above data record #486 (largestburned area events) the benchmark solution or solution GRGM4_15would provide better BA predictions.It is worthwhile distinguishing some of the characteristics of theproblematic (difﬁcult toﬁt for the TOB 1-Var DC solutions) data records.Table 9does this and distinguishes their sequence order numbers in theranked BA distribution from their actual data record numbers (as de-ﬁned by the order of data records in the dataset repository).Table 10explains why some of the problematic data records, thoseresponsible for substantial jumps in the trends of Figs. 7 and 8,a r ep r e - dicted quite differently by the benchmark solution and solution Evol2_6(Table 8).For data record #21 and #94 (Tables 10 and 11) it is the lower Q value of the benchmark solution (Q = 6) that leads to it not includinghigh BA value data records #233 and #236 ( Table 11)i ni t sp r e d i c t i o n s . This results in a substantially lower absolute prediction error for the
benchmark solution for these data records. The problem for the DC-based record matching is data records #21 and #94 have high DC valuesbut zero BA values. This causes data records #233 (and #238) and #236,with very high BA values, to be ranked in the top ten data matchesagainst data records #21 and #94, respectively. The lower Q value ofthe benchmark solution works against it in the prediction of data record#104 (Table 10, measured BA value =0) causing it to assign a higherweight that solution Evol2_6 to matching record #235 (high BAvalue). The BA predictions for data records #228 and #230 (highmeasured BA values) shown inTables 10 and 11are also impacted by favourably by the Q value of the benchmark solution. The DC datamatching leads to data records #6 and #93 (BA = 0) to be selected astop-ten matching data records (ranks 7 and 8). These are both excludedby the benchmark solution in its forecast due to the Q = 6 constraintleading to much lower absolute BA prediction errors.Data record #235 is accurately by all the solutions considered inTables 10 and 11but solution GRGM4_10 generates the most accuratesolution. The involvement of data record #239 in the top-ten data re-cords contributes signiﬁcantly to the BA predictions of data record#235 by these solutions. On the other hand, the predictions of data re-cord 239 (with the highest measured BA value) are not good for anyof the solutions considered inTables 10 and 11, despite them including data records #235 and #237 in their top-ten matches. Although themeasured BA values of #235 and #237 ( Table 9) are high, they are ﬁve-times lower than the BA value of #239 when compared on a non-logarithmic scale. Although the benchmark solution does not predict#239 accurately it does so better than the other solutions considered.5. DiscussionThe results presented demonstrate that optimized data matchinghas signiﬁcant beneﬁts for predicting total burned areas of forest ﬁres and for data mining the associated datasets. Indeed, the transparencyachieved signiﬁcantly exceeds what is achievable with regression-based machine-learning methods, and this can provide bene ﬁcial in- sights for agricultural, ecological, environmental and forestry datasets.In particular, the transparency provided by the predictions of the TOBalgorithm provide insights that are ecologically signi ﬁcant regarding the pros and cons of particular high-performing prediction solutions.It clearly identiﬁes the most inﬂuential combination of data records(historical burn events) contributing to each prediction. However, theanalysis presented raises some important issues related to highly posi-tively skewed and generally asymmetrical distributions that are typi-cally associated with the burned areas of data sets compiling historicalforestﬁre incidents in different geographic areas. It is dif ﬁcult to de- velop machine learning solutions that accurately predict BA for thebulk of the data records (small to modest total burned area incidents)and, at the same time, provide accurate BA prediction for those fewburn events located in the right-side tail of the distribution (largesttotal burned area incidents).The feature selection sensitivity analysis process described for TOBin this study also has signiﬁcant potential for other forestﬁre datasets. Its ability to identify the most and least in ﬂuential input variables for data matching provides useful information ( Table 5andFig. 3). Ranking input features in this way typically complements the information that isavailable by comparison of correlation coef ﬁcients or generated by multi-variate analysis such as factor analysis and principal componentanalysis. This approach can help focus attention on which variablesare inﬂuential and how the information they provide could be reﬁned, complemented or improved. It can also help identify and assess the ben-eﬁts of potential future collection of new input variables that better de-scribe the characteristics of speciﬁc forests or forests in certain climaticzones. All these beneﬁts should contribute positively to the fundamen-tal ecological requirements of modern wild ﬁre management decision support systems (Martell, 2015).The results and analysis presented justify the combined use ofprediction accuracy metrics MAE and RMSE to root out high-performing solutions. RMSE as an objective function focuses moreon the right-side tail of the BA distribution. On the other hand,MAE can reveal important information about the absolute predic-tion errors in the parts of the distribution containing most data re-cords. Optimizing models separately using both MAE and RMSE asobjective functions minimizes errors and provides more ecologicalinsight to those predictions.D.A.

37Many of the subsets used to establish the mean values for theregression-based and statistically-based machine learning models eval-uated in multi-case studies are likely to have involved a degree ofoverﬁtting. However, evaluating their BA prediction performance withrelatively small testing subsets of data records is unable to reveal thisdue to a lack of transparency with repsect to each data record predic-tion. On the other hand, the two-stage prediction process involved inthe TOB models clearly reveals those cases with solutions generatedfrom small tuning and testing subset samples for which some degreeof overﬁtting has occurred. These are the cases where the TOB stage 2

38solutions generate lower prediction accuracy than TOB stage 1 solutionswhen applied to the full dataset (Tables 6 and 7). The TOB method provides forensic auditing capabilities for each pre-diction made by transparently providing access to the data matchingand variable error weighting in each prediction calculation ( Tables 9 and 10). It is this identiﬁcation of the best matching data records, andtheir contributions to each data record predictions, that represents thetrue data mining beneﬁt of the TOB algorithm. This enables it to provide

39ecological insight for each of its predictions. This capability differenti-ates the TOB method, in a positive way, from the machine learning algo-rithms that use regression, statistical or probabilistic relationshipsbetween the variables, which inhibit transparency and ready-access tothe underlying details for individual predictions.Graphical presentations of cumulative prediction error ( Fig. 3)h e l p to provide insight to a models prediction performance. It is useful tocompare cumulative prediction error trends for the two predictionsgenerated for each data record by the TOB algorithm. This revealsexactly for what parts of the total burned area distribution the predic-tions are being improved by the optimization process. The cumulativeabsolute error and squared error differentials between speci ﬁc solutions are also usefully displayed as graphical trends ( Figs. 5 and 6). Such dis- plays help to make choices concerning which prediction model is mostuseful for speciﬁc ecological purposes. The ability to drill down into thespeciﬁc data record predictions (Table 10and11) and understand the data records inﬂuencing each prediction, in positive or negative ways,is a valuable feature unique to the TOB method. For forest ﬁre

40predictions from datasets with many recorded input variables it makesecological sense to move beyond regression-based machine learningand beneﬁt from the auditability of optimized data matching to providevaluable insights from closely related historical records.The detailed data mining made possible with the TOB solutions re-veals a good deal of useful information about each data record (burnevent). Information about the inﬂuences on accurate and inaccuratepredictions associated with speciﬁc optimized solutions. This can helpto surface important ecological information that is useful in making ap-propriate response decisions to speciﬁc burn incidents. It identiﬁes which are the most useful TOB models and the most in ﬂuential variables that provide, and consistently justify, BA predictions. Such improvedconﬁdence in BA predictions, and the greater understanding of the fac-tors inﬂuencing each burn event derived from associated data mining,should lead to more appropriate responses to burn events as they hap-pen. Moreover, it should lead to more informed follow-up mitigation re-sponses that help to limit agricultural, ecological, environmental andforestry damage from similar incidents that might occur in the future.
6. ConclusionsAn optimized data-matching machine learning algorithm can pre-dict the total burned areas of a well-studied forest ﬁre dataset from Portugal (Montesinho Natural Park) to a high degree of accuracy.While doing so it provides exceptional data mining insights (that arenot immediately obvious) with which to interrogate each historicalburn event. The transparent open box (TOB) algorithm avoids the useof regression, correlation and statistical distribution assumptions inmaking its predictions and does not involve any hidden layers or com-plex calculations.For the dataset studied, TOB feature selection sensitivity analysisidentiﬁed drought code (DC) and relative humidity (RH) as the most in-ﬂuential, of the thirteen variables considered, on TOB's total burned areapredictions. The use of mean absolute error (MAE) and root meansquared error (RMSE) of the total burned area predictions separatelyas objective functions to minimize provides complementary informa-tion with respect to speciﬁc burned-area predictions from the highlypositively skewed total burned area distributions of forest- ﬁre datasets. The results indicate that transparent optimized data matching machinelearning reveals more in wildﬁre datasets than regression-based ma-chine learning algorithms.The consideration of cumulative absolute error (and squared error)differentials, displaying all data records, aid the comparisons betweenthe detailed prediction analysis achieved by high-performing TOBmodels. Graphical representations of these cumulative error trends fa-cilitate data mining and reveal the few problematic data records thatnegatively inﬂuence the overall prediction accuracy achievable by spe-ciﬁc model structures. This enables model structures to be selectedthat focus prediction accuracy on speciﬁc sectors of the total burned area distributions and/or more broadly across the entire distributions.This ability provides knowledge that is bene ﬁcial for sound agricultural, ecological, environmental and forestry responses to better respond toand manage speciﬁc burn events and potentially limit the impacts of fu-ture similar events. The method proposed could be readily adapted topredict and data mine generic agricultural systems that are dependenton complex interactions between weather and environmental variablesgoing beyond regression- and correlation-based methods.FundingThis study received no funding.Credit author statementI am the sole author of this manuscript and responsible for every as-pect of its study and preparation.Declaration of InterestThe author declares that he has no known competing ﬁnancial inter- ests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in
