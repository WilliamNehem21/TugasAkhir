1. Introduction
In recent years, territorial security have been studied intensively for variousapplications such as environmental monitoring and surveillance, such as airports,public transit, emergency services or nuclear facilities. When trying to monitorlarge geographically distributed area, in general Wireless Sensor Networks(WSN) are deployed. A WSN usually consists of numerous wireless devicesdeployed in a region of interest, each able to collect and process environmentalinformation and communicate with neighboring devices ( Wang and Tseng, 2008; Bai et al., 2006; Hefeeda and Ahmadi, 2009 ). Hence, A WSN can be regarded as a Multi-Agent System (Wooldridge, 2002; Hewitt and Inman, 1991;Ferber, 1999; Cai et al., 2011) for territorial security, where individual agentscooperate with each other to avoid duplication of effort and to exploit otheragent’s capacities (Wooldridge, 2002; Athanasiadis and Mitkas, 2004; Cai et al.,2011). Sensor deployment is an essential issue in WSN, as it affects how well aregion is monitored by sensors. This is a critical issue as there are a number of highpotential applications for sensor deployment, such as national defense ( Nickerson and Olariu, 2007), home security (Zhang, 2008), industrial surveillance (Chen, 2008) and environmental monitoring, etc. the primary objective for sensor deploy-ment is two-fold: WSN should cover a region of interest as complete as possible,while minimizing the number of sensors deployed, and thus minimizing costs asso-ciated with sensor deployment.
Considering a region of interest monitored by sensors, one of the most criticalconcerns is the region coverage (Wang and Tseng, 2008; Kar and Banerjee, 2003;Zhou et al., 2007; Kumar et al., 2006; Liu and Towsley, 2004; Hefeeda andAhmadi, 2009; Romoozi and Ebrahimpour-Komleh, 2012 ). In general, one of basic requirements for a WSN is that each location in a region of interest shouldbe within the sensing range of at least one of the sensors. An alternative approachis to have a region of interest covered simultaneously by at least Ksensors (Wang and Tseng, 2008; Zhou et al., 2007). Some deterministic methods have been pro-posed to address the problem of coverage. It has been shown that covering an areawith disks of equal radius can be done in an optimal manner ( Bai et al., 2006; Hefeeda and Ahmadi, 2009; Kar and Banerjee, 2003). Similar results have beenreported when multiple coverage of the target area is required ( Bai et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2007; Kumar et al., 2006; Wang and Tseng, 2008 ). Besides, the majority of optimization methods proposed are deterministic, and are generallyfunctions of a ﬁxed sensing range, as shown inFig. 1.90 A.H.R. Ko, F. GagnonThe direct consequence of oversimpliﬁcation in sensor deployment is that the-oretically perfect coverage shown in these deterministic methods may not holdtrue in practice. Most sensor deployment optimization methods assume that sen-sors are placed on a 2D plane, without taking into account the topographic ter-rain information (Kar and Banerjee, 2003; Bai et al., 2006; Hefeeda andAhmadi, 2009; Zhu et al., 2012). However, the area of interest that requires sen-sor deployment is rarely completely plane, usually it contains buildings andsome facilities. As a result, obstacles presented in environment, such vegetation,buildings, hills or valleys are all ignored in traditional sensor deployment setting.The conventional deterministic approaches do not consider environmentalfactors such as terrain topology, and cannot deal with it. While WSN seemsto satisfy the requirements to achieve full coverage on a target area using adeterministic method, there are no means to ensure that this coverage is trulyeffective in the real environment. This uncertainty of coverage thus presents achallenge in sensor deployment. To summarize, oversimpliﬁed assumptions leadto oversimpliﬁed optimization results, which cause sub-optimal WSNperformance.
Nevertheless, the problem becomes non-trivial when we consider environmentalfactors. GivenNsensors to be deployed in an area withMpossible positions, the possible combination of deployment will be
M/C1ðM/C01Þ/C1ðM/C02Þ/C1/C1/C11ðM/C0NÞ/C1ðM/C0N/C01Þ/C1/C1/C11. In general,Mis rather large, and this makes exhaustive search unfeasible. For example, given an area of100 m/C2100 m, even if we place a grid of 1 m and restrict sensors to be deployedonly on the corner of a grid, there will be 10;000 possible sensor positions.Considering to deploy only 10 sensors, there will be 10 ;000/C29999/C29998 /C29997/C29996/C29995/C29994/C29993/C29992/C29991 combinations, which isalmost 10
40. Such amount is simply not easy to proceed with current computationpower. The problems with such a high dimensionality cannot be solved directly,especially if the terrain exhibits some irregularities. In general, heuristic searchmethods such as random search can be applied, in the hope that a local optimumwill emerge during the search. However, random search offers little help if high

Somemore systematic search algorithms such as genetic algorithms rely strongly onsome regularities or similarities of features present in best individuals(Bhondekar et al., 2009; Seo et al., 2008; Akbarzadeh et al., 2010; Brar andVirk, 2014; Karaboga et al., 2014; Tripathi et al., 2011 ). We have, however, little evidence that such regularities or similarities exist in a highly complex problem,and that they can be extracted in such a straightforward way. Others such as sim-ulated annealing try to explore local information of sensors deployed, and onlymake short range displacement for sensors in a less frequent pace when time passesby.
In order to solve the problem, some non-deterministic search methods such asrandom search or simulated annealing can be applied. By taking into account ter-rain elevations, these non-deterministic search methods could perform better thantraditional deterministic approach. In an effort to tackle the problem, some priorwork based on evolutionary algorithm has been conducted ( Akbarzadeh et al., 2010; Kosar and Ersoy, 2012; Akbarzadeh et al., 2013; Song et al., 2012;Gueney et al., 2012).
However, there are still some disadvantages in using conventional evolutionaryapproaches. Due to the fact that all sensors are homogeneous, the chromosomesthat encode sensor positions are actually interchangeable, and conventional cross-over schemes such as uniform crossover (Yoon and Kim, 2013; Karaboga et al.,2014; Brar and Virk, 2014; Tripathi et al., 2011; Romoozi and Ebrahimpour-Komleh, 2012) would cause some redundancy as well as over-concentration incertain speciﬁc geographical area. We notice that after a few iterations the samesensor positions or geometrically close sensor positions would be encoded indifferent parts in chromosome by different individuals, and the conventionalcrossover scheme such as uniform crossover may produce offspring with redun-dant or geometrically close sensors. Such a crossover is thus less effective andmay delay the optimization process in sensor deployment optimization.
There are little work in sensor deployment optimization with evolutionaryapproaches, and most prior work conducted with such paradigms ( Romoozi and Ebrahimpour-Komleh, 2012; Akbarzadeh et al., 2010; Brar and Virk, 2014;Karaboga et al., 2014; Tripathi et al., 2011) simply used evolutionary algorithmsas a black box approach without taking into account the problem of homogeneousgene representation. Hence, we propose a Parsing Crossover Scheme that reducesredundancy and eases geographical concentration pattern to facilitate the search.The proposed parsing crossover method demonstrates better performances thanthose of uniform crossover under different terrain irregularities.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The problem statement ispresented in the next section, followed by a presentation of the proposed method.The experimental protocol and results are then summarized, concluding the paperwith discussions and perspectives.92 A.H.R. Ko, F. Gagnon2. Problem statement
Although there are some common notions on critical issues such as coverage(Ahmed et al., 2005; Boukerche and Fei, 2007; Kumar et al., 2006; Zhou et al.,2007), there are few comprehensive frameworks that have been done for sensordeployment optimization. In most cases, sensor deployment optimization isregarded as an overly complex problem, thus generic heuristic algorithms are oftenused for the optimization task (Bhondekar et al., 2009; Seo et al., 2008). A more comprehensive framework was proposed inAkbarzadeh et al. (2010). Still, we believe that are some important concepts that are yet to be clearly deﬁned oroutlined.
Given a sensors iwith a sensing ranged rand a point of interestpjwith a distanced
psaway from sensors i, we ﬁrst deﬁne the visibilityvðs i;pjÞas 1 if the pointp
jis visible to sensors i, and as 0 otherwise. Once the visibility is deﬁned,the coverage of the sensors
ito the pointpjcan be calculated (Ko et al., 2011):
Deﬁnition 1(Single Sensor Binary Coverage on a Point). The sensor binary coveragecðs

cðsi;pjÞ¼1;ifmaxð0;d r/C0d psÞ/C1vðs i;pjÞ>0ð1Þ cðs

Alternatively, we can extend the deﬁnition ofcðs i;pjÞinto a probability setting:
Deﬁnition 2(Single Sensor Probability Coverage on a Point).
cðsi;pjÞ¼fðd psÞ/C1vðs i;pjÞð3Þ
wherefðd psÞis a probabilistic sensor detection function, the exact function depends
on sensor behavior model. For example, a sigmoid detection function can be usedif justiﬁed:

of interest is regarded as covered if it is covered by at least of sensors deployed. Ifthere areNsensors deployed, instead of just one single sensor, then the coverage ofa pointp
jcan be deﬁned as (Ko et al., 2011):

Note thatcðs i;pjÞis the single sensors iprobability coverage on a pointpj.
With the knowledge of the coverage between sensors iand all points of interest, the overall coverage by sensors
ican be deﬁne by aggregation. If there arempoints of interest, then the coverage by a sensors
ican be deﬁned as:
Deﬁnition 5(Coverage by a Sensor). The coveragecðs iÞby a sensors ican be deﬁned as (Ko et al., 2011):

wherepjis a point, 16j6m, in a region of interestR. This deﬁnition applies for
both binary and probabilistic coverages. GivenNsensors to be deployed in aterrain, andmpoints in a region of interest, the global coverage cðSÞcan be deﬁned as the sum of coverage of all points of interest, which in turns is a functionof all sensors deployed,fs

Deﬁnition 6(Global Coverage).

wherepjis a point, 16j6m, in a region of interestR. Again, the same deﬁnition
works for under both binary and probabilistic coverage settings. Apparently, theglobal coveragecðSÞis a function of terrain elevationsp

fsi;x;si;yg¼arg maxUðpj;z;si;x;si;y;si;zÞ¼arg maxcðSÞð11Þ
Note thatpj;zands i;zare terrain effects and the system has no controls on these
factors.
Here we notice that we derive global coveragecðSÞnot by sensors, but by pointsin a region interest. The reason is that it is far less costly to take into accountmultiple coverage effects by points of interest rather than by sensors. We simplycannot know the extent to which a sensor has duplicated coverage with other sen-sors unless we examine all points of interest that may potentially be covered. Thiscauses some problems in optimization, because we cannot simply add up coveragefrom all sensors to obtain global coverage. Thus, we cannot regard the problem asindividual optimization problems, because optimization of individual sensorcoverage would not be equal to the overall global coverage. Moreover, becausethe sum of coverage of all sensors does not equal to global coverage, we cannotevaluate the ﬁtness of an individual sensor only based on its coverage achieved.
Given the high dynamic nature of the problem, it is quite costly to predict thebehaviors of other agents and the consequences of these behaviors in such a com-plex and dynamic setting. Due to the intrinsic complexity of the problem,advanced evolutionary approaches would perform better than traditional heuristicsearch. However, since all sensors are homogeneous, the chromosomes that codesensor positions are actually interchangeable, and conventional crossover schemessuch as uniform crossover would cause some redundancy as well as over-concen-tration in certain speciﬁc geographical area. We thus propose in the next sectionour parsing crossover method.
3. Proposed method
GivenNsensors, each sensor position can be encoded by its x coordinate and ycoordinate, hence the sensor deployment needs 2/C1Nsensors to depict sensor posi-tions. Each sensor position is thus represented by a gene-pair in chromosome.
The conventional crossover scheme may encode identical sensors into differentgenes, and this may cause two problems: (a) offspring may have redundant sensorpositions in its chromosome; (b) offspring may not inherit the gene-pairs that bothparents have.
We are mainly motivated by three purposes to propose this parsing crossovermethod for sensor deployment : (a) make sure that offspring would not haveredundant gene-pairs; (b) if both parents have a certain gene-pair, then make surethat their offspring would inherit it; (c) under the condition that both (a) and (b)are satisﬁed, make sure that more distant sensor positions, i.e., sensor positionsthat are less similar to existent sensor positions, have higher chance to beinherited.Process of 3D wireless decentralized sensor deployment 95In order to satisfy these purposes, the parsing crossover method can be carriedout by the following algorithm:
Algorithm 1.Pseudo-code of parsing crossover scheme.
Given two parents, each parent encodes Nsensor positions, and contains 2/C2Ngenes:
1. Merge chromosomes from both parents into a new chromosome, as group A with 2 /C2Ngene-pairs, or 4/C2Ngenes,2. Separate all 2/C2Ngene-pairs from group A into two groups: group B with N

4. Simulations
In order to verify the validity of the proposed method, we carried out a number ofexperiments on terrains with different irregularities. Note that we are simplyunable to test all terrain types for two reasons: (a) Millions of types of terrainexist, and even categorization may not be feasible; (b) currently there is simplyno measure on terrain irregularities and we cannot quantify it given any terrain.Hence, we work another way around, ﬁrst we deﬁne a standard deviation ofterrain elevation as irregularity, and then we generate artiﬁcial terrains usingdifferent standard deviation and test different search algorithms.
4.1. Experimental protocol
We deploy 8 sensors in an area with size 100 m/C2100 m, thus the problem has thecomplexity of 10;000/C29999/C29998/C29997/C29996/C29995/C29994/C29993 combi- nations, which is almost 10
32. The coverage is based on binary setting, and eachsensor is supposed to have a radius of 30 m of detection range. Sensors aredeployed one meter high above the ground, so there is an asymmetry betweendetecting positions and detected positions. Consequently, we assume that anypoint of interest is detectable under the condition that it is inside the detection96 A.H.R. Ko, F. Gagnonrange of a sensor and that there is no obstruction on the line of sight between thesensor and the point.
Note that a real world WSN sensor has more complex behaviors and many morefactors to take into account, such as a ‘‘dipole’’ pattern, battery issues, communi-cation routes, etc. Nevertheless, we regard the 3D obstruction as one of the mostrelevant ones. In this paper, we simply try to stress the importance of terrain issuesin considering WSN coverage, and do not deal with all of them at the same time.
Terrain has various elevation variations, the elevation variations are in Gauss-ian distribution with standard deviation from 0.1 m to 1200 m and a mean of 0.Terrain is almost ﬂat with only 0.1 m of standard deviation, but can be quitecomplex with 1200 m of standard deviation.
To introduce asymmetry in the experiment, sensors would be placed one meterabove the ground instead of on the ground. We tested several methods, includingtraditional deterministic pattern (Bai et al., 2006; Hefeeda and Ahmadi, 2009), Random Search, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm with uniform crossover,one point crossover, two point crossover, and the proposed parsing crossover.
Each method makes 500 displacement iterations in a test, with 30 tests in total,except for traditional deterministic pattern, and genetic algorithm. For geneticalgorithm, we set up a population of 10 individuals, hence there would be 10 dis-placement evaluations in each generation. Thus, genetic algorithm only contains
50010¼50 generations to be comparable with other methods. Crossover rate is 0.9for uniform crossover. Mutation rate is 0.05, and the disturbance in case of amutation is a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation r
r¼10 m. For sim- ulated annealing, we seta¼
13andb¼12for temperature function, andr
r¼10 m for displacement distance, the same as in genetic algorithm.
4.2. Experimental results
Table 1shows experimental results. Traditional deterministic deployment patternhas the lowest coverage among all methods tested. This is not surprising given thattraditional deterministic deployment does not consider terrain elevations.
Among purely heuristic methods, we notice that simulated annealing with dis-placement of only one sensor at a time generally performs better than randomsearch. On contrary, simulated annealing with displacement of all sensors at thesame time in general does not perform as well as random search. It may suggestthat simulated annealing can perform better than random search, but only if wedisplace one sensor at a time rather than displace all sensors at the same time.A plausible explanation is that if we displace only one sensor at a time, the restof sensors preserve more or less the structure of the network. Thus, during thesearch simulated annealing would explore a better solution for a given network,of which properties are somehow stable. However, if we displace all sensors atthe same time, simulated annealing may actually generate a completely differentnetwork. A complete new network may prevent simulated annealing from makingProcess of 3D wireless decentralized sensor deployment 97Table 1 Coverage percentage on the target areas for sensor deployment. 8 sensors in total are deployed in an area with size 100 m /C2100 m, each sensor has aradius of 30 m of detection range, and all sensors are placed one meter above the ground.

Ko, F. Gagnonuse of properties of a stable network. As there are some constraints on displace-ment distance, simulated annealing with displacement of all sensors at the sametime may not be as good as random search.
Genetic algorithm apparently performs better than both simulated annealingapproaches. Also, genetic algorithm has the best performance when the terrainirregularity is low. Among different crossover schemes, we observe that uniformcrossover is consistently outperformed by all other crossover schemes, as showninFig. 2. For terrain with low variations, one point crossover tends to outperformother crossover schemes. However, as terrain starts to show medium irregularity,two point crossover seems to have the best performance. Furthermore, the pro-posed parsing crossover scheme has the best performance when the terrainbecomes even more irregular.
5. Discussion and conclusion
Sensor deployment in a 3D environment is a non-trivial task, as it is basically aNP-hard non-convex optimization problem. In order to solve the problem, non-deterministic optimization methods such as random search, simulated annealingor evolutionary algorithm (Akbarzadeh et al., 2010) can be applied. By taking intoaccount terrain elevations, these non-deterministic optimization methods couldperform better than traditional deterministic approach.
Figure 2Genetic Algorithm crossover scheme performance comparison using uniform crossover as thebenchmark: the evaluation was carried out on different terrain complexities with elevation standard deviationfrom 0.1 m to 1200 m. Genetic Algorithm with uniform crossover is set as the benchmark as thus has always thevalue 0; we compare its performance with those of one-point crossover, two-point crossover and the proposedparsing crossover.Process of 3D wireless decentralized sensor deployment 99However, due to the fact that all sensors are homogeneous, the evolutionaryalgorithm will encounter some problems. The chromosomes that encode sensorpositions are actually interchangeable, and conventional crossover schemes suchas uniform crossover would cause some redundancy as well as over-concentrationin certain speciﬁc geographical area. We notice that after a few iterations the samesensor positions or geometrically close sensor positions would be encoded indifferent parts in chromosome by different individuals, and the conventionalcrossover scheme such as uniform crossover may produce offspring with redun-dant or geometrically close sensors. Such a crossover is thus less effective andmay delay the optimization process in sensor deployment optimization.
Hence, we proposed a parsing crossover scheme for genetic algorithm. Theexperimental simulation conﬁrms that the proposed crossover scheme performsbetter than traditional uniform crossover, one-point crossover and two-pointcrossover schemes. However, although the proposed scheme outperforms all othercompared methodologies in highly irregular terrain, we acknowledge that theremay still be some room to further improve the crossover scheme and to make itmore robust regardless of irregularity in optimization space.
Despite the fact that the proposed method does perform better than mostconventional schemes, our parsing crossover relies on the mechanism of geneticalgorithm - a population-based optimization. Hence, in circumstances wheregenetic algorithm fails, we are uncertain whether our parsing crossover schemecan be a full remedy. In our simulation, we do not observe any instances of generalgenetic algorithm failure. However, this is an issue that we may need to pay moreattention in the future.
