The recent technological advancements inspectral imaging and artiﬁcial intelligence have opened up new possibilities for plant disease detection in bothcrops and trees. In this study, Dutch elm disease (DED; caused by Ophiostoma novo-ulmi,) and American elm (Ulmus americana) was used as example pathosystem to evaluate the accuracy of two in-house developedhigh-precision portable hyper- and multi-spectral leaf imagers combined with machine learning as new toolsfor forest disease detection.

1. IntroductionForests play a critical role in our ecosystems by providing variousecological, economic, social, and cultural services ( Chen and Meentemeyer, 2016). However, diseases caused by invasive pathogensare an increasing threat to forest health ( Flower and Gonzalez-Meler, 2015;Fei et al., 2019). Management options may be limited and prohib-itively expensive depending on the extent of pathogen spread and es-tablishment, so early and accurate detection is essential, particularlyfor invasive pathogens that may not yet be broadly distributed or arecryptic in nature. Current methods for disease detection includeobservation of visual symptoms, followed by molecular con ﬁrmation when needed. However, visual assessment of disease symptomsmanually is laborious and prone to errors ( Bock et al., 2020;Bian et al., 2022). While early molecular detection methods can generallybe developed, they often involve labor-intensive procedures, highcosts, and operational limitations (Schaad and Frederick, 2002;Fang and Ramasamy, 2015).Recent technological advancements have produced new tools, espe-cially spectral imaging combined with arti ﬁcial intelligence, for rapid and accurate plant phenotyping, including early plant disease detectionin both crops and trees (Mishra et al., 2020;Bian et al., 2022). By combining traditional imaging with spectroscopy, spectral imagingcan capture both the spatial and spectral features of an object, includinghealthy and diseased plants, thus enabling the identi ﬁcation of subtle changes associated with disease development before visible symptomsArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 10 (2023) 26 –34

journal homepage:http://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/artificial-intelligence-in-agriculture/appear (Conrad and Bonello, 2016;Mishra et al., 2020;Singh et al., 2020;Cotrozzi, 2022;Fang et al., 2023). Artiﬁcial intelligence has been utilized to analyze complex and high-dimensional data captured byspectral imaging systems. Traditional machine learning methods, suchas support vector machine (SVM) and partial least square discriminantanalysis (PLS-DA), are commonly used in spectral analysis with satisfac-tory performance for disease detection in crop and tree systems ( Conrad et al., 2020;Wei et al., 2021a;Fearer et al., 2022). State-of-art deep learning models, such as convolution neural networks (CNN), aremore suited for image analysis tasks, including spectral image analysisfor plant phenotyping and disease detection ( Jiang and Li, 2020;Liu and Wang, 2021;Shi et al., 2023). The integration of spectral imagingwith machine learning techniques has opened up new possibilities forearly detection of plant diseases. However, many major forest diseasesremain unexplored by these technological advancements, andadditional studies aimed at identifying and detecting disease-speci ﬁc signatures are needed (Wei et al., 2021b;Cotrozzi, 2022). Depending on the number of spectral wavelengths/bands involved,spectral imaging can be categorized into hyperspectral imaging (HSI)and multispectral imaging (MSI). Hyperspectral imaging captures andanalyzes data across a wide range of narrow spectral bands, which pro-vides a more detailed spectral resolution, thus allowing for the detectionof subtle spectral variations associated with plant diseases ( Mishra et al., 2017). Multispectral imaging captures data across a limited number ofspectral bands, typically ranging from 3 to 10 bands. While it offersless spectral detail compared to HSI, MSI can still provide valuable infor-mation for plant disease detection, especially with higher spatial resolu-tions to captureﬁne detailed spatial features of disease development(Peng et al., 2022). Both hyper- and multi-spectral imaging techniqueshave been evaluated for plant disease detection, but mostly in remotesensing systems (Kumar et al., 2012;Chen and Meentemeyer, 2016; Abdulridha et al., 2019;Cotrozzi, 2022). Spectral imaging data collectedusing remote sensing systems have high throughput but limited imag-ing resolution, leading to disease detection models primarily relyingon averaged canopy color changes ( Gitelson and Merzlyak, 1996; Chen and Meentemeyer, 2016). However, early disease symptomsoften manifest as small local spots before noticeable canopy colorchanges occur. In addition, the signal-over-noise ratio (SNR) of remotesensing data is constrained by various sources of noise, including ambi-ent daylightﬂuctuations, varying leaf slopes, and shadows ( Zhang et al., 2019a;Ma et al., 2021). Consequently, the lack of high-SNR imagingsensors capturing high-spectral and spatial resolution disease signals,along with advanced algorithms for accurate disease detection andidentiﬁcation, remains a signiﬁcant bottleneck in early plant diseasediagnosis, including the detection of forest diseases.
The recent development of high-precision leaf spectral imagers,known as LeafSpec, provides high-resolution images in both spectraland spatial domains for accurate plant health monitoring ( Zhang et al., 2019b;Wang et al., 2020a, 2020b;Li et al., 2023a, 2023b). The low- cost handheld leaf imaging device was designed to overcome challengesfaced by spectral imaging systems, such as inconsistent lighting sourcesand various leaf slopes, via a customized imaging chamber with embed-ded light sources and a touch-based scanning mode. The leaf imagingdevice can collect hyper- or multi-spectral images of a whole leafdirectly in theﬁeld and in a non-destructive and rapid manner. Inaddition, LeafSpec has been evaluated with improved performance indetecting nutrient deﬁciency and discriminating genotypes in bothcorn and soybean (Wang et al., 2020a, 2020b;Ma et al., 2020;Song et al., 2023). However, most of the previous applications of LeafSpecwere in agricultural crop systems, and the high-precision hyper- andmulti-spectral leaf imagers have yet to be evaluated in tree phenotypingapplications such as disease detection and resistance screening.In this study, we used Dutch elm disease (DED) in American elm asan example pathosystem to evaluate the capability of LeafSpec for forestdisease detection. Dutch elm disease, caused by Ophiostoma ulmi and O. novo-ulmi,is one of the most devastating and widespread invasivediseases in U.S. forests (Flower et al., 2017;Fei et al., 2019). The disease wasﬁrst detected in theﬁrst half of the 20th century and has sincedestroyed American elms (Ulmus americana) in urban and forest land- scapes across the U.S. (D'Arcy, 2000;Bernier, 2022). Current efforts are focused on identifying and breeding disease-resistant elm trees foruse in restoration (Townsend et al., 2005;Pinchot et al., 2017). There- fore, methods capable of rapidly phenotyping trees for disease suscepti-bility are needed to facilitate these efforts. Past research hasdemonstrated that Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy issensitive enough to detect changes in elmwood chemistry followinginfection withO. novo-ulmi(Martin et al., 2005a, 2007) and to differen- tiate between trees that differ in DED susceptibility ( Martin et al., 2005b, 2008). However, only xylem tissues of elm trees were destructivelyexamined in the previous studies, and as suggested by the authors, thein-ﬁeld application of FT-IR for large-scale tree screening is uncertain(Martin et al., 2008). The high-precision handheld LeafSpec showspromise for scaling-up automated in-ﬁeld plant phenotyping tasks when integrated with robotic systems ( Chen et al., 2021, 2023). The overarching goal of this study is to evaluate the accuracy ofhigh-precision LeafSpec combined with machine learning for diseasephenotyping in trees. The speciﬁc objectives were to determine 1) ifhigh-resolution spectral images collected using LeafSpec combinedwith machine learning can detect DED; 2) if there is a different abilityusing high spectral resolution HSI versus high spatial resolution MSI indetecting DED; 3) can we differentiate elm genotypes with variedsusceptibility to DED through machine learning-based analysis ofhigh-resolution leaf images in both spectral and spatial domains.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and inoculationsAmerican elm genotypes with known susceptibility to DED wereclonally propagated in 2021, potted and grown in a greenhouse at theU.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Northern Research Stationin Delaware, OH. The experimental unit was one clonal tree in a pot.Trees were organized in a resolvable incomplete block design withthree sampling time points, including four elm genotypes and two inoc-ulation treatments, and 4 to 12 replicates per genotype per treatmentper sampling time point (Table 1). The four elm genotypes tested in-cluded NA 57845, Princeton, RV 141, and RV 467. NA 57845 is an elmclone known for its sensitivity to DED and has been used as a susceptiblecontrol in elms breeding programs (Haugen and Bentz, 2017). Princeton is a commercially available American elm clone with high levels of DEDtolerance (Townsend et al., 2005;Haugen and Bentz, 2017). The RV 141 and RV 467 genotypes are unique clonal lines developed from seed pro-duced in controlled crosses between known DED-resistant elms. An un-publishedﬁeld trial has indicated intermediate to low levels of tolerance

27for RV 141 clones, and high levels of tolerance for RV 467 clones(C. Flower, personal communication). Two levels of pathogen inocula-tion treatments were tested, including mock inoculation with waterand inoculation withO. novi-ulmi. Trees were inoculated following themethods ofPinchot et al. (2017). Brieﬂy, a sterile grafting knife was used to make a small incision that extended into the xylem stream,analogous to a cleft graft, about 10 cm above the base of each pottedtree. Either 5μl of water or fungal spore solution at a concentration of5×1 0
3spores/μl was pipetted into the hole of each tree as the mock-inoculation or inoculation treatment, respectively. The inoculationtreatment was applied on May 10 to May 12, 2022.2.2. Visual disease evaluationsCanopy-level symptoms induced by DED infection, includingwilting, yellowing, and browning, were rated as a percent of a tree(using 5% decline ratings) weekly throughout the experiment(Fig. 1C). At the completion of the experiment, which was ∼18 weeks post-inoculation (WPI), trees were destructively harvested to con ﬁrm pathogen infection via xylem staining. Disease progress curves of eachelm genotype were plotted. The visual disease severity rating of DEDsymptoms before the completion of the experiment ( ∼14 WPI) was compared among elm genotypes using a one-way Analysis of Variance(ANOVA) followed by Tukey honestly signi ﬁcant difference (HSD; α= 0.05) to evaluate differences in disease severity ratings amongelm genotypes.2.3. Spectral image collectionHyper- and multi-spectral leaf images were collected utilizingLeafSpec at three sampling time points, including 96 h post inoculation(HPI; before any visible foliar symptoms of DED developed), 4 WPI(during early foliar symptom development) and 15 WPI (near theconclusion of the experiment when foliage symptoms were visibly no-ticeable). Fifteen to thirty-three leaves per treatment were imaged foreach elm genotype at each sampling time point ( Table 1). Trees were destructively sampled for a different study at 96 HPI. Thus, leavesimaged at 96 HPI were from a different group of trees compared toones at 4 and 15 WPI. Regardless of inoculation treatment, leaves sam-pled at theﬁrst two sampling time points (96 HPI and 4 WPI) did notshow any obvious foliar symptoms of DED (asymptomatic). Whileleaves sampled from the inoculated treatment at 15 WPI had visibleDED symptoms, including necrotic leaf tips or yellowing ( Fig. 1C). A detached leaf method was used for the image scans, where leaveswere detached from each tree and imaged with both hyper- andmulti-spectral LeafSpec imagers (Fig. 1A, B). The conﬁguration of these two devices is listed inTable 2. Due to logistical constraints, leavessampled at 96 HPI and 4 WPI wereﬁrst stored on wet ice and imaged6 and 24 h after leaves were detached from trees. In comparison, leaveswere imaged immediately after detachment at 15 WPI. A total of561 leaves were scanned for the three sampling time points, resultingin 561 hyperspectral and 561 multispectral image cube data ﬁles, respectively.2.4. Analysis of hyper- and multi-spectral image cubesTheﬂow chart for the analysis of hyper- and multi-spectral LeafSpecimages is illustrated inFig. 2.B r i eﬂy, raw hyper- and multi-spectralLeafSpec images wereﬁrst calibrated with a reference image of a ﬂat strip made of white Reﬂon materials (Wang et al., 2020a). Then, leaf re- gions in each image were segmented from the background using athreshold method based on normalized difference vegetation index(NDVI) heatmaps derived from the calibrated image cubes ( Ma et al., 2020;Song et al., 2023). Traditional machine learning methods, includ-ing SVM and PLS-DA, were used for the spectrum analysis. While state-of-art deep learning models, ResNet18, were used for the spectral cubeimage analysis. Data (either spectra or cube images) for each elm geno-type were split into training (70% data) and testing (30% data) subsetsusing the same random seed to evaluate the training and testing classi-

28detection of DED. The detailed analysis procedures of hyper- and multi-spectral LeafSpec images were described in the following subsections.2.4.1. Analysis of averaged spectra derived from hyper- and multi-spectralimage cubesThe averaged spectrum of a leaf sample was calculated by averagingthe spectrums of all the pixels in the leaf regions. The preprocessing stepsof averaged spectra derived from hyperspectral image cubes wereadapted fromWei et al. (2021a). First, wavelengths at two extremeends (<490 nm and >900 nm) were removed. Then, spectra weresmoothed using a Savitzky-Golayﬁlter with a second-order polynomialand a window size of 11 data points. Lastly, the number of features wasreduced by half to 156 wavelengths/bands using a self-developed spec-tral binning function. In comparison, averaged spectra derived from the6-band multispectral image were directly used for further analysis.To classify the mock-inoculated and DED-inoculated treatments,two commonly used supervised machine learning models were testedon the averaged spectra derived from hyper- and multi-spectralLeafSpec images, including linear support vector machine (SVM) andpartial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The linear kernelin SVMﬁnds a linear separator (hyperplane) that maximizes the marginbetween classes with the least error (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). PLS-DA aims toﬁnd a latent space representation that maximizes the separationbetween classes. It can handle multicollinearity in spectral data and cap-ture the relevant variation for classiﬁcation (Chevallier et al., 2006). The hyperparameters for SVM and PLS-DA models were ﬁne-toned using grid search and 10-fold cross-validation. The hyperparameters foreach model were selected according to the best training classi ﬁcation accuracy. The range of penalty parameter C in the SVM models wasset from 0.001 to 1000 on a logarithmic scale between 10
−3and 103
in order to maximize the margin for better classi ﬁcation results and minimize the misclassiﬁcation errors and overﬁtting concerns. The range of the number of latent variables for PLS-DA models was setfrom 2 to 5 for similar reasons. The detailed hyperparameters for eachmachine learning-based model used in this study were listed inTable S1. SVM and PLSDA models were built using the SVM andPLSRegression packages, respectively. Both packages are in the scikit-learn library in Python (Pedregosa et al., 2011).2.4.2. Direct analysis of hyper- and multi-spectral cube images usingpre-trained CNN modelsTo make full use of the spectral and spatial features in hyper- andmulti-spectral images, pre-trained convolutional neural network(CNN) models, ResNet18, were built and ﬁne-tuned to classify leaves collected from mock-inoculated and inoculated elm trees. ResNetmodels reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with refer-ence to the layer inputs, which facilitates the training of substantiallydeeper networks (He et al., 2016). ResNet18, with its deep layers andskip connections, may have the potential to effectively capture complexspatial and spectral features from leaf-level spectral images. Duringpreprocessing, spectral images at two extreme ends (<490 nmand >900 nm) were removed, and neighbor images were binned to-gether using a window size of 5 to reduce multilinearity. The ﬁrst band image of 560 nm in the multispectral image at 15 WPI was aban-doned as an outlier after visual checking of all image bands. After pre-processing, 62-band image cubes were used as input to build thehyperspectral ResNet18 models for all three sampling time points. Forthe multispectral ResNet18 models, 6-band image cubes were used asinput for 96 HPI and 4 WPI, and 5-band image cubes were used for 15WPI. The adaptive moment estimation algorithm, known as the Adamoptimizer, was chosen to iterate the cross-entropy loss function with alearning rate of 0.001. A total of 200 epochs were executed whileusing a callback function to record the best performance of the trainedResNet18 models. The ResNet-18 model architecture was built usingthe PyTorch library in Python (Paszke et al., 2019).2.4.3. Visualization of spectral and spatial feature patterns in DED detectionmodelsTo better interpret classiﬁcation models built upon machine learningalgorithms, spectral and spatial feature importance patterns were plot-ted for the best-performing SVM models built upon averaged spectraderived from hyperspectral images and the ResNet18 CNN model builtupon multispectral images, respectively. In the linear SVM models,spectral feature importance was measured by coef ﬁcients, representing the weights assigned to each predictor variable in the linear combina-tion that was used to make predictions. In the ResNet18 CNN modelbuilt upon multispectral cube images, the class-speci ﬁc feature heatmaps were generated using Gradient-weighted Class ActivationMapping (Grad-CAM) (Selvaraju et al., 2017). The highlighted regions in each Grad-CAM heatmap represent relatively important features forthe model's prediction, which might indicate symptomatic leaves inthe current study.3. Results and discussion3.1. Visual ratings of foliar symptoms induced by DED infectionThe development of foliar symptoms potentially induced by DEDafter inoculation varied among elm genotypes ( Fig. 3). Foliar symptoms such as wilting were observed as early as 2 WPI. However, among fourelm genotypes, only NA 57845 had an average rating of over 20%throughout the experiment. A decrease in visual ratings of DED severityoccurred from 6 to 9 WPI (Fig. 3A) in tandem with a secondﬂush of veg- etative growth in epicormic branches and basal sprouts (data notshown). At 14 WPI, NA 57845 had the greatest DED severity ratingsamong all four elm genotypes (P< 0.0001), numerically followed byRV 141, Princeton, and RV 467 (Fig. 3B).

29symptoms among the four elm genotypes in the current study is consis-tent with previous studies (Flower et al., 2017;Pinchot et al., 2017), which found NA 57845 as susceptible and Princeton and RV 467 asresistant to DED. Previous studies found RV 141 to initially exhibithigh tolerance to DED (Flower et al., 2017;Pinchot et al., 2017), with symptom development increasing substantially two years after inocula-tion (Flower, personal communication).At 14 WPI,∼67.6% of elm trees inoculated withO. novi-ulmi(N=6 8 ) showed foliar symptoms of DED, such as wilting, yellowing, or necrosis,and conﬁrmed infection with DED via underbark staining. However,nearly 40% of mock-inoculated elm trees ( N= 25) also showed some foliar symptoms, such as wilting and yellowing, but none exhibiteddiscolorations on the xylem tissues indicating an absence of DED infec-tion (data not shown). Foliar symptoms could be attributed to othercauses besides DED, so more sensitive methods for evaluating DED areneeded.3.2. Classiﬁcation performances for DED detection using hyper- andmulti-spectral leaf imagesRegardless of hyper- or multispectral images and machine learningmethods used, overall classiﬁcation accuracies varied among differentsampling time points after inoculation treatments to separate leavesfrom mock-inoculated and inoculated elm trees. The highest classi ﬁca- tion accuracy was achieved at 15 WPI, followed by 96 HPI, and 4 WPIhad the lowest classiﬁcation accuracies (Table 3). The lower classiﬁca- tion accuracy at 4 WPI than 96 HPI can be potentially explained by thesecondﬂush of vegetative growth caused by fertilizer applicationsafter theﬁrst sampling time point at 96 HPI. The new vegetative growthmight outweigh the DED infection and lead to less prominent spectralsignals at 4 WPI than 96 HPI. Leaves sampled from the inoculated elmtrees at 15 WPI already had visible DED symptoms, so it was expectedto have a higher classiﬁcation performance at 15 WPI than the ﬁrst two sampling time points with no obvious foliar symptoms of DED. Inaddition, the temporary wet-ice storage of leaves before imaging at 96HPI and 4 WPI might also cause leaf chemical statuses, as suggestedbyJuneau and Tarasoff (2012). This may potentially confound the DEDsignals and lead to a lower classiﬁcation performance in separatingleaves from mock-inoculated and inoculated elm trees at the ﬁrst two sampling time points than 15 WPI (Table 3). Generally, models built upon hyperspectral data had higher trainingaccuracy but varied testing accuracies compared to models built uponmultispectral data (averaged spectrum or cube image) ( Table 3). The training accuracy represents the accuracy of a model on the data itwas trained on, while the testing accuracy indicates the model'sperformance on unseen data. Models built upon hyperspectral datacan captureﬁne spectral variations and potentially extract morediscriminative features of leaves collected from mock-inoculated andinoculated elm trees, leading to higher training accuracy than multi-spectral data. However, the testing accuracies of these models can

30vary, indicating their sensitivity to different testing scenarios. Formodels built upon the averaged spectrums, hyperspectral typicallyhad higher testing accuracies than multispectral. While for modelsbuilt upon cube images, multispectral had comparable testing accura-cies with hyperspectral (Table 3).For both hyper- and multi-spectral images, deep learning modelsbuilt upon cube images had higher or comparable classi ﬁcation accura- cies in the training datasets but always higher accuracies in the testingdatasets than traditional machine learning models built upon averagedspectrum (Table 3). Deep learning models, including ResNet18, oftenrequire larger amounts of training data compared to traditional ma-chine learning models, such as SVM or PLS-DA ( Zhang et al., 2020). The lower training accuracies of ResNet18 than SVM or PLS-DA couldbe potentially explained by the limited sample size in the currentstudy. However, the higher testing accuracies of ResNet18 models sug-gest that they can effectively generalize their learned representations todistinguish between mock-inoculated and DED-inoculated treatment inunseen spectral leaf images. In addition, ResNet18 models were built di-rectly upon spectral image cubes, which allowed them to simulta-neously capture spatial and spectral features of DED infection. Incontrast, SVM or PLS-DA models built upon spectrum derived fromspectral images only considered spectral features, potentially missingout on valuable spatial information that can aid in accurate DED detec-tion. Nevertheless, results indicate that the deep learning models con-sidering both spectral and spatial features of high-resolution LeafSpecimages have advantages over traditional machine learning modelsbuilt upon spectral features alone for DED detection.To better visualize leaves sampled from healthy and DED-infectedelm trees, leaf-level attention maps representing spatial feature impor-tance were generated using Grad-CAM in the ResNet18 CNN modelbuilt upon multispectral cube images. The “hotter”areas in the attention map were the prioritized locations used by the CNN model for DED de-tection. Two distinct feature distributions were observed betweenleaves from inoculated and mock-inoculated trees. Edges and symp-tomatic spots on the leaves were highlighted as important spatial fea-tures to distinguish leaves from inoculated and mock-inoculated trees(Fig. 4). DED infection affects the xylem water transportation, thus lead-ing to foliar wilting symptoms (Haugen, 1998;D'Arcy, 2000;Bernier, 2022). At the leaf level, edges are away from the main xylem channel,typically major or second veins. Plants usually sacri ﬁce leaf edgesﬁrst when under vascular stress, which could explain why leaf edges wereselected in addition to symptomatic spots when differentiating elmleaves from inoculated and mock-inoculated trees.3.3. Spectral and spatial feature patterns of elm genotypes with differentsusceptibility to DEDThe best-performing DED detection models were investigated fur-ther to explore their applications in screening different elm genotypesfor DED resistance. Because disease progressed differently among thefour elm genotypes, classiﬁcation models were built and cross-validated among elm genotypes using averaged spectrum derivedfrom hyperspectral image cubes (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the NA 57845 model performed better in classifying the spectrums of itself and RV141 than the spectrums of Princeton and RV 467. These two modelsalso had better performance in classifying the combined spectrumsthan Princeton and RV 467 models. On the other hand, the Princetonmodel performed better in classifying itself and RV 467 than classifyingspectrums of NA 57845 and RV 141. These results suggest that spectralproﬁles of susceptible and resistant elm genotypes differ following inoc-ulation. This may indicate differences in induced chemicals betweensusceptible and resistant trees following infection with O. novo-ulmi, as reported in previous studies (Martin et al., 2005a, 2005b, 2007,2008).Among the averaged spectrum models, the SVM model built uponhyperspectral images at 15 WPI had the highest prediction accuraciesin distinguishing leaves from healthy and diseased elm trees. To exam-ine which spectral wavelength(s) were most important for classi ﬁca-
tion, the coefﬁcients of the linear SVM models were plotted in Fig. 5B. Interestingly, in the visible region (e.g.,∼490 to 680 nm), NA 57845 and RV 141 models had similar coefﬁcient patterns, while Princeton and RV 467 had similar patterns. Moreover, the patterns of susceptiblegenotypes (NA 57845 and RV 141) differed from resistant genotypes(Princeton and RV 467). In the part of the Red-edge region (e.g. ∼700 to 730 nm), RV 141 and RV 467 had similar patterns, and NA 57845and Princeton had similar patterns. In the near-infrared region(e.g., 800 to 900 nm), the feature importance was low, as indicated bythe coefﬁcients being close to 0 (Fig. 5B). Overall, the visible region of the spectrum was important in distinguishing leaves from inoculatedand mock-inoculated trees, which agreed with one previous report onspectral reﬂectance characteristics of DED byWilson et al. (1998).T h e reﬂectance/transmittance at the visible region is related to leaf pig-ments such as chlorophyll. The wilting, yellowing, and eventually brow-ning symptoms induced by DED might be caused by leaf pigmentchanges, which were captured by spectral imaging tools.Among models directly built upon hyper- and multi-spectral imagecubes, the multispectral ResNet18 model at 15 WPI had the highest pre-diction accuracies in distinguishing leaves from healthy and diseasedelm trees. To investigate whether spatial feature patterns were usefulfor disease-resistant genotype screening, attention maps in theResNet18 CNN models for DED detection were compared among thefour elm genotypes evaluated in this study. Susceptible elm genotypes(NA 57845 and RV 141) had similar attention maps that differed fromthose of the resistant elm genotypes (Princeton and RV 467) ( Fig. 6). Both the susceptible and resistant elm genotypes underwent twotypes of treatments: inoculated and mock-inoculated. However, whenexamining the attention maps, it was observed that the susceptible

RGB im- ages were derived from multispectral leaf images at 15 weeks post inoculation. Attentionmaps representing the spatial feature patterns of the ResNet18 CNN model for DED detec-tion were generated using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping. The highlightedregions in each attention map were the most important regions in the image to predictDED infection.X. Wei, J. Zhang, A.O. Conrad et al.

31elm genotypes showed attention maps with colors similar to those ofthe inoculated group, indicating a response to the disease. On theother hand, the attention maps of the resistant elm genotypes exhibitedcolors resembling those of the mock-inoculated group, suggesting a lackof response to the disease (Figs. 4 and 6). Theseﬁndings provide further evidence that leaf-level spatial feature patterns identi ﬁed by deep learn- ing models can effectively distinguish between susceptible and resistantelm genotypes, which can be useful for identifying disease-resistantgenotypes and informing disease management strategies.3.4. Advantages and limitationsTwo novel leaf-level imaging solutions, including high spectral reso-lution HSI and high spatial resolution MSI combined with machinelearning, were evaluated side-by-side for the ﬁrst time in detecting DED and screening genotypes for disease resistance in American elms.Results indicated that HSI had an advantage in detecting DED duringthe early stage of infection before disease symptoms were visible tohuman eyes. The rich spectral information provided by HSI couldpotentially capture plant early responses to the pathogen infection.Meanwhile, MSI combined with deep learning also showed an advan-tage in capturing symptomatic spots on the leaves once foliar diseasesymptoms appeared because of its high spatial resolution images. Theinnovative engineering design of LeafSpec, which includes an enclosedimaging chamber with embedded uniform light sources, ensured theimaging quality with a high signal-over-noise ratio and thus built a suc-cessful foundation for further machine learning-based analysis.On the other hand, we acknowledged that the current study hadsome limitations. Firstly, as a proof-of-concept study, the elm treesevaluated were grown under a controlled environment. Factors like dif-ferent light conditions, seasonal variations, or interactions with otherpathogens might inﬂuence the spectral signatures of the leaves.

The highlighted regions in each attention map were the most important regions in the image to predict DED infection.X. Wei, J. Zhang, A.O. Conrad et al.

32Secondly, only four genotypes of American elms were included in thisstudy due to logistical constraints. For future studies, it would be valu-able to explore a broader range of elm genotypes to further assess themodel's generalizability and validate models developed in this studyunder different environmental conditions, potentially enhancing its ap-plicability. By broadening the scope of evaluated elm genotypes andtesting in varied environmental settings, we believe there is immensepotential to reﬁne and extend the applicability of the proposed imagingsolutions that would pave the way for advanced, accurate, and ef ﬁcient DED detection and resistance screening in the future.4. ConclusionsIn the current study, high-resolution leaf images collected usingboth hyper and multi-spectral LeafSpec imagers combined with ma-chine learning were able to separate leaves from DED-infected andnon-infected trees, although accuracy varied depending on machinelearning model and time point following inoculation. Deep learningmodels that incorporate both spectral and spatial features of high-resolution spectral leaf images demonstrate superior performancethan traditional machine learning models built upon spectral featuresalone in detecting DED infection in American elm. Distinct leaf-levelspatial feature distributions were also observed between elm leavesfrom inoculated and mock-inoculated elm trees. Similar spectral andspatial patterns were found between elm genotypes with similar sus-ceptibility to DED after pathogen inoculation. Results demonstratethat machine learning-based spectral and spatial analysis of high-resolution hyper- and multi-spectral leaf images can detect DED and po-tentially be useful in screening for elm genotypes for susceptibility toDED. Though further studies are needed, these high-precision and por-table spectral leaf imagers combined with machine learning have dem-onstrated promising potential for accurate disease phenotyping in trees.DisclosureN/ACRediT authorship contribution statementXing Wei: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Formalanalysis, Software, Visualization, Project administration, Writing - orig-inal draft.Jinnuo Zhang: Data curation, Formal analysis, Software,Visualization, Writing–review & editing.Anna O.
