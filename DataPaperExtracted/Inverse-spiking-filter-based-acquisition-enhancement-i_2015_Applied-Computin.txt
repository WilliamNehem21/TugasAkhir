KEYWORDSGPS;Inverse spiking ﬁlter;Differential coherentdetection;Weak signalacquisitionAbstract The lower visibility of the satellite in the acquisition stage of a GPSreceiver under worst noisy situation leads to reacquisition of the data and therebytakes a longer time to obtain the ﬁrst position ﬁx. If the impulse noise affects theGPS signal, the conventional ways of acquiring the satellites do not guarantee tomeet the minimum requirement of four satellites to ﬁnd the user position. The per-formance of GPS receiver acquisition can be improved in the low SNR level usinginverse spiking ﬁltering technique. In the proposed method, the estimate of thedesired GPS L1 signal corrupted by impulse noise ( g

n) into a desired GPS signal (x n). In the proposed method, to detect thevisible satellites under weak signal conditions the traditional differential coherentapproach is combined with the inverse spiking ﬁlter method to increase the num-ber of visible satellites and to avoid the reacquisition process.

1. Introduction
At present GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) consists of two fullyoperational global systems, the United States’ global positioning system (GPS)and Russia’s GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS), as well asthe developing global and regional systems, namely Europe’s European SatelliteNavigation System (GALILEO), China’s COMPASS/Bei-Dou, India’s RegionalNavigation Satellite System (IRNSS) and Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System(QZSS). GPS is used in a large number of safety critical applications and hasbecome essential for precise timing reference and synchronization purpose intelecommunications networks (Zhu et al., 2010). GPS signal power levels areextremely low, due to the long satellite-receiver distance. The commercial GPSreceiver is easily affected by vulnerable effects of interference and noise. TheGPS receiver mounted on or inside manned or autonomous vehicles is easilyaffected by impulse noise caused by motor emissions. This leads to a drop inthe carrier power to noise density ratio. Hence, it is important to have aneffective method to detect and ﬁlter the noise. Spectral signal processing consistsof time and frequency excision, pulse blanking and pulse spiking techniqueswhich are used to prevent loss of lock caused by the effect of noise ( Borio et al., 2008).
The nominal power level of the received signal is only /C0158.5 dBW. The highest power density of the spread spectrum signal is/C0220 dBW/Hz where the nominalbackground noise level is approximately/C0205 dBW/Hz, i.e. the signal strength lies15 dB under the background noise level (Braasch and Van Dierendonck, 1999). A GPS signal below/C0158.5 dBW power level is categorized as a weak signal, sothere is a strong possibility of the cross-correlation peaks exceeding the autocor-relation peaks. This will ruin acquisition and reduce satellite availability. Thepre-detection integration time plays a vital role in signal detection and in deter-mining the feasible gain. This should be optimally selected to achieve the desiredacquisition sensitivity with the available processing power and to avoid false locks.Hence the detection threshold should be optimally chosen to avoid false lockswhich can be achieved by selecting a proper value of the false detection probability(Hu and Fang, 2010). To ﬁnd the weak signal, the approach is to increase the datalength. Three approaches based on the integration time namely coherent, non-coherent and differential coherent techniques are used during the weak signal14 G. Arul Elango et al.acquisition in order to improve the SNR. Dividing the set of input data intosmaller blocks then stripping the C/A code from the data and performing FFTbased parallel code phase search technique (performing an algebraic sum of thesignal) are known as coherent detection (Bao-Yen and Tusi, 2005). In the non coherent integration method, summing the data blocks of squared correlation val-ues of the acquisition process (performing an absolute sum of the signal) yieldsgood correlation. This increases the signal strength by a factor of 2 and noiseby
p2 thereby increasing the SNR by p2 or 1.5 dB (Deshpande et al., 2004). This improvement is less compared to the coherent integration method but requiresfewer operations. Also non-coherent integration is not affected by the navigationdata bit transition since the correlation results of the coherent integration time aresquared before summation. When the correlator output is multiplied with thecomplex conjugate of the successive correlator output this method is termed as dif-ferential coherent detection and thus by doing this a high degree of correlation isbeing maintained. Hence, the SNR loss in differentially combining detection is de-creased in comparison to non-coherent combining detection. Fallahi et al. (2012) calculated probability of detection and the ROC (Receiver Operating Character-istic) using coherent, non-coherent and differential detection at various power lev-els of GPS signal.
The typicalC/N 0value of a commercial GPS receiver is in between 37 and45 dB-Hz. In the noisy environment of analyzing the GPS signal, the traditionalmethods of coherent, non coherent and differential coherent ways of increasingthe integration time result in poor correlation. If the impulse noise distorts theGPS signal, the parallel code phase search acquisition performed for single msecdata works only forC/N
0up to 35 dB-Hz of the GPS receiver. Hence, it is quiteobvious to use the coherent integration method for the lower C/N
0in the range of 35 dB-Hz and the non-coherent integration method with C/N
0up to 30 dB-Hz (Deshpande et al., 2004). A longer coherent integration time means a smallerDoppler bin size which increases the number of the Doppler bins to be searched.The coherent integration time is limited by two factors, navigation data bit tran-sition and the Doppler effect on the C/A-code. A navigation data bit transitionwill spread the spectrum causing the output to be no longer a CW signal. Thisspectrum spreading will reduce the acquisition gain and distort the acquisitionpeak. An increase of 100 ms non coherent integration correlation can acquirethe signal havingC/N
0up to 25 dB-Hz. But all the above mentioned techniquescannot be applied for impulse noise affected GPS signal which has C/N
0less than 20 dB-Hz. In this paper, it is proposed to excise the impulse noise embedded in theGPS signal withC/N
0below 20 dB-Hz through the inverse spiking ﬁltering tech-nique. The structure of the paper is organized as follows. This section discusses theexisting methods available for weak signal acquisition. Section 2 describes themathematical formulation and theory of inverse spiking ﬁlter, Section 3 illustratesthe acquisition and tracking results of conventional and the proposed modiﬁeddifferential methods of processing the noisy GPS signal as well as MontecarloInverse spiking ﬁlter based acquisition enhancement 15simulation is also performed to conﬁrm the effectiveness of the acquisition pro-cess. Section 4 gives the conclusions.
2. Inverse spiking ﬁlter based noise excision in GPS receiver
In this section, the spiking inverse ﬁlter based noise excision is proposed for excis-ing the impulse noise. The received noisy GPS L1 signal which has a C/N
0below 20 dB-Hz is subjected to the spiking ﬁlter and the output of the spiking ﬁlter isgiven to the A/D converter with a sampling frequency of 11.999 MHz .If 1 msof data is analyzed, the number of samples can be found as 1/1000 of the samplingfrequency (11.999·10
6/1000 = 11,999 samples) with a single bit resolution (Bao- Yen and Tusi, 2005). The digitized data obtained after A/D is given as an input tothe acquisition process with peak search algorithm.(Mao et al., 2008).
The impulse noise (g n) and the GPS signal (x n) are related by the convolutionrelationship

The basic objective here is to recoverx nfrom impulse noise affected signaly n.
The spiking de-convolution (Mathew and Narayana Dutt, 1993) is proposed to compress the effect of impulse noise embedded in the GPS signal and to improvethe SNR value. The problem may be formulated as follows: To design a spikinginverse ﬁlterh
ncorresponding to the impulse noise functiong n, that is,h n\gn= d
n. In the least-squares sense ﬁlteringy nthroughh nwill recover the desired signal x
n. If the given record of available noisy GPS data isy n={y 0,y1,y2....,y N}, then the inverse spiking ﬁlter coefﬁcientsh
n={h 0,h1,h2....h M}, will reshapey n, into the desired GPS signalx={x
0,x1,x2....,x N}. The estimate of input signal isgiven by the convolution relationship (Orfanidis, 1988).

The steps involved in least-squares spiking ﬁlter design for a given signal y n, n=0 ,1...,N/C01 are summarized as follows:
1. Construct an autocorrelation matrix (YTY).2. Calculate all inverse ﬁlters through pseudo inverse of an autocorrelation matrix.3. Find i-th diagonal entry of a projection matrix which has maximum value.4. Obtain i-th ﬁlter i.e.h

Arul Elango et al.The performance of the spiking ﬁlter is determined by the diagonal values of theperformance matrixP. Based on the minimum mean square error value, the par-ticular diagonal entry has a maximum value that determines the rank of the matrix(Mathew and Narayana Dutt, 1993).
3. Experimental results
3.1. Software based GPS receiver acquisition performance assessment in the presenceof impulse noise
The GPS signal affected by the impulse noise with C/N 0of 20 dB-Hz is given to the proposed ﬁlter model. The ﬁltered data are passed through an acquisitionblock of peak search algorithm. As per the simulation parameters for the GPSL1 signal mentioned inTable 1, the acquisition performances are tested for threedifferent scenarios and the outputs are tabulated inTable 2. For all the 3 cases the peak algorithm proposed byMao et al. (2008)has been used. The threshold con-dition is set based on the maximum peak and the secondary peak values of thedecision statistic (S) in the acquisition process. The Threshold Condition usedfor simulation is given as the Correlation max Peak – Mean Peak > 0.96 andthe Max Peak – Secondary Peak > 0. 5. Based on this condition, the simulationis carried out for single msec data, and it is observed that the signal is absentdue to poor SNR and the typical parallel code phase search algorithm fails to de-tect the distinct peak. Hence longer msec data of coherent integration are used forimproving the SNR of the signal, but there is no signiﬁcant improvement in strip-ping the noise. On the other hand, even if non-coherent integration is performed,the acquisition success percentage does not improve due to the large false alarmpeaks. The minimum requirement of 4 visible satellites was not attained in bothcoherent and non coherent integration methods. Finally the spiking ﬁlter com-bined with the differential coherent detection method is tested and it is able to sup-press the impulse noise and able to locate more number of visible satellites. Table 2 shows the Satellite Vehicle Number (SVN) that is visible using the proposedmethod.

The spectrum of the retrieved signal resembles the original signal spectrum and the noisy signalpower spectral density as shown inFig. 2e and f.
The performance metric of the spiking ﬁlter is determined by the maximumdiagonal entry in a performance matrix or the error function (1 /C0P
ii) with respect to the order of the ﬁlter which is shown inFig. 3a and the impulse response of thespiking ﬁlter of order 50 is illustrated inFig. 3b.
The acquisition result of SVN-16 obtained by the conventional methods for sin-gle msec, coherent, non-coherent and differential coherent detection for the noisydata is shown inFig. 4.This depicts that the start of C/A code is not perfectlyaligned with the incoming signal C/A code due to the many cross correlation peaksthat exceed the autocorrelation peaks. So the above mentioned traditional meth-ods fail to detect the decision statistic or threshold condition of the visible satellite.Processing of single msec data results in worst correlation. Similarly analyzing ofcoherent and non-coherent detection also provides many cross correlation peaks.By comparing the outputs inFig. 4, the conventional differential coherentapproach gives a better performance of detecting SVN-16. Only 2 SVNs surpassthe threshold condition but minimum 4 SVNs are required to ﬁnd the userposition.
Next the same noisy data are tested with the spiking ﬁlter combined with differ-ential coherent detection (modiﬁed differential coherent). Increased visibility ofthe satellites [SVN 3, 9, 10, 13, 16, 23 and 30] in terms of distinct peak (perfectalignment with C/A code) is shown inFig. 5. This approach performs better com-pared to other traditional methods and ensures that the corrected code phase andDoppler frequency enhance the acquisition performance. The results of Table 3 show the visible satellites, their respective Doppler frequency and code phase.

Acquisition stage gives only a rough estimate of the frequency and code phase of asatellite signal. Hence it is required to reﬁne these values in order to conﬁrmwhether the acquired satellite metrics is correct or not i.e., code and carrier lockis achieved with the incoming signal to keep track and demodulate the navigationdata for a particular satellite. Thus to track a GPS signal, two tracking loops areused. One is code loop known as delay lock loop (DLL) or early-late tracking loopwhich is used to track the C/A code phase and the another one is phase-lockedloop (PLL) which is used to track the carrier frequency of the incoming signal withDoppler shift. Both loops are intercoupled. The impulse noise affected GPS signalis given as the input to the tracking module and in-phase and quadrature part of

Arul Elango et al.carrier replica with frequency 3.563 MHz is generated to wipe off the carrier fromthe input signal. The two equally spaced (±0.5 chip apart) early and late versionsC/A code of visible satellites [SVN 3, 9, 10, 13, 16, 23 and 30] acquired in theprevious section is generated and correlated with the incoming signal to producetwo outputs. These outputs are ﬁltered, squared and compared using an early-latenormalized envelope discriminator. The phase lock loop (PLL) comprises of anumerically controlled oscillator (NCO), carrier loop ﬁlter and a discriminator(Kaplan, 1996). The output of the DLL is a signal only modulated with thenavigation data, which is also used as the input to the PLL. The Costas loop isused for GPS signal tracking in the PLL stage. An arc tangent discriminator thatis insensitive to the phase transition of the navigation data bit transitions is used todetermine the phase shift in the carrier frequency (Kaplan, 1996).The tracking loop parameters used for simulation are listed inTable 4. Once the lock has been accomplished, the navigation data bits are extracted from the In-phase arm sincethe local carrier signal is in-phase with the incoming signal and all the energy willbe in ‘Ip’.Table 3Comparison of satellite information for traditional and modiﬁed differential coherent method.Traditional diﬀerential coherent (Fallahi et al., 2012;Mao et al., 2008) Modiﬁed diﬀerential coherentSVN Frequency DopplerfrequencyCode phasechipsSVN Frequency DopplerfrequencyCode phasechips 13 4,126,400 4000 449 3 4,126,400 4000 94916 4,133,800/C03400 410 9 4,128,400 2000 48210 4,134,200/C03800 20513 4,126,400 4000 39316 4,133,800/C03400 41023 4,130,000 400 52330 4,128,400 2000 227

Figure 6Performance comparison of various detection techniques.Inverse spiking ﬁlter based acquisition enhancement 25The impulse noise affected signal processed through traditional differentialdetection for SVN-3 is tested for tracking and the performance is given inFig. 7. SVN-3 is tested during the acquisition phase as this satellite does not satisfythe threshold condition and is an invisible satellite. Here the PLL and DLL errorsare not considerably reduced to the minimum extent. The input and referencesignals are not in-phase and theIpandQpvalues contain only noise. The demod-ulation of navigation data is not possible in this case due to loss of lock with theincoming signal and the tracking fails to demodulate the navigation data. Fromthe results we conclude that the noise is not effectively excised; so reacquisitionof GPS data is required.
The tracking operation is next tested for spiking ﬁlter combined with differen-tial detection. For this method, the carrier frequency settles after 100 ms periodand is shown inFig. 8a. It is inferred that lock has been achieved for the GPSsignal power level of 20 dB-Hz.

4. Conclusion
In this paper, a method based on the least square spiking ﬁlter is proposed toexcise the impulse noise in GPS receivers. From the results, it is evident that byreplacing the traditional differential coherent approach by least square spikingﬁlter, the detection of the number of visible satellites is increased and the reacqui-sition of GPS data is avoided. It is shown that coherent, non-coherent detectionshandle the GPS signal withC/N
