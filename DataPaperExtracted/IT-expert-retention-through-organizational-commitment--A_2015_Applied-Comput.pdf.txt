KEYWORDSOrganizationalcommitment;Pakistan;High technologyemployees;Compensation;Training anddevelopment;Supervisor support;IT professionals;Retention;Affectivecommitment;Normativecommitment;Abstract Organizational commitment has been studied extensively world overand hundreds of research articles are available however a few studies addressorganizational commitment in IT sector high technology employees. In Pakistaninsufﬁcient research is available speciﬁc to IT sector employees. The presentstudy is an attempt to better describe these factors which can induce organiza-tional commitment in Pakistani IT sector high technology employees.
Previous studies in different countries validate that compensation; training anddevelopment and supervisor support induce organizational commitment in hightechnology employees, which increases employee retention. These factors weretested in IT sector organizations in Pakistan, ﬁndings of present study estab-lished that in Pakistan for IT professional’s compensation, training and develop-ment and supervisor support is signiﬁcantly correlated with organizationalcommitment.

1. Introduction
Managing turn over is a increasing challenge especially for companies employinghigh technology professionals (Dockel, 2001). Managers have to bolster IT profes-sionals’ sense of self-worth by treating them as intellectual assets, not operatingexpenses, and by helping them shape and direct their careers, so they can gainexperience within the enterprise rather than outside it ( Pare´and Tremblay, 2000).
The above ﬁndings of some researches conducted on of high technology IT pro-fessionals validate that their retention is becoming difﬁcult for business managersand organizations are interested in ﬁnding out ways which can induce organiza-tional commitment in IT sector high technology employees and reduce turn over.The studies conducted in this regard found signiﬁcant relationships between orga-nizational commitment and employee retention factors like compensation, train-ing and development and supervisor support.Dockel (2001)conducted a research in this regard however this research was speciﬁc to telecom industryand South African working environment. Hence it cannot be applied globallyor in any other country like Pakistan.
Pakistan is a developing country with less opportunities due to which high tech-nology employees always try to avail a better opportunity that makes retention ofhigh technology employees more complex and difﬁcult job for a manager. Hencepresent study explains relationship of some signiﬁcant factors in Pakistani publicsector IT professionals, which can induce organizational commitment.
2. Review of literature
A number of articles were reviewed to study the importance of employee retention,organizational commitment with speciﬁc reference to high technology employeesIT sector. The literature review clearly establishes relation ship between factorslike Compensation, training and Development and Supervisor Support on Orga-nizational Commitment.
2.1. Compensation
Compensation has a strong and signiﬁcant relationship to organizational commit-ment (Dockel, 2001). Indeed, more an employee perceives a high level of internalequity (in comparison with other employees of the same department and/or thesame company) and external equity (in comparison with individuals occupyingIT-expert retention through organizational commitment 61a similar job in other organizations) in regard to issues such as compensation andbeneﬁts, performance evaluation, promotions, and mandates, the less they willintend to leave current employer (Pare´and Tremblay, 2000). Because of the high technology employees commitment to their team, group based pay may result inmore commitment to organization (Dockel, 2001). Earning was found to be notsigniﬁcant though it is positively related to continuance commitment ( Johns, 2005). Employees constantly review if their salary is still competitive ( Dockel, 2001). Those in the highest ranks calculate costs and beneﬁts, which may impacttheir thoughts of leaving (Moynihan et al., 2000).
In addition to above there are researches which suggest that one should notorganizations should not solely rely on compensation, e.g., A retention strategythat solely focuses on compensation conditions and beneﬁts is not likely to favorcommitment and loyalty of employees and offer any guarantee in satisfaction andretention. Further, such a strategy is not likely to compensate for the lack of pro-fessional recognition and chances of advancement and for a little stimulating ITjob (Pare´and Tremblay, 2000). While a focus on competitive pay packages toattract and retain talented cadres is clearly effective in manifesting job motivation,complimentary strategic HR practices are profoundly important in reducing staffturnover (Chew, 2005). Commitment stemming from economic and pragmaticconsiderations may actually lead to poor performance and leadership(Moynihan et al., 2000). Merely increasing wages will increase individual’s percep-tion of low alternatives but has no impact on improving the alignment of employeegoals with the organization (Iverson and Buttigieg, 1999).
These diverse ﬁndings highlight importance of compensation. It needs to betested whether organizational commitment in Pakistani IT professionals can solelybe induced through compensation or there are some other factors in addition tocompensation. However literature review strongly establishes relationship betweenorganizational commitment and compensation. Hence in present study Compen-sation is one of the independent variable and its relationship with Organizationalcommitment will be seen in the ﬁndings.
H1: Compensation is signiﬁcantly and positively related to OrganizationalCommitment
2.2. Training and development
Employee development programs play a signiﬁcant role in job satisfaction whichhelps lead to retention (Shelton, 2001). Training, development opportunities andcareer opportunities were not found to have direct impact of organizational com-mitment in high technology industry This ﬁnding is contrary to many other ﬁnd-ings in high technology industry (Dockel, 2001). Training is too often seen as aperk when it should be seen as essential investment in the intellectual capital of62 S.M.M.R. Naqvi, S. Bashirthe organization. This is true in every professional ﬁeld, but is perhaps more acutein IT (Pare´and Tremblay, 2000). Proper training of managers and supervisors torecognize proﬁle of each individual coupled with training in how to turn aroundperception that the organization controls can considerably improve retentionefforts (Rossi, 2000). Organizations should have a process for encouraging, plan-ning and investing in high technology employee’s professional development(Dockel, 2001). Training, support for training and motivation to learn were signif-icantly and positively associated with overall commitment and its types, i.e., affec-tive commitment and normative commitment (Ahmad and Bakar, 2003).
Thus Training and Development has emerged as one of important independentvariable having relationship with organizational commitment. Hence it is taken inthe present research and its impact on organizational commitment in Pakistani ITprofessionals will be tested.
H2: Training & Development is signiﬁcantly and positively related to Organiza-tional Commitment
2.3. Supervisor support
Indeed, it seems that a successful employee whose work performance is recognizedby his superiors and his peers will tend to do more than what is formally requiredof him (Pare´and Tremblay, 2000). For high technology employees supervisor sup-port gives them a chance to make difference on job, try out new skills and receivefeed back on performance (Dockel, 2001). Employees emotional attachment to,identiﬁcation with, and involvement in the organization is positively related tosupervisor care and concerns about their employees, opinion, values and generalwell being (Soulen, 2003). The perception of the employees that the organizationdoes support them is with strongest positive correlation with affective commitment(Mayer et al., 2002) where as supervisor relationships had a more and strongerrelationship to turnover intention (Raabe and Beehr, 2003). These ﬁndings are suf- ﬁcient to argue that supervisor support is strongly related with organizationalcommitment and due to its relationship it is one of the independent variablesand its relationship with organizational commitment will be tested in PakistaniIT professionals.
H3: Supervisor Support is signiﬁcantly and positively related to OrganizationalCommitment
But while seeing the relationship of these factors it is important to note thatretention is not for every one. For example one research suggests that would bea mistake to believe that organizations should attempt to retain each and everyemployee-especially in today’s economic turmoil. The challenges that confrontmangers are therefore not only how to minimize the possibility of loosing goodIT-expert retention through organizational commitment 63employees, but also how to identify the employees and organization needs andwants to keep (Kreisman, 2002).
All the above literature review identiﬁed three important independent variablesand all of them have relationship with the dependent variable Organizational com- mitment. It is the employee’s emotional attachment, identiﬁcation with, andinvolvement in a particular organization. The major contribution in deﬁning orga-nizational commitment and its components is byAllen and Meyer (1990)who have described three types of Organizational commitment as affective, normativeand continuance. All three forms of organizational commitment are negativelycorrelated with withdrawl cognition, turnover intention and turn over ( Mayer et al., 2002). Managers must keep in mind that IT specialists who identify them-selves and feel emotionally attached to their organization and/or work unit arethose who risk least to leave (Pare´and Tremblay, 2000). Organizational commit- ment was revealed to be negatively related to turnover intentions ( Lee, 2000). Affective commitment constitutes the primary predictor of turnover intentions.IT specialists grant a lot of importance for the alignment between their own valuesand those conveyed by management and they look for a work environment ormilieu which will allow them to develop a strong feeling of belonging ( Pare´and Tremblay, 2000). Job involvement, Organizational commitment are negativelyrelated to turn over intention (Sjoberg and Sverke, 2000). Organizations that focus on different retention strategies that tap into different mind sets of commitmentmight have a better chance of retaining key employees ( Irving et al., 2002). The organizational commitment has also macro level implications. Organizations withweak commitment are often less productive and if this occurs broadly throughouta number of organizations then quality of products and services may decline(Johns, 2005). Thus research on organizational commitment can also specifycauses of low quality products in Pakistan (Fig. 1).

Figure 1Theoretical framework showing relationship between independent and dependent variables.64 S.M.M.R. Naqvi, S. Bashirnaire was based on well tested questionnaire like Allen and Myers Organizationalcommitment questionnaire (OCQ).Dockel (2001)used similar questionnaire toﬁnd out the Organizational Commitment in high technology employees in SouthAfrica. The questionnaire with some modiﬁcations as per local requirements ofPakistan was used. Since the questionnaire was successfully used in previous stud-ies and well tested by researchers on internal consistency and other measures hencein the present study the same questionnaire was used to test the level of organiza-tional commitment in Pakistani IT sector professionals. Participants had to indi-cate their agreement with each item on ﬁve point Likert scales (endpoints:1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree).
Questionnaires were printed and given to the heads of the respective humanresources departments of each organization. Participation was anonymous to havean impartial opinion. The questionnaires were accompanied by a covering letterexplaining the conﬁdentiality and importance of this research.
3.2. Participants
There are a number of public sector IT organizations in Pakistan out of whichnine IT organizations were selected in this study.

4. Results
4.1. Characteristics of target population
Although these selected organizations employed thousands of employees but theprofessional Information Technology employees were in limited numbers. A totalof 85 IT professionals were serving in these organizations and due to their limitednumber whole population was taken as sample. Out of these respondents 77responded making response rate 90%. Keeping in view the limited number ofIT professionals in public sector organizations the sample is sufﬁcient for analysisof various results.
4.2. Discussion and ﬁndings4.2.1. Discussion and ﬁndings (Table 1)
Most of the respondents were male and they constituted 82% of the total popula-tion. Being a relatively new ﬁeld in Pakistan the number of female IT professionalsis low in Pakistani organizations.Table 7Frequency: involvement in salary related issues.Involvement Frequency PercentageYes 10 13No 67 87Total 77 100

Most of the respondents were young and more than 60% were between the age of25–35 years.4.2.3. Discussion and ﬁndings (Table 3)
The frequencies of qualiﬁcation show that 77% of the respondents possess mastersor higher qualiﬁcation. The reason for this percentage is that only High Technol-ogy IT professionals were included in this study. This is also a reason why totalsample size was 77 out of thousands of employees. Many respondents also possessprofessional IT certiﬁcations (not shown in this table).4.2.4. Discussion and ﬁndings (Table 4)
Majority of respondents (64%) are married. Thus majority of the respondentshave spouse and children responsibilities as well.4.2.5. Discussion and ﬁndings (Table 5)
The ﬁndings inTable 5indicate that 44.2% of the respondents have shown theirnative language as Urdu which is also the national language of Pakistan. Punjab isthe biggest province of Pakistan and 27.3% respondents have shown their nativelanguage as Punjabi. Some foreign nationals are also working in these IT organi-zations showing their native language as English.4.2.6. Discussion and ﬁndings (Table 6)
As already highlighted atTable 2most of the respondents are young.Table 7 regarding tenure indicate that 61% respondents have a tenure up to four yearsin their respective organizations. Thus study gives a better understanding of levelof organizational commitment of young IT professionals in Pakistan.4.2.7. Discussion and ﬁndings (Table 7)
The purpose ofTable 7is to have an idea about involvement of IT professionals inimportant issues like salary. The results indicate that level of IT professionalsinvolvement is just 13% and the organizations are taking important decisionsabout IT professionals without involving them.
4.3. Inter correlation of the variables
The Pearson correlation ﬁndings show that all the Independent variables, i.e., Pay,Supervisor support and Training and Development are positively and signiﬁcantlyrelated to Organizational Commitment.68 S.M.M.R. Naqvi, S. Bashir4.3.1. Discussion and ﬁndings (Table 8)
Out of different demographics age and tenure were used to ﬁnd out if they have anyimpact on the level of organizational commitment of IT professionals in Pakistan.The discussion forTables 2 and 6indicate that, majority of the respondents wereyoung having up to four years tenure in their respective organizations. Accordingto correlation analysis age has no signiﬁcant relationship with Organizational com-mitment in IT professionals that shows that the age has no effect because thebehavior pattern regarding commitment is the same because all of the equally waitfor better opportunities in a developing country like Pakistan (0.105). This argu-ment is further strengthened by the correlation value of organizational tenure(0.021) which is insigniﬁcant and shows no matter how long a professional is withthe organization when ever a better opportunity is around it will be availed. Thesevalues indicate that IT professional’s organizational commitment in Pakistan hasweak link with age and tenure, i.e., with more experience within the organizationsand increase in age organizational commitment remains un-affected. Dockel (2001) argues age and tenure are not correlated with any form of commitment. Similarlythese ﬁndings are also supported byMathebula (2004)who found no correlation between organizational commitment and demographics like age and tenure.
According to Correlation Analysis Compensation has a signiﬁcant relationshipwith organizational commitment (0.30
**,**p< 0.01).Dockel (2001)also found a signiﬁcant relationship between Compensation and overall Organizational Com-mitment (0.37
**,**p< 0.01). Thus results are supported byDockel (2001). Johns (2005)also found positive relationship between earning and continuancecommitment, however it was not signiﬁcant. However the response from the ITprofessionals in the questionnaires indicated that majority IT professionals werenot satisﬁed with their salary structure. As highlighted in Table 7about 87% of IT professionals feel that they are not involved in salary related issues. Thus thePublic sector organizations make decisions about different salary related issuedof IT professionals without involving them which can be a major cause for theirdissatisfaction with salary. Being the backbones of public sector IT organizationsthey must be involved in incentive schemes to increase their level of OrganizationalCommitment and retention in these organizations.
The relationship between Supervisor support and organizational commitment isalso signiﬁcant (0.340
**,**p< 0.01).Dockel (2001)also found a relationshipbetween Supervisor Support and overall Organizational Commitment (0.36
**,
**p< 0.01). The IT professional feel that they are praised on positive performanceby their boss. They are provided with a feed back on their performance. The ﬁnd-ings are supported byDockel (2001)andSoulen (2003).Raabe and Beehr (2003) also found a negative relationship between supervisor support and turnover inten-tion. Recognition on job well done intrinsically motivates individuals so the orga-nizations should take such steps that IT professionals are not under valued.Moreover organizations should devise a mechanism so that efforts of ITIT-expert retention through organizational commitment 69professionals towards organizational objectives are acknowledged and seen posi-tively by the supervisors.
The relationship between Training and development and organizational com-mitment is also signiﬁcant (0.349
**,**p< 0.01). These ﬁndings are supported byShelton (2001)butDockel (2001)did not found a signiﬁcant relationship thoughit was positive. The response from questionnaire indicate that the IT professionalsfeel they are not being provided the job related training and sufﬁcient time is notallocated for this training. These professionals are working in an industry wherenew technology is replacing the existing technology quite swiftly and training isthe only way through which these professionals can update their knowledge aboutthe new technologies. Hence the organizations should devise a detailed trainingprogram after necessary need assessment and allocate sufﬁcient time for trainingof these professionals.
5. Conclusion
Majority of the studies were conducted measuring the relationship of three com-ponents of organizational commitment, i.e., Normative, Continuance and affec-tive components with different variables such as pay, Job characteristics,Supervisor support etc. and some also found the relationship between organiza-tional commitment and these factors as a whole. Since no such study was con-ducted on Information Technology (IT) professional in Pakistan the studyfound the relationship of three variables, i.e., Pay, Supervisor support and Train-ing and Development on Organizational commitment as whole.
The ﬁrst hypothesis of present study was that compensation is signiﬁcantly andpositively related to organizational commitment. From the above discussions andsigniﬁcant correlation values it is established that among high technology IT pro-fessionals in Pakistan compensation is signiﬁcantly and positively related to orga-nizational commitment. Thus hypothesis one is established.
The second hypothesis intended to ﬁnd out positive and signiﬁcant relation shipbetween organizational commitment and training and development. The ﬁndingsclearly indicate that training is signiﬁcantly and positively related to organiza-tional commitment. Hence hypothesis two is also established.
The third hypothesis of the study was that supervisor support is signiﬁcantlyand positively related to Organizational Commitment. The results obtained bycorrelation analysis clearly establishes the hypothesis that supervisor support issigniﬁcantly and positively related to Organizational Commitment.
In their conclusion,Pare´and Tremblay (2000)argued that IT specialists shouldnot be managed as disposable productive resources but considered as humans withspeciﬁc needs and interests such as equity and justice, opportunity to learn andinnovate, recognition of peers and managers, attainment of new levels of respon-sibility, and empowerment. We support this statement with the view that the roleof IT professionals is becoming increasingly important for organizations through70 S.M.M.R. Naqvi, S. Bashirout the world and in Pakistan as well. The business mangers should devise suchHR policies that these professionals ﬁnd them at a place where they have a com-pensation package which is competitive to any other organization. IT profession-als must be provided trainings frequently not only for their personal developmentbut also to gain the competitive advantage through latest technologies. The super-visors of these IT professionals should recognize that managing IT professionals isdifferent than other professionals; they should be involved in decision making toincrease level of organizational commitment.
It is also important to note that many developed countries are offering attrac-tive immigrations to IT professionals at priority which is causing a brain drainfrom Pakistan. Based on above ﬁndings immediate measures are required at theGovernment level for retention of this intellectual capital not only in the organi-zations but also in Pakistan.
6. Future studies
The literature review indicated that there a number of other factors which affectOrganizational Commitment of IT professionals. The following future studiesare recommended:
(i) Factors like Job characteristics, Career opportunities and Work life Policesetc can also be used to see their relationship with organizational commitment.(ii) A larger sample from different cities of Pakistan can also be collected forsame study.(iii) A large number of IT professionals are working in Private sector. Theirresponse on similar variables can be obtained to have a comparison of levelof organizational commitment of Public sector and private sector IT profes-sionals in Pakistan.
