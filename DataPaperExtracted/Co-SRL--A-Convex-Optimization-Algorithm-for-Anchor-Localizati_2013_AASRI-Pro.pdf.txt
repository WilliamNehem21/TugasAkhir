Currently, there are mainly the range based localizati on methods and the range free localization methods in wireless networks. The rangebased localization met hods as proposed in [10][8][4], localize nodeswith property measurement.On the other hand, the rangefree localizationmethods proposed in [5][2][3][9]localize anchors without property measurement. We can tolerate th at the website with bad content such as sex and violence are banned for the common good of society[5], but it may be a big pity that some websites with academic disputations are banned so not reachable only for political reason. [6]Moreover, one path may be broken down resulting in some websites not available to certain people, but actually they can still visit the webs after many attempts of trying other way only if the websites have other paths. In addition, sometimes though the websites are still available to us, we can always find a best way, i.e. with the highest speed to use.In one word, we need a put up way which can make the accessibility of the wireless sensor network more robust with better performance.  In fact, there are many papersthat study the localizationproblems in sensor networks using optimization method. For example,[3] described localization informa tion distributing propagation methods.[10]gave a time a localization discovery method in wireless sensornetwo rks.The Co-SRL system is answer we find. In Co- SRL, there is not any center server, and only a register server generate identifications for the nodes who want to join the system, but not one is responsible for mon itoring the behaviors single nodes. When strange nodes come to certain nodes and request for service, the requested nodes make their own opinions on response positively or negatively, according to their knowledge of the coming nodes. This paper is arranged as follows: In section 2, we fi rst introduce some basic principles of localization in wireless sensor networks and the optimization method, and then talk about the Co-SRL. In section 3, we present the simulation results of Co-SRL.And fina lly, we give the conclusion of this paper. 2. The Algorithm of Co-SRL For each of the specific sub-problems, the problem specific assumptions will be presented when the problem itself is presented. The sensor network is ൌሼ ܵ
௜ǡൌͳǡڮǡሽrandomlydeployed. ܵ௜is an anchor, and 
ݏ௜ሺݏ௜ൌሺ ݏ௜௫ǡݏ௜௬ሻሻ is the position set of  ܵ௜. Both the mobile target and all communications between different anchors are bidirectional.  This paper gave a convex optimizationbased method to he lp node to localize anchors, given that at most M of them are malicious in a network. Our enhanced  protocol, named Advanced Distance Bounding (AAD) protocol uses the high-speedDBtechnique.By Using of AAD, it can preventfrom many network attacks aiming at wireless sensor networks such as wormhole attacks [1],Sybil attack [1] and Distance reduction attacks etc., because in this case, malicious anchorswith faked position information will be detectedimmediately by a Malicious Node. Why? The reason can be seen as follows. Basically, we use the convex optimizationtechnique for the Malicious Node position estimation. As shownabove, if there existmeasurementnegative errorsthe intersection region 
௧ of the disks  ௧௜ may be empty. The disk  
௧௜ corresponds to the circle drawn with the position of anchor ௜being served the center and the distance between
௜and the target t as the radius. In this case, it will result in the increased distance estimation

In fact, it means that we use a common factor Ⱦtosimultaneously shrink௧௜ᇱ (all disks), as much as possible, it only need to ensure that there exist at least one member in the intersection among the disks. The first N constraints in equation (4.1) can ensure the condition of non-empty intersectionamong the disks. The objective function as shown in equation (4.1) is to maximize

Algorithm 1: The optimization algorithm In this research, it is assumed that the malicious node 
௧ has adequate ability to perform the localizationoperations in Algorithm 1. Otherwise, if it cannot perform the localization operations, then the anchors can perform the localization operations. 3. Simulation Results The proposed methodhas been implementedusingthe Matlab software. We apply the algorithm into the design the Co-SRLsystem which is an application overl ay of the physical networks. It is constructed by the nodes and their accessible parts of the Internet. every peer in the system is a proxy which voluntarily relay the traffic of pass through it . Each node of Co-SRLis composed of 4 subsystems: The Functional-Module, the Calculation-Engine, the Friends-List and the Evaluati on-Engine. Where, the Functional-Module is used for transferring traffic, registering and other functions. Our policy model for admission control is implemented in the calculation engine. When a new node comes, the calculate engine is responsible to calculate its trust value Algorithm 1. The optimization method to obtain an approximation to the geometric center 1: Initialize x, LM
