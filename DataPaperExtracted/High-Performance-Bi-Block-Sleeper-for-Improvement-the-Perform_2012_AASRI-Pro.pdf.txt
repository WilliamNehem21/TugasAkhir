On field experiences, which were carried out in Italy on traditional lines and employed the diagnostic trains “Archimedes” and “Taletes”, allowed to point out that  92.6% of the track alignment faults and 82.6% of superelevation faults occur in line sections with a non-void curvature (circular curves, clothoids and cubic parabolas) [4]. This can be due to the high lateral stresses in  the track as trains pass by owing to the centrifugal force, which in the long run cause sleepers to be weakly clamped to the ballast with consequent variations in the original geometry of the track. In order to face these problems, whose solution can be reached only through frequent ordinary and/or extraordinary maintenance activities with high financial costs and deterioration in service levels for users (due to the necessity, for instance, to reduce the speed on faulty lines or to interrupt lines for maintenance work), a new ra ilway sleeper was designed, planned and patented, called “HP-BB” (High Performance Bi-Block sleeper) [5], [6]. It is a reinforced concrete bi-block sleeper equipped with two lateral stoppers with a “clamping action”. The sleeper, whose dimensions are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, provides the lateral actions with high resistance values under conditions of well-compacted and degraded ballast, as emerged by the analyses performed and better described later.

2.  Evaluation of  lateral sliding resistance  The railway sleepers should be tightly clamped into the ballast body so as to provide the sliding with high resistance values both lengthwise and crosswise. In particular, the specific lateral sliding resistance 
0 influences the critical load value P
crit, the latter being the theoretical minimum axial load value which gives rise to the track “twist”. Assuming a track initially  deformed by a sinusoid with an amplitude f
o and a wavelength L, a track “frame” characterized by a deflecti onal stiffness which is evaluated on the horizontal plane equal to EI, is able to stand an axial load P
crit given from the following equation [2]:  
fEIPcrit     (1)  Equation 1 shows the proportionality between the critical load P
crit and the specific lateral sliding resistance 
0; therefore, a track marked by high values of 0 is able to successfully stand thermal as well as lateral and longitudinal actions generated from railway carriages . The specific lateral resistance values, in case of an unladen track, are equal to 
0 = 11 kN in mono-block sleepers and 0 = 14 kN in bi-block sleepers. The evaluation of the lateral resistance of a railway sleepe r can be carried out through two different criteria: the former, empirical, involves in situ tests with an unladen track; the latter, theoretical, involves the assessment of the resistance of the single element-girder thought as independent of the other elements forming the track frame through specific mathematical models. In order to adopt  the latter approach it is required [1], [7]: 
 To set the friction angle of the ballast which, under condition of aggregates obtained from crushed stony rock with solid elements in low porosity and with sharp corners, can be assumed as equal to 
’ = 45°; 
 To set the specific weight of the ballast which un der ordinary conditions can be evaluated as 15 kN/m3.  The comparative evaluation of the performances provided by traditional sleepers and by a HP-BB sleeper is here made by taking two limit conditions into consideration: 
 condition A: ballast in good condition ( ’ = 45°). In this case the friction angle between ballast and sleeper assumes such values which can be estimated through the relation 
’w = 2/3 ’; 
 condition B: degraded ballast ( ’ = 35°). In this case, precautionarily the value of the friction angle can be set as 
’w = 1/3 ’.  3. Performances of a HP-BB sleeper and comparison with traditional sleepers In order to establish the behaviour of the new sleeper it is hypothesized that a lithostatic stress distribution is determined in the ballast. Under the conditions of incipient motion the total sliding resistance of the sleeper can be obtained from the sum of the elementary resistances offered by each component of the same sleeper and developing under each part of the structure deno ted with letters “b” and/or “B” (see Table1). From the equilibrium conditions [3] are obtained the following expressions which give the lateral sliding resistance of sleepers S whenever there are variations in their geometrical parameters, the mechanical properties of the railway ballast and the weight force (P) transmitted to each sleeper:
