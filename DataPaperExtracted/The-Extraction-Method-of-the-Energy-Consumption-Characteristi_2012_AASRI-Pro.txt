1. Introduction The large coal-fired power generation system was com posed of many complex subsystems, and there were high-dimensional nonlinear associative relationships am ong various operating parameters. To determine the relationships among parameters under different operating conditions, and reconstruct the system operating state, thus the optimum controllable parameters of th e boundary condition can be obtained, and then the operation optimization strategies can be formulated. All of this can be summarized as the analysis of complex systems modeling.

 different levels of systems, processes and unit equipmen ts of the large coal-fired generating units was obvious. At the same time, there were strong relationships be tween the power generation energy consumption and the environment, resources, loads.  As the main way of energy production, large-scale coal -fired units, including (ultra) supercritical units, will bear rapid peak regulation operation, frequent change of working conditions in long time, stand the test of factors such as complex coal quality, the cold junction and environment etc. Its en ergy consumption level has distinct time-varying characteristics. Considering the characteristics of large coal-fired generating units, as well as the coupling effects of external factors, it was an important foundation of achieving energy saving of coal-fired power generation process to reveal the sp atial and temporal distribution of unit energy consumption within the scope of total working conditions. Howeve r, due to the characteristics such as mechanism complexity, nonlinear, time-varying, large time delay, strong coupling, uncertainties and random disturbances of the equipment, systems and process, the tradition al mechanism modeling method was difficult to establish the exact energy consumption space-time distribution model. The data in unit generating process database can re flect the operating conditions and characteristics of operating variables, process equipment and process dire ctly or indirectly, and the data mining technology provides a powerful tool for knowledge discovery in d atabases. From the vast amounts of data, it can dig out useful information and knowledge, thus the powerful decision supports for the energy consumption online monitoring of large-scale coal-fired units, optimization of energy-saving operation and management can be provide. In response to these characteristics, features were extracted from real data of thermal power units though attribute reduction method based on fuzzy rough set (FRS ) in basis of data mining technology in the paper. The relationship was analyzed among variables, between variables and energy consumption distributes, to reduce attribute table, drop redundant data. That provides  the important research base for real unit energy consumption characteristics analysis in depth. 2. Fuzzy rough sets theory Classical rough set theory proposed by Pawlak, was us ed to depict the incompleteness and uncertainty. It can classify information which was inaccurate, inconsistent and incomplete for effectively, and discover hidden knowledge, reveal the potential law. The function of knowledge classification of the rough set theory was achieved through attribute reduction. Attributes (characteristics) of the information system was not equally important, or even some of the attributes was redundant. The system will be mostly simplified  by reducing attribute of knowledge in maintaining the system’s ability of classification, deleting irrelevant or unimportant attribute knowledge to extract the most relative characteristics and variation of the properties.  The following was the relevant definition of the reduction of knowledge in rough set theory. Information system S=<U, CĤD, V, f >, U was a non-empty objects set; C and D were the properties sets. Namely the condition attribute set was C and decision attribute set was D; V was a set of attribute value ; f was an information function. namely f ˖U×(CĤD)→V. It specifies the object's property values of U in each group. In the given knowledge base K= (U, S), U was universe of discourse, S was the equivalence relation clusters on U. Then for each subset XكU and equivalence relation RęIND (K),  R*(X) =
Ĥ {xęU :[x]RكX}                                                                                                         (1) X was R’s lower approximation.        The dependence of two attribute sets between C and D was defined as 144   Zhao Ming et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  142 – 149 
 γC(D)=|POSC(D)|/|U|                                                                                                                   (2) POSC(D)=C*(D)˗|U| represents the entire collection of the number of objects. For the condition attributes aięC, ai on the importance of D was defined as γai (D)= γC(D)- γC-{ai } (D)                                                                                                         (3) The classical rough set theory can only deal with di screte or symbol-based property information system. The large-scale coal-fired unit energy consumption decision table (Table 2) based on the unit's actual operating data (shown in Table 1) was continuous real-val ue in this paper, and they need to be reduced by attribute discretization methods. But the discretization process will bound to lose some important information to have a negative impact on the classification results.  Therefore, the reduction method based on fuzzy rough set theory attributes were adopted in the paper, fuzzy sets were used to replace the precise set, the fuzzy similarity relation was introduced to instead equivalence relations on the universe of discourse, the classical rough set theory was extended to fuzzy rough sets.

the dependence γC(D) of two attribute sets between C and D was defined as  γC(D)=|POSC(D)|/|U|                                                                                                                            (8) 
To find out the importance of certain attributes, the heuristic algorithm was adopted. Properties were 
added one by one, and then changes investigated. If the corresponding changes were great after adding 
attribute in the classification, that was high important; on the contrary, that was low. 146   Zhao Ming et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  142 – 149 
 The importance of attribute Ci on D was defined as:  γai (D)= γC+{ai } (D)-γC(D)                                                                                                                 (9) 
γC+{ai } (D) was the dependence of condition attribute r elative to decision attribute after adding attribute ai,. 
If γai (D) = 0ˈso the attribute ai can be removed from the attr ibute set. It can be obtained a relationship 
between the condition attributes and decision attributes, an d the set of {Ci} which plays a decisive role in the 
properties of the decision-making for D can be extrac ted , namely the energy consumption characteristics 
(referred to here as ‘energy label’) can be extracted. 3. Attribute reduction algorithm based on fuzzy rough set  
The data in the paper was collected from the pansha n power plant, Unit No. 3, 3250 data points total from 
March 2006 to May 2006. The 2260 controllable sample points were got though quasi-steady-state test, error 
and redundant data elimination, and other data de-noising and cleaning process. The energy consumption of a 
decision table was shown in Table 2. The decision tab le consists of 54 condition attributes (including 
controllable variables and uncontrollable variables) and one decision attribute (select supply coal consumption 
for decision-making attributes). The date of the unit energy consumption decision-making table, in order to 
eliminate the dimensionless impact, was normalized such as the type of the data shown in (10).

Theoretical verification of the results Plant system was a complex thermal system composed of many subsystems (equipment) which connected by specific way, working under multi-boundary conditions, completing the process of energy conversion thermal energy to mechanical energy and ultimately to electricity. Thermal system with specific device structures, ma terial properties and system structures conducts the process of combustion, heat transfer, mass transfer and flow through each device inside and shows corresponding running state parameters in the cons trained conditions such as  uncontrollable boundary conditions (such as power generation load, the local me teorological conditions, coal quality, etc.), controllable boundary conditions (such as the turbine initial operatin g parameter, circulating water flow, boiler primary or second air flow, etc.),system structures and device ch aracteristics. These state parameters were ultimately expressed as the thermal and economic performance indicators of the unit’ s thermal efficiency or power consumption rate.
