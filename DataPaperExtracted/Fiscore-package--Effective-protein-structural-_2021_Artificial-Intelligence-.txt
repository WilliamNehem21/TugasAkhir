The lack of bioinformatics  tools to quickly assess protein conformational  and topological  features  motivated  to create an integrative  and user-friendly  R package.  
Moreover,  the Fiscore package  implements  a pipeline  for Gaussian  mixture modelling  making such machine  learning  methods  readily accessible  to non-experts.  This 
is especially  important  since probabilistic  machine  learning  techniques  can help with a better interpretation  of complex  biological  phenomena  when it is necessary  
to elucidate  various structural  features  that might play a role in protein function.  Thus, Fiscore builds on the mathematical  formulation  of protein physicochemical  
properties  that can aid in drug discovery,  target evaluation,  or relational  database  building.  In addition,  the package  provides  interactive  environments  to explore 
various features  of interest.  Finally, one of the goals of this package  was to engage structural  bioinformaticians  and develop more robust and free R tools that could 
help researchers  not necessarily  specialising  in this ﬁeld. Package  Fiscore (v.0.1.3)  is distributed  free of charge via CRAN and Github. 
1. Introduction  
Fiscore R package  was developed  to quickly  take advantage  of protein  
topology/conformational  feature assessment  and perform  various  anal- 
yses allowing  a seamless  integration  into relational  databases  as well as 
machine  learning  pipelines  [1] . The package  builds on protein  structure  
and topology  studies which led to the derivation  of the Fi-score  equa- 
tion capturing  protein  dihedral  angle and B-factor  inﬂuence  on amino 
acid residues  (Eqs. (1) and (2)) [1] . The introduced  tools can be very 
beneﬁcial  in rational  therapeutics  development  where successful  engi- 
neering  of biologics,  such as antibodies,  relies on the characterisation  
of potential  binding  or contact  sites on target proteins  [1,2] . Moreover,  
translating  structural  data into scores can help with target classiﬁcation,  
target-ligand  information  storage,  screening  studies,  or integration  into 
machine  learning  pipelines  [1,2] . As a result, Fi-score,  a ﬁrst-of-its-kind  
in silico protein  ﬁngerprinting  approach,  created  a premise  for the devel- 
opment  of a specialised  and freely distributed  R package  to assist with 
protein  studies and new therapeutics  development  [1] . 
Fiscore package  allows capturing  dihedral  angle and B-factor  eﬀects 
on protein  topology  and conformation.  Since these physicochemical  
characteristics  could help with the identiﬁcation  or characterisation  of a 
binding  pocket or any other therapeutically  relevant  site, it is important  
to extract and combine  data from structural  ﬁles to allow such informa-  
tion integration  [1,3,4] . Protein  dihedral  angles were selected  as they 
contain  information  on the local and global protein  structural  features  
where protein  backbone  conformation  can be highly accurately  recre- 
ated based on the associated  dihedral  angles [1,4] . Furthermore,  since 
Ramachandran  plot, which provides  a visualisation  for dihedral  angle 
distributions,  namely  𝜙(phi) and 𝜓(psi), allows only a holistic  descrip-  
tion of conformation  and cannot be integrated  with traditional  para-

formation  was required  to use this data. An additional  parameter,  specif- 
ically the oscillation  amplitudes  of the atoms around their equilibrium  
positions  (B-factors)  in the crystal structures,  was also used. B-factors  
encompass  a lot of information  on the overall biomolecule  structure;  
for example,  these parameters  depend  on conformational  disorder,  ther- 
mal motion paths, and the rotameric  state of amino acids side-chains.  
B-factors  also show dependence  on the three-dimensional  structure  as 
well as protein  ﬂexibility  [1,4] . Normalised  dihedral  angles (standard  
deviation  scaling to account  for variability  and distribution)  and scaled 
B-factors  (min-max  scaling)  (Eq. (1)) were integrated  into the Fi-score  
equation  (Eq. (2)). It is important  to highlight  that B-factors  need to be 
scaled so that diﬀerent  structural  ﬁles can be compared  and that the di- 
hedral angle normalisation  transforms  angular  data into adjusted  values 
based on the overall variability  [1] . Thus, combining  dihedral  angle and 
B-factor  values into a single parameter  provides  a way to extract infor- 
mation on individual  residues,  residue  clusters,  motifs, and structural  
features.  This information  can be eﬃciently  transferred  into machine  
learning  to detect data characteristics  not easily identiﬁable  otherwise.

In order to identify  meaningful  clusters  based on the structural  com- 
plexity,  Gaussian  mixture  models (GMM)  were selected  as a primary  
machine  learning  classiﬁer  [1] . The strength  of GMM lies in the proba- 
bilistic model nature since all data points are assumed  to be derived  from 
a mixture  of a ﬁnite number  of Gaussian  distributions  with unknown  
parameters  [1,5] . Consequently,  the soft classiﬁcation  of GMM where 
a data point has a probability  of belonging  to a cluster is much more 
suitable  to assess biological  parameters  compared  to other hard classiﬁ-  
cation techniques  in machine  learning,  such as k-means,  which provide  
only a strict separation  between  classes.  GMM pipeline  oﬀers a number  
of beneﬁts  to categorise  protein  structural  features  and the information  
can be used to explore  amino acid grouping  based on their physico-  
chemical  parameters.  The designed  GMM implementation  takes care of 
the information  criterion  assessment  to ﬁne tune the number  of clusters  
for modelling  and predicts  the best suited model for the expectation-  
maximisation  (EM) algorithm  to maximise  the likelihood  of data point 
assignments  [1,5] . As a result, protein  residues  can be grouped  based on 
their Fi-scores  where this information  can be used to identify  emerging  
patterns  in the protein  conformation  or topology.  
Nur77 protein  was used as a case example  to demonstrate  various  
package  functionalities.  Nuclear  receptor  subfamily  4 group A member  
1 (NR4A1),  also known as Nur77/TR3/NGFIB,  is a member  of the nu- 
clear receptor  superfamily  and regulates  the expression  of multiple  tar- 
get genes [6] . This nuclear  receptor  is classiﬁed  as an orphan receptor  
since there are no known endogenous  ligands.  Nur77 has the typical 
structure  of a nuclear  receptor  which consists  of N-terminal,  DNA bind- 
ing, and ligand-binding  domains.  This regulatory  protein  plays many po- 
tentially  therapeutically  relevant  roles regulating  cell proliferation  and 
apoptosis  [6] . Consequently,  the Nur77 protein  is an excellent  example  
to highlight  how in-depth  structural  analysis  and classiﬁcation  could be 
used in better understanding  protein  functions  and ﬁnding  druggable  
binding  sites or identifying  ligands.  
Based on the need to develop  integratable  and specialised  tools for 
protein  analyses,  the Fiscore package  was developed  to assist with a 
wide spectrum  of research  questions  ranging  from exploratory  analy- 
ses to therapeutic  target assessment  ( Fig. 1 ). The introduced  set of new 
tools provides  an interactive  exploration  of targets with an easy integra-  
tion into downstream  analyses.  Importantly,  the package  and associated  
tools are written  to be easy to use and freely available  facilitating  anal- 
yses for non-specialists  in structural  biology  or machine  learning.  
2. Methods  
Fiscore package  architecture  is divided  into exploratory  and ad- 
vanced functions  ( Fig. 1 ). Several  key packages,  such as ggplot2  [7] , 
Bio3D [8] , plotly [9] , and mclust [10] , are also employed  to create an 
easy-to-use  analytical  environment  where a user-friendly  machine  learn- 
ing pipeline  of GMM [1] allows for a robust structural  analysis.  GMM 
implementation  is designed  to include  the optimal  cluster number  eval- 
uation (Bayesian  information  criterion;  BIC), automatic  model ﬁtting 
in the EM phase of clustering,  model-based  hierarchical  clustering,  den- 
sity estimation,  as well as discriminant  analysis  [1,11] . Researchers  also 
have an option to perform  advanced  exploratory  studies or integrate  the 
package  into their development  pipelines.  Fiscore also takes care of raw 
data pre-processing  and evaluation  with optional  settings  to adjust how 
the analyses  are performed.  The package  was built using functional  pro- 
gramming  principles  with several R S3 methods  to create objects for PDB 
ﬁles [12] . Fiscore is accompanied  by documentation  and vignette  ﬁles 
to help the users with their analyses  [11] . Since PDB ﬁles are typically  
large, the documentation  provides  a compressed  testing environment  
as well as a detailed  tutorial.  Additional  visualisations  were generated  
with PyMol [13] . Proteins  were retrieved  from the Protein  Data Bank 
database  [14] . Protein  sequence  alignments  were performed  with PSI- BLAST using default parameters  and a single iteration  [15] . Hydropho-  
bicity plots for Nur77 functional  analysis  were generated  with the fol- 
lowing parameters:  window  = 15,weight  = 25, model = “exponential  ”. 
Student’s  t -test (two-sided,  unpaired,  sig. level = 95%) was performed  in 
the R programming  environment.  
3. Results  
3.1. Data preparation  
The workﬂow  begins with the PDB ﬁle pre-processing  and prepara-  
tion. The user should also generally  assess if the structure  is suitable  for 
the analysis;  that is, the crystallographic  data provides  a good resolution  
and there are no or a minimal  number  of breakages  within the reported  
structure.  Function  PDB_process  takes a PDB ﬁle name which can be 
expressed  as 6KZ5.pdb  or path/to/the/ﬁle/6KZ5.pdb.  One of the func- 
tion’s dependencies  is package  Bio3D [8] , this useful package  provides  
several tools to begin any PDB ﬁle analysis.  In addition,  the PDB_process  
function  can take a path parameter  which can point to a directory  where 
to split PDB ﬁles into separate  chain ﬁles (necessary  for the downstream  
analysis).  If this option is left empty, a folder in the working  directory  
will be created  automatically.  If the user splits multiple  PDB ﬁles in a 
loop, they will be continuously  added to the same folder. After the pro- 
cessing,  the function  PDB_process  returns a list of split chain names. It is 
important  to highlight  that PDB ﬁles need to be split for the downstream  
processing  so that separate  chains can be analysed  independently.  
After a ﬁle or ﬁles are pre-processed  the function  PDB_prepare  can be 
used to prepare  a PDB ﬁle to generate  Fi-score  and normalised  B-factor  
values as well as secondary  structure  designations.  The function  takes 
a PDB ﬁle name that was split into separate  chains, e.g., 6KZ5_A.pdb,  
where a letter designates  a split chain. The ﬁle is then cleaned  and 
only the complete  entries for amino acids are kept for the analysis,  i.e., 
amino acids from the terminal  residues  that do not contain  both dihe- 
dral angles are removed.  The function  returns a data frame with pro- 
tein secondary  structure  information  ‘ Type ’, Fi-score  values per residue  
‘ Fi_score  ’, as well as normalised  B-factor  values for each amino acid 𝐶 𝛼
‘ B_normalised  ’ ( Fig. 2 ). Extracting  protein  secondary  structure  informa-  
tion, i.e., ‘ Type ’, helps to prepare  a data object so that the information  
about a target can be supplied  into cheminformatics  or other bioinfor-  
matics pipelines  where structural  features  are important  to assess pro- 
tein sites and amino acid composition.  These features  are new and ex- 
tend structural  ﬁle exploration  possibilities  compared  to, for example,  
other software  packages,  such as Bio3D [8] . 
Function  calls are simple and user-friendly:

3.2. Exploratory  analyses  
The scope of the exploratory  analyses  provides  options  to evaluate  
physicochemical  parameters,  such as dihedral  angles, B-factors,  or hy- 
drophobicity  scores, and visualise  their distribution  ( Fig. 1 ).

Fig. 2. PDB ﬁle processing  output. 
Basic analyses  are accessed  through  simple function  calls to ex- 
plore how dihedral  angles and B-factors  are distributed.  These anal- 
yses oﬀer interactive  and easy visualisations  of key parameters  that 
are currently  not oﬀered in any other package.  For example,  while 
Bio3D [8] has many useful functionalities  for the exploration  of PDB 
ﬁles, ‘ Fi_score  ’ extends  exploratory  analyses  by allowing  a simpliﬁed  
and in-depth  look into the key physicochemical  parameters,  such as B- 
factor value visualisation  or generation  of Ramachandran  plots. Simi- 
larly, other freely available  tools (distributed  as an online service),  such 
as Expasy ProtScale  [16,17]  , provide  only one dimensional  assessment  
without  incorporating  structural  features  and do not process  PDB ﬁles. 
‘ Fi_score  ’, however,  combines  sequence,  structural,  and physicochemical  
analyses  in simple function  calls to quickly  explore  the user data. #Calling  a Ramachandran  plot function

An especially  useful functionality  is the hydrophobicity  visualisation  
with the superimposed  secondary  structure  elements.  To the author’s  
knowledge,  there are currently  no tools implementing  such a visuali-  
sation ( Fig. 3 ). In contrast  to Expasy ProtScale  [16,17]  , it is possible  
to visualise  hydrophobicity  values and their corresponding  secondary  
structure  elements  as extracted  from the PDB ﬁle. Such an assessment  
provides  a direct way to compare  structural  features  based on their aﬃn- 
ity to water. This can be very helpful in evaluating  or predicting  poten- 
tial binding  sites as well as bioengineering  new proteins.  
The package  provides  an easy to use wrapper:

ponential’’)  
The nuclear  receptor  was assessed  to provide  a case example  for the 
introduced  hydrophobicity  analysis.  The evaluation  revealed  an overall 
dynamic  proﬁle for the protein.  Moreover,  Nur77 evidently  contains  a

relatively  large number  of right-handed  alpha helices with the majority  
showing  a hydrophobic  proﬁle,  i.e., the larger the score, the more hy- 
drophobic  the region. Some likely disordered  regions  can be seen span- 
ning 50–70 amino acids ( Fig. 4 ). Another  interesting  region is around 
126–136  amino acids since these amino acids undergo  signiﬁcant  shifts 
in their hydrophilicity  and hydrophobicity.  Similarly,  the region around 
180–210  amino acids appears  to be actively  changing  preferences  from

little solvent  to being solvent  exposed.  This might suggest  that the site 
undergoes  considerable  movements  or actively  engages  other proteins  
or the DNA sequence.  The disordered  elements  in this sequence  stretch 
also imply that the region has to likely accommodate  various  rearrange-  
ments. Thus, studying  these sites could provide  hints at functionally  im- 
portant  protein  domains  or subdomains  ( Figs. 3 and 4 ). Finally,  evalu- ating N and C terminal  sites for the purpose  of protein  engineering,  we 
can see that a histidine  tag would not signiﬁcantly  disrupt the confor-  
mation of the molecule  and the C-terminus  is probably  the best site for 
the tag. 
It is worth commenting  on the derivation  of the hydrophobicity  scor- 
ing since the algorithmic  nature of the process  provides  several impor-

tant analytical  angles. The function  builds on the Kyte-Doolittle  hy- 
drophobicity  scale [1,18] to detect hydrophobic  regions  in proteins.  
Regions  with a positive  value are hydrophobic  and those with neg- 
ative values are hydrophilic.  This scale can be used to identify  both 
surface-exposed  as well as transmembrane  regions,  depending  on the window  size used. However,  to make comparisons  easier, the original  
scale is transformed  from 0 to 1 (similar  scaling is also implemented  
in Expasy ProtScale  [16,17]  ). The function  requires  a PDB data frame 
generated  by PDB_prepare  and the user needs to specify a window  pa- 
rameter  to determine  the size of the window  for hydrophobicity  cal- 
culations.  The selection  must be any odd number  between  3 and 21 
with the default being 21. Another  parameter  is weight that needs to 
be supplied  to the function  to establish  a relative  weight of the window  
edges compared  to the window  center (%); the default setting is 100%. 
Finally,  a model parameter  provides  an option for weight calculation;  
that is, the selection  determines  whether  weights  are calculated  linearly  
( 𝑦 = 𝑘 ⋅𝑥 + 𝑏 ) or exponentially  ( 𝑦 = 𝑎 ⋅𝑏 𝑥 ); the default model is ‘linear’.  
The function  evaluates  each amino acid in a selected  window  where a 
hydrophobic  inﬂuence  from the surrounding  amino acids is calculated  
in. While the terminal  amino acids cannot be included  into the window  
for centering  and weighing,  they are assigned  unweighted  values based 
on the Kyte-Doolittle  scale [18] . The plot values are all scaled from 0 
to 1 so that diﬀerent  proteins  can be compared  without  the need to 
convert.  
Thus, the hydrophobicity  analysis  can be especially  useful when 
preparing  to engineer  proteins  for various  expression  systems  as the 
superimposition  of structural  features  and hydrophobicity  scores can 
help deciding  if a protein  region or domain  is likely to be solvent  ex- 
posed or prefer hydrophobic  environments.  For example,  assessing  the 
hydrophobicity  and structural  milieu of the N or C terminal  amino acids 
can help selecting  which terminal  site should be tagged (as was demon-  
strated with Nur77).  Moreover,  this tool could be broadly  applied  in 
drug discovery  studies involving  the assessment  of protein-protein  in- 
teractions,  protein-nucleic  acid interactions,  and membrane  association  
events based on physicochemical  characteristics.

3.3. Advanced  analyses  
Advanced  analyses  provide  an opportunity  to evaluate  Fi-score  dis- 
tributions  and take advantage  of a streamlined  GMM pipeline  ( Fig. 1 ). 
The main impetus  for the development  of this pipeline  was the need 
for functions  and data modelling  tools that could be made freely accessible  to non-experts.  By contrast,  commercial  solutions,  namely  
Schr ȵ dinger chemical  simulation  software  [19] , or non-commercial/  
semi-commercial  solutions,  including  PSIPRED,  AutoDock,  MGLtools,  
and Expasy [16,20–22]  , lack a simple software  platform  to summarise  
and assess protein  structural  data that can be integrated  into machine  
learning.  While the mentioned  software  suites or online workbenches

provide  many useful functionalities,  there is no one solution  to use ma- 
chine learning  based inferences  on the user’s structural  data. ‘ Fi_score  ’ 
enables  researchers  to quickly  extract,  assess, and summarise  key fea- 
tures of their data and incorporate  that information  into downstream  
analyses  or custom  pipelines.  That is, more advanced  users are also given 
opportunity  to supply custom  parameters  for the GMM workﬂow  and 
extract probabilities  from the output to use scores in other analyses  or 
integrate  the values in their own discovery  pipelines.

For example,  a Fi-score  distribution  plot captures  several interesting  
regions  in Nur77 around the 50, 130, and 180 amino acids ( Fig. 5 ) that 
coincide  with the Fi-score  shifts and mirroring  patterns.  Some other re- 
gions are also picked up which should be studied  in more detail based on 
the amino acid composition  and 3D conformations.  The uncovered  char- 
acteristics  can be juxtaposed  to other similar sites to better understand  interaction  mechanisms.  Such approaches  are especially  useful when 
comparing  known structures  with the newly identiﬁed  or investigating  
potential  structural  outliers.  
Extracted  Fi-score  values can be used in machine  learning  modelling  
and this is enabled  through  the function  cluster_ID  . This function  groups 
structural  features  using the Fi-score  and Gaussian  mixture  modelling  
where an optimal  number  of clusters  and a model to be ﬁtted during the 
EM phase of clustering  for GMM are automatically  selected  ( Fig. 6 ). The 
output of this analytical  tool summarises  cluster information  and also 
provides  plots to visualise  the identiﬁed  clusters  based on the cluster 
number  and BIC value ( Fig. 7 ). These outputs  can be used to better 
assess model performance  for the select parameters  if the users chose to 
customise  their model building.  
#User selected  parameters  
df < -cluster_ID(pdb_df,clusters  = 5, modelNames  = ’’VVI’’) 
The users are advised  to set seed for more reproducible  results when 
initiating  their projects.  cluster_ID  takes a data frame containing  a pro- 
cessed PDB ﬁle with Fi-score  values as well as a number  of clusters  to 
consider  during model selection;  by default 20 clusters  (‘max_range’)  are 
explored.  In addition,  a ‘secondary_structures’  parameter  is needed  to 
deﬁne whether  the information  on secondary  structure  elements  from 
the PDB ﬁle needs to be included  when plotting;  the default value is 
TRUE. Researchers  also have an option to select a cluster number  to 
test ‘clusters’  together  with ‘modelNames’.  However,  it is important  to 
stress that both optional  entries need to be selected  and deﬁned,  if the

user wants to test other clustering  options  that were not provided  by the 
automated  BIC output.  This is an advanced  option and the user should 
assess the BIC output to decide which model and what cluster number  
he or she wants to try out. It is important  to note that cluster_ID  oﬀers 
a user-friendly  implementation  of GMM where most technical  decisions  
are already  incorporated  automatically.

also automatically  provided  ( Fig. 10 ). Dimension  reduction  is a use- 
ful technique  to explore  multi-dimensional  biological  data through  key 
eigenvalues  that deﬁne the largest information  content  of the explored  
features  [10] . In other words, one can infer how well the explored  char- 
acteristics  deﬁne the data and if the classiﬁcation  is suﬃcient  for down- 
stream analyses.  For example,  in the case of Nur77 Fi-score  clustering,  
this analysis  allowed  assessing  how well the number  of clusters  separates  
data points based on their distribution  features.  Nur77 has six clusters  
which might indicate  functionally  and structurally  distinct  regions  in 
the target protein.  It appears  that the data points are well separated  into 
groups accounting  for the diﬀerent  variability.  The dimension  reduction  
approach  could also help deciding  if a diﬀerent  number  of clusters  might 
better classify  Fi-scores.  One of the goals of building  this software  pack- 
age was not only to provide  accessible  and easy-to-use  functions  but also 
to generate  additional  plots allowing  to assess model performance  and 
data point distribution.  
In addition,  one of the most valuable  features  of this set of functions  
is to generate  clusters  with secondary  structure  information  ( Figs. 8 and 
9 ).The produced  interactive  plots enable researchers  to explore  struc- 
tural characteristics  of a protein  of interest  ( Figs. 8 and 9 ). Thus, the 
subdivision  of a protein  structure  based on the physicochemical  features  oﬀers a new way to detect and explore  functional  sites or structural  el- 
ements.  Figs. 9 and 10 clearly indicate  that some structural  elements  in 
Nur77 are likely similar in their function  and physicochemical  charac-  
teristics.  For example,  diﬀerent  types of helices as well as beta sheets in 
some cases overlap  in their Fi-score  characteristics  and the assigned  clus- 
ter type. This detailed  capture  of structural  elements  can help evaluate  
conformational  outliers  or infer similarities  for diﬀerent  motifs. More- 
over, it can be clearly seen that the region around the 50 amino acid is 
set to be distinct  from the other two sites around 130 and 180 amino 
acids which could suggest  overall diﬀerent  motion and interaction  pro- 
ﬁles. These ﬁndings  also correspond  with the earlier observations  for 
the hydrophobicity  features  ( Fig. 3 ). A similar trend can be seen for N 
and C terminus  clusters  which form distinct  groups and might indicate  
sites where the receptor  mediates  speciﬁc  functions  [6] . GMM guided 
analyses  oﬀer a novel way to extract patterns  that might not be observ-  
able using other methods  dependent  on sequence  based analytics,  e.g., 
Expasy [16,17]  . 
All previous  analyses  tie in with the function  density_plots  which pro- 
vides a density  plot set for 𝜙/ 𝜓angle  distributions,  Fi-scores,  and nor- 
malised  B-factors.  3D visualisation  of dihedral  angle distribution  for ev- 
ery residue  is also included.  These plots can be used for a quick as- 
sessment  of the overall parameters  as well as to summarise  the obser- 
vations.  Density  plots are very useful when evaluating  how well the 
selected  features  or scores separate  protein  structural  elements  and if a 
protein  structure  is of good quality (i.e., dihedral  angles, B-factors,  or Fi- 
scores provide  reasonable  separation  between  elements).  The function  
also gives another  reference  point to establish  if the selected  number  
of clusters  diﬀerentiates  residues  well based on the secondary  structure

3.4. Case study: exploring  potential  ligands for the Nur77 orphan receptor  
To demonstrate  some of the Fiscore applications,  potential  ligands  
were searched  for the Nur77 receptor  which can be considered  as a 
complex  target since no endogenous  ligands  are known for this orphan 
receptor  [6] . The ﬁrst analysis  step involved  searching  for other similar 
human proteins  that did not belong to the Nuclear  receptor  subfam-  
ily 4. PSI-BLAST  alignment  analysis  led to several candidate  proteins,  
namely  the retinoic  acid receptor  alpha (PDB ID: 1FBY) and estrogen-  
related receptor  gamma  (PDB ID: 6KNR) [15] . These proteins  showed  
a good alignment  to the Nur77 ligand binding  domain  sequence  (av- 
erage percent  identity  31.68%;  Suppl. Table 1) and were subsequently  used for the structural  and functional  exploration.  Comparing  Nur77 Fi- 
scores with the retinoic  acid receptor  alpha and estrogen-related  recep- 
tor gamma  Fi-score  distributions  revealed  several interesting  patterns  
( Fig. 12 ). The shaded blue region highlights  a matching  distribution  
pattern  for all the proteins  and the Student’s  t -test conﬁrmed  that none 
of the distributions  diﬀered  signiﬁcantly  ( Fig. 12 ; Suppl. Table 2). In- 
triguingly,  this region is involved  in mediating  interactions  with retinoic  
acid in the retinoic  acid receptor  alpha ( Fig. 13 ). Similarly,  the estrogen-  
related receptor  gamma  (PDB ID: 6KNR) has a known inverse  agonist  
binding  to the same cavity created  by paired alpha-helices,  an anti- 
parallel  beta sheet, and disordered  stretches  [23] . The inverse  agonist  
exhibits  several structural  features,  such as the scaﬀold  size/orientation  
and key aromatic  groups,  that are similar to retinoic  acid. Moreover,  
despite the diﬀerent  amino acid composition,  the key physicochemical  
features  are preserved  in this site across the investigated  proteins  as can 
be seen from the superimposition  studies ( Fig. 13 ). These observations  
point to the fact that this region might be essential  in accommodating  
binding  events. Importantly,  machine  learning  exploration  ( Fig. 8 & 9 ) 
helped to classify  Fi-scores  around this region which revealed  a repeat- 
ing pattern  very diﬀerent  from a surrounding  N- and C-terminal  regions.  
This further implies  a site of special functional  importance  where data 
was grouped  based on emerging  probabilistic  patterns  in data point val- 
ues. This case study suggests  an interesting  possibility  that Nur77 with 
no known ligands  might bind to chemical  entities  similar to retinoic  
10 A. Kanapeckaite Artiﬁcial Intelligence in the Life Sciences 1 (2021) 100016 
acid [6] . This is also supported  by the alignment  data and hydrophobic-  
ity plots (Suppl.  Figs. 1 –3) where Nur77 and the retinoic  acid receptor  
alpha show substantial  structural  and physicochemical  overlaps  for this 
interactor  site. Further  molecular  modelling  and docking  studies could 
aid in better understanding  binding  energetics  and emerging  interac-  
tions. 
Overall,  this example  reveals that extracting  patterns  through  scor- 
ing and machine  learning  could help identify  proteins  that have shared 
and functionally  related features.  Thus, Fiscore allows an easy implemen-  
tation of protein  structural  data mining and classiﬁcation  without  nec- 
essarily  performing  multiple  visual inspections  of the structures.  These 
analytical  principles  can also be applied  to explore  other proteins  of 
interest  and their potential  ligands.  
4. Discussion  
Fiscore package  was developed  to address  the need for a simple-to-  
use, freely available,  and adaptable  set of tools for protein  physicochem-  
ical feature exploration  via machine  learning.  By contrast,  other com- 
mercial,  semi-commercial,  or free software  tools lack machine  learn- 
ing pipeline  implementation  to explore  structural  features  and in most 
cases users need special knowledge  to employ  these pieces of software  
[8,16,19–22]  . 
Fiscore package  ( Fig. 1 ) allows a user-friendly  exploration  of PDB 
structural  data and integration  with various  machine  learning  methods.  
The package  was benchmarked  through  several analytical  stages that 
involved  a diverse  set of proteins  (3352) to assess scoring  principles  
[1] and package  functionalities  (1337 structures)  [11] . With a number  
of helpful functions,  including  distribution  analyses  or hydrophobicity  
assessment  in the context  of structural  elements,  Fiscore enables  the ex- 
ploration  of new target families  and comprehensive  data integration  
since the described  ﬁngerprinting  captures  protein  sequence  and physic- 
ochemical  properties.  Such analyses  could be very helpful when explor- 
ing therapeutically  relevant  proteins.  In addition,  provided  tutorials  and 
documentation  should guide researchers  through  their analysis  and al- 
low adapting  the package  based on individual  project needs [1] . Fiscore 
could also aid in drug repurposing  studies when a chemical  compound  
needs to be juxtaposed  to a number  of potential  targets.  This was demon-  
strated during a native ligand search for Nur77 where a case study of a 
nuclear  receptor  revealed  the usefulness  of the introduced  scoring  and 
physicochemical  data capturing  via GMM. Furthermore,  the novel scor- 
ing system as well as machine  learning  applications  can lead to inter- 
esting insights  about sites of structural  and functional  importance.  The 
retrieved  information  could be used in comparative  studies to search for 
other proteins  that share similar features.  For example,  some of the shifts 
in Fi-score  values coincide  or precede  post-translational  modiﬁcations  
in Nur77 ( Fig. 5 ) [24] . This information  could be included  in the fu- 
ture studies together  with ﬁngerprinting  to better understand  structural  
characteristics  of this receptor.  
Another  important  aspect of the Fiscore package  is the simpliﬁcation  
of complex  analytical  steps so that the researchers  without  an exten- 
sive background  in structural  bioinformatics  or machine  learning  could 
still use the tools for their analyses,  such as protein  engineering,  pro- 
tein assessment,  and data storage  based on speciﬁc  target sites. Thus, 
the interactive  analytical  and visualisation  tools could become  espe- 
cially relevant  in the pharmaceutical  research  and drug discovery  stud- 
ies as more complex  targets and protein-protein  interactions  need to 
be assessed  in a streamlined  fashion.  In other words, ability to trans- 
late structural  data into parameters  could accelerate  target classiﬁca-  
tion, target-ligand  studies,  or machine  learning  integration.  Since target 
evaluation  is paramount  for rational  therapeutics  development,  there is 
an undeniable  need for specialised  analytical  tools and techniques  that 
can be used in R&D or academic  research.  Implementing  these novel 
approaches  could signiﬁcantly  improve  our ability to assess new targets 
and develop  better therapeutics.  As a result, the Fiscore package  was de- 
veloped  to aid with therapeutic  target assessment  and make machine  learning  techniques  free-to-use  and more accessible  to a wider scientiﬁc  
audience.
