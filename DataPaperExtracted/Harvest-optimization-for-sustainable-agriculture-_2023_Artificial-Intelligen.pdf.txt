Article history:Received 5 June 2023Received in revised form 6 October 2023Accepted 7 October 2023Available online 12 October 2023To ensure sustainability in agriculture, many optimization problems need to be solved. An important one of themis harvest scheduling problem. In this study, the harvest scheduling problem for the tea is discussed. The teaharvest problem includes the creating a harvest schedule by considering the farmers' quotas under the purchaselocation and factory capacity. Tea harvesting is carried out in cooperation with the farmer - factory. Factory man-agement is interested in using its resources. So, the factory capacity, purchase location capacities and number ofexpeditions should be considered during the harvesting process. When the farmer's side is examined, it is seenthat the real professions of farmers are different. On harvest days, farmers often cannot attend to their primaryprofessions. Considering the harvest day preferences of farmers in creating the harvest schedule are of greatimportance for sustainability in agriculture. Two different mathematical models are proposed to solve thisproblem. Theﬁrst model minimizes the number of weekly expeditions of factory vehicles within the factorand purchase location capacity restrictions. The second model minimizes the number of expeditions and aimsto comply with the preferences of the farmers as much as possible. A sample application was performed in aregion with 12 purchase locations, 988 farmers, and 3392 decares of tea ﬁelds. The results show that the compli- ance rate of farmers to harvesting preferences could be increased from 52% to 97%, and this situation did notaffect the number of expeditions of the factory. This result shows that considering the farmers' preferences onthe harvest day will have no negative impact on the factory. On the contrary, it was concluded that this situationincreases sustainability and encouragement in agriculture. Furthermore, the results show that models areeffective for solving the problem.© 2023 The Authors. Publishing servic es by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of KeAi Communications Co., Ltd.

1. IntroductionOrganizing activities in the agricultural sector are the activitiescarried out to develop the decision-making mechanism of the producersdirected towards the same purpose. The sustainable conduct of theseorganizational activities increases social and economic ef ﬁciency (Karlı et al., 2018).Andrei et al. (2020)argued that agricultural export competitiveness can only be achieved with increasing productivity.They mentioned that one of the elements that increase this productivityis policies aiming to expand relations in the agricultural sector. For thesereasons, social optimization studies to be applied in agriculture arevaluable.Many plant species can be considered in the social optimizationstudies to be applied in the agricultural sector. These plant speciesvary according to region. Considering the Black Sea Region in Turkey,it is seen that social optimization studies can be carried out foragricultural products such as tea, hazelnuts, corn, and kiwi. When thetea production is examined, it is noteworthy that Turkey ranks seventhin the world regarding the width of tea agricultural areas and ﬁfth in dry tea production. Turkey is located inﬁrst place according to the world's statistics of tea consumption per capita ( Çaykur, 2019). For these reasons, the importance of tea in the Turkish agricultural sector isquite signiﬁcant. Harvest scheduling, vehicle routing, and personnelscheduling problems in tea farming can be discussed. Optimizationwork can be performed for many objectives, such as complying withthe farmers' preferences, minimizing the number of expeditions to pur-chase locations, collecting the tea harvested with the shortest route, andscheduling drivers.The production journey of tea, which is harvested three times a year,starts with the tea collection process of the farmer. Farmers usuallyenter the teaﬁeld at sunrise and harvest the tea until the afternoon.The tea is transported to the so-called purchase location for the saleprocess of the farmer-factory. Tea is weighed, and the sales process iscompleted in the purchase locations. The purchase location and factorycapacity constraints are important in the harvesting process.

Tea can be affected by the sun. If the tea issunburnt, it is not accepted by the factory. This causes the tea to bewaste. Considering the purchase location capacity is essential to elimi-nate such grievances. The aim of the minimization of truck expeditionsduring harvest scheduling is signiﬁcant to use the resources of the facto-ries efﬁciently. In addition, it is important for social development and in-centive to agriculture to consider the harvest day preferences in thecreation of the harvest schedule. Considering these parameters in theharvest process increases national efﬁciency in tea farming.In this study, the tea harvest scheduling problem is discussed. Math-ematical models have been proposed for farmers and factories. Thesemodels consider the weekly harvest day preference constraints, locationconstraints, the purchase location capacity, and the factory capacityconstraints. These problem-speciﬁc models offer an innovative ap-proach to the tea harvesting process and contribute to the literatureon harvest optimization. Most of the tea production in Turkey takesplace in Rize (Çaykur, 2019). Exemplary applications have been carriedout in a region with 988 farmers, 3392 decares of tea ﬁelds, and 12 pur- chase locations in Rize. With these applications, the performances of therecommended models were evaluated. This study is a new startingpoint in the literature, as it is theﬁrst work that deals with tea harvest-ing with the unique constraints mentioned.The plan of the study is as follows: In the second section, the harvestscheduling problem is mentioned. In the third section, the studies in theliterature are examined. In the fourth section, a sample application wasperformed. The result of the study is in the ﬁfth section.2. Harvest scheduling problemIn the production and service sectors, schedule problems are fre-quently encountered. The solution to these problems includes allocatingcertain resources to certain tasks. During the allocation, many problem-speciﬁc criteria can be found (Ceylan et al., 2019). Some issues exam- ined in the scheduling studies are as follows: personnel scheduling(Eren and Ünal, 2016;Varlıand Tamer, 2017), job scheduling (Fanjul- Peyro et al., 2019;Lei et al., 2021;Lei and Liu, 2020), syllabus scheduling (Çolak and Yiğit, 2021;Eren et al., 2018;Yurtsal and Kaynar, 2022), maintenance scheduling(Cullum et al., 2018;Dündar and Sarıçiçek, 2021;Özcan et al., 2020). Some of the methods used are as follows:Goal programming (Ceylan et al., 2019;Eren and Ünal, 2016), artiﬁcial bee colony (Lei et al., 2021;Lei and Liu, 2020), genetic algorithm (Yurtsal and Kaynar, 2022), particle swarm optimization(
Yurtsal and Kaynar, 2022).Harvest optimization problems are the problems that are interestedinﬁnding the answers to the following questions: i. Which plant shouldbe planted? ii. When should the harvest be done? iii. Which machinesshould be used? iv. Which system or which route should be taken? v.In whichﬁeld should the product be planted? vi. What should be thesize of the labor force to carry out the harvest? The location of harvestscheduling problems in the harvest optimization literature is shown inFig. 1.Harvest scheduling applications contain objectives such as ef ﬁcient use of resources and maximizing the amount of harvest. With these ap-plications, factory resources can be used more ef ﬁciently. In addition, considering the preferences of farmers can encourage communities toagriculture. In today's world, where agriculture is increasing day by day(Kirmikil and Ertaş, 2020), these studies that can increase the efﬁciency of both farmers and factories are important. Some harvesting processesare implemented in cooperation with f armers and factories. In these pro- cesses, both sides have beneﬁtv a l u e .T h eb e n eﬁtv a l u e sa r eo p t i m i z e db y using resources efﬁciently within the problem's constraints. The optimi-zation can only take into account farmers or factories. In addition, opti-mization studies that are interested in both can be carried out. Thesestudies are handled to increase sustainability in agriculture.3. Literature reviewHarvest optimization in the literature is referred to by variousnames: Planting decision optimization ( Rollan et al., 2018;Sajid and Hu, 2022), harvest scheduling (Thuankaewsing et al., 2011), scheduling of the machines to be used in harvesting ( Edwards et al., 2015;He et al., 2018a, 2018b), labor optimization in agriculture (Busato and Berruto, 2016). Studies have different qualities regarding plant species, the ob-jective of optimization, and the methods used. The examination of thestudies according to these qualiﬁcations is shown inTable 1. When the subjects of the literature studies given in Table 1are exam- ined, harvest optimization was performed for many objective, such asplanting time optimization (Sajid and Hu, 2022), plant species selection optimization (Poltroniere et al., 2021), agricultural machine schedulingand routing (He et al., 2018a). Sarımehmet et al. has done one of themost recent studies on tea harvest optimization ( Sarımehmet et al., 2023). The GP model is developed in the study and a real case study re-alized in Turkey. There was no study that optimizes the gains of farmersand factories for sustainable agriculture by taking the preferences of thefarmers. Our study contributes to the literature in this respect.It is seen that the mathematical programming method is frequentlyused in harvest optimization studies ( Grunow et al., 2007;He et al., 2018b;Poltroniere et al., 2021;Rollan et al., 2018), Artiﬁcial neural net- works (Sajid and Hu, 2022), the tabu search method (He et al., 2018a) and statistical methods (Badi et al., 2004) are also used. In this study, mathematical programming, which is the most preferred method inthe literature, is used.Fig. 2depicts the distribution of the studies according to the plantspecies discussed. The most discussed plants in the literature appearto be sugar cane (Grunow et al., 2007;Poltroniere et al., 2021; Thuankaewsing et al., 2011) and rice (Busato and Berruto, 2016;He et al., 2018b) respectively. Afforestation (Rollan et al., 2018), wheat (He et al., 2018a), and thyme (Badi et al., 2004) are also available for harvest optimization. According to the literature research, tea harvest-ing scheduling has not been handled before. In this respect, our studyﬁlls the gap in the harvest optimization literature. Harvest optimizationis discussed in the literature for many plant species for different

36objective. The contributions of harvest optimization in this study to theliterature are as follows:•A Mathematical model has been developed that optimize the bene ﬁt values of the factories (the number of expeditions of the factoryvehicles) in the tea harvest scheduling problem.•A Mathematical model has been developed that optimize the bene ﬁt values of the farmers (harvesting day preferences) in the tea harvestscheduling problem.•In mathematical models developed, there are problem-speci ﬁc constraints like the number of weekly harvesting days and purchaselocation capacities preferred by farmers.•The study contributes to the literature on harvest optimization as itprovides an innovative and sustainable approach by looking at thetea harvesting process in terms of both a farmer and the factory.•The problem has been tested by a case analysis using real-life data.4. ApplicationReal case study and the method used are mentioned in this section.4.1. Goal programmingGoal Programming (GP) emerged in 1955 with a study by Charneset al. (Charnes et al., 1955) GP is one of the techniques used in theﬁeld of multi-objective decision making and scheduling ( Dağdeviren and Eren, 2001). The GP helps to turn all the objectives of the probleminto a constraint and to transfer them to the mathematical model. Linearprogramming helps to decide to optimize only one objective. GP mini-mizes deviations from multiple goals and helps users to manage contra-dictory objectives more accurately (Leung et al., 2003). Also, GP models are used for harvest optimization (Rollan et al., 2018). The basic repre- sentation of the GP method is as follows:Min Z¼∑

Deviation variables in the GP methodare variables that express deviations from speci ﬁc targets(s). The aim is to minimize these variables in the subject function. This is the most sig-niﬁcant difference from GP's linear programming. With deviation vari-ables, a GP model has a feasible solution. For example, a deviationTable 1Harvest optimization literature review.Author(s) Plant Problem Method(Sarımehmet et al., 2023) Tea Tea harvest scheduling GP(Sajid and Hu, 2022) – Planting time optimization ANN, MP (Poltroniere et al., 2021) Sugar cane The optimization of plant species selection MP(Rollan et al., 2018) Afforestation The optimization of plant species selection GP(He et al., 2018a) Wheat Agricultural machine scheduling TS(He et al., 2018b) Rice Agricultural machine routing MP(Busato and Berruto, 2016) Rice Labor optimization S(Edwards et al., 2015) – Agricultural machine scheduling TS (Thuankaewsing et al., 2011) Sugar cane Land yield estimation and harvest scheduling ANN, MP(Grunow et al., 2007) Sugar cane Breeding and harvest optimization MP(Badi et al., 2004) Thyme The effect of harvest time on yield SM(Salassi et al., 2002) Sugar cane Selection of harvest system MP(Higgins et al., 1998) Sugar cane Revenue optimization according to harvest time and harvest age MP(Astika et al., 1997) Sugar cane Planting and harvesting time optimization MPThis study Tea Harvest scheduling GPMP: Mathematical Programming, ANN: Arti ﬁcial Neural Network, TS: Tabu Search, S: Simulation, SM: Statistical Methods, GP: Goal Programming.

37variable may mean that a personnel is not appointed to the day hewants. With a GP model, personnel preferences can be followed asmuch as possible. Eq.(3)refers to the constraint that makes thedeviation variables only in one direction. Eq. (4)is a constant of the negative of decision variables and deviation variables. This basic GPmodel minimizes positive and negative deviations from a goal. Withthe GP method, only negative or only positive deviations can be mini-mized, as well as deviations from multiple goals can be minimized.The importance of deviations with the coef ﬁcients to be given to the de- viation variables can be indicated. Thus, the priority GP model can beinstalled.4.2. Tea harvest schedulingIn the study, a harvest optimization was performed on tea harvestscheduling. Theﬂow chart of the application is shown in Fig. 3.4.3. Problem descriptionEfﬁcient use of resources is one of the most critical elements affect-ing the earnings of the factories. The minimum number of truck expedi-tions required (MNOTER) for each day according to the amount of tea tobe harvested by farmers varies. Considering the truck capacities duringharvest scheduling, it is essential to reduce the number of expeditionsand use the factories' resources efﬁciently. For this reason, a tea harvestscheduling was made in our study and aimed to minimize the totalweekly MNOTER of the factory.Tea harvest is performed on average three times a year. Proceduresto be carried out except harvest: Fertilization, pruning, and cleaning ofherbs. The tea does not need irrigation because it grows in wetlands.Therefore, the tea does not require constant attention and follow-up.Because of they plan their daily lives accordingly, it is important to pre-fer harvest days for the farmers. Farmers who can harvest on the daythey prefer will be enthusiastic about tea harvest. This will allow theuse of land that is not planted and harvested for tea harvesting. Forthese reasons, a schedule created by considering the farmer'spreferences will directly contribute to sustainability in agriculture. Forthis reason, a tea harvesting scheduling that considered the farmers'preferences was performed.Each farmer belongs to a purchase location according to where heresides. Exposure of teas to sunlight burns teas, and some or all ofthem lead to the rejection of the factory. Because tea became uselessfor factories. The rejection of these teas, which are fertilized, cleanedfrom wild herbs, harvested when the time comes, and transported tothe purchase locations causes wastage. For this reason, in this study,the capacity of purchase location is considered in the tea harvestscheduling.4.4. Problem dataThe case study was implemented in a region with 988 farmers and3392 decares of teaﬁelds in Rize. There are 12 purchase locations inthis region, and all purchase locations are linked to the same factory.The data were taken from this factory. Each farmer harvests the sameamount of tea on their harvest days. The capacity of the factory forthe area discussed is 288.000 kg per day. The capacity of the vehiclesbetween the purchase location and the factory is 20.000 kg. Thecapacity of the purchase location is the same every day and is as giveninTable 2.Decare information on the lands of farmers was obtained. Althoughthe quota varies from period to period, the weekly quota was deter-mined by the expert opinion that it was 500 kg per decare. The weeklyquota is essential in terms of fair sales of farmers. Tea can be sold sixdays a week. In the case study, the number of harvesting days of farmerswas taken into consideration. However, these values were not takenfrom farmers and were determined according to expert opinion andfarmer quotas. During the creation of preferences, a variable called nor-malized value was calculatedﬁrst. This normalized value consists of thedivision of the weekly quota of each farmer into the maximum quota.According to this normalized value, the intervals to be used todetermine the number of harvesting days was created with the supportof expert opinion.Table 3shows these intervals.

38The distribution of farmers according to the number of harvestingdays is as inTable 4.Day preferences of farmers were randomly made according to thenumber of weekly harvest days. In order to measure the determinationof the model, many preference matrices were created in Section 4.6.3 and the effectivity of the model was tested.4.5. Mathematical modelsTwo different mathematical models have been developed to pro-duce solutions for farmers and factories for the tea harvest schedulingproblem. The features of the models are shown in Table 5. The notations used in mathematical models are given in Table 6.4.5.1. The model aimed to minimize the weekly MNOTERThis model minimizes the MNOTER complying with farmers' totalnumber of harvesting days, purchasing place, and factory capacity con-straints. Minimizing the number of expeditions is essential in terms ofthe efﬁcient use of factory vehicles. In this model the day preferencesof farmers are not taken into consideration.Min Z¼∑

Eq.(6)ensures that farmers are assigned as muchas they should be assigned according to the number of days they wantto harvest. For example, for a farmer who wants to harvest 3 days aweek, the∑Gg¼1pcgvalue is 3. Eq.(6)is complied with the number ofweekly harvesting days of the farmer by making the ∑
Gg¼1xcgvalue 3 for this farmer. Eq.(7)refers to the constraints of purchase location capac-ities. Eq.(8)is the capacity constraint of the factory. It contains the ca-pacity of the factory for the region discussed daily. Eq. (9)refers to the constraint of the minimum number of daily expeditions to be done de-pending on vehicle capacities (β). Eq.(10)refers to the domains of de- cision variables.4.5.2. The model that considers the preference of the farmers and the weeklyMNOTERThis model is a multi-objective optimization model. The number ofweekly expeditions is minimized, and it is aimed to comply with thefarmers' preferences as much as possible. The subject function of theﬁrst model was brought to Eq.(11)instead of 5. Eq.(12)and Eq.(13) were included in the model. In this way, the multi-objective optimiza-tion model has been created.Min Z¼k

In other words, increasing the total number of weeklyexpeditions by two is equivalent to the farmers deviating from thepreference of 5 days.When determining these values by the experts, the extent towhich both parameters beneﬁt the tea harvest scheduling problemhas been taken into account. Eq. (11)is the objective function, which minimizes the number of weekly expeditions and the devia-tion of farmers from their preferences. Eq. (12)constitutes the devia- tion variable from farmers' day preferences. If the farmer prefers for aday but is not assigned, the d
cgvariable takes on a value of 1 andworsens the object function. Eq. (13)refers to the domains of decision variables.4.6. Numerical resultsIn the solution of the mathematical models, a computer with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz 2.81 GHz, 8 GB RAM wasused.

39Studio 12.8.0 (COS) and Python 3.7.7 using COS's application program-ming interface (API).4.6.1. The solution of the model aimed to minimize the weekly MNOTERThe solution with COS took 1.88 s. It was seen that the object func-tion value of the model was 87, which is the total number of expeditionsweekly. According to the result, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, 15vehicles; other days 14 vehicles were needed. Although this model didnot aim to adapt to the farmers' harvest day preference, when the solu-tion result was examined, it was observed that the farmers' preferencematrix was complied with by 52.13%. The assignment of 116 farmersto the day preferences of theﬁrst purchase location is shown inTable 7. The green cells in the table mean that the farmer preferredthat day and was assigned. Red cells mean that the farmer was notassigned even if he preferred. Empty cells mean that the farmer doesnot prefer that day.There 267 preferences of the farmers who will sell at the ﬁrst pur- chase location. The created schedule complies with the 129-day prefer-ence. According to this result, the rate of compliance to the daypreferences of the farmers is 48.31%. The rate of compliance of all pur-chase locations to day preferences is shown in Table 8. WhenTable 8is examined, it is seen that the purchase location withthe lowest compliance rate is the 11th purchase location with 41.73%,and the purchase location with the highest compliance rate is thesixth purchase location with 84.06%. Another value that needs to be an-alyzed is the capacity utilization ratio (CUR) of the purchase location.The daily capacity of theﬁrst reception site is 32,827 kg.Table 9 shows the quantities of tea sold at theﬁrst purchase location and the CUR values.WhenTable 9is examined, it is seen that the daily purchase locationcapacity is complied with every day at the ﬁrst purchase location.Analysis of the CUR values of all purchase locations are shown inTable 10.Table 10shows that capacity constraints were observed at all pur-chase locations on harvest days. This means that the harvested teaswill not be exposed to the risk of being left outside and burned.4.6.2. The solution of the model that considers the preference of the farmersand the weekly MNOTERThis model is a multi-objective optimization model. It is aimed tominimize deviations from farmers' harvest day preferences and thenumber of weekly expeditions. The solution with COS took 7.91 s. Theobject function value of the model was found to be 541. According tothe schedule, the total weekly MNOTER value is 87. It was seen that53 of the farmers' preferences is not assigned. The value of 541 is formedby multiplying 87 by a coefﬁcient of 5, 53 by a coefﬁcient of 2, and then summing up. According to the result, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Satur-day, 15 vehicles, other days 14 vehicles were needed. Different resultscan be obtained by changing the coefﬁcients in the mathematical model. According to the schedule, 2201 out of 2254 days preferencewere complied with. Accordingly, the adaptation rate to farmers' prefer-ences was calculated as 97.65%. The assignment of 116 farmers to theday preferences of theﬁrst purchase location for examination isshown inTable 11. The green cells in the table mean that the farmer pre-ferred that day and was assigned. Red cells mean that the farmer prefersbut is not assigned. Empty cells mean that the farmer does not preferthat day.There are 267 preferences of the farmers who will sell at the ﬁrst purchase location. The created schedule complies with the 263 dayspreference. According to this result, the rate of compliance to the daypreferences of the farmers is 98,5%. The rate of compliance of all pur-chase locations to day preferences is shown in Table 12. WhenTable 12is examined, it is seen that the purchase locationwith the lowest compliance rate is the 12th purchase location with95.3%, and the purchase location with the highest compliance rate isthe sixth purchase location with 100%. Another value that needs to beanalyzed is CUR. The daily capacity of the
ﬁrst reception site is 32,827 kg.Table 13shows the quantities of tea to be sold at the ﬁrst pur- chase location and the CUR values.WhenTable 13is examined, it is seen that the daily purchase loca-tion capacity is complied with every day at the ﬁrst purchase location. Analysis of the CUR values of all purchase locations are shown inTable 14.Table 14shows that capacity constraints were observed at all pur-chase locations on harvest days. This means that the harvested teaswill not be exposed to the risk of being left outside and burned.4.6.3. Sensitivity analysis and managerial insightsIn this section, sensitivity analysis was performed to measure the ef-fectiveness of the developed mathematical models in different prefer-ence matrices. In the model aiming to minimize the MNOTER, theeffect of the number of weekly harvest days of farmers on the model'ssuccess was examined. In the model, which takes into account the pre-ferred days of the farmers and the weekly MNOTER, the effect of thefarmers' day preferences on the model's success was examined whilethe weekly harvest day numbers wereﬁxed.In the model aimed at minimizing the weekly MNOTER, some of theharvest day numbers of farmers were modi ﬁed to examine the effect ofTable 5Features of developed harvest scheduling mathematical models.Model Parameters GoalNumber of days Which days Compliance with preferencesMinimizingMNOTERModel aiming to minimize the weekly MNOTER Farmer determines Factory determines ✓ The model that considers the preference of the farmers and the weekly MNOTER Farmer determines Farmer prefers ✓✓

40the number of weekly harvest days on the model's success. The farmersto be modiﬁed were randomly selected. The weekly harvest day num-bers of the selected farmers were again randomly changed by one dayin the upward or downward direction. There has been no change inthe upward direction for those whose number of harvest days is sixand downward for those who have one. The reason for changing onlyone day is to maintain the reasonableness of the number of harvestdays established by considering the farmer's weekly quota. For example,it would not be reasonable for a farmer who harvests a large amount oftea six days a week to change the number of harvest days per week toone. In this way, 100 preference matrices were produced with Python.Solutions have been implemented through Python and COS. When theresults were examined, it was seen that the weekly MNOTER was 87in all of the solutions, and changing the number of harvest days didTable 7According to the results of the model that aimed minimization of the weekly MNOTER, compliance to the day preferences of farmers at the ﬁrst purchase location.

This result proves that the model maintains its ef-fectiveness in different matrices.In the model, which considers the preferred days of farmers and theweekly MNOTER, the farmers' harvest day preferences were randomlychanged without changing the number of harvest days. In this way,100 preference matrices are produced with Python. Solutions havebeen implemented through Python and COS.

42The fact that the value is 87 again shows that the change in farmers' har-vest day preferences does not affect the weekly MNOTER. The averagerate of adaptation to farmers' preferences was calculated as 97.12%.Fig. 4shows the compliance rate of 100 solutions to farmer preferences.WhenFig. 4is examined, it is seen that the preference compliancerate is the worst 95.96% and the best 98.05%. Therefore, it was concludedthat farmer preferences could not be fully complied with, and in theworst case, farmer preferences could be complied with 95% of thetime. Therefore, the absence of a value lower than 95% in the sensitivityanalysis proves the model's effectiveness.The two mathematical models developed were examined accordingto the parameters of adaptation to the farmers' day preferences and theweekly MNOTER of the factory. This review is shown in Table 15. The * symbols in the table indicate that the model is intended to optimize thevalue in question.When the models are examined in terms of adaptation to farmerpreferences, it is seen that the model aiming at minimization of theweekly MNOTER has lower success. This is because the model doesnot consider farmer preferences. When the MNOTER is examined, it isseen that the consideration of farmer preferences does not affect thisvalue. Although the weekly MNOTER is the same, the second model of-fers a dominant solution compared to the ﬁrst model because the sec- ond model is better at adapting to preferences. This proves that whileconsidering farmers' day preferences, the weekly MNOTER of the facto-ries can also be minimized. Subjecting the models to sensitivity analysisand deciding their consistency shows they will succeed in different pref-erence matrices.According to the results obtained, the following predictions aremade to the managers:•By considering the weekly MNOTER during tea harvest scheduling,the competitiveness of tea producers in sales prices will increase asfactory resources will be used more efﬁciently. •Considering the capacities of the purchase location is important forthe sake of not losing the harvest, efﬁcient use of the receiving places,and the sustainability of the farmer-factory relationship. In addition,as a result of analysing the occupancy rates of the reception place, itmay be considered to make the purchase locations with low CURvalue inactive on certain days. In this way, the shipping program canbecome more efﬁcient.•The case study proven that considering the farmers' harvest day pref-erences during harvest scheduling will not create any cost to the fac-tory. On the contrary, considering farmers' preferences is important toincrease sustainability in agriculture.•Compliance with farmers' harvest day preferences and accordinglypurchasing the farmers' harvest from the purchase locations will in-crease the preferability of tea-producing companies. As a result, com-panies will increase their competitiveness and get one step ahead inthe market.5. ConclusionIn the study, a harvest optimization for sustainable agriculture wascarried out. Two mathematical models have been developed for tea har-vest scheduling. One of these models only optimizes factory resources,while another aims to comply with factory resources and farmer prefer-ences as much as possible. A case study was conducted in a region with3392 decares teaﬁelds, 12 tea receiving places and a factory. The sched-ule created with the models is compared in terms of the number of ex-peditions made by the factory vehicles and the adaptation to the daypreferences of the farmers. According to the mathematical model,which only considers the number of expeditions of factory vehicles, itTable 12According to the results of the model that considers the preference of the farmers and theweekly MNOTER, compliance to the day preferences of farmers in all purchase location.PurchaselocationNumberof farmersNumberof prefersNumber ofcomplienceRate ofcomplience1 116 267 263 98.50%2 114 255 250 98.04%3 101 199 193 96.98%4 45 86 83 96.51%5 54 124 120 96.77%6 15 69 69 100%7 42 115 112 97.39%8 148 282 277 98.23%9 128 319 316 99.06%10 101 250 243 97.20%11 71 139 133 95.68%12 53 149 142 95.30%

43is seen that 87 expeditions per week are required and the rate of adap-tation to farmer preferences is 52.13%. In the model, which considersthe day preferences of farmers and factory vehicles, it was seen thatwhile the number of expeditions remained the same, the rate of adapta-tion to farmers' day preferences increased from 52.13% to 97.65%. Thisresult shows that considering the farmers' day preferences does notnegatively impact the factory and can increase sustainability and incen-tives in agriculture. Companies can increase their preference by consid-ering the farmers' harvest day preferences and get one step ahead in themarket.In future studies, vehicle routing and personnel scheduling prob-lems may also be included in the tea harvest scheduling problem. Itcan be decided which days the farmers will harvest, which routethe factory's vehicles will follow, and which purchase locations willstop. Staff scheduling studies can be carried out for drivers and pur-chase location ofﬁcers. The effect of making farmers' buying placesﬂexible on the rate of adaptation to their day preferences can be ex-amined. Larger problems can be addressed, and scheduling can becarried out for all reception locations connected to the factory. Asthe complexity of models increases, solutions can be realized withheuristic methods.CRediT authorship contribution statementBedirhan Sarımehmet:Data Curation, Methodology, Resources,Software, Writing - original draft.HacıMehmet Alakaş:Conceptualiza- tion, Supervision, Writing - review & editing.
