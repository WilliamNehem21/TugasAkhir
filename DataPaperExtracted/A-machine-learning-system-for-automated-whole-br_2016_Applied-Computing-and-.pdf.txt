Characterised by sudden bursts of excess elec-tricity in the brain, manifesting as seizures, epilepsy is still not well understoodwhen compared with other neurological disorders. Seizures often happen unex-pectedly and attempting to predict them has been a research topic for the last30 years. Electroencephalograms have been integral to these studies, as therecordings that they produce can capture the brain’s electrical signals. The diag-nosis of epilepsy is usually made by a neurologist, but can be difﬁcult to make inthe early stages. Supporting para-clinical evidence obtained from magnetic reso-nance imaging and electroencephalography may enable clinicians to make adiagnosis of epilepsy and instigate treatment earlier. However, electroencephalo-gram capture and interpretation is time consuming and can be expensive due tothe need for trained specialists to perform the interpretation. Automated

1. Introduction
Epilepsy is a chronic condition of the brain, and causes repeated seizures, com-monly referred to as ﬁts. Epilepsy is said to affect 70 million people worldwide[19]. The risk of developing epilepsy is greatest at the extremes of life with inci-dences more common in the elderly than the young[18]and is the cause of prema- ture mortality for those suffering with the condition[19].
Seizures can be focal (partial) and exist in one part of the brain only, or they canbe general and affect both halves of the brain. During a focal seizure, the personmay be conscious and unaware that a seizure is taking place, or they may haveuncontrollable movements or unusual feelings and sensations. A diagnosis ofepilepsy is made with the help of an electroencephalogram (EEG). EEGrecordings are commonly visualised as charts of electrical energy produced by the brain andplotted against time[16].
The majority of previous works on seizure detection and prediction havefocused on patient-speciﬁc predictors, where a classiﬁer is trained on one personand tested on the same person[13,10,25,26,63,9]. In this paper, the emphasis ison using EEG classiﬁcation to generalise detection across all regions of the brainusing multiple subject records.
A whole-brain seizure detection approach supports para-clinical evidenceobtained from magnetic resonance imaging and EEG to make a diagnosis ofepilepsy and instigate treatment earlier. It helps to mitigate the difﬁculties associ-ated with the capture and interpretation of electroencephalogram by neurologists.In this paper, a robust data processing methodology is adopted and several clas-siﬁers are trained and evaluated, using 342 EEG segments extracted from the EEGrecords of 24 patients suffering with epilepsy.
The structure, of the remainder, of this paper is as follows. Section 2describes the underlying principles of EEG and the type of features extracted from EEG sig-nals. Section3discusses machine learning and its use inseizureandnon-seizure classiﬁcation, while Section4describes the evaluation. The results are discussedin Section5before the paper is concluded in Section6.A machine learning system for automated whole-brain seizure detection 712. Seizure detection and classiﬁcation
Gotman is one of the pioneers of seizure detection whose research in the area datesback to 1979. In Gotman et al.[22], he proposed a system for automatic recogni-tion of inter-ictal epileptic activity in prolonged EEG recordings using a spike andsharp wave recognition method. Extensions to this work are presented in Kofﬂerand Gotman[29], Gotman[21], Gotman[23], Qu and Gotman[51], while recent works have focussed on the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)and the correlation between cerebral hemodynamic changes and epileptic seizureevents visible in EEG[36]. More recently, he has looked at automatic seizuredetection in sEEG using high frequency activities in the wavelet domain [10].
In other studies, the most common classiﬁer used to distinguish between seizure andnon-seizureevents has been the support vector machine (SVM). Using theCHB-MIT database and a patient-speciﬁc prediction methodology, the study inShoeb[55]used a SVM classiﬁer on EEG recordings from 24 subjects. The resultsshow that a classiﬁcation accuracy of 96% forsensitivitywas produced, with a false-positive rate of 0.08 per hour. In a similar study ﬁve records from theCHB-MIT dataset (containing 65seizures) were evaluated using a linear dis-criminant analysis classiﬁer[28]. The overall accuracy reported was 91.8%,83.6% forsensitivity, and 100% forspeciﬁcity. For similar SVM studies usingother datasets the reader is referred to[55,28,44,62].
Acharya et al. focused on using entropies for EEGseizuredetection and seven different classiﬁers[6]. The best-performing classiﬁer was the Fuzzy Sugeno clas-siﬁer, which achieved 99.4% forsensitivity, 100% forspeciﬁcity, and 98.1% for overall accuracy. The worst performing classiﬁer was the Naı ¨ve Bayes Classiﬁer, which achieved 94.4% forsensitivity, 97.8% forspeciﬁcity, and 88.1% for accura- cy. Nasehi and Pourghassem[43]used the same CHB-MIT dataset with a ParticleSwarm Optimisation Neural Network (PSONN) which produced 98% for sensi- tivityand a false-positive rate of 0.125 per hour. Using the FRE
1dataset Yuan et al. presented a patient-speciﬁcseizuredetection system and an extrememachine-learning algorithm to train a neural network [65]. Twenty-one seizure records were used to train the classiﬁer and 65 for testing. The results show thatthe system achieved an average of 91.92% forsensitivity, 94.89% forspeciﬁcity and 94.9% for overall accuracy.
Patel et al.[49]proposed a low power, real-time classiﬁcation algorithm, fordetecting seizures in ambulatory EEG. The study compared linear discriminantanalysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), Mahalanobis dis-criminant analysis (MDA), and SVM classiﬁers on 13 subjects from the FRE data-set. The results show that the LDA gave the best results when trained and testedon a single patient, with 94.2% forsensitivity, 77.9% forspeciﬁcity, and 87.7% for overall accuracy. When generalised across all subjects, the results show 90.9% forsensitivity, 59.5% forspeciﬁcity, and 76.5% for overall accuracy.

Electroencephalography is the term given to the recording of electrical activityresulting from ionic current ﬂows generated by neurons in the brain and is mainlyused to evaluate seizures and epilepsy. In order to retrieve EEG signals, electrodesare placed on the scalp where odd numbered electrodes are placed on the left sideof the scalp and even numbered electrodes on the right. Electrode locations andnames are speciﬁed by the International 10–20 system [55].
The collection of raw EEG signals is always temporal. However, for analysisand feature extraction purposes, translation, into other domains, is possible andoften required. These include frequency representations, via Fourier Transform [42,37,24,12]and wavelet transform[12,32,40,17,14,39]. The advantage of frequen- cy-related parameters is that they are less susceptible to signal quality variations,due to electrode placement or the physical characteristics of subjects [38].
In order to obtain frequency parameters, several studies have used Power Spec-tral Density (PSD). Within PSD,Peak Frequencyis one of the features consideredin many studies. It describes the frequency of the highest peak in the PSD. During a seizure, EEG signals tend to contain a major cyclic component, which showsitself as a dominant peak in thefrequency domain. In one example, Aarabi et al.usedPeak Frequency, along withsample entropyand other amplitude features,to detect epileptic seizures and achieved asensitivityof 98.7% and a false detectionrate of 0.27 per hour[3].
Meanwhile, Ning and Lyu[45]found thatMedian Frequencydisplayed sig- niﬁcant differences betweenseizureandnon-seizurepatients. By segmenting theEEG signal into ﬁve separate frequency bands fordelta(d: 0.56f64 Hz),theta (h:46f68 Hz),alpha(a:86f612 Hz):beta(b:1 26f625 Hz), andgamma (c:2 56f), it was possible to predict 79 of 83seizures, with asensitivityvalue of 95.2%.
Root mean square(RMS) has also been considered a useful feature for distin-guishing betweenseizureandnon-seizureevents.RMSmeasures the magnitude of the varying quantity and is a good signal strength estimator in EEG frequencybands[5]. In a study on neonatalseizuredetection[50], 21 features forseizureclas- siﬁcation were compared, which sawRMSachieves an overall accuracy of77.71%. The study showed thatRMSoutperformed all the other features used.
Entropyhas been used as a measure of the complexity, or uncertainty, of anEEGsignal, where the more chaotic the signal is, the higher the entropy. There are two kinds ofentropyestimators:spectral entropies, which use the amplitude of the power spectrum; andsignal entropies, which use the time series directly[27]. Many authors agree that during aseizure, the brain activity is more pre-dictable than during a normal,non-seizure, phase and this is reﬂected by a suddendrop in theentropyvalue[46,47,61,66].
Energyis a measure of the EEG signal strength. Rather than looking at theenergyof the whole EEG signal, the energy distribution across frequency bandsA machine learning system for automated whole-brain seizure detection 73has been used inseizuredetection[46]. The study found thatdeltaandthetafre- quency bands saw a much larger distribution of energy during a seizure comparedto normal EEG, whereas thealpha,betaandgammafrequency bands saw a lowerenergydistribution during aseizure. Using theenergydistribution, per frequency band, as a feature achieved an overall accuracy of 94%.
Correlation dimensionhas been investigated as a correlation measure in severalstudies, which is anonlinearunivariate, widely used to measurefractal dimension. Fractal dimensionmeasures the complexity of the EEG signal, in other words, theregularity and divergence of the signal[33,7].I n[1]correlation dimension and ﬁveother features forseizureprediction of focal neocortical epilepsy produced reason-ably good results with 90.2% forsensitivityand 97% forspeciﬁcity. However, when looking speciﬁcally at thecorrelation dimensionthey found the results dropped in 44.9% ofseizuresand increased in the pre-ictal phase in 44.9% ofsei- zures. They also found that there were stronger dimension changes in the remotechannels compared with those near the seizure onset.
In[8]correlation dimensionand the largestLyapunov exponentwere studied to determine their ability to detectseizures. The study showed that neither measureon its own was useful for the task, but did work better, when they were usedtogether. They also noted thatcorrelation dimensionwas only useful when appliedto the frequency sub-bands (delta,theta,alpha,beta, andgamma), and not on the entire 0–60 Hz frequency spectrum that was used in the study. The authors con-cluded that changes in dynamics are not spread out across the entire spectrum,but are limited to certain frequency bands.
Skewnessis a third-order statistical moment, andkurtosisis the fourth. Along with the ﬁrst and second order moments,meanandvariance, respectively, the four statistical moments provide information on the amplitude distribution of a time series. Speciﬁcally,skewnessandkurtosisgive an indication of the shape of the dis-tribution[4]. Khan et al. useskewnessandkurtosis, along with normalised coefﬁ-cient of variation, forseizuredetection in paediatric patients. They managed todetect all 55 seizures from a subset of 10 patients, achieving 100% sensitivity, with a false detection rate of 1.1 per hour.
4. Automated whole-brain seizure detection
The aim of most studies, in EEG detection, has been to detect patient-speciﬁc focalseizures, rather than predicting generalseizuresacross a much bigger population.As Shoeb[55]explains, aseizureEEG pattern is speciﬁc to a particular patient.The main reason for this is that focal seizures can occur in any part of the brain,and therefore, can only be detected in the EEG on speciﬁc channels. A classiﬁertrained on a patient who experiences focalseizuresin the occipital lobes, for exam-ple, would no doubt be trained on features from channels, including electrodes O1, andO2(electrodes to monitor electrical activity in the occipital lobe), as these74 P. Fergus et al.would be the channels from the area of theseizureand therefore, best at detectingtheseizure.
For this reason, and due to the conﬁguration of the dataset, this study focuseson discriminating betweenseizureandnon-seizureEEGs across a group of 24 sub-jects. The classiﬁers are trained on all patient records and therefore, classiﬁcationis generalised across all subjects using features from channels that capture theEEG in all parts of the brain.
The approach utilises machine learning algorithms embedded in-line with exist-ing clinical systems to enhance clinical practices in epilepsy diagnostics. The pro-posed algorithms support para-clinical evidence obtained from magneticresonance imaging and electroencephalography to alleviate the capture and inter-pretation of electroencephalogram and help reduce costs, by minimising the needfor trained specialists to perform the interpretation. The approach provides auto-mated detection of correlates of seizure activity generalised across different regionsof the brain and across multiple subjects.
4.1. Methodology
TheCHB-MITdataset is a publicly available database from physionet.org thatcontains 686 scalp EEG recordings from 23 patients treated at the Children’sHospital in Boston. The subjects had anti-seizure medication withdrawn, andEEG recordings were taken for up to several days after.
The EEG recordings are divided among 24 cases (one patient has two sets ofEEG recordings 1.5 years apart). The patients range between 1.5 and 22 yearsof age, and there are 5 males and 17 females. Case 24 was added after the originaldataset was collected and has no patient data.
Most of the recordings are one hour long, although those belonging to case 10are two hours and those belonging to cases 4, 6, 7, 9, and 23 are four hours long.Records that contain at least one seizure are classed as seizurerecords and those that contain no seizures asnon-seizurerecords. Of the 686 records, 198 containseizures.
Although the description supplied with the dataset states that recordings werecaptured using the international 10–20 system of EEG electrode positions andnomenclature, it was found that 17 of the ﬁles that contained seizureshad different channel montages to the rest of the seizure ﬁles. Therefore, these 17 records havebeen excluded from this study, leaving 181 seizure ﬁles. A further 10 records wereremoved from the dataset due to a large number of missing data.
The ﬁnal dataset used in this study was constructed from 60-s data blocks(mean ictal length across the 171 seizure records), comprising the ictal data ( sei- zure), which were extracted from 171seizureﬁles.Table 1provides a summary of the ictal data with the 171 ictal blocks.
The results show that 25% of the data blocks (42.75 blocks) contain less than orequal to 23 s of ictal data, which means that 75% of our data blocks (128.25A machine learning system for automated whole-brain seizure detection 75blocks) contain 23 s or more of ictal data, with the average block containing 45 s ifwe consider the median. However, the data contain outliers, i.e. the Max value is752. To get a more representative summary the ﬁrst 60 s of ictal data is used fromeach seizure record that lasts longer than 60 s.Table 2provides a summary of the data.
The average block now contains 45 s if we consider the median, 40.52% if weconsider the mean. More importantly, the majority of the data blocks (64%) ofthe 171 ictal blocks contain 30 s or more of icta data. In a real-world scenario,it is unlikely that, whatever window size we select, data blocks will contain onlyictal data. The more realistic case is that it will contain both ictal and non-ictaldata. By having 60-s blocks with different ictal and non-ictal data splits, thisallows us to determine the performance of the classiﬁers under conditions morealigned with a real-world situation. However, future work will explore optimalwindow sizes. To balance the dataset, 171 data blocks randomly extracted fromnon-seizure ﬁles were also added to the dataset.
Fig. 1shows the processes used in the methodology to process the data, thatinclude ﬁltering, feature extraction, feature selection, classiﬁcation and ﬁnallyvalidation.
Each of these processes is discussed in more detail below. Fig. 1shows a data science methodology that produces a robust data analytics based solution.4.1.1. Data pre-processing
In theCHB-MITdatabase, each record was sampled at 256 Hz, with 16-bit resolu-tion. Signals were recorded simultaneously through twenty-three different chan-nels, via 19 electrodes and a ground attached to the surface of the scalp.
A bandpass ﬁlter was applied to each of the 342 EEG segments (171 seizures, 171non-seizures) to extract the EEG data in each of the frequency blocks. Secondorder butterworth ﬁlters were used as they offer good transition band character-istics at low coefﬁcient orders; thus, they can be implemented efﬁciently. Thisresults in ﬁve columns of additional data; the complete bandwidth (0.5–30 Hz),delta(d: 0.56f64 Hz),theta(h:46f68 Hz),alpha(a:86f612 Hz): andbeta

In other words, each block contains 115 columns of data foreach of the 23 EEG channels in the original data ( N= 23 * (complete bandwidth + delta + theta + alpha + beta) = 23 * 5 = 115).4.1.2. Feature selection
The feature vectors in this paper are generated from the 171 seizureﬁles and 171 non-seizureblocks, obtained from 23 patients, usingPeak Frequency,Median Fre- quency,variance,root mean squares,sample entropy,skewnessandkurtosis. These features were extracted from each of the 115 columns in an EEG block ( N= 7 fea- tures * 115 columns = 805). The literature reports that Median Frequency,sample entropyandroot mean squarehave the most potential to discriminate betweensei- zureandnon-seizurerecords. To validate these ﬁndings, the discriminant capa-bilities of each feature are determined using several measures: statistical signiﬁcance(p and q-values),principal component analysis(PCA)–Principle Com- ponent one(PC1)and Principle Component two(PC2),linear discriminant analysis independent search(LDAi),linear discriminant analysis forward search(LDAf),lin- ear discriminant analysis backward search(LDAb) andgram-schmidt(GS) analysis.
Using these measures, the top 20 uncorrelated features were extracted from allregions of the EEG scalp readings (region-by-region feature extraction is consid-ered later in the paper). For example, in the case ofp-valueswe select the top 20 uncorrelated features (from the 805 features that we have) that have the highest p- valuesand use these features with all our classiﬁers. Thetttest2function in Matlab can be used to extractp-valuesand they can be ranked using thesortfunction.Data Filtering

Figure 1Methodology data processes.A machine learning system for automated whole-brain seizure detection 77These features are then used to determine which classiﬁer performs the best. Thesame approach is used for theq-values. Themafdrfunction in Matlab can be usedto determine theq-valuesand again, they can be ranked using thesortfunction. In the case of Principle Component one (PC1), the top 20 uncorrelated features thatcomprise the most variance inPC1were selected and evaluated against all classi-ﬁers. The same approach was used forPC2. In the case of linear discriminant ana-lysis feature selection, thefeatseli,featself, andfeatselbprovided by the Matlab pattern recognition toolbox PRTools is used to provide an ordered ranking of fea-tures. In a similar way, the Gram-Schmidt ranks and orders each feature byimportance.
Table 3shows that the best results were obtained from thelinear discriminant analysis backward searchtechnique with an area under the curve (AUC)o f 91%. This was followed closely by statisticalpandq-valueswithAUCvalues of 90% and 89% respectively.
Fig. 2shows (using PCA) that several RMS andMedian Frequencyfeatures, from different channels and frequency bands, appear along the principal compo-nent. This is consistent with the ﬁndings in Ning and Lyu [45], Abdul-latif et al.[5], Paivinen et al.[47]. The vertical axis shows that CH12_48_Var, CH9_48_Var, andCH3_0530_MFreq features align closest with the second principal component.Again, these results are consistent with the ﬁndings in Ning and Lyu [45], Abdul-latif et al.[5], Paivinen et al.[47].
This study also extracts the top ﬁve uncorrelated features from each of the ﬁveregions covered by theEEGscalp electrodes as shown inTable 4. This ensures that each region is represented without the bias from all other regions, and allows clas-siﬁers to detect focal seizures in different parts of the brain. The features extracted,using the generalised and region-by-region approach, are used to evaluate thecapabilities of several classiﬁers considered in this study and are the top ﬁve fea-tures per region selected based on their rank determined by the linear discriminantbackward search technique, creating ﬁve feature sets containing ﬁve features each.The top 20 uncorrelated features and the 25 region-by-region features are com-pared in the evaluation.

Fergus et al.4.1.3. Classiﬁcation
Following an analysis of the literature, the study in this paper adopts simple, yetpowerful algorithms. These include thelinear discriminant classiﬁer(LDC), quadratic discriminant classiﬁer(QDC),uncorrelated normal density based classiﬁer(UDC),polynomial classiﬁer(POLYC),logistic classiﬁer(LOGLC),k-nearest neighbour(KNNC),decision tree(TREEC),parzen classiﬁer(PARZENC) and thesupport vector machine(SVC)[61].4.1.4. Validation methods
In order to determine the overall accuracy of each of the classiﬁers several valida-tion techniques have been considered. These include Holdout Cross-Validation, Sensitivities,Speciﬁcities,Receiver Operating Curve(ROC) andarea under the curve(AUC). The Holdout Cross-Validation technique uses 80 per cent of ran-domly selected observations (N= 19.2) to train the algorithms and 20 per centof randomly selected test cases to test the algorithms ( N= 3.8).
5. Evaluation
5.1. Results using top twenty uncorrelated features ranked using LDA backwardsearch feature selection
In the ﬁrst evaluation, the top twenty uncorrelated features, extracted from eachof the frequency bands within each of the EEG channels, and nine classiﬁersare used. The performance for each classiﬁer is evaluated using the sensitivity, speciﬁcity,mean error,standard deviationandAUCvalues with 100 simulationsand randomly selected training and testing sets for each simulation. In this study,
Figure 2PCAforMedian FrequencyandRMSfeature discrimination.A machine learning system for automated whole-brain seizure detection 79highsensitivitiesare important to ensure that seizures can be detected within analarm system. Highspeciﬁcitiesare considered equally important as high falsealarm rates (more than 1 per hour) will deter doctors from using it.5.1.1. Classiﬁer performance
The ﬁrst evaluation uses all theseizureandnon-seizureblocks from all subjects in theCHB-MITdataset (171seizuresand 171non-seizures). The simulations use 80% for training and 20% for testing.Table 5, shows the mean averages obtainedover 100 simulations for thesensitivity,speciﬁcity, andAUC.
As shown inTable 5, thesensitivities(seizure), in this initial test, are low for allclassiﬁers. This is interesting given that the dataset is balanced between seizureand non-seizureblocks. One possible reason for this is that theictallength across the 171 records was 60 s. However, in theCHB-MITrecordsictalperiods ranged between 2 and 752 (cut down to 60 s) seconds. It is possible that some ictalblocks resemblenon-seizurerecords resulting in misclassiﬁcation (particularly blocks thatcontain 2 s ofictaldata). However, given that 64% of the ictal blocks containmore than 30 s of icta data, this is appropriate for training. Furthermore, it is adecision that is supported by the relatively highsensitivity,speciﬁcityand AUCTable 4Top ﬁve features for the ﬁve scalp regions.Feature set Description Features1 Top 5 features from region 1 RMS CH2 0.5–30 Hz Samp entropy CH2 0.5–4 HzRMS CH2 4–8 HzRMS CH2 0.5–4 HzSamp entropy CH1 0.5–4 Hz 2 Top 5 features from region 2 RMS CH16 0.5–30 Hz RMS CH16 0.5–4 HzRMS CH12 12–30 HzRMS CH16 12–30 HzRMS CH16 4–8 Hz 3 Top 5 features from region 3 RMS CH3 0.5–30 Hz RMS CH3 0.5–4 HzRMS CH4 4–8 HzMed Freq CH3 0.5–4 HzRMS CH4 0.5–30 Hz 4 Top 5 features from region 4 RMS CH18 4–8 Hz RMS CH18 0.5–30 HzRMS CH17 0.5–30 HzRMS CH17 0.5–4 HzRMS CH18 0.5–4 Hz 5 Top 5 features from region 5 RMS CH21 0.5–30 Hz RMS CH21 4–8 HzRMS CH21 12–30 HzRMS CH21 8–12 HzRMS CH21 0.5–4 Hz80 P.

The results show that all techniques are able to achieve a classiﬁcation error,lower than the base-rate error of 50% (i.e. 171/342).5.1.2. Model selection
The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve shows the cut-off values for thefalse negative and false-positive rates.Fig. 3indicates that several of the classiﬁersperformed reasonably well. TheAUCvalues inTable 4support these ﬁndings with good accuracy values for theLOGLCandKNNCclassiﬁers.
5.2. Results using top ﬁve uncorrelated features ranked using lda backward searchfeature selection from ﬁve head regions
In the second evaluation, the top ﬁve uncorrelated features, extracted from ﬁvemain regions across the head, are used to determine whether the detection of sei- zurescan be improved. Again, the performance for each classiﬁer is evaluatedusing thesensitivity,speciﬁcity,mean error,standard deviationandAUCvalues with 100 simulations and randomly selected training and testing sets for eachsimulation.Table 5Classiﬁer performance results for top 20 uncorrelated features.Classiﬁer Sensitivity (%) Speciﬁcity (%) AUC (%)LDC 70 83 54QDC 65 92 62UDC 39 95 65POLYC 70 83 83LOGLC 79 86 89KNNC 84 85 91TREEC 78 80 86PARZENC 61 86 54SVC 79 86 88

The simulations use 80% for training and 20% for testing. As shown in Table 7, thesensitivities(seizure), for most of the algorithms have improved, including thespeciﬁcitiesvalues. TheAUCresults also show improvements for several of theclassiﬁers, with 93% achieved by theKNNCclassiﬁer. From the previous results,we ﬁnd a 4% increase insensitivities, a 3% increase inspeciﬁcitiesand a 2% increase in the performance of theKNNCclassiﬁer, with other classiﬁers improv-ing by similar values.
Again, the results inTable 8show that themean errorhas decreased by 3% using theholdouttechnique. This indicates that using a region-by-region approachis better at discriminating betweenseizureandnon-seizureevents.
Overall, themean errorsproduced, using all of the validation techniques, aresigniﬁcantly lower than the expected error, which is 171/342, i.e. 50%.5.2.2. Model selection
Again, theROCcurve shows the cut-off values for the false-negative and false-positive rates.Fig. 4indicates that the performance of several classiﬁers improved.TheAUCvalues inTable 7support these ﬁndings with theKNNCclassiﬁer show- ing a 2% increase in performance.

The study has focused on discriminating betweenseizureandnon-seizureEEG records across a group of 23 subjects, rather than a single individual. The classi-ﬁers are trained using all 24 cases, and therefore, classiﬁcation is generalised acrossthe whole population contained in the CHB-MIT database. To achieve this, fea-tures from all the channels that capture the EEG in all parts of the brain wereused. In the initial classiﬁcation results, the top 20 uncorrelated features fromthe whole of the head (not region-by-region) were extracted from 805 possible fea-tures. This was determined using thelinear discriminant analysis backward searchtechnique to rank features. This approach achieved reasonably good results, usingtheKNNCclassiﬁer, with 84% forsensitivity, 85% forspeciﬁcity, 91% for the AUC, with a global error of 15%.
Interestingly, the features used in this initial evaluation, involved channels fromthe four lobes of the brain,occipital,parietal,frontal, andtemporal, but not the channels spread across the centre of the head. This implied that rather than havinggeneralised seizures across the whole of the brain, a majority of focal seizuresoccurred in each of the lobes. Unlike studies that used the BONN dataset, whichonly contains one channel, or the FRE dataset, that contains six channels andTable 8Cross validation results from top ﬁve uncorrelated features from ﬁve regions.Classiﬁer 80% Holdout: 100 repetitions Err SD LDC 0.16 0.04 QDC 0.14 0.04 UDC 0.29 0.04 POLYC 0.16 0.04 LOGLC 0.17 0.04 KNNC 0.12 0.03 TREEC 0.18 0.05 PARZENC 0.13 0.04 SVC 0.14 0.03
Figure 4Received operator curve for top ﬁve uncorrelated features from ﬁve head regions.A machine learning system for automated whole-brain seizure detection 83identiﬁes focal and extra focal channels, the CHB-MIT database used in this studycontains 23 channels with no information on the seizure type or location.
Using the top ﬁve uncorrelated features from EEG channels speciﬁc to the ﬁvemain regions of the head improved thesensitivitiesandspeciﬁcities, while produc- ing high AUC values. The best classiﬁcation algorithm was again the KNNC clas-siﬁer, which achieved 88% forsensitivity, 88% forspeciﬁcity, and an AUC value of 93% with a 12% global error. This was followed closely by the SVC classiﬁer,which achieved 85% for sensitivity, 86% for speciﬁcity, and an AUC value of 90%with a 14% global error.
Comparing our results with other studies, we ﬁnd that Shoeb [55]produced a better sensitivity value (96%) than those reported in this study. However, theirapproach utilised a SVM classiﬁer trained and tested on an individual patientand was not concerned with the generalisation of seizures across a bigger popula-tion group. Consequently, the 88% sensitivity value produced in this paperappears to be extremely good given that our classiﬁers were trained and testedon data from 23 different patients, not just one. In a similar study, Nasehi andPourghassem[43]used a neural network and reported asensitivityvalue of 98%, which again is higher than the results reported in this study. However, aswith the work of Shoeb, the classiﬁers were trained and tested on speciﬁc patients.
In comparison with other studies that adopted a similar approach to our study,our approach produced better overall results. For instance, Khan et al. [28]report a 83.6%speciﬁcityvalue, while Patel et al.[49]report 94% forsensitivity, 77.9% forspeciﬁcity, and 87.7% for overall accuracy. Yuan et al.[66]report 91.72% for sensitivity, 94.89% forspeciﬁcity, and 94.9% for accuracy, while Aarabi et al.[2], Kannathal et al.[27], report similar results. The results found in this paper can becompared in more detail with the papers listed inTable 9.
This work has potential future clinical applications in the investigation ofpatients with suspectedseizuredisorders and may be useful in the assessment ofpatients with non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD). Introducing automated sei-zure detection technologies could help increase capacity within healthcare systemssuch as the UKs National Health Service (NHS), which currently suffers from achronic shortage of trained clinical neurophysiologists to interpret EEGs. Tele-EEG reporting has previously been suggested as a solution and more recentlyonline systems[20,41], which are interesting approaches, but carry increased costsand concerns over data security. Nonetheless, these, including automated seizuredetection may be viable solutions, following further work aimed at improvingaccuracy further.
7. Conclusions and future work
Within a supervised-learning paradigm, this study has addressed this challenge byutilising EEG signals to classify seizure and non-seizure records. Our approachposits a new method for generalising seizure detection across different subjects84 P.

Our results show animprovement on existing studies with 88% for sensitivity, 88% for speciﬁcityand 93% for the area under the curve, with a 12% global error, using the k-NN classiﬁer.
The results suggest that the algorithms in-situ with existing clinical systems andpractices may enable clinicians to make a diagnosis of epilepsy and instigate treat-ment earlier. It can help to reduce costs by limiting the number of trained special-ists required to perform the interpretation by automating the detection ofcorrelates of seizure activity generalised across different regions of the brain andacross multiple subjects.
There are a large number of features reported in the literature, which have notbeen considered in this paper. In particular our future work will consider the set offeatures described in Logesparan et al.[34], Logesparan et al.[35]. Furthermore, our future work will investigate the use of more advanced machine learning algo-rithms, despite the good performance of the classiﬁers considered in this paper. Inparticular, we will investigate the use of convolutional neural networks [53]and SVM with different kernels[54].
Window sizes will also be considered to determine whether further improve-ments on accuracies can be made. Future development will also utilise regressionanalysis and a larger number of observations. This may help to deﬁne the charac-teristics of the pre-ictal phase. In addition, more advanced classiﬁcation algo-rithms, and techniques, will be considered, including advanced artiﬁcial neuralnetwork architectures (higher order and spiking neural networks). The investiga-tion and comparison, of features, such as fractal dimension and cepstrum analysis,autocorrelation zero crossing and correlation dimension, have also not been per-formed. These techniques should be investigated in a head-to-head comparison,with linear methods.
The paper has investigated the use of classic yet powerful machine learningalgorithms and evaluated their ability to detect correlates of seizure activity. Whilethe results are convincing the paper does not address how the system can be gen-eralised for normal use. Furthermore, it does not address real-time concerns whereperformance will degraded signiﬁcantly. The approach evaluates the algorithmsusing ofﬂine data; however, this is not a good indicator of the system’s abilityas the signals that are used to train and test the algorithms are processed andcleaned and appropriate features extracted. This is a major concern and our futurework will look to implement the methodology pipeline using real-time signals,using advances in the Internet of Things and Big Data community that currentlyutilise data processing technologies, such as Apache Spark.
Finally, there are concerns regarding the veriﬁcation of the results producedusing the CHB-MIT dataset against other datasets. Our future work will investi-gate the use of a bigger dataset, using patients provided by our co-author fromThe Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust, and other datasets that permit accessto verify the ﬁndings in this paper.86 P. Fergus et al.Overall, the study demonstrates that classiﬁcation algorithms provide an inter-esting line of enquiry, when separating seizure and non-seizure records.
