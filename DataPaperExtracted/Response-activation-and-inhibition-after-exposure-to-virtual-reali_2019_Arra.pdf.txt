The widespread availability of affordable head-mounted displays and easy access to virtual reality (VR) appli-cations and games has signiﬁcantly increased the use of such technology by the general public. Thus there isincreasing interest in determining any risks of using such technology and any aftereffect from exposure. Head-mounted display manufacturers provide general usage guidance but this is ad hoc and there is limited recentevidence comparing early virtual environment studies with experiences from modern head-mounted displays. Theprimary objective of this study was to explore response activation and inhibition after participants experienced atypical virtual environment in a head-mounted display. Reaction times were collected with a robust cued go/nogotest as pre- and post-tests. Participants (n ¼22, female¼11) played Minecraft VR for 15 minutes using an Oculus Rift headset. In contrast to other studies, the results showed no signi ﬁcant impact on reaction times across response activation or inhibition. However, evidence of participant fatigue in the reaction time tests was found.This work conﬁrms safe use of virtual reality experiences in modern head-mounted displays for short durationexposures and identiﬁes issues with reaction time testing that are in need of further investigation.
1. IntroductionThere is increasing use of virtual reality technology and the immer-sive experiences that such technology can provide. Much of this has beendriven by the advent of affordable, commercially available virtual reality(VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) [ 1]. HMDs encapsulate the visual senses and provide the user with altered, i.e. virtual, experiences. Theseexperiences can be very realistic and many users experience states ofpresence and immersion [2]. However, a signiﬁcant portion of the pop- ulation suffer negative effects from VR technology use, commonlyreferred to as cybersickness [3]. This can happen in situ and linger postusage. Cybersickness is associated with feelings of illness, discomfort,dizziness and unease [4]. With the widespread availability of VR tech-nology there is a need to quantify any negative impacts and considerhealth and safety implications [5,6], even for short exposures. Althoughthere is considerable research on cybersickness, there has been lessattention paid to the impact on behavioural control, inhibitory effects [ 7] and reaction time, or“speed of action”[8]. Our concern is the impact on post VR exposure activities that rely on such activation mechanisms forinformation processing, for example driving vehicles or cycling.Inhibitory effects have been researched over numerous substanceexposures, for example alcohol [7], cocaine [9] and energy drinks withand without alcohol [10]. The current work explores HMD usage forimmersive virtual environments as the exposure condition. Our researchfollows Fillmore’s protocol [7] with two primary measures of interestbeing participant’s failures to inhibit responses (failures of response in-hibition) and their speed of responding (response activation) afterexperiencing a short exposure (15 min) to an immersive virtual envi-ronment. The aim is not to deﬁne new HMD guidelines but to provide anevidence-based approach to measuring the impact of short duration HMDusage. Contributions of this work include (i) measuring HMD impact in arealistic real-world use of VR technology, in this case use of commercialoff-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software, and duration of use withinVR manufacturers’guidelines, and (ii) use of a robust reaction time testand protocol [7] to determine the impact of VR technology on activationmechanisms for information processing.2.

However, what constitutes a good“limit”is unclear as the impact of VR technology can depend on thetechnology used, the nature of the environment being experienced [ 11] and the physical, cognitive and emotional state of the user [ 4]. An ad hoc time guide of 15 minutes for initial exposure to new VR environments istypically used. Example guidance with common HMD technologyinclude:/C15Oculus Rift:“Ease into the use of the headset to allow your body toadjust; use for only a few minutes at a time at ﬁrst, and only increase the amount of time using the headset gradually as you grow accus-tomed to virtual reality.”“Take at least a 10–15 min break every 30 min, even if you don’t think you need it. Each person is different, sotake more frequent and longer breaks if you feel discomfort. Youshould decide what works best for you. ”[12]. /C15HTC VIVE:“Prolonged, uninterrupted use of the product should beavoided. It may negatively impact hand-eye coordination, balance,and/or cause other negative effects. While using the productfrequently and for prolonged periods of time, you may experiencetiredness or soreness in your muscles, joints, or other body parts. Takeregular breaks from using the product. The length and frequency ofnecessary breaks may vary from person to person. ”[13]. /C15Samsung Gear VR:“Ease into the use of the Gear VR to allow yourbody to adjust; use for only a few minutes at a time at ﬁrst, and only increase the amount of time using the Gear VR gradually as you growaccustomed to virtual reality.”“Take at least a 10–15 min break every 30 min, even if you don’t think you need it.

Youshould decide what works best ”[14]./C15Google Daydream:“Take the time to get adjusted to the virtual realityexperience before using Daydream View extensively. Begin by usingDaydream View for only a few minutes at a time. Use that time to getadjusted to how the device reacts to your movements. As you becomeaccustomed to the virtual reality experience, you can begin increasingthe amount of time you use Daydream View. Take frequent breakswhile using Daydream View. If you experience nausea, discomfort,eye strain, or disorientation, immediately discontinue usingDaydream View. Each person reacts differently to virtual reality soyou should base the frequency and length of breaks on what is rightfor you.”[15]./C15Sony PlayStationVR:“Avoid prolonged use of PS VR. Take frequentbreaks.”“Avoid prolonged use of PS VR. Take a 15-min break duringeach hour of play.”[16
].2.2. Virtual reality exposure impactThe negative impact of VR use has received the most attention inareas which traditionally had high use of the technology, for examplevirtual environmentﬂight simulators and early VR entertainment cen-tres. In the former, many air force bases have mandatory groundingpolicies for pilots after virtual environment simulation use from 12 to 24hours. In the later, VR entertainment centres often require users not todrive for at least 30–45 minutes after exposure [17]. However, the dif- ference between these two environments is the length of exposure timewith entertainment users only spending minutes in the VR experiencecompared to potentially hours for pilots. However, the recent widespreadavailability of affordable HMD technology has increased public use andexposure to VR experiences.The negative impact of engagement with virtual reality technologyand virtual environments is typically considered in the context ofcybersickness, which include symptoms of nausea, eye strain, pale skin,cold sweats, vomiting, disorientation, headache, increased salivation andfatigue [3,11,17].Cybersickness as a result of HMD use has been an ongoing researchtopic (recent reviews on cybersickness include Davis et al. [ 11] and Rebenitsch and Owen [3]). Early work in this area also noted aftereffects[18–20]. Stanney et al. [20] explored HMD-based VR exposure durationsof 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes and found that if a 95% HMD-based solutionwas required, virtual environment duration would need to be limited toless than 15 minutes. So and Lo [18] found that“In the absence of scene oscillation, viewing a stationary virtual environment for up to 15 minutesis not likely to cause a signiﬁcant increase in the nausea level. ”Although using signiﬁcantly different technology, Virtual Research V6 with VirtualiO! Tracker [20] and VR4 LCD HMD with Polhemus FastTrack headtracking [18], these thresholds are similar to those promoted by currentVR technology manufacturers.Most cybersickness research measures the effect by use of question-naires, e.g. the simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) [ 21], postural instability [22], or more recently biometric and physiological states [ 23, 24]. Recent work has also explored impacts on cognitive performance [ 4, 24,25].Nalivaiko et al. [24] and Nesbitt et al. [25] found a signiﬁcant relation between reaction time and cybersickness. They found prolongation ofsimple reaction time of 20–50 ms after up to 14 minutes in a virtual re-ality roller-coaster (the 14 minutes was an upper limit on exposure assubjects could terminate the experience early due to nausea sensations).However, both these studies used intentionally provocative VR envi-ronments, i.e. roller-coaster simulations, to elicit cybersickness symp-toms; used environments that had limited interaction, e.g. theroller-coaster experience was “on rails”with only head tracking; used a relatively old HMD, in this case an Oculus Rift Development Kit 1 (DK1);and applied a simple 40 trial/2 minute reaction time test, i.e. theDeary-Liewald reaction time task [26].Mittelstaedt, Wacker and Stelling [1] also found simple reaction times and choice reaction times deteriorated after VR exposure. They used themost recent Oculus Rift Commercial Version 1 (CV1) HMD and interac-tion was closer to realistic use with participants using either a physicalbike ergometer (bike/HMD) or an Xbox One Controller (gamepad/HMD)for HMD conditions. The Deary-Liewald reaction time task [ 26] was used to collect reaction time data. Participants completed three 90 secondbiking tasks followed by a simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ)symptom rating task. The participants spent a total of “about 10 minute in VR”[1].In the work reported here, we have explored a more real-world, orecological valid [27], use of VR HMD through the use of COTS hardwareand software. This is representative of the more widespread use of VRHMD technology as might be found at a trade show, gaming convention,shop demonstration or causal home use. Our interest is in short duration(15 minutes) HMD use and exploring any inhibition impact or delayedresponse activation in this context. Thus the aim is to pair a real-world VRHMD interactive experience, across travel, selection and manipulationinteractions, with a robust reaction time test.3. Method3.1. ParticipantsParticipants were recruited until 22 volunteers (11 female) completedthe HMD task. Three additional male volunteers could not complete 15minutes in the HMD and were excluded from the study (see the Resultssection). The 22 volunteers that completed the HMD task had a mean ageof 24.59 years (SD¼5.05). All participants had normal or corrected tonormal vision with contact lenses. Participants with glasses wereexcluded as some glasses frames do notﬁt under the HMD. The study was approved by the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Com-mittee (HREC #H-2017-0170).3.2. Apparatus3.2.1. HardwareThe virtual environment was presented on an Oculus Rift CV1 HMD.The CV1 has two separately rendered displays with a screen resolution ofS.P. Smith, E.L. Burd Array 3-4 (2019) 100010
21080/C21200 pixels for each eye and a refresh rate of 90 Hz. It allowsstereoscopic vision with a 110
/C14horizontalﬁeld of view. Head tracking is integrated into CV1 use as the device includes an accelerometer, a gy-roscope, and a magnetometer, and is tracked with a constellationtracking camera.The Oculus Rift and all software in the experiment was run on anAlienware 15 R3 laptop (Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.60Ghz, 32 GB RAM, 64-bit Windows10, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card). The laptop ’s Wi-Fi was disabled for the duration of all the experiments so that therewere no software updates (for example for Windows10 or Oculus prod-ucts) across the duration of all the experiments.3.3. Virtual reality taskMinecraft VR version 1.1.5 (Mojang,www.minecraft.net) was used as the base environment for the VR task. The aim was to provide a virtualenvironment that (i) had a low entry level for the participants, so theycould spend more time doing the task rather than learning the environ-ment; (ii) was an environment with active interaction [ 28], rather than passive, e.g. travel“on rails”or just 360
/C14viewing, but (iii) was not overly provocative to cybersickness effects, i.e. not a VR roller-coaster [ 25]. Minecraft is an open-world 3D video game that can be played in ﬁrst- person perspective where players can travel over a 3D cartoon likelandscape and utilise tools to both create and destroy environmentalcomponents and thus modify the virtual environment. Interaction in theexperiments described here was via a wired Xbox controller (gamepad).Minecraft was run in single player Creative mode (i.e. no mobs/monstersor falling damage), on easy difﬁculty and with“always day”mode. The other primary Minecraft mode is Survival where there is a day/nightcycle and at night enemy computer-controlled mobs, or monsters, spawnand can attack players.A template Minecraft world was cloned for each participant so they allstarted in the same environment and consisted of an island environmentand an example house (seeFig. 1). The VR task was for participants tobuild their own version of a house. They were given a time limit of 15minutes. The house construction process required participants to utilisetravel, selection and manipulation interaction techniques while using theHMD and gamepad.Participants had a pre-populated building material interface with allthe necessary building components in the standard Minecraft tool menu(see bottom ofFig. 1) and were encouraged to verbally discuss theirdesign and progress while in the virtual environment. The conversationduring the VR session allowed the evaluator to subtly monitor the com-fort level of participants and consider terminating the session if signs ofdistress, e.g. cybersickness, occurred [ 6].3.4. Reaction time measurementA cued go/no-go task was used to measure failures of response inhi-bition and response activation as pre and post VR exposure tests. Inquisit5 Lab (Millisecond Software,www.millisecond.com) was run on the Alienware laptop with a script implementing the cued go/no-go taskdescribed in Fillmore et al. [9]. Participants were asked to press thelaptop spacebar when they saw a green rectangle ( ¼go) but refrain from pressing the spacebar when they saw a blue rectangle ( ¼nogo). The blue and green rectangles were vertical or horizontal. The vertical rectanglehad a high probability of being green (a go trial) and the horizontalrectangle had a high probability of being blue (a nogo trial). Participantsgot information about the orientation of the rectangle ( ¼cue) shortly before the colour of the rectangle was revealed. The default Inquisit 5 Labscript was used for pre and post reaction time measures and provides afactorial design with:/C155 x Stimulus-Onset Asynchrony (SOA) (100 ms, 200 ms, 300 ms, 400ms, 500 ms)/C152 x Cue (1¼vertical, 2¼horizontal)/C152 x Target (Go, No-Go)The vertical cue go/nogo ratio is 4:1 (80% go trials, 20% no-go trials)with a higher probability of go trials after a vertical cue and the hori-zontal cue go/no-go ratio is 1:4 (20% go trials, 80% no-go trials) with ahigher probability of nogo trials after a horizontal cue. The minimumnumber of trials required to fulﬁl the above conditions is 50 and thedefault script runs 250 trials, i.e. each factor combination is repeated 5times./C15100 vertical cue-go targets (20 for each SOA); 25 vertical cue-nogotargets (5 for each SOA)/C15100 horizontal cue-nogo targets (20 for each SOA); 25 horizontal cue-go targets (5 for each SOA)For each trial, Inquisit 5 Lab logs raw data across date, time, subject,blocknum, blockcode, trialcount, trialcode, cuetype, targettype, target-condition, SOA, cuepic, targetpic, response, latency, correct, and error

3data. Each pre- and post-test of 250 cued go/no-go trials took approxi-mately 12 minutes.3.5. ProcedureEach session took approximately 90 minutes and were held individ-ually. Firstly, the research team collected signed consent forms. Secondly,the participant was given a short tutorial on the use of the Xbox gamepadwhich was to be used to interact with the Minecraft environment. Par-ticipants used the gamepad controller to brie ﬂy move around the laptop (non-VR) version of Minecraft. All participants showed aptitude innavigating and using the gamepad in less than 5 minutes.To conﬁrm that participants could easily determine the stimuluscolours of the cued go/no-go task, they performed a colour vision testthat required them to pick out the stimulus colours (green and blue) froman array of 12 colours. All participants successfully identi ﬁed green and blue coloured rectangles.Participants were then seated at the laptop and performed a practicetest on the cued go/no-go task of 15 sample trials. Participants wereinstructed to press the space key as fast as possible when the green targetappeared and not to respond to the blue target. Participants were givenno information on the relation between the rectangle orientation and thetarget colours. After the 15 trials, participants verbally con ﬁrmed that they understood the task and then competed a full 250 trial test.The participants were then shown a picture of the target house to bebuilt (Fig. 1). Minecraft VR was then run on the Alienware laptop and theparticipantsﬁtted with the Oculus Rift HMD and theﬁrst-person mode of Minecraft VR activated (seeFig. 2). A 15 minute countdown timer was setand participants then had 15 minutes to build in Minecraft VR. Partici-pants sat in a swivel chair and the evaluator ensured free movement bymanaging the Oculus Rift and gamepad controller cables during thesession.After playing Minecraft VR, the participants removed the HMD andrepeated the full 250 trial cued go/no-go task with the Inquisit 5 Labscript. Finally, they completed a demographic survey and a questionnaireto determine their susceptibility to motion sickness, i.e use of the revisedmotion sickness susceptibility questionnaire (MSSQ) [ 29]. At the end of the session, each participant waited while their pre and post VR experi-ence reaction times were compared. If the raw reaction times betweentests were signiﬁcantly different, i.e. a percentage change of greater than5% from baseline reaction time [7], the participants were advised not todrive or cycle for the next 30 min. Participants were given A$60 in su-permarket vouchers to compensate them for their time.3.6. AnalysisFillmore’s[7] protocol had two primary measures of interest beingparticipant’s failures to inhibit responses to no-go targets (failures ofresponse inhibition) and their speed of responding to go targets (responseactivation).Failure of response inhibition: This was measured as the proportion ofno-go targets in which a participant failed to inhibit a response during areaction time trial, i.e. the participant reacted to a no-go target as if it wasa go-target. Also no-go cues should support response inhibition of no-gotargets. The p-inhibition failure scores were calculated for each cuecondition (go and no-go) on each test.Response activation: This was measured by the reaction time to gotargets. The reaction time was collected as latency (ms) from the Inquisit5 Lab raw data logs of each trial.Response times of<100 ms and>900 ms were excluded from the raw data as the former indicates pre-emptive activation and the latterindicates loss of concentration/boredom and neither are indicative ofaccurate reaction times. Only 5 trials<100 (0.09%) and 9 trials>900 (0.16%) were removed across the 5500 go trials analysed. Data wascleaned and graphs produced in Excel (Ofﬁce Professional Plus 2016) and all statistical analysis performed in SPSS (version 24.0.0.1). As reactiontimes are not normally distributed, non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used to analyse the pre- and post-test data pairs.
In comparison to previous work with reaction time measures [ 4,24, 25], the cued go/no-go task used here is signi ﬁcantly longer in duration and trials, i.e. the 40 trial/2 min Deary-Liewald reaction time task versus250 trial/12 min cued go/no-go task. Also as previous work [ 19] has shown duration effects of VR exposure, in addition to full duration re-sults, we have split the pre-test and post-test results into four time pe-riods, namely pre-ﬁrst (trials 1–126), pre-second (trials 127 –250), post-ﬁrst (trials 1–126) and post-second (trials 127 –250).3.7. HypothesesOur hypotheses consider response activation and inhibition scoresacross both the general pre- and post-tests and the two time periods, ﬁrst 126 trails and second 126 trials, within each test.

We expectdecreased response activation after HMD exposure./C15H2: Pre-Post scores will show failure of response inhibition impact.We expect increased failure of response inhibition after HMDexposure./C15Pre-ﬁrst and pre-second trials will show no difference. We expectresponse activation (H3a) and response inhibition (H3b) to beconsistent across the pre-test trials./C15Post-ﬁrst and post-second trials will show a difference. We expect theresponse activation (H4a) to increase, i.e. improve, and response in-hibition to decrease (H4b) across the post-test trials. The HMDexposure should decrease over time out of the VR experience andreturn to normal.4. ResultsTwenty-two participants (female¼11) completed the VR task and completed the house building task in Minecraft VR with 15 minutes inthe Oculus Rift CV1 HMD. An additional three participants (male ¼3) did not complete the VR task and exited the virtual environment at 4, 7.3and 11.5 minutes into the experience.4.1. Motion sickness susceptibility questionnaire (MSSQ)The mean MSSQ score across the participants (n ¼22) was 21.63 (SD ¼17.03). Golding [29] noted a mean MSSQ score of 45.5 (SD¼37.6, n ¼147) as an adult reference norm. The results reported here may indi-cate that the participants are less susceptible to motion sickness than ageneral population. However, this could be due to selection bias as par-ticipants self-selected their participation based on the study descriptionthat mentioned virtual reality and computer games. Also an exclusioncriterion was for conditions that may be aggravated by use of a HMD,including vertigo, claustrophobia or epilepsy. The mean MSSQ scores ofthe participants (n¼3) who did not complete the VR task were calcu-lated at 21.67 (SD¼17.40) and thus not indicative of difference from theother participants.4.2. Response activationFor the pre-test and post-test analysis (n¼22) there was no signiﬁ- cant difference between Go cue (p¼0.36) or the NoGo cue (p¼0.57) in terms of response activation. Also reaction time activation was reduced(i.e. faster reaction times) in the post-tests than in the pre-tests (See Fig. 3 andTable 1). Therefore, H1 is refuted.In the pre-test (n¼22) for the Go cue, the second half trials (Mean ¼325.96) were signiﬁcantly higher (i.e. slower response activation) thanin theﬁrst half trials (Mean¼316.84), T¼6, p¼0.013, r¼/C00.37. This was also true for the NoGo cue with the second half trials (Mean ¼ 337.45) signiﬁcantly higher than in theﬁrst half trials (Mean¼323.88), T¼
6, p¼0.022, r¼/C00.35 (seeFig. 4). Therefore, H3a is refuted.In the post-test (n¼22) only the NoGo cue was signiﬁcantly different between the second half trials (Mean¼331.99) and theﬁrst half trials (Mean¼319.83), T¼5, p¼0.24,r¼/C00.34 (seeFig. 5). Therefore H4a is refuted for NoGo cues.4.3. Response inhibitionFor the pre-test and post-test analysis (n¼22) there was no signiﬁ- cant difference between Go cue (p¼1) or the NoGo cue (p¼0.80) in terms of response inhibition (also see Table 1). Therefore, H2 is refuted. There was also no signiﬁcant difference across theﬁrst trials, [Go cue (p¼0.71), NoGo cue (p¼1)] or second trials [Go cue (p¼0.26), NoGo cue (p¼0.76)] in terms of response inhibition. Therefore, H3b isconﬁrmed and H4b is refuted.5. DiscussionThe full group results (pre-test to post-test) showed no signi ﬁcant differences in response activation or response inhibition of the partici-pants after brief exposure to the Minecraft VR environment using anOculus Rift CV1 HMD. From one perspective this validates the health andsafety advice from VR hardware companies that there should be no illeffects after short duration use of VR technology (see Section 2.1). Our results are evidence that this is valid for response activation and inhibi-tion in a participant population that is not generally susceptible to motionsickness. However, this conclusion does need to be contextualised withthe small participant group (n¼22), although the participant group wasbalanced for gender (female¼11) which contributes to it being repre-sentative of general users. A statistical power analysis was conducted

5using G*Power (v3.1.9.4) [30]t od eﬁne the sample size requirements for the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test as used in the analysis reported here. Witha standard signiﬁcance level (
αerror probability,p/C200:05) and level of power (1/C0β¼0:8) [31], to demonstrate a large effect (r/C200:50) the suggested sample size ranges from n¼23 (Laplace parent distribution) to n¼35 (normal parent distribution). The results presented here fall justoutside this range but only by one participant pair (i.e. one female/malepair). However, follow-on work should explore female/male balancedsample sizes within this range.Also it should be noted that 3 participants (all male) did not completethe HMD component of the study. Although we were not explicitlymeasuring cybersickness, all three participants verbally indicatedincreased head temperature, which is indicative of cybersickness [ 24], and were unwilling to continue with the Minecraft VR task. Theirremoval was part of the study protocol but this did bias the reaction timeresults to only participants that could complete the 15 minute VR task.However, self-exclusion like this is what typically happens with HMDusage. Users who encounter obvious negative effects stop using, andtypically avoid future use of, the technology. It is interesting to note thatthese participants did self-select to participate and did not have indica-tive MSSQ scores. Nevertheless, our interest here was in exploringpotentially hidden negative HMD impacts, i.e. on activation mechanismsfor information processing, that might come from brief VR use.Measuring the reaction time impact on participants that had experiencedexplicit cybersickness symptoms was out of the scope of the currentresearch but would be a useful avenue for further work.In contrast to previous research [4,24,25], the results here showed an improvement in reaction times (although not statistically signi ﬁcant, see Section4). There were a number of differences in our study where theaim was to provide a more ecologically valid VR usage experience. Otherstudies with reaction time impact had more provocative cybersicknessinvoking environments [24,25], more limited interaction and used amuch shorter duration reaction time task [ 4,24,25]. However, our results did show that the longer cued go/no-go test had evidence of participantfatigue during the test. This was evident in both the pre- and post-tests.As this was present in the pre-test, this indicates that the longer dura-tion of the reaction test could be the cause.Increases in test length times can result in cognitive fatigue [ 32], where the length of the test is taxing the participants ’mental functions to the point that is causing a decrease in their performance. This can bemental fatigue, boredom, and reduced attention over time [ 33,34]. Cognitive fatigue is a topic of continued importance in applied psy-chology [35] and speciﬁcally how individual differences in personality orother traits can impact cognitively fatiguing conditions. Cognitive fatigueis commonly measured through changes in test performance and sub-jective reports via questionnaires [35] or course/test evaluations [32]. Duration of testing and any physical conditions of the test environmentare also relevant, for example movement time [ 33]. In our reaction time trials the participants were seated for the test duration and any physicalduress was limited to concentrating on the reaction time trials. Also thego/no-go trials are very repetitive and it is possible that boredom and/orreduced attention is what we have detected as fatigue. Adding apost-session question to capture subjective experiences of the reactiontime task, in the context of reported fatigue, would be useful for futurework in this area. However, to mitigate potential cognitive fatigue,repeated short tests with rest times between may be better than singleshort (as in previous work [4,24,25]) or single long (as reported here)reaction time tests.Given the use of reaction time measures in VR experience andcybersickness research and the results from the work described here,there may be considerable beneﬁt in factoring in cognitive fatigue andthe measures that contribute to this, i.e. personality or other traits [ 35], in order to increase the relevance of the reaction time data for aftereffectanalysis. This is a focus for future work.6. ConclusionThe widespread availability of COTS HMD and easy access to VRapplications and games has signiﬁcantly increased the use of such tech-nology by the general public. With more users, risk exposure from thistechnology is increasing. VR technology manufacturers provide guide-lines for usage but this guidance can be overly general and there is alimited evidence base for these recommendations.Explicit negative effects of HMD use, such as cybersickness, often leadto self-selection as users who experience negative effect stop using oravoid the technology. However, activation mechanisms for informationprocessing, such as response activation and inhibition, are more dif ﬁcult to determine ad hoc and can have signiﬁcant impact on response critical activities, such are driving vehicles or cycling.The research reported here has explored response activation and in-hibition in pre- and post-tests after participants experienced a typicallyVR experience, in this case Minecraft VR using an Oculus Rift CV1 HMD,for 15 minutes. Participants (n¼22) experienced no signiﬁcant reaction- based negative effects. This provides evidence in support of current VRtechnology use approaches, at least for response activation and inhibitionimpact. Participants did however demonstrate trial fatigue during thereaction test process and this should be factored into future studiesinvolving reaction time measures.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare no conﬂict of interest.References
