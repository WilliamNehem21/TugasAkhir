There is growing tendency to elicit subject-dependent features from physiological data like electroencephalogram(EEG) signals, which is the most relative one to the subject ’s brain, though the behavior of this signal does not obey any grammatical pattern. In this regard, several attempts have been made toward eliciting subject-dependent features from EEGs to promisingly verify/identify subjects. In this paper, we have comprehensivelyassessed state-of-the-art EEG features to empirically show their pros and cons. Herein the resting-EEG and ERP-EEG of 20 healthy subjects are utilized and the conventional features are extracted from them. These featuresare then fed to three types of classiﬁers. Among the deployed features, spectral coherence and correlation features provide the best veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation results in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and equal error rate. Empirical results demonstrate that the ERP-EEG features are more discriminative than the resting-EEG featuresbecause they reveal the response of a speci ﬁc circuit of the neural brain system.
1. IntroductionBiometric systems have been widely used in secure and ﬁnancial organizations such as military, banks, airports, security agencies andfamous companies. Biometric systems verify their queries according totheir unique physiological data such asﬁngerprint [1,2]], palm print [3], face, ear shape, iris textures, vocal tract system (speech signal) [ 1], ﬁducial points of electrocardiogram (ECG) [ 4], distribution of electro- encephalogram (EEG) energy in different bands [ 5,6]] and DNA struc- ture [7]. The mentioned biometric systems suffer from variouslimitations and can be deceived by impostors. For instance, speechrecognition system can be deceived by a recorded tape; iris biometricsystems can be deceived by wearing a lens; an image or video tape is thebottleneck of face and ear-shape biometric systems. DNA veri ﬁcation system is the most secure biometric system but its veri ﬁcation process is a bit time consuming and expensive.ECG and EEG biometric systems cannot be deceived since these sto-chastic signals should be directly acquired from the surface of the body.Among the mentioned biometric indicators, it is expected that decodingthe EEG variations [8-13] provides exclusive features characterizing thebrain activity of subjects. There are some evidences about differencesamong people’s brain in terms of anatomical and functional traits [ 14, 15]]. Moreover, it has been proven that there are some genes, which haveconsiderable effects over different brain areas and EEG frequencies[16-18]. Since EEG signals represent the reﬂection of ionic currents through exclusive neural connections of each subject, it carries speci ﬁc information and imitating of this signal is impossible. It seems that EEG isthe most appropriate technique [19,20]] to monitor the brain activity because of high temporal resolution, portability and low price, thoughEEG suffers from some limitations such as volume conduction, commonsources, potential leakage over the scalp and additive noise (e.g., muscleartifacts). As the research trend shows, EEG will be used as the mosteffective and popular brain monitor tool in the future [ 21,22]]. Never- theless, EEG as a veriﬁcation biomarker has some bottlenecks such asnoisy recording and also its content is inﬂuenced by stress and mood. A few attempts have been made to extract exclusive brain signaturefor each subject by applying a suitable transform to his/her EEG signalsand considering the elicited coefﬁcients as his unique mental features.Fraschini et al. [23] investigated the possibility of person identi ﬁcation by measuring the brain functional connectivity. Nonetheless, this featureis sensitive to the phase difference between each pair of EEG channels.They estimate functional connectivity between electrodes using the

Afterward,the weighted network is estimated from the connectivity matrix and thenodal eigenvector centrality is computed. The highest recognition rate isobtained in the Gamma and Beta bands, while other frequency bandsyield poor results. Their results show that using functional connectivityimproves the performance compared to that of power spectrum features.Rocca et al. [24] propose the spectral coherence-based connectivitybetween different brain regions which measures the extension of corre-lation function in the frequency domain. They execute this method over108 subjects and obtain 97.5% and 96.3% veri ﬁcation accuracy during eye-closed and eye-open conditions, respectively. These convincing re-sults are achieved in the Alpha and Delta bands. Gui et al. [ 25] evaluate two similarity features for EEG-based identi ﬁcation: Euclidean distance and dynamic time wrapping (DTW) methods. Their results on the chan-nel Oz provide the best identiﬁcation accuracy for both mentioned fea-tures. Using Euclidean distance yields 80% accuracy over 30 subjects,while the best accuracy of DTW yields 68% veri ﬁcation rate. Zhao et al. [26] implement a security system verifying the users (4 females and 6males) directly from their EEG signals. After preprocessing stage toremove frequency interference and artifacts, they extracted featuresincluding coefﬁcients of autoregressive (AR) model, power spectrum andcenter frequency (frequency which makes the power spectrum maxi-mize) from EEG signals. Then, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classiﬁer is applied to classify the obtained features with the average accuracy of97.63%. Huang et al. [27] extract equivalent root mean square valuesfrom scalp EEGs and apply them to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neuralnetwork. Their results over 45 subjects yield 100% veri ﬁcation rate while it provided 95.1% over 122 subjects.It is noteworthy to say that the veriﬁcation results over the occipital, temporal and parietal lobes are much higher than the other scalp parts inthe eye-close condition [16], while the veriﬁcation results are proper over the anterior part under the eye-open state [ 16]. Therefore, a few studies are conducted to verify the subjects by employing less number ofEEG channels (e.g., only one on the occipital lobe). Riera et al. [ 28] propose an EEG-based authentication system by using just two dryelectrodes (Fp1 and Fp2). They recorded EEG signals from the subjectswithin the interval of 34/C674 days. AR coefﬁcients, power spectral density (PSD) and three statistical measures are extracted from their EEGsignals. They have achieved the veriﬁcation rate of 98.10% over 51 registered subjects and 36 intruders.Another EEG based subject-dependent biomarker is the pattern ofevoked related potential (ERP) which has been used for subject veri ﬁ- cation [29]. ERP shape reﬂects valuable information about high-levelneural processing like attention and memory. Armstrong et al. [ 30] extract ERP template by synchronous averaging, and thensubject-dependent features are elicited from the ERP of each subject.Theyﬁnally apply their subjects’ERP features to different classiﬁers and achieve 82
–97% veriﬁcation rate. They have achieved the identiﬁcation rate of 92% for cross-correlation, 89% for divergent auto-encoder(DIVA), 82% for Naive discriminant learning (NDL) and 83% by sup-port vector machines (SVM), respectively. In addition, their ﬁndings imply the stability of the ERP features through six months recording.Das et al. [31] extract spatio-temporal patterns from visual evokepotential (VEP). They show that the subject-dependent information ofERP component, over the occipital region, occurs from 120 to 200 msafter the visual stimulus. Palaniappan [ 32] have recorded EEG signals through a speciﬁc mental task from several subjects in order to verifythem. In this regard, they have extracted AR coef ﬁcients, PSD differences over the inter-hemispheric channels, linear complexity and approximateentropy from the EEG signals. They propose a modi ﬁed four fold cross validation procedure to demonstrate the robustness of this authentica-tion system against impostors.This study aims to investigate the performance of state-of-the-artsignal processing techniques to characterize the EEG signals of 20 sub-jects, in both resting and cognitive state, for an EEG-based authenticationsystem in both identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation modes. The candidatefeatures in this study are local binary pattern (LBP) [ 33,34]], AR co- efﬁcients, wavelet coefﬁcients, eigen-vectors of principal componentanalysis (PCA), correlation value, spectral coherence and phase differ-ence. The reminder of this paper is structured as follows. The descriptionof the collected dataset is brought in Section 2and the explanation of the extracting features are brought is Section 3. Classiﬁers are discussed in Section4. Experimental results and discussions are illustrated in Section5. The paper isﬁnally concluded in Section6and a horizon for the future work is suggested.2. Data collectionTwenty subjects (all male and healthy) have voluntarily enrolled inthis study. The average of their age is 33.4 years old with standard de-viation (Std) of 9.29. They have had no history of pain, neurologic andpsychiatric disorder. During the EEG recording, each participant is seatedon a comfortable chair with open eyes. To mitigate the effect of muscleartifact, the neck isﬁrmly supported by the chair, and the feet are restedon a footstep. In this study, the signal recording process can be dividedinto two phases, where the resting-EEG and ERP-EEG signals are caughtfrom the same subjects. In theﬁrst recording state, the participants do notperform any mental task and no stimulus is imposed. Each trial recordingtakes 2 min. In the second recording state, ERP-EEG signals are recordedthrough oddball stimulus paradigm (cognitive task), where audio stimuliare randomly applied to the subjects. The participants are asked todiscriminate the infrequent target stimuli (high pitch beep) from thefrequent standard stimuli (low pitch beep) by pressing a button. Thecognitive ability of distinguishing between the low and high tones isconﬁrmed before beginning the experiment. This cognitive experimenttakes 20 min for each subject.Electrophysiological data are recorded using a Neuro-Scan 24 chan-nels Synamps system, with a signal gain equal to 75 K (150- at theheadbox). Through the recording paradigm, EEG signals are caught from20 electrodes (Fpz, Fz, Cz, Pz, C3, T3, C4, T4, Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, F7, F8, P3,P4, T5, T6, O1, and O2) via an Electrocap molded according to the 10 –20standard system with reference to linked earlobes plus vertical electro-oculogram (VEOG) and horizontal electrooculogram (HEOG). The sam-pling rate of the EEG setup is 200 Sa/s. The blink artifacts are correctedusing an efﬁcient technique, which is described in [ 35,36]]. In theﬁrst preprocessing phase, the artifacts are eliminated by an experiencedphysician using visual inspection. In addition, the EEG signals are ﬁltered by a band passﬁlter with cutoff frequencies of 0.5 and 45 Hz.3. MethodologyIn this Section, state-of-the-art features for the EEG-based authenti-cation systems are brieﬂy explained.3.1. Local binary pattern (morphological feature)Local binary pattern (LBP) [33, 34]] is an ef ﬁcient descriptive method for texture analysis. For each sample in the signal, this feature iscomputed by comparing the current sample value to its left and right sideneighbors and therefore, it measures the local variation for each sample.LBP feature is computed as:LBP

Spectral coherenceSpectral coherence [24] quantiﬁes the level of synchrony betweentwo stationary signals at a speciﬁc frequencyf. This feature for two EEG channels (iandj) is estimated by:coh

i;jðfÞ¼1 shows the maximum synchrony is happened at frequency f.3.3. Phase differenceThe phase lag index (PLI) [23] is estimated using pair-wise statisticalinterdependence between EEG time series in two different channels. Incontrast to spectral coherence, PLI reveals the features related to volumeconduction, common sources and active reference; therefore, it presents amore suitable estimation of functional interactions among the brain re-gions. The PLI varies between 0 (interaction with zero-phase lag) and 1(maximum interaction), and it evaluates the asymmetry of the distribu-tion of instantaneous phase differences between pairs of channels. ThePLI is determined as:PLI¼j〈signðsinðΔϕðt

Wavelet coefﬁcientsWavelet transform [37] has been repeatedly used for analyzing EEGsignals and representing its content in both time and frequency domains.In fact, wavelet transform is a bank ofﬁlters, which their bandwidths are set in a dyadic manner [38]. Wavelet coefﬁcientsc(j,k)of the mother waveletΨ
j;kðnÞ(jth scale and shiftk), is determined by the following relation:cðj;kÞ¼X
n2zfðnÞΨ/C02jðn/C0kÞ/C1 (7)wheref(n)is the input discrete signal. After decomposing each EEGchannel intomscales,ﬁve features are extracted from each decomposedsignal within a time frame. These features are the energy, maximum,minimum, mean, and standard deviation of the decomposed signals. Inthis research, the number of extracted features from 20 EEG channels forthe 5 scale became 5/C25/C220¼500.3.5. Principal component analysis (PCA) featuresPCA [39,40]] is an orthogonal linear transform which projects a highdimensional input to a lower dimensional subset of features, where thenew features are orthogonal and independent to each other. This featurereduction is carried out by multiplying the input vectors to theeigen-vectors, corresponding to the larger eigen-values. Given athreshold determines the informative eigen-vectors in which data isscattered along those directions (just features with a high variance areselected). First, the employed EEG signals are segmented into successive1s windows. Next, the covariance matrix of EEG signals is estimated forall channels and 20 eigen-vectors are extracted. For each time-frame over20 channels, 20/C220¼400 features are generated.3.6. Correlation-based featuresThe correlation [41] between different EEG channels is determinedby the following function:RxðτtÞ¼E/C8xðtþ τtÞxTðtÞ/C9 (8)where
τtis the time delay between a signal and its shifted version. Thecross-correlation value is determined between two by two EEG channelsand therefore, 20/C220¼400 features are produced for each time frame.In fact, these features contain spatio-temporal information of the 20 EEGchannels.Fig. 1depicts stages of the implemented correlation-basedfeature.1.

AR coefﬁcientsOne of the most powerful tools for signal modeling is the autore-gressive (AR) model [42], in which a sample is predicted according to theweighted average of itspformer samples, wherepdetermines the model order. A stationary signalx[n]is modeled by the following relation:x½n/C138¼X

idenotes the AR model coefﬁcients. In this paper, the Burg method is employed to estimate the AR coef ﬁcients based on the sum- mation of both forward and backward prediction errors. In addition, theﬁnite sample criterion [42] is used to select the best order of the ARmodel, considering the residual variance and the prediction error. In thisstudy, the best order of AR model is set to 8; therefore, the number ofelicited features for 20 channels becomes 160.4. ClassiﬁersIn this part, we introduce the k-nearest neighbor (kNN), supportvector machine (SVM) and random forest. Although kNN [ 43] is not a new method, it is still used in wide range of applications, especially forthose multi-class problem that the distribution of their classes is multi-modal. kNN is famous due to its simplicity, interpretability and goodperformance. kNN is a lazy classiﬁer in the recall phase while it is theonly classiﬁer that does not need any training phase. kNN is a localclassiﬁer and for each test samplex

3found and the label of samples, with majority vote, is assigned to x 0. Through the cross validation phase, the value of kis set to 5. Support vector machine (SVM) [44] is designed based on the statis- tical learning theory. SVM tries to maximize the margin width simulta-neous with minimizing the empirical error in order to provide a goodgeneralization property. Using kernel function maps the input samples toa new high dimensional space that probability of separating the projectedsamples by a hyper-plane is increased.Random forest [45] classiﬁer is operated by constructing an ensembleof decision trees in the training phase and predicts the label, which is themode of the classes of the individual trees. Decision trees work bychoosing theﬁnest feature to divide the data and expanding the leafnodes of the tree until the termination criterion is met. In these treestructures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent con-junctions of features that lead to those class labels. After the constructionof the decision tree, a tree-pruning phase is applied to diminish the size ofthe decision tree. Pruning is supported by trimming the branches of theinitial tree to simplify the interpretation capability of the decision tree.5. Experimental results and discussionIn this section, the veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation results are sepa- rately illustrated in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and equal error rate(EER). The results are demonstrated for three authentication scenarios interms of the resting-EEG, ERP-EEG and averaged ERP. In the identi ﬁca- tion system, we are confronted with a multi-class problem, where theoutputs of each classiﬁer could be 1 toN(whereNis the number of participants). On the other hand, in veriﬁcation system, we are faced with a two-class problem, where each EEG signal could be classi ﬁed either as authorized user or impostor.In theﬁrst stage, both resting-EEG and ERP-EEG signals are dividedinto successive 1 s windows (except for wavelet transform that thewindow length is set to 4 s). The successive windows have 50% overlap.The mentioned features are extracted from each windowed signal, thenthese features are applied to kNN, SVM and random forest classi ﬁers. Results inTables 1–3demonstrate the identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation accuracy (in terms of mean and Std) over twenty healthy subjects. In thisstudy, SVM uses linear kernel function, and sequential minimal optimi-zation (SMO) for objective-function minimization. In addition, for opti-mizing the hyper-parameters of each SVM, an interval is considered forthe parameter C and SVM is run for different values of C (in the train set)and the best value of C is selected. Since the SVM is binary classi ﬁer (only two classes), in identiﬁcation task, K(K–1)/2 binary SVM models using the one-versus-one is applied where K is the number of class labels.As we see, the results of ERP-EEG using different features aresigniﬁcantly superior to that of the resting-EEG features. This is thereforeERP-EEG features reveals the high-level activity of neural systems (e.g.,attention, memory and cognition) rather using the resting-EEG whichreveals the integration of the whole activities of the brain system.Tables 1–3show that both spectral coherence and correlation are themost accurate methods for both EEG-based identi ﬁ
cation and veriﬁcationFig. 1.The correlation-based feature.

4systems.The signiﬁcance of the ERP-EEG results implies the uniqueness of thecortical activities for each subject. On the other hand, the brain is an opensystem (cybernetic) and it receives several inputs from the ﬁve types of sensors along with cortical activities during the mental and emotionalexcitation. Therefore, unlike several attempts for distinguishing subjectsaccording to their resting-EEG features, the identi ﬁcation result is not promising due to the wide range of factors in ﬂuencing the EEG signals [14]. Our results on the ERP-EEG signals over three classi ﬁers show that the spectral coherence and correlation have the best discriminative in-formation for the person identiﬁcation task. The Student’s t-test is applied to determine the difference between the ef ﬁciency of the mentioned features is signiﬁcant or not. The signiﬁcance level ofp<0.05 is considered statistically signiﬁcant. Our statistical evaluation over thethree classiﬁers shows that these two features (spectral coherence andcorrelation) are signiﬁcantly (p<0.05) superior to the other comparedfeatures.Both correlation and spectral coherence can measure the relationshipbetween two signals. Coherence value is a correlation coef ﬁcient in the frequency domain, while the correlation feature shows the similarity ofsignals in the time domain. Spectral coherence measures the degree oflinear dependency of similar frequency components between two signals.In other words, it can measure the degree of information ﬂow between groups of neurons activities of the EEG signal. The excellent results givenby the correlation and spectral coherence show the way which functionalnetworks can cooperate with each other during neurocognitive pro-cesses. These are a high-resolution way to quantify the degree of dynamicconnectivity between the diverse areas in the brain [ 46,47]]. Addi- tionally, our results show difference between the ef ﬁciency of wavelet coefﬁcients inTables 1–3. Since wavelet decomposition adaptively pro-vides dyadic resolution over the frequency range, these frequency di-visions are matched with the EEG standard bands. However, the accuracyof wavelet may be changed with several factors such as mother waveletand number of decomposition levels. Efﬁciently setting of these factors will lead to high veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation accuracy. In addition to the classiﬁcation accuracy, false accept rate (FAR) andfalse reject rate (FRR) and EER are measured [ 48]. A False acceptance allows an impostor to get an access, and a false reject denies an access tothe enrolled user. These criteria are simply de ﬁned below:
FAR¼Number of accepted impostorsTotal number of impostors (10)FRR¼
Number of rejected genuinesTotal number of genuines (11)EER¼FARþFRR2when FAR¼FRR(12)Tables 4–6show the EER (%) for the deployed resting-EEG and ERP-EEG signals in both veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation systems. Our results shows that the random forest and kNN obtain the better results in com-parison with SVM.It is noticeable to state that specialists visually analyze the ERPwaveforms for diagnosis purposes by measuring their amplitude and la-tency. In this regard, the ERP signals are extracted from the EEGs andthen applied to the classiﬁers to see how discriminative these waveformsare for authenticating the subjects. The ERP-EEG epochs following agiven stimulus are averaged (over 80 stimuli) to remove the backgroundEEG, for eliciting the ERP template.Fig. 2shows the extracted ERP signal on Fz, Cz and Pz channels for a randomly selected subject. Since the mostof classiﬁers require multiple examples from each participant in order tolearn input–output mappings robustly; consequently, it is not suf ﬁcient to simply create one ERP trial from each participant for training of theclassiﬁers. A bootstrapping procedure is applied to both train and testdata, where 100 ERP trials are generated for each participant [ 30]. Finally, the samples of ERP waveform are considered as features to beapplied to kNN, SVM and random forest classi ﬁers.Table 7shows the accuracy and EER for the ERP-based veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation sys- tems. Unlike our expectation, the classiﬁcation results show the ERP waveforms are not suitable for the identiﬁcation task, while its veriﬁ- cation results are plausible.Despite the achieved excellent ERP-EEG based veri ﬁcation and identiﬁcation results, there are certain aspects that may need furtherinvestigation. These important points are:Table 3The mean and Std of accuracy of random forest classi ﬁer for resting-EEG and ERP-EEG signals.

5/C15The important limitation that must be addressed in future work is thesample size. The sample size is small in our study. To prove the use-fulness of these tools for subject identiﬁcation task, these measures should be applied to larger population. Since, a normal EEG varieswith the age, these features must be applied to study of EEG signalsduring different intervals of age (it is shown that EEG in childhoodgenerally shows slower frequency oscillation than an adult)./C15EEG recording in the resting state needs no active involvement ofsubjects during the recording; therefore, the probable effect of mentalfatigue is highly reduced. Moreover, our results show the existence ofexclusive information in the resting-EEG of each subject, which isemerged from the exclusive connections in the brain system of eachsubject [24]. EEG signals in the time domain obey not grammaticalbehavior and they behave like a white/color noise, nonetheless itseems that the subject-dependent information is captured throughthis signal. It is shown the power spectrum of EEG signal, especially inthe range of Alpha band contains subject information that can be usedin person veriﬁcation [49].6. Conclusion and future workIn this paper, we investigate the role of state-of-the-art features inveriﬁcation and identiﬁcation of subjects via classifying their resting-EEG, ERP-EEG and the averaged ERP features. The universality,measurability, uniqueness and robustness against fraudulent attacks arefavorite characteristic of use of resting-EEG and ERP-EEG signals forhuman recognition. As we have expected, the veri ﬁcation results provide more accuracy rather the identiﬁcation results in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and equal error rate. This difference is emerged from this factthat the identiﬁcation process is a multi-class problem (in this research20 classes), while the veriﬁcation process is a two-class problem. More-over, the results of ERP-EEG features provide higher accuracy rather thanthe two other approaches, because ERP-EEG contains the information ofboth background EEG and ERP, which are richer than each of them.Although ERP has a grammatical pattern and reveals the response of aspeciﬁc sub-system of the brain, the background EEG contains uniqueinformation for each subject and combination of them provide robustfeatures. We suggest the ERP-EEG based authentication system as anefﬁcient biometric tool due to its convincing results.Fig. 2.The synchronous averaging over ERP-EEG signal on Fz, Cz, Pz channels for a randomly selected subject./C15Our results demonstrate that the ERP-EEG signals have high inter-subject variability and low inner-subject reliability; therefore, ERP-EEG-base d individual iden- tiﬁcation is a good candidate to design a reliable authentication system (in con ﬁrmation with previous studies [30,50]]). Nonetheless, to address the robustness, participants should return to the EEG lab after their ﬁrst session to analyze the stability of our results over the time. /C15EEG signals may be inﬂuenced by motion artifacts and body movement. In order to reduce the effect of these undesired components, it is essential to select betterﬁltering algorithm to obtain signals with better quality. ERP is less sensitive to the background noise (the ongoing EEG) because the background EEG an d additive noises behave like the white/pink Gaussian noise and therefore they are attenuated and faded through the averaging. Synchronous averaging assumes t he ERP template is fairly constant in response to each stimulus and through the long time, brain fatigue leads to skew the ERP latency and amplitude./C15The quality of EEG depends on the quality EEG setup. An apparatus with more number of electrodes (e.g., 128 or 256) is usually more accurate and if the pro cess is performed by a high quality apparatus with dense array, the results might be increased due to covering more spatial resolution and better quality of si gnals. Although the results are acceptable with 24 electrodes, the acquisition of EEG signals with more number of electrodes will de ﬁnitely add more discriminative information.
