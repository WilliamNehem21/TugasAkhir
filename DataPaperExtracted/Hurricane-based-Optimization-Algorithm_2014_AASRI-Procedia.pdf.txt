 During the last few years, Nature inspired algorithms have been experiencing extremely rapid growth in the industrial world, where they have been shown to be  very effective in solving real-world optimisation problems [1]. As an example of the huge and growing variety of heuri stic approaches: Genetic Algorithm [6], Simulated Annealing [7], Ant Colony Search Algorithm [8], and Particle Swarm Optimization [9].  However, these algorithms suffer from a major shortco ming, i.e. being trapped in local minima. In order to overcome these limitations, many other optimization technics have been developed. Some of these technics are Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) [10], Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA) [11].  In this paper we introduce a new optimization algorithm named as Hurricane-based Optimization Algorithm (HOA), based on wind and pressure profiles in a hurricane. During the search process, wind parcels search for a lower pressure zone (the ey e), which is considered as the optimal solution. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provid es a brief review of hurricanes as a meteorological phenomenon and the concepts and ideas behind HOA in details. In Section 3 the experimental results are demonstrated. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 4. 2. Hurricane-based Optimization Algorithm 2.1. Hurricanes A hurricane is a low-pressure zone with a warm core that forms over tropical and subtropical oceans. The center of the hurricane is known as the eye (Figure 1). Immediately outside of the eye is the Eyewall region, an area of vigorous tall/deep clouds, and the strongest observed winds. The surrounding spiral bands, called Rainbands, are localized areas of tall/deep clouds, heavy rain, and high winds.

2.2. Basic Concepts The idea of the proposed algorithm is based on the obse rvation of hurricane and how wind parcels move in the surrounding atmosphere.

 A variety of equations have been suggested to model this phenomenon. The first one presents a straightforward description of the wind field. This model called Rankine-combined (or modified Rankine vortex) was applied to hurricanes by Depperman [12].  The Rankine vortex model is a simple two-equation parametric description of a swirling flow. In the inner radial region about the center the flow is in solid rotation. While the outer region is free of vortices:

     if   r ! Rmax   (2) where V is the tangential wind with maximum value V
max at r = R max, and the parameter X allows the shape of the wind field outsi de the (R
max) to be modified to fit available data. The proposed method uses this model to control velocity variation over the search space. The interaction of the natural forces in a hurricane makes the wind parcels start spiraling outward. Therefore, the top horizontal surface of the hurricane can be approximated by a logarithmic (log) spiral pattern.  Log spirals, which can be formulated as follows:

 he real numbers (e
x, ey) are the coordinates of the spiral center (eye). The real number a > 0; b controls how tightly the spiral whirls and in 
which direction. In the extreme case that b= 0, the spiral becomes a circle of radius a. In t
he proposed algorithm, the eye (lower pressure) corresponds to the best solution. Its pressure is determined using problem fitness function.  2.3. The proposed HOA Consider a system with N parcels. The position of the ith parcel is

 The function isOut(c) checks if the passed component c is within search space boundaries. Rand() gene
rates a uniform random number in the interval [0, 1]. The algorithm starts with a random eye position.  After the parameters initialization, the algorithm generates iteratively wind parcels by modifying the eye position according to Eq. (5). Each time a new wind parcel is generated, the algorithm considers 3 cases:  1) The parcel is out of the search space, the algorithm resets the parcel parameters (
Minitialiand  Mi).  2) The algorithm compares pressures, if the parcel pressure is lower than the eye pressure; the parcel position becomes the new eye.  3) The parcel moves to the next position according to Eq. (7). After achieving a predetermined number of iterations ( itMax), the algorithm returns the eye position, which is considered as the optimal solution. 3. Experimental Results To validate the performance of the proposed method, HOA is applied to optimize a number of benchmark functions listed in Table 1, where n presents the dimension of the function. All benchmark functions are minimization problems. The values of parameters used in HOA are, Ȧ = ʌ/10, R
max = 0.2, R 0 = 10-5. Wind parcels number is 100, and the maximum number of iterations is 20000. All e xperiments are averaged over 20 independent runs.

 Table 2 presents the experimental results of HOA in term
 s of the average final best value (Avg) and the standard deviation (SD). In this table, x
* is the optimum for the problem, and f(x*) is the best achievable fitness for that function. According to experiment al results HOA shows a great performance in solving some benchmark functions. In general the results are close to the global optimum. The small standard deviation values prove the convergence of HOA. 4. Conclusion In this paper, HOA as a new nature-inspired algorithm is proposed to tackle optimization problems. The underlying concepts and ideas behind HOA are based on the observation of hurricanes and the radial wind and pressure profiles.  In HOA, wind parcels start spiraling outward from the ey e. The velocities are controlled by a predefined model. In this process, wind parcels search for a lower pressure zone (new eye position). Once new lower pressure is discovered, its position becomes the eye and the process starts all over again.  To prove its performance, HOA is tested with severa l benchmark functions with different dimensions. The statistical results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in solving various nonlinear functions. In further work, HOA should be compared to other metaheuristic optimization algorithms.
