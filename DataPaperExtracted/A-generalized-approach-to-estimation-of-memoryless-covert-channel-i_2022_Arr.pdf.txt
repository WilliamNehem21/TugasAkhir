Estimating the amount of information that is leaked by covert channels is a necessity to comprehend and
mitigate the severity of attacks exploiting these channels. Having such an estimation in design-state provides
an opportunity for designers to adjust their systems to minimize information leakage. In this paper, we propose
a methodology to estimate the worst-case information leakage (or capacity for the information leakage) through
various memoryless covert channels – both analog and digital ones – exhibiting on–off keying structure. In that
respect, we first model the communication channel as a deletion–insertion channel to account for the information
losses due to software activities. Then, we derive the effective noise in covert channels as the combination
of jitter noise caused by signaling time variation and Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). Considering
this effective noise, we propose a communication model which can be generalized for various covert channels
and takes insertions, deletions, and asynchronous nature of covert channels into account. By leveraging the
link between this communication model and information theory literature, we obtain the information leakage
capacity that reveals the leakage limit for the worst-case scenarios. Finally, we provide experimental results
to demonstrate that the proposed model is an effective and a generalized methodology to score the resilience
of a given system to covert channel attacks.
1. Introduction
With the breakthrough improvements in computer systems and
immense inter-connectivity of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, comput-
ing systems, especially mobile and embedded systems, have become
the main storing space to keep sensitive data (e.g., financial data,
personal information, etc.). Unfortunately, this creates opportunities
for attackers to steal secret data by exploiting side-channel signals
from these computing devices. In that respect, an extensive research
is performed on cryptographic devices and their vulnerability against
side channels [ 1,2]. They prove that side-channel attacks can circum-
vent the existing defense mechanisms and has to be considered while
designing systems.
Side-channels are unintentionally generated due to digital and/or
analog characteristics of computers while computers execute programs.
If these channels are generated deliberately by manipulating an ap-
plication’s software, they are called covert channels [3]. The most

vent existing protection mechanisms (e.g., isolation) deployed on a
computer to exfiltrate sensitive data. For example, it is shown that a
rogue employee can exfiltrate sensitive information about a project
(stored in a secured laptop) by leveraging side-channels to establish
a covert channel even if the computer’s Input/Output (I/O) ports are
fully monitored, and the computer is completely isolated from the
network [ 4].
Depending on the exploited side-channel, covert channels can be
classified into two broad categories of digital/micro-architectural and
analog/physical covert channels. In both cases, the attacker uses a
malicious process (called source ) which, in one way or another (as will
be discussed later), has access to secret data but does not have access
to the outside world (i.e., the source cannot ‘‘extract’’ the sensitive
information by itself through conventional channels without being scru-
tinized). To circumvent the protection mechanisms, the source exploits

an existing side-channel (either digital such as cache [5] or analog such
as electromagnetic emanations [6]), to communicate the information to
asink(i.e., either to another process or to the outside world).
In the literature, there are many examples illustrating that different
digital and/or analog characteristics of computers can be exploited to
establish a reliable covert channel (e.g., caches [5,7–12], electromag-
netic emanations [6,13–16], variation in power consumption [17–25],
etc.). Given this extensive set of vulnerabilities and their non-negligible
threat to the system security, it is important to measure the severity of
leakage through covert channels (in terms of channel capacity) for a
given design in both modern systems (e.g., laptops) and embedded/IoT
devices.
Millen was the first to propose a method to establish a connection
between information theory and flow models [26]. With such a model,
Millen defined severity of covert channels in terms of conventional
channel capacity assuming covert channels are synchronous commu-
nication channels. Similarly, a Gaussian channel model is proposed
in [27] for template attacks based on power side channels. The model
assumes each template takes equal amount of time and there is no
deviation in template timing. In [28], another Gaussian channel model
is proposed for the leakages to calculate the success rate of an attack
targeting the implementations that are protected by masking. These
channel models (which exhibit the footprints of an ideal communica-
tion system) are proposed to designate the best distinguisher for a side
channel attack to cryptographic devices. Unlike conventional commu-
nication systems which are carefully designed such that transmitters
and receivers are well-synchronized, covert channels are unintended,
hidden, and undesired channels that do not exhibit such characteristics.
Furthermore, they are corrupted not only by additive channel noise
but also by deviation in signaling time, insertions, and deletions of
transmitted bits.
In the communication literature, many papers discuss (a)bounds on
the capacity of channels corrupted by synchronization errors [29–33]
and(b)bounds on the capacity of channels corrupted by synchroniza-
tion and substitution errors [34,35]. Likewise, information theoretic
metrics are applied to side channel attacks to calculate the available
information to an adversary under the assumption that leakages are
Gaussian and all signal traces belong to the targeted cryptographic
function [36]. In [37], the success rate estimation is easily computed
by utilizing SNR and bounds for success rate is proposed. The effect of
shuffling and higher order masking on the information leakage has been
also investigated by utilizing information theoretic models. In [38], the
security analysis of a cryptographic device has been given when higher
order masking is used in Differential Power Analysis (DPA). Mutual
information between the leakages and security keys of a cryptographic
device with shuffled implementations are considered for worst-case
security analysis in [39]. The noisy information leakage models and
information theoretic approach also lead to security proofs for masked
implementation of block ciphers and divide-and-conquer side channel
attacks [40,41]. Although all these approaches aim to quantify and
utilize the available information to an attacker, applying these ideas
to measure covert channel leakage capacity has shortcomings because
they do not consider the problems that covert channels face due to un-
precedented computer activities, i.e. insertions, deletions, the variation
in signaling time.
Furthermore, a micro-level investigation on side-channel capacities
was conducted in prior work [42,43], assuming instructions (which
are the lowest level order to computer processor) are the transmit-
ted symbols between the transmitter (source) and the receiver (sink).
These papers exploit emanated electromagnetic (EM) signal power
while executing instructions and model the communication based on
the differences in the signal power levels of different instructions.
However, employing the micro-level capacity definitions to covert chan-
nelsoverestimates the leakage capacities because they do not consider
insertions and deletions that are encountered in macro-level (program
level) scenarios. In addition, these models cannot be generalized tomeasure the leakage capacity of other side-channels because the models
are specifically designed for EM side-channels based on individual or
pairwise signal power.
To avoid these problems, recent work in [44,45] proposed a
program-level communication model including insertions and deviation
in signaling time while transmitting signals. Furthermore, leakage
capacity bounds were defined for only EM covert channels under the
assumption that signaling time deviation can be modeled by changing
the position of the pulses and by keeping the pulse width fixed.
However, the scope of these papers is limited to EM based covert
channels, ignores the losses due to deletions, fixes the pulse width
while modeling the channel, and provides capacity bounds instead
of actual capacity values. Moreover, these papers consider only the
scenario where the signal is silent while transmitting a zero bit, and
the signaling time distribution has zero mean and the same standard
deviation irrespective of the bit. Interestingly, as we experimentally
illustrate in this paper, for different covert channels these assumptions
are too optimistic because the bit signals are generated by running
different parts of a program or completely different benchmarks [46].
To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a generalized
communication model for various covert channels, which considers
insertions, deletions and their asynchronous nature, to calculate actual
leakage capacity. The main contributions of the paper can be listed as
follows:
•We propose a communication model for covert channels which
considers insertions and deletions to comply with software activ-
ities.
•We experimentally demonstrate that the distribution of signaling
time variation exhibits a Gaussian behavior, hence, can be char-
acterized as a Gaussian distribution with mean 𝜇and standard
deviation𝜎.
•We mathematically show that jitter error (error due to variation
in signaling time) can be combined with additive channel noise.
We call it effective channel noise and experimentally demonstrate
that the behavior of this effective channel noise can change for
different symbols.
•Based on the communication model and combined effective chan-
nel noise, we propose a discrete memoryless channel model to
calculate the worst-case leakage through a covert channel. With
this channel model, we obtain actual leakage capacity.
•The proposed model can be generalized to various covert chan-
nels, therefore, the same structure can be utilized by system
designers to assess security of their systems against different types
ofalready existing covert channels.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we in-
troduce the model for transmitted signal, receiver, and communication
channel. Section 3 provides the derivation of effective channel noise
and leakage capacity. Section 4 demonstrates how the proposed model
can be used for various types of covert channels. Section 5 provides
experimental setup and results, and Section 6 provides concluding
remarks.
2. Overall communication model
In this section, we first describe the proposed model for the trans-
mitter of a covert channel considering its asynchronous nature and the
variation in signaling time. Then, we explain the underlying reasons to
model the receiver as a pulse-shape filter. This is followed by deriving
effective channel noise which is a combination of additive and jitter
noise caused by the variation in signaling time. Finally, we propose dis-
crete memoryless channel model by considering the effective channel
noise, insertions, and deletions.
In the literature, side-channel analysis has been generally consid-
ered for cryptographic devices to secure the privacy of users. ManyArray 14 (2022) 100131

researchers have studied different implementations and their vulner-
abilities to side channel attacks [ 47–49]. To obtain the worst-case
information leakage that can be achieved by covert channels, we first
need to model the transmitter and emanated signal. Here, we need to
note that the covert channels considered in this paper do not seek for
relevant information in a system. These channels are exploited as a
bridge between a trusted insider or a Trojan and adversarial outsider.
Also note that this paper does not propose a new covert channel. The
goal of the paper is to analyze already existing covert channels and
evaluate their severity.
2.1. Transmitted signal and receiver model
Transmitted Signal: Since transmitted signal models are well-studied
in conventional communication theory, a natural approach to model
the signals in covert channels is to establish a connection between
covert and conventional communication systems. In that respect, we
first investigate different modulation schemes (e.g., pulse amplitude-
width modulation, pulse width modulation, and pulse amplitude mod-
ulation) and their suitability for covert channels. However, employing
such modulation schemes with various width and amplitude choices
are not practical for covert channels since the width and amplitude of
the transmitted signals deviate due to other program activities [ 50].
To avoid these difficulties, the general practice in covert channel
community is to employ modulation schemes that can only transmit
zeros and ones [ 4,45,51]. Therefore, we follow the assumptions and
notations below for the model of the transmitted signal:
A1: The Transmitted Signal Assumptions and Notations
–The receiver samples the signal at every seconds under
the assumption that the transmission time of the covert
channel is .
–On–Off-Keying (OOK) is considered as the modulation
scheme to transmit information signal (i.e., the source ex-
ploits a specific side-channel such as cache to transmit
bits).
–The targeted duty cycle changes based on the implementa-
tion of the covert channel. In other words, the ratio between
the width of the pulse and the transmission time can vary
for different channels.
–There is no overlapping among the bits transmitted by the
covert channel transmitter. Therefore, a bit is transmitted
only if the transmission of the previous bit is complete.
–The signal is on for 𝑇0or𝑇1seconds if the transmitted bit
is zero or one, respectively. Please note that 𝑇0can be zero,
which represents the transmission period when nothing is
transmitted.
In Fig. 1(a) , an ideal OOK modulated signal is shown when the
transmitted bit sequence is all ones (Although the behavior of any bit
sequence is the same, all-one-bit-sequence is used for better explanation
of the process). Unfortunately, obtaining such a signal is not possible
with an unintentional channel. Because of the delays and synchro-
nization problems in covert channels, the system experiences shifts
in transmitted signals as shown in Fig. 1(b) . This undesired behavior
appears in almost all of the covert channels, and needs to be modeled
to comprehend and estimate leakage capacity.
Receiver Model: For the receiver model, we need to combine the
knowledge of conventional communication theory and some practices
utilized in the security community. The common approach in conven-
tional systems is to apply a match filter under the assumption that the
system is well-synchronized [ 52]. Motivated by this approach, we make
the following assumptions and observations:
Fig. 1. The received signal for (a) ideal conventional communication system, (b)
covert channel communication system.
A2: The Receiver Model Assumptions
–The receiver employs a filter which mimics the match filter
to capture the transmitted information.
–Since the modulation is a result of software–hardware ac-
tivities, the transmitted keys encounter problems. These
problems can be a result of changes in duty cycle, non-
synchronization and delays while transmitting modulated
signal.
Since synchronization problems limit the capability of the match filter
for covert channels, the first step to design the receiver is to relax these
synchronization requirements in order to handle shifts in signaling-
time. To capture the transmitted bit sequence, the receiver employs a
matched filter with 100% duty cycle (irrespective of the actual duty
cycle of the transmission) to capture the changes in signaling time as
𝑚𝑐(𝑡)=1√
𝚛𝚎𝚌𝚝(𝑡
)
, (1)
where rect (t) is a function with amplitude one, and has only nonzero
values between −0.5and 0.5. Assuming 𝑟(𝑡)is the received signal, we
can write the match filtered sequence after sampling with period as
𝑦(𝑛) =𝑟(𝑡)∗𝑚𝑐(𝑡−𝑛)||𝑡=𝑛
=1√
∫𝑛
(𝑛−1)𝑟(𝑛−𝜏)𝚛𝚎𝚌𝚝(𝜏
−(𝑛−0.5))
𝑑𝜏
=𝑦𝑛 (2)
where∗is the convolution operation and 𝑛is the sample index.
Under this receiver implementation, the received signal can be
considered as a signal which only experiences variation in duty cycles.
Please observe that raising time of the received signals can be altered
such that the total area under the signaling period stays the same.
Therefore, an equivalent version of the original signal in Fig. 1(b) can
be presented as in Fig. 2. The equivalence of these two signal models
stems from the fact that the receiver does not consider the shift within
the sampling period, but the existence of the signal components.
Let us consider a noiseless environment where the received signals
only experience asynchronous nature of the covert channel. Fig. 3Array 14 (2022) 100131

shows the received signal between (𝑛−1)and𝑛when, without loss
of generality, the transmitted bit is one after modifying the raising time
as given above (the same discussion can be made for bit-zero).
The received sample for this time slot can be written as
𝑦𝑛=1√

𝑑𝜏

𝑇𝑛=√
(𝑇1+𝑇𝑥)(3)
where𝑇𝑥is a random variable for the width variation of the received
signal. For the rest of the paper, we refer to 𝑇𝑥as the effective variation .
Please note that 𝑇𝑥can also be negative and the outputs of the match
filter can be smaller or larger than the expected output value.
2.2. Channel model
In this section, we introduce our discrete memoryless channel model
for the covert communication. Having such a model is essential for
establishing connection with information theory which allows us to
calculate the channel capacity. For the channel model, we make the
following assumptions:
A3: Bit-Deletion
The covert channel transmitter continuously sends information
bits unless it encounters interrupts, stalls, etc. Due to other pro-
gram activities that can run in parallel with the covert channel
source, the received signal is masked and can be randomized
because of the constructive and destructive interference. From
the receiver perspective, the received bit has the highest entropy,
hence, this scenario is considered as the deletion.
A4: Bit-Insertion
When stalls, interrupts, etc., force the source of covert channel to
stop transmitting information, the insertion of random bits occurs.
Since the receiver is not aware of such an interrupt, it keeps
interpreting the sampled symbols as the actually transmitted
symbols.A5: Additive Gaussian White Noise (AWGN)
The transmitted signals are also corrupted by additive white
Gaussian noise. We assume that this noise covers all unrelated
signals that are produced by the environment and the system.
For further discussion, we remind the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) for
the conventional communication systems which can be written as
SNR=𝑃𝑠
𝜎2
𝑛(4)
where𝑃𝑠is the signal power and 𝜎𝑛is the standard deviation of
the noise after sampling. However, the conventional SNR definition
does not reflect the variation in the width of the transmitted signal.
Therefore, the first goal is to combine the channel noise and the noise
due to signal timing variation called jitter noise. First we consider the
noiseless scenario given in (3). If we define the ideally received sampled
symbol,𝑦𝑜, as
𝑦𝑜=𝑇𝑖√
(5)
and the jitter noise term, 𝑛𝑥as
𝑛𝑥=𝑇𝑥√
, (6)
the received sampled symbol can be written as
𝑦𝑛=𝑦𝑜+𝑛𝑥 (7)
where𝑖∈ {0,1}. Let𝑇𝑥be normally distributed as
𝑇𝑥∼(𝜇𝑥,𝜎2
𝑥|Bit-𝑖is transmitted).
This equation exposes two main intuitions about the characteristics
of covert channels: (1) the mean and standard deviation of the sig-
naling time variation could be different for different bits, and (2)
the distributions can exhibit differences for each system since they
can correspond to non-identical program activities. Hence, different
jitter-noise schemes need to be considered. With this assumption, the
distribution of 𝑛𝑥can be written as
(
𝜇𝑥
√
,(𝜎𝑥)2
||||||Bit-𝑖is transmitted)
=(
𝜇𝑥,𝑖,𝜎2
𝑥,𝑖)
.
Eq. (7) reveals that even with noiseless scenario assumption, the covert
channel system still encounters noise due to jitter in the system. In-
cluding the additive channel noise (AWGN), the received symbol can
be written as
𝑦𝑛=𝑦𝑜+𝑛𝑥+𝑛𝑜 (8)
where𝑛𝑜∼(0,𝜎2
𝑛)is the channel noise sample. Here, jitter and
channel noise can be combined as a single random variable because
both have Gaussian distribution. Let us define 𝑛𝑐as the effective noise
component which is given as
𝑛𝑐=𝑛𝑥+𝑛𝑜.
Therefore, the distribution of 𝑛𝑐can be written as
𝑛𝑐∼(
𝜇𝑥,𝑖,𝜎2
𝑛+𝜎2
𝑥,𝑖)
. (9)
Please also note that bit-zero signals can be nonzero for a while if
𝑇0>0. Therefore, the average transmitted signal can be written as
𝑃𝑠=2
(
𝑝0(𝑇0)2+𝑝1(𝑇1)2)
(10)
where𝑝𝑗({𝑗∈{0,1}})represents the probability that bit- 𝑗is transmit-
ted without deletion. Likewise, average effective noise power can be
written as
𝑃𝑛=𝜎2
𝑛+𝑝0(
𝜇2
𝑥,0+𝜎2
𝑥,0)
+𝑝1(
𝜇2
𝑥,1+𝜎2
𝑥,1)
. (11)Array 14 (2022) 100131
5B.B. Yilmaz et al.
Fig. 4. Channel model for the communication system.
Therefore, the effective SNR ( SNReff) in these covert channels can be
defined as
SNReff=𝑃𝑠∕𝑃𝑛. (12)
These equations show that covert channels suffer not only from chan-
nel noise but also variations in signaling time. With the modeling
assumptions from Section 2, we can observe that signaling time varia-
tion behaves like an extra source of channel noise. Therefore, for the
simplicity of discussion, we assume additive channel noise has two
components which are independent of each other: jitter and additive
channel noise.
Having the model for the noise term in the system, the received
samples given in (8) can be simply written as
𝑦𝑛=𝑦𝑜+𝑛𝑐. (13)
Therefore, overall channel between the transmitter and receiver can
be modeled as a discrete memoryless channel since the transmitted
bits show no dependency to other bits in the sequence. Another im-
portant point is that if the communication is insertion/deletion-free,
the overall channel can be considered as a binary channel, but this
leads to overestimation of information leakage through these systems.
The channel model based on these assumptions is given in Fig. 4. To
simplify explanations, we divide the model into two parts Bit-Generation
andCommunication Channel .
The Bit-Generation shows the probabilities of different types of
signals that exist in the system. In this part, 𝑥𝑖represents the trans-
mitter (the actual source of the covert channel). 𝐈represents the other
activities that can cause insertions in the channel. The probabilities
𝑝0and𝑝1(= 1 −𝑝0)are the probabilities to send bit zero and one,
𝑝𝑑is the deletion probability, 𝑝𝑖is the insertion probability, and 𝑝𝑐is
equivalent to 𝑝𝑖+𝑝𝑑. The second part, Communication Channel , presents
the transition probabilities of different symbols. Here, 𝑠0,𝑠1and𝑠?
represent the transmitted bit zero, one, or an insertion/deletion. The
received symbols corresponding to bits zero and one are denoted by 𝑦0
and𝑦1, respectively.
The transmitter behaves like a ternary source, which generates zero,
one or an insertion(or deletion), however, the receiver always inter-
prets the received symbols as zero or one since it is unaware of insertion
(or deletion) locations. Another observation is that the timing variation
while transmitting bit-zero or bit-one could be different, which leads to
differences in 𝑇𝑥distribution. This means the channel does not exhibit a
binary-symmetric feature even if there are no insertions (or deletions).
To incorporate this asymmetrical feature of the system, the substitution
probabilities for bit-zero and bit-one are represented as 𝑝𝑠0and𝑝𝑠1,
respectively.3. Leakage capacity
Having a model for the covert channels enables calculation of leak-
age capacity because leakage capacity corresponds to channel capacity
of the model. In conventional communication systems, the channel
capacity is calculated based on Shannon’s theorem [53]. The channel
capacity is defined as
𝐶=sup
𝑝(𝑥)𝐼(𝑋;𝑌) (14)
where𝑋and𝑌are the random variables for inputs and outputs, and
𝑝(𝑥)is the probability distribution for the inputs. In our scenario, 𝑋and
𝑌represent the symbols sent from the transmitter (a source ), and the
received symbols (by an sink), respectively.
To calculate the leakage capacity, the first step is to obtain the
transition probabilities, 𝑝𝑠𝑖where𝑖∈{0,1}. We know that the threshold
is calculated based on the posterior distribution of the inputs [52], and
that the asymmetric nature of the system affects the threshold while
calculating substitution probability. Combining these information, the
threshold has to fulfill the following equations:
𝑝0𝑓(
𝑧𝑡ℎ𝑟|||̂ 𝜇0,̂ 𝜎2
𝑛,0)
=𝑝1𝑓(
𝑧𝑡ℎ𝑟|||̂ 𝜇1,̂ 𝜎2
𝑛,1)
𝑝0𝑓0(𝑧𝑡ℎ𝑟) =𝑝1𝑓1(𝑧𝑡ℎ𝑟) (15)
where
̂ 𝜇𝑖=𝑇𝑖√
𝑇+𝜇𝑥,𝑖and̂ 𝜎2
𝑛|𝑖=𝜎2
𝑛+𝜎2
𝑥,𝑖,
which represent the effective symbol mean power and the effective
noise variation when bit- 𝑖is transmitted, respectively, 𝑓(𝑥|𝜇,𝜎2)is
the probability density function (pdf) for Gaussian distribution with
mean𝜇and standard deviation 𝜎, and𝑧𝑡ℎ𝑟is the threshold value to
calculate substitution probabilities which preserve the equality in (15).
Therefore, considering all these features of a covert channel, we define
the leakage capacity as
maximize
𝑝(𝑥)𝐼(𝑋;𝑌)
subject to
𝑝(𝑥is insertion) =𝑝𝑖
𝑝0𝑓0(𝑧𝑡ℎ𝑟) = 𝑝1𝑓1(𝑧𝑡ℎ𝑟)
𝑝𝑠0=𝑃0(𝑌 >𝑧𝑡ℎ𝑟)
𝑝𝑠1=𝑃1(𝑌≤𝑧𝑡ℎ𝑟)(16)
where𝑃𝑖(∙)provides the probability of its event with respect to the
pdf of the corresponding bit, 𝑓𝑖(∙). The solution to this optimization
problem provides the worst-case information leakage through covert
channels.
We need to note here that the insertion (or the deletion) probability
depends on the targeted computer system. Therefore, 𝑝𝑖and𝑝𝑑have to
be kept fixed while calculating the leakage capacity. A further analysis
can be done to find the effect of insertion/deletion on the leakage
capacity. We can observe that increase in these probabilities decreases
the channel capacity. That means systems can be designed more chaotic
(randomly pumping power to the systems, activating some random
components, etc.) to increase insertion/deletion probability (which can
be thought as a shielding strategy). Hence, investigating the effect of
deletion/insertion on the channel capacity provides more knowledge
and confidence about the required level of this chaotic regime.
4. Establishing connection between the proposed model and
covert channels
In this section, we explain how the proposed framework can be used
to model various covert channels. By establishing such a connection,
we demonstrate that the model can be utilized to calculate leakage
capacity of these channels, and define a metric measuring the resilience
of any system to covert channel attacks.Array 14 (2022) 100131

curve represents the measured signal and the red (dotted) curve is for the modeled
signal.
4.1. Power based covert channels
The connection between covert channels based on Simple Power
Analysis (SPA) and the proposed model can be established explicitly be-
cause power covert channel attacks utilize total power consumption of
the system. For example, they exploit variation in power consumption
while executing bits for signing operation in crypto-systems [ 18,54].
The main goal is to measure the total power, and to estimate whether
the signed bit is zero or one, therefore, the system can be represented
by OOK modulation.
To calculate the leakage capacity of power covert channel, we can
assume that is the average time required to sign a bit for a cryptosys-
tem, or processing one bit of information. However, processing this
information can take different amount of time due to other software
activities, optimization, etc. Therefore, it can cause some shifts in
time, and variation in processing time, which can be explained by the
proposed model as long as the distribution of the effective variation is
known. Also, due to stalls, interrupts, etc., some of the bits correspond
to deletions or insertions. Both of these issues are covered by the
proposed model, therefore, the power based covert channel can be
analyzed theoretically.
An example of the received signal for power analysis is given in
Fig. 5 when the microbenchmark in [ 16] is executed to transmit 0–1
sequence repetitively (Please note that these are not the signal traces
while signing a key of cryptographic function). Because power channels
are very noisy channels, we filter the signal with move-median filter
that helps exposing the OOK structure of the received signal. Since
the proposed framework is flexible to model any OOK signal with any
duty cycle, it is possible to define and obtain the leakage capacity by
collecting the statistics about timing variation, insertion, and deletions.
4.2. EM-based covert channels
EM covert channels are a consequence of computer activities and
their effects on EM fields. By measuring the variation in the EM field, it
is possible to steal information from a distance [ 4,45,55,56]. Requiring
no direct access to the system and having larger available frequency
band can be listed as the main advantages of these channels over other
covert channels. In this section, we consider two channel types that
exploit the variation in EM field caused by different units of a modern
computer system.
4.2.1. EM-based covert channels due to processor activities
It is already shown that a covert channel can be generated by
running a microbenchmark that causes systematic changes in the sur-
rounding EM field, and a motivated attacker can monitor these changes
to infer the transmitted bits [ 6,45]. An example of the generated signal
is given in Fig. 6. The main observation is that the received signal
displays OOK structure, but suffers from variation in signaling time.

Considering the same arguments with power based covert channels,
we can see that the proposed model can explain the leakage in the
worst-case scenario for a given design. To achieve our goal, the critical
step is to obtain the variable values for deletion, insertion, , and the
distribution of the effective variation. Once we obtain these parameters,
the proposed methodology can be used to assess the resilience of a
system against EM-based covert channels.
4.2.2. EM-covert channels based on power management units
These covert channels are generated by exploiting power manage-
ment units (PMU) and voltage regulator module (VRM) of modern
computers. PMU is responsible for power alteration to optimize the
power consumption of a system. Since the priority of system designers
is to minimize the consumption of power, they do not put enough effort
on the security aspect of their design to covert/side-channel attacks.Array 14 (2022) 100131
7B.B. Yilmaz et al.
Fig. 9. Distributions for the signaling time for various covert channels.
By leveraging such a security flaw, a covert channel that transmits
sensitive information from air-gapped computers is generated in [ 4].
To transmit information, a microbenchmark is designed causing
changes in the power state of a system. An example of the demodulated
signal for the covert channel is given in Fig. 7. The main observation
here is that the received signals are active for a while even for the off
case. However, this is also included in the proposed model since we do
not restrict 𝑇0to be zero. Furthermore, this channel suffers from inser-
tions, deletions and signaling time variation as previously considered
covert channels. Although the received signal is not a perfect square
signal, the proposed methodology can be exploited to calculate the
leakage limit assuming distortions are due to additive channel noise.
4.3. Backscattering covert channels
This covert channel is created by exploiting the recently intro-
duced backscattering side-channel. It exploits circuits as a semi-passive
RFID and relies on switching activities on the level of transistor gates
(between low and high states). The switching activities change the
impedance of circuits, hence, the circuit behaves as an RFID tag. Forexample, by utilizing this channel, circuits with Trojans are identified
because the backscattered signals show different characteristics due to
change in the impedance of the circuits [ 58]. Although there is no
registered attack, or a paper investigating attack scenarios based on
these channels, we still consider this channel to obtain its capacity
because impedance change can result in exfiltration of some sensitive
information.
An example of the received signal for the backscattering covert
channel is given in Fig. 8. The same characteristic features with other
covert channels, i.e., insertions, deletions, timing variation, are ob-
served as well. Therefore, the proposed methodology can calculate the
maximum leakage (or information transfer) given that the statistics
about deletion, insertion, and timing distribution are known.
4.4. Cache-based covert channels
To improve the performance of a computer system by reducing the
effective main memory latencies originating from data accesses, faster
hardware caches are used for storing the frequently used data. Based
on the speed of the caches, they are divided into levels i.e., L1, L2, etc.,Array 14 (2022) 100131
8B.B. Yilmaz et al.
Fig. 10. Distributions for the signaling time for various covert channels.
where the highest cache level i.e. L1 is the smallest, fastest and closest
to the processor, and subsequent lower levels are placed closer to the
main memory with varying higher latencies. Thus, more recent and/or
frequent the data is, the higher it will be placed in the cache levels. The
cache-based covert channel attacks exploit this difference in data access
time to steal sensitive information of a victim. For example, based on
the time differences in recalling cache entries, secret keys of different
cryptosystems are broken [ 5,9]. We need to note here that the recall
time can be used not only for evilpurposes. For example, a methodology
is proposed in [ 59] to profile the memory access that does not cause any
overhead on the system. The method exploits emanated EM signals for
performance analysis, and provides statistical information on the recall
time of the system.
The question here is that how the proposed method can model the
cache based covert channels since the only data collected during these
attacks is the recall time. Let us start with the following observation:
These attacks request recall time at every pre-defined time interval. In
our case, this pre-defined interval is equivalent to . Moreover, the
recall time can be considered as the output of the receiver after filtering
with𝑚𝑐(𝑡). Let𝑇𝑅be the current recall time of an experiment or attack.
If we assume the transmitted signal, 𝑇𝑆(𝑡), is a pulse function whose
width and amplitude are equivalent to the recall time and√

random shift, we have
𝑦(𝑛) =𝑇𝑆(𝑡)∗𝑚𝑐(𝑡−𝑛)||𝑡=𝑛=∫𝑛

𝑑𝜏
=𝑇𝑅 (17)
where
𝑡′=max((𝑛−1),(𝑛−1)+𝑡𝑑)
and𝑡𝑑is the time shift. Since the output is equivalent to 𝑇𝑅, our
model can represent the cache based covert channels with the assumed
transmitter and receiver. Please also observe that the recall time varies
at each operation, and that is represented by the timing distribution in
the model. Another observation is that based on these transmitter and
receiver assumptions, the additive channel noise power is equivalent
to zero, and all of the effective noise is represented by the jitter noise.
Finally, cache-based covert channels generally suffer from deletions
and insertions, which is also considered in the model. Therefore, our
methodology can calculate the leakage capacity of these channels if
the required statistics are available. Comparing to the literature, in this
paper, we experimentally show that signaling time varies significantly
and has a Gaussian structure. In Information Theory, the channel
capacity is calculated under the assumption that the signaling time isArray 14 (2022) 100131

fixed and does not vary from one transmission to another. Also, we
mathematically prove that the signal time variation can be modeled
as an extra source for additive channel noise which causes decrease
in leakage capacity. Another contribution is including the insertion–
deletion channel model to consider the signal losses due to other
program activities. We believe this is the first paper that combines all
these features of memoryless covert channels to estimate their leakage
capacity. After an exhausting research, we have not encountered any
paper that combines all these parameters to propose a model for these
unintended channels.
5. Experimental results and discussion
In this section, we first provide signaling time distributions for vari-
ous covert channels to demonstrate that assuming Gaussian distribution
with a specified mean and standard deviation is valid. Then, we provide
the leakage capacity results for these channels.
For the experiments, the devices we consider are an Altera NIOS-II
processor with a commercial Terassic DE1 SoC board [ 60], an Olin-
uXino board [ 61] which has a modern Cortex A8 ARM core with two
levels of caches, 4 MB main memory that is commonly used in factory
lines, etc., and a Dell Precision 7730 laptop [ 62]. The antennas to
collect emanated signals are a high-gain custom-made disk-array based
antenna [ 63], near EM field probes [ 64], a power rail probe [ 65], a
horn antenna [ 66] and a lab-made near field probe. We record the
signals using a spectrum analyzer (Agilent MXA N9020 A) [ 67].
The first goal of these experiments is to collect data while transmit-
ting bits to experimentally obtain the distribution of 𝑇𝑥for both bits.
In that respect, we follow the experiments done in [ 6] for EM, [ 4] for
power unit, [ 57] for backscattering, and [ 5,59] for cache-based covert
channels. For the power covert channel, we collect the signal fromTable 1

a capacitor while running the code given in [ 46] and following the
attack scenario given in [ 19]. The setup for all these measurements are
given in Fig. 9. For more accurate distribution results of 𝑇𝑥, we collect
signals closer to the device under inspection, and then perform an
edge detection to obtain the width of the pulses. Empirical cumulative
distribution functions (CDF) of bit-1 for various covert channels are
given in Fig. 10. Furthermore, in this figure, we provide CDF of normal
distributions that are fitted to these data. As seen from these figures,
the signaling time distributions have a Gaussian characteristic, which
means the assumption in Section 2 holds. Actually, the assumption is
also supported by Law of Large numbers [ 68] because of ubiquitous
software activities.
The experimental variables required for the leakage capacity cal-
culation for the experiments are given in Table 1. Here,𝜎0and𝜎1
represent standard deviations of the signaling time ( 𝜎𝑥) when bit-0
and bit-1 are transmitted, respectively. Since the performance of these
covert channels, in terms of bandwidth, noise characteristics, etc., are
different from each other, we choose different transmission time for
more reliable results. For example, in the literature, the reported trans-
mission rates for various covert channel attacks vary from 5 bit/s to aArray 14 (2022) 100131

couple of kbits/s [ 4,51,69,70]. Please note that these parameters are
not known beforehand and need to be measured carefully to calculate
the possible leakage capacity. In that respect, an experimental setup
needs to be designed which maximizes the SNR of the received signals
and minimizes the interference caused by surrounding signals. These
steps are required because we do not have any control on the power of
the transmitted signal, and even have limited control on the signaling
time of the signals for the covert channels like cache, etc. The leakage
capacities, which are obtained by solving the optimization problem
given in Section 3, are provided in Figs. 11 and 12. In the first figure, we
provide the results in terms of Bit/Channel-Use [ 34] to show whether
maximum gain from each bit transmission can be achieved at any
SNR. The figures contain behavior of maximum leakage as the sum of
deletion and insertion, 𝑝𝑐, changes. For a fair comparison of channel
capacity for various deletion and insertion probabilities, SNRis defined
as
𝑆𝑁𝑅=2((𝑇0)2+(𝑇1)2)
2𝜎2
𝑛. (18)
We observe that the maximum gain is only possible if there is no
insertion and deletion, and the communication takes place in high SNR,
which is an unrealistic scenario because of unintentional nature of covert
channels. However, it does not mean that systems are secure enough
to attacks exploiting these channels. If the attacker can establish a
longer connection, even transmission with slow data rate could be a
disaster. For example, if SNR is 5 dB, and 𝑝𝑐= 0.8, a communication
with at least 0.1 Bit/Channel-Use could be possible for any given covert
channel. Considering the attacker aims to steal some passwords, credit
card information, etc., even this rate could be severe enough. In Fig. 12,
the same results are given in terms of Bit-per-second (Bps). Our goal is
to illustrate that hundreds of information bits can be transmitted persecond through these channels even tough leakage capacity is small in
terms of Bit/Channel-Use. For example, when Fig. 11(e) is compared
with the rest of covert channels, we can conclude that it is the most
inefficient channel for an attacker. However, Fig. 12(e) demonstrates
that this channel can achieve higher data rates than others.
Another interesting observation here is that although all but cache-
based covert channels achieve almost the maximum gain in terms of
Bit/Channel-Use for high SNR, the cache-based covert channel con-
verges to 0.6 Bit/Channel-Use. The reason is higher signaling time
deviation when a cache-miss occurs. This introduces powerful jitter
noise to the system, which could not be alleviated even the attacker
measures the signal when SNR=∞. This result shows that the signaling
time variation causes a decisive additive noise which decreases the
transmission rate further.
In Fig. 13, we provide the same results with Fig. 11 for backscat-
tering and cache-based covert channels to observe the behavior in
a 3-D surface plot. These figures reveal the general behavior of the
worst-case leakage scenarios through different covert channels. Here,
as the representative of other covert channels, we provide the results
for backscattering covert channels. Our observation here is that the
decrease in the leakage capacity of cache-based covert channel is
sharper in both 𝑝𝑐andSNR directions than the backscattering channel
due to jitter noise. However, both figures illustrate the possibility of
severe information leakages through covert channels.
We compare our outcomes with the results given in [ 45]. In that
paper, capacity bounds for the leakage capacity are provided. For a fair
comparison, we assume
•The channels do not experience deletions but insertions,
•The signal deviation for both bits are same with zero mean,
•The standard deviation of signaling variation does not variate
with respect to bit value.Array 14 (2022) 100131
11B.B. Yilmaz et al.
Fig. 13. Bit/Channel use while 𝑝𝑐andSNR vary.
Fig. 14. The proposed leakage capacity and bounds given in [ 45] while SNR changes.
The results are given in Fig. 14. In this figure, we provide the upper
and lower bounds in [ 45], and the proposed leakage capacity for the
EM covert channel. In that paper, instead of providing an estimate for
the leakage capacity, the model provides the leakage capacity bounds.
The gap between these bounds increases as the insertion probability
increases. We observe that our leakage capacity lies within the region
defined by the bounds, and closer to the upper bound. We conclude that
the decrease in the leakage capacity is much less than the decrease in
the lower bound in [ 45] as the insertion probability increases. Please
note that the proposed channel model can be used to calculate the
mutual information for the leakage and success probability as given
in [2,36,37,71] if deletion and insertion probabilities are zero and if
signaling time shows no variation. Therefore, we believe that our model
can be extended by including the assumptions related the distributions
of leakages given in these papers.
Although all these results demonstrate the possible threat through
these covert channels, the methodology in this paper can be used by
designers to make their systems more resilient to covert channels. In
thedesign-stage , designers can collect the statistics for 𝑝𝑐, and estimate
signal power that can be generated by any covert channel attack.
Then, SNR vs. leakage capacity analysis can be done by solving the
optimization problem given in Section 3. If the leakage is zero or very
close to zero at the targeted SNR, they can conclude their system is
secure enough. Otherwise, they need to modify their design to protect
privacy of their customer.
Please note that this paper considers the capacity of memoryless
covert channels modulated with on–off keying. Since these channelsare artifacts of legitimate program activities, estimating the param-
eters beforehand to calculate the channel capacity is overwhelming.
Therefore, all these parameters are required to be obtained via exper-
imentation. Also, for better assessment of system security to attacks
based on these covert channels, people with expertise in covert chan-
nels need to perform the experiments. Lack of expertise can cause
over/under-estimation of system security.
6. Conclusions
This paper considers the capacity of memoryless covert channels
modulated with on–off keying. Since these channels are artifacts of
legitimate program activities, estimating the parameters beforehand to
calculate the channel capacity is overwhelming. Therefore, all these pa-
rameters are required to be obtained via experimentation. We proposed
a methodology that can model multiple covert channels and estimate
the available information to attackers for the worst-case scenarios
through these covert channels. We showed that the method can be
adopted to both analog and digital covert channels. To model the losses
due to software activities, we first modeled the communication channel
as a deletion–insertion channel. Then, we introduced the jitter noise
that is an extra source for additive white noise. This jitter noise is a
result of signaling time variation due to stalls, interrupts, optimization,
etc., which conventional communication systems do not suffer. We
showed that these noise sources can be combined and called effective
additive noise. Secondly, based on the effective noise, we modeled the
communication channel between the receiver (a source ) and transmitter
(asink). Then, we defined the channel capacity as the maximum
leakage for a given covert channel. Finally, we provide experimental
results for various covert channels to show that the proposed model is
an effective and a general method to attain the resilience of a given
system.
