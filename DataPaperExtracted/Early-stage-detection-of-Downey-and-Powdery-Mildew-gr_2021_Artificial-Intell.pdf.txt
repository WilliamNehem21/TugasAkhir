Article history:Received 19 March 2021Received in revised form 5 October 2021Accepted 6 October 2021Available online 18 October 2021Grape diseases are major factors causing severe diminution in its fruit development. Unfavorable climatic condi-tions are one of the principal dangers for grape disease development. Downy Mildew, Powdery Mildew, Anthrac-nose, Stem borer, Black Rot, Leaf Blight are widespread grape leaf vermin and diseases, which cause sternmonetary losses to the grape industry. Devices ready to quantify the climate conditions in real-time for diseaseonset are hence crucial to perform timely diagnosis and precise detection of grape leaf diseases. This will ensurethe healthy growth of grape plants, further controlling the spread of diseases. This paper discusses the require-ments for building a consistent grape disease detection framework that would encourage headways in agribusi-ness. The primary aim of this work is to adapt an Internet of Things (IoT) based approach to predict theoccurrence of Downey and Powdery Mildew grape diseases at an early stage. The sensor values received aretransmitted to the Central Server with the help of the IoT device NodeMCU. At the server side, an analysis ismade based on weather conditions. Further noti ﬁcation to the farmer is sent if weather properties are conducive for disease onset. The exclusivity of the system lies in using a rain gauge sensor along with the temperature sen-sor to predict the occurrence of grape diseases. This system realizes an overall accuracy of 94.4% for Downey Mil-dew and 96% for Powdery Mildew. Experimental results suggest the projected model can pro ﬁciently recognize Downey and Powdery Mildew grape diseases.© 2020 The Authors.

1. IntroductionThe grape industry is one of the signiﬁcant organic product indus- tries in India. Nearly 2,46,133 tons of fresh grapes worth $334.79 millionwere exported by India in 2018–19 (Indian Grape Forum, 2019). Maha- rashtra (third largest state in India) comprising over 81% of the yield forgrape production in India. However, grape plants are vulnerable to dif-ferent types of diseases due to the ongoing climate conditions such asrain and humidity. Ranchers struggle with various issues in keepinggrape quality and trade responsibilities in diverse business sectors. Sub-sequently, detection and prevention of grape leaf diseases at an earlystage are required by vineyard peasants and research experts.Downey Mildew (induced by Plasmoparaviticola), and Grape Pow-dery Mildew (induced by Uncinulanecator (Schw.) Burr.), are two sig-niﬁcant diseases of grape in numerous parts of the world ( GuanlinLi and Wang, 2011). These diseases affect both leaves and grapefruits.Downey is particularly severe under severe precipitation, high relativemoistness, and signiﬁcant stretches of dampness on leaves and fruits(Indu et al., 2010); whereas high humidity and moist weather favoursthe development of Powdery disease ( Mundankar et al., 2008). Crop protection products (fungicides) are applied to minimize these diseases.Fungicides are expensive for farmers and can cause ecological contami-nation (Weissteiner et al., 2014), (Zhang et al., 2011)(Zhao and Pei, 2012). Thus, only applied when there are vibrant signals about the exis-tence of the disease.Many recent approaches for disease identi ﬁcation depends primarily on visual or image recognition. Nonetheless, this is a tedious and oneroustask. Precision horticulture (McBratney et al., 2005)a i m st oi m p r o v et h e yield per unit of cropland using Information and Communication Tech-nologies (ICT) equipment and advancements. Utilization of ICT devicesand identiﬁcation frameworks have been created to notify the farmersabout the unexpected advent of diseases. Grape diseases can disseminateswiftly in various climates due to temperature and humidity ( Eitzinger et al., 2013) under India climatic conditions. Other countries such as theU.S. and Australia have various systems in place that use both hourlyand daily meteorological conditions to anticipate the onset of a varietyof different crop diseases but not for grapes. The disease model developedby (Thomas et al., 1994) computes the day-to-day average temperatureArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 223 –232

They discuss the model testing in California climaticconditions. There is a need for devices to quantify the climate conditionsin real-time such that onset of grape disease can be predicted. In recentyears, modern mechanisms from the Internet of Things (IoT) have beenutilized to acquire real-time onsite observations ( Pesonen et al., 2014) and it is crucial to build disease models referenced to these IoT devices.The principal objective of this work is to acclimate a disease warningmodel in theﬁeld of viticulture via an innovative framework using sen-sors to measure real-time meteorological conditions within the vine-yard. Measured data is sent to a central server using the cloud and analert message is sent to the farmer, when the favorable conditionsarise, for the occurrence of Downey and Powdery on grapes or leaves.Distinctively, the contributions of this effort are:(a) Effective determination of Downey and Powdery mildew via leafwetness, humidity and temperature.(b) Pro-creation of regular warnings, contingent on the level of de-velopment and kind of disease, sent directly to farmers; and.(c) Application of the models for use on IoT hubs sent legitimately.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents thebackground. Section 3 details methodology used to detect Downey andPowdery Mildew grape disease, in vineyards. Section 4 shows experi-mental results of this system followed by insights on performance.Section 5 concludes the work and proposes commendation of futurework.2. BackgroundDowney Mildew (PlasmoparaViticola) is a major grape disease inIndia (Emmett et al., 1992). Farmers need to use judgment on whetherto use fungicides for Downey Mildew ( Magarey et al., 1991)n o t i n gt h a t both cost and residue levels on crops increase with fungicide use.Clearly, farmers need to restrict the occasions to shower, so that thecost diminishes along with ecological contamination; however theylikewise need to limit the danger of crop failure because of the disease.Decades ago only a few methodologies were utilized to anticipate GrapeDowny Mildew disease. Various statistical models were evolved ( Hill, 2000)(Maurin, 1983)(Tran Manh Sung et al., 1990)(Blaise and Gessler, 1992)(Orlandini et al., 1993) that performed without explaining all functioning details. Robotic models often depends onthe assessment of numerous parameters and require a good knowledgeof mechanisms and impact of various ecological factors on thesemechanisms. In 1992, an Austrian analyst built up the Metos pro-grammed climate station and related software, to foresee the occur-rence of Downy Mildew. The abroad could not precisely determinediseases in India. The Metos software model (G. Pessl, 2000) was per- sonalized for South African environment in 1995. Consequences haverevealed that supplementary splashes were required in the protectionshowering program, rather than proposals of the Metos-2 model, forthe equivalent or even further developed control of Downey mildew.Metos-2 model didn't caution of any Downey mildew contaminations.In 2006 to make it more exact and easy to use DonsigeSkimmelVroeg-Waarskuwings model (DSVW) (Afrikaans for “Downey Mildew Early Warning Model”) was developed (Haasbroek and Vermeulen, 2005). Two signiﬁcant changes were made in comparison to Metos-2, the leafwetness was supplanted with a numerical, non-linear regression andthe Metos-2 model's“Yes/No”admonitions for Downey Mildew dis-eases were supplanted with four classes of potential dangers. The deter-mined leaf wetness of the DSVW model, which used estimated relativedampness and air temperature as info esteems, had a critical coef ﬁcient of assurance of 0.70, compared to estimated leaf wetness.The DSVWmodel yield at present gives a graphical depiction of the past climatefactors (as long as 3 weeks), and an alert of (3 unique tones - high, me-dium and low possibility) of probable favorable condition for both es-sential and optional disease occurrence.Powdery Mildew is another monetarily signi ﬁcant disease. In India, this disease reoccurs in grape plantations with humid climate (e.g.high relative dampness) favoring growth of the disease (
Oberti et al., 2014). Presently, in the hotter and drier grapevine-developing terri-tories, powdery mildew is meticulously constrained by agrochemicals,applied consistently in grape plantations ( Stummer et al., 2003) (Calonnec et al., 2004)(Crisp et al. (2006a))(Crisp et al. (2006b)) (Iriti et al., 2011).Sensor mechanization for grape yield malady has been comprehen-sively analyzed by (Sankaran et al., 2010), who describe current tech- nologies for developing a ground-based sensor framework which aidin supervising disease in plants underﬁeld conditions. The authors also reviewed that the spectroscopic and imaging innovation could beincorporated with a self-governing agricultural automobile for reliableand real time disease detection recognition to accomplish predominantplant disease monitoring and control. Various researchers haveprojected solutions for identifying the condition of a vineyard by utiliz-ing sensors. Sensors permit us to recognize the particular necessities ofevery territory, which improves the supervision of the grape plantationand addresses the potential issues precisely. The majority of recent liter-ature centers on remote monitoring of vineyards grapevines by utilizing

These approaches include the procurement of spectral information using ex-pensive technologies, for example, satellites, airplanes, or UnmannedAerial Vehicles. Agrochemical information can be utilized to developthe grape plant growth process and to ensure tractability and precisegrapevine health perceptions. The impact of explicitly planned Highand Low Frequency transponders when embedded in grape vineyardsis documented in (Luvisi et al., 2012). In spite of the fact that the tracta-ble data is helpful, the authors describe that the embedding methodsdistress the development of the shoots examined.Vite.net, introduced in (Rossi et al., 2014)i sa ne n c o m p a s s i n gm e t h - odology which incorporates a real-time monitoring framework and on-line system to deal with the grape plantation. Nonetheless, the authorsdepend on third–party hardware, so details on the sensor hubs are pre-cluded. A wireless sensor network for precision viticulture ( Matese et al., 2009)i su s e f u lf o ro b s e r v i n gg r a p ep lantations progressively. The framework incorporates a climate station and a few remote hubs situatedin the grape plantation. A modem introduced on the hubs transmits theinformation to a remote central server. This system gathers only minia-ture meteorological factors. (Zhang et al., 2015) proposed a system for ag- riculture monitoring using factors like temperature, soil dampness, andcomputes system dependent on theﬁeld information. The system incor- porated WSN with decision support system and computerized many un-dertakings including climate monitoring. It gives an instrument toranchers, framework clients, and viticulture ventures, to further developthe grape plantation proﬁciency. Various organizations now offer im-proved monitoring solutions for grape plantations. SGSMap developedan agribusiness system that sustainsthe choices of grapevine cultivatorsand vintners on grapevine growth (VintiOS, 2020). The product showsboth the location and all information identi ﬁed with it. (Monet, 2020), outlines a comparative instrument, which monitors the wellbeing of agrape plantation, that includes the danger of rising disease outbreak, cli-mate data. Other exclusive arrangements have been proposed bySmartVineyard (SmartVineyard, 2020) which incorporate precision sen- sors equipped for seizing precise weather parameters (e.g. hourly,daily). The sensor is intended for grapes and can be placed among leavesto convey this important information to viticulturists.On studying all the frameworks referenced and summarized (SeeTable 1.), Our proposed system intendsﬁve primary focal points that have not been discussed simultaneously in the literature. To beginwith, it gives a total hardware and software framework, so similarity is-sues are limited. Secondly, this system tries not to gather informationfrom or through third-party cloud-based platforms Third, because ofthe utilization of standard android Nodes, the arrangement cost of theframework is genuinely reasonable, while giving a decent coverage.Fourth, it focuses on early stage detection in grape production. Lastly,this approach has been devised in a secluded manner for ease in addingnew alerts, sensors, and actuators to the framework.Hence, the objective for this work lies in developing an adaptablesystem for the management of grape diseases that occurs at muchearly stages for crop disease using wireless sensors nodes.3.

Thus, the proposed system stands in fortwo essential necessities:a. It tracks important factors that inﬂuence growth of grapes withinvineyard while offering data through the Internet by utilizing awide scope of sensors.b. It helps in grape disease prevention through prescient models, pro-curing alerts to the farmers from the vineyard.The implementation of algorithms 3.1 and 3.2 automates theidentiﬁcation of Downey and Powdery mildew grape diseases andsends notiﬁcation for these diseases to the farmers. Algorithms areexecuted on a central server which monitors the status of the dis-ease occurrence using the climatic parameters gathered from thesensor hubs. A notiﬁcation is sent to the farmer when leaf wetnessand the temperature range sensed by the sensors surpasses thethreshold value necessary for disease onset. The ﬂow diagram for our approach demonstrates its inward operations and multifacetednature(Fig. 1).

Temperature and RainSensor nodes are used to gather sensor information and send them tothe central server via IoT device platform NodeMCU( NodeMCU ESP8266, 2020).NodeMCU is liable for transmitting the records accrued from thesensor nodes to the Central Server.3.2.2. SensorsTemperature Sensor and Rain Sensor measure essential environ-mental parameters viz. temperature, humidity and rainfall. Each sensoris managed by a NodeMCU (a low cost ﬁrmware and development board particularly designed for Internet of Things (IoT) based applica-tions (NodeMCU ESP8266, 2020)). NodeMCU is programmed by theIDE of Arduino Microcontroller ATMEGA 2560 utilizing sensor librariesoffered by Arduino commune. Speciﬁcation of the proposed solution can be observed inTable 2.3.2.3. GSM module and LCD displayNotiﬁcation are sent to the farmers by the means of Short MessagingService (SMS) about the grape disease occurrence. SIM800L GSM/GPRS,4 V, is the modem selected for the transmission of messages, and LCDDisplay allows the farmers to visualize the temperature and humidityvalues on theﬁeld.4. Results and discussionsThis section discusses about the experimental setup deployed in theﬁeld and actual results captured from the ﬁeld at real time. Captured data from IoT sensors were analyzed using the algorithm stated to testfor the occurrences of Downey and Powdery Mildew. After analysisthe proposed system is compared with the existing system which re-veals that the proposed system is worth detecting the occurrence ofboth diseases.4.1.

2284.2. SimulationThe proposed model has been evaluated based on the data gatheredin real -time by the IoT based device placed in the farm. This section pre-sents the evaluation of the devised model.Table 3, shows the data collection values for experimental purpose.The recordings of sensor values were collected during 1
stSeptember 2019 to 31
stAugust 2020, 1080 recordings in each farm under consider-ation i.e. 6 values per day.Fig. 4.depicts a graph of the information sensed by sensors (temper-ature and rainfall) and sent to the server by NodeMCU from15thSeptember 2019 to 15thOctober 2019 at Prashant Agro Farm. Italso shows the temperature values sensed in the period of 15th Feb2020 to 15th March 2020. It demonstrates the estimations after everyfour hours. This is also depicted inTable 3i.e. testing samples estima- tions are 215 per farm.Fig. 5shows the temperature acquired by the hub on 15
thSeptember -17th September 2019 and 12
thMarch to 15th March 2020 respectively(from Prashant Agro Farm). The encircled value in Fig. 5a indicates the favorable condition for Downey Mildew showing temperature value21 °C and heavy rainfall in accordance to the algorithm 3.2. Similarly,inFig. 5b. The encircled value indicates the favorable condition for Pow-dery Mildew showing temperature value 23 °C and cloudy atmospherein accordance to the algorithm 3.2.A small dissimilarity can modify the turn of events and necessities ofthe plant even though initially the information may appear to be analo-gous. For example, favorable conditions for Downey Mildew aroseapproximately at night 9.00 p.m. on 15th Sept 2019 as heavy rain wassensed by the rain gauge sensor,Fig. 5. (a). These conditions occurred because of the downpour, and a decrease in the temperature. Similar ex-perimentation was carried out to demonstrate occurrence of PowderyMildew from 12thMarch 2020 to 15thMarch 2020.4.3. AlertsThe temperature and rain level values are checked after every fourhours.Fig. 6, depicts the Experimental device set on the ﬁeld to display and gather the agroparameters value and also the message of diseaseoccurrence. If the parameters convene the threshold values, a noti ﬁca- tion is sent to the farmer.Fig. 6also illustrates an instance of a warningsent by SMS about the occurrence of Downey and Powdery Mildewdisease.4.4. Performance measureThe performance of the developed merchandise is assessed by com-puting accuracy Eq.(1), recall Eq.(2), and precision Eq.(3)based on Confusion Matrix as shown inTables 4.1 and 4.2for Downey and Pow- dery respectively. The Accuracy, Recall and Precision are derived fromTrue Positive (TP), True Negative(TN), False Positive (FP), False Nega-tive(FN). These are calculated as follows:Accuracy¼

From the above results we can observe that 94.4% of recordings werecorrectly identiﬁed in case of Downey Mildew disease occurrence and96% for Powdery Mildew. Thus, the accuracy achieved has helped thefarmers to reduce the use of fungicides on grape plants. This increasesthe quality of grapes.4.5. Comparison with other systemsDepending upon the proposed system, the grape diseases can be ef-fectively identiﬁed at a much early stage. The novelty of the proposedsystem lies in using the Rain sensor along with temperature and humid-ity sensor. The accuracy of disease notiﬁcation is therefore considerably increased then if a rain gauge was omitted. Thus, the projected devicedemonstrates higher performance in recognizing grape diseases.In this proposed system, temperature and rainfall level have beenused as features to identify the favorable conditions for grape diseasegrowth. The performance of the projected framework has beencontrasted with existing detailed strategies and is conferred in Table 6, proposed (Patil and Thorat, 2016), (Das et al., 2009)(Kharde and Kulkarni, 2016). The systems used for comparison have used IoT, WSNand Image Processing approach. All the systems have been analyzedon our augmented data set and achieved accuracy of approximately90%. However, the accuracy proposed in our system is increased dueto the use of rain sensor along with humidity and temperature sensor.From the comparison, it is clear that the proposed algorithm is capableof identifying Downey and Powdery Mildew grape disease with high ac-curacy better than other systems investigated.5. ConclusionThis paper presents a framework dependent on wireless sensor hubsthat considers remote monitoring of grape plantations. Particularly, theproposed system suggests an executive approach to control Downeyand Powdery Mildew (devastating grape diseases for vine producers).Based on literature surveys, we develop an adaptable system for themanagement of grape diseases at much early stage using wireless sen-sor nodes. When a particular threshold level is achieved, the proposedframework generates an alert to the farmer so they may take preventivemeasures by scouting and potentially using a fungicide. Consequently,the framework avoids the use of pesticides and herbicides when not re-quired, thereby reducing the impact on the surroundings and minimiz-ing the cost to farmers.The system was deployed initially in Prashant Agro Farm(Materwadi, PimalgaonBaswant) and also Boraste farm(Sakura,PimapalgaonBaswant) in September 2019. The arrangement includedtwo types of sensor hubs dependent on ESP8266 microcontrollers.Type-1 nodes monitor environmental information and Type-2, precipi-tation level. A battery was used to satisfy the power supply of the grape-vine in an economical manner. The data gathered by the developedsystem is introduced through an easy to understand LCD interface forrepresentation. The information can also be accessed online throughthe cloud and can be operated from any PC, tablet or smartphone withthe sole prerequisite of having a browser and an Internet link. Addition-ally, the framework offers state-of-art information to deal with thegrape plantation in the form of cautions by means of messages to thefarmers. As regards to the tests performed, it was con ﬁrmed that the framework executed well in a real-world situation and also gave accu-rate information gathered on the climate, the nodes, and the alarms re-lated with the advancement of Downey and Powdery Mildew grapedisease.To summarize, all outcomes from the proposed system af ﬁrm that it offers excellent information to the grapevine producers to automate thedetection of Downey and Powdery Mildew through monitoringweather related variables while providing a cost-effective system forthe ranchers to address real-time climate issues surrounding diseasemanifestation in grape plantations.CRediT authorship contribution statementKainjan Sanghavi:Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing –orig- inal draft, Visualization, Investigation.Mahesh Sanghavi:Data curation,
