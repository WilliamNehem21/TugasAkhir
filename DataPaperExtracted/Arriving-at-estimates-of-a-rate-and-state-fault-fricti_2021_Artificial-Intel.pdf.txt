The critical slip distance in rate and state model for fault friction in the study of potential earthquakes can varywildly from micrometers to few me-ters depending on the length scale of the critically stressed fault. Thismakes it incredibly important to construct an inversion framework that provides good estimates of the criticalslip distance purely based on the observed ac-celeration at the seismogram. To eventually construct a frame-work that takes noisy seismogram acceleration data as input and spits out robust estimates of critical slipdistance as the output, weﬁrst present the performance of the framework for synthetic data. The framework isbased on Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte C arlo methods. The synthetic data is generated by adding noise to the acceleration output of spring-slider-damper idealization of the rate and state model as theforward model.
1. IntroductionInversion of seismogram data to infer subsurface properties is one ofthe most critical aspects of geophysics research. In a nutshell, the ac-tivity at and around discontinuities called faults in the subsurfacespawn off seismic waves which are recorded at the surface on a seis-mogram. Some of these recordings are too weak to enable any inferenceof subsurface properties, while some are too rich in terms in seismicsignatures. Theﬁeld of waveform inversion deals with the aspects ofinference for the latter. The core set of mathematical operations forwaveform inversion are going back and forth between the time domainand the frequency domain. To the naked eye, these operations and al-gorithms to implement them can get a little complicated to the com-munity of researchers who do not have aﬁrm background in inversion geophysics. Over the past few years, Bayesian methods to infer prop-erties from seismogram data have become popular because of theadvent of high performance computing and the ability to constructreduced order models of the highﬁdelity physics using deep learning.At the heart of the Bayesian inversion framework lies the feasibility toperform a lot of fast forward simulations to eventually arrive at robustestimates of the model parameter. Before stepping into any inversionframework, two questions are critical (1) What is the forward model?and (2) What are we infering? In the geophysics realm, the connectionbetween the physics of what happens around the fault and what hap-pens at the fault is achieved using the rate- and state- model for frictionevolution, which is considered the gold standard for modeling earth-quake cycles on faults (Ruina, 1983;Scholz, 1989;Marone, 1998;Meng and Shi, 2021;Jia et al., 2021;Zhu et al., 2020)

Understanding the physics that controls the critical slip distance and explains the gapbetween observations from experimental and natural faults is thus oneof the crucial problems in both the seismology and laboratory com-munities (Ohnaka, 2003). With that in mind, we provide a frameworkin which synthetic earthquake data is used to quantify uncertainty incritical slip distance. While the resolution and coupled ﬂow and poromechanics (Dana and Wheeler, 2018a;Dana and Wheeler, 2018b; Dana et al., 2018;Dana et al., 2021;DanaJoel Ita and Wheeler, 2020; Dana et al., 2020;Dana, 2018;Dana and Reddy, 2021;Dana and Reddy Lyathakula, 2021) associated with subsurface activity in therealm of energy technologies and concomitant earthquake quanti ﬁ- cation is a hot topic, in this work, we focus on the effect of a standardtrigonometric perturbation with exponentially decreasing amplitude.In section2, we explain the spring slider damper idealization to inferthe inﬂuence of critical slip distance on RSF without recourse tocomplicated elastodynamic equations.

The formalism of Bayesian inference with Markov chainMonte Carlo samplingThe Bayesian inference framework works on the basic tent ofuncovering a distribution centered around the true value and starts offwith an initial guess for the distribution also called “prior”Dto eventually get to the most accurate distribution possible also called“posterior”Pthrough a likelihoodL. The Bayes theorem in a nutshell is:P¼D/C2LRD/C2L (7)The prior is typically taken to be a Gaussian distribution and thelikelihood carries information about the forward model. The quantitythat makes evaluation of the posterior dif ﬁcult is the integral term in the denominator. Since direct evaluation of the integral using quad-rature rules is expensive, sampling methods like Markov chain MonteCarlo (MCMC) (Shapiro, 2003;Keith Hastings, 1970;Haario et al., 2001;Mueller, 2010) are used. To put it mathematically, if we wereevaluating an integral, then the sampling would apply to points atwhich we know the value of integrand, and then proceed to evaluatethe integral. But if the integrand at each of those points is a distri-bution rather than a value, it makes the sampling and subsequentaveraging signiﬁcantly more complicated. By constructing a Markovchain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution,

The more steps are included, the more closely thedistribution of the sample matches the actual desired distribution.3.1.

mc, which is the Markov process. The computational time ofthe MCMC sampling method is proportional to the number of generatedsamplesn. To put it more succinctly, the algorithm is elucidated in Al-gorithm 1.4. ResultsFigs. 3 and 4show a gradual improvement in the estimated modelparameter as the number of samples is increased. It is evident that theframework has a lot more difﬁculty converging to the true value if theinitial guess is far away from the true value. In reality, it is not reallyknown what the true value is, and arbitrary initial guesses will lend asolution that is way off target regardless of the number of samplingpoints. We observe fromFig. 3that the response is not necessarilymonotonic, in the sense that the estimated value with the maximumprobability does not necessarily monotonically converge to the true valueas the number of sampling points is increased. In all of the simulations,we observe in all the simulations that the Bayesian framework does anexcellent job of dropping to the ballpark of the expected true value withintheﬁrst few samples.4.1. With burn-inAs an MCMC algorithm is rarely initialized from its invariant distri-bution, there might be some concern that its initial values might biasresults even if it does approach this equilibrium distribution later on. Tocompensate for this, a burn-in period is often implemented: the ﬁrst N samples being discarded, with N being chosen to be large enough that thechain has reached its stationary regime by this time. We take that burn-inS. Dana, K.R. Lyathakula Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Geosciences 2 (2021) 171 –178
175number to be half the number of samples. A comparison between Figs. 3 and 5as well asFigs. 4 and 6clearly demonstrates the improved accuracyof the estimate when a certain number of samples are burnt-in.5. Conclusions and outlookThe rate and state model for fault friction evolution is a piece of thepuzzle in which forward simulations are used to arrive at the seismicimpact of fault slip on earthquake activity. Typically, the earthquakes aremeasured with seismograms and geophones on the surface as P-wavesand S-waves, and then these readings are used to calibrate the seismicactivity for constant monitoring. The acceleration ﬁeld around the fault slip activity translates to these waves recorded on the surface, and for-ward simulations with wave propagation bridge that gap. That beingsaid, a seismic recording on the surface cannot easily be backtraced toacceleration around the fault, andﬁnally to the source of the fault slip.That is precisely inverse modeling, and the Bayesian framework coupledwith MCMC allows us to put such a framework in place. The accelerationsareﬁeld quantities, and the inverse estimation of the ﬁeld around the fault from the time series at the seismogram and/or geophone is not atrivial task. With that in mind, we test the robustness of the Bayesian/MCMC framework to inversely estimate a value instead of a ﬁeld. The thing is that any inversion framework works on data as the input, andsince subsurface data is not available other the sensors at the wells, theforward simulations are used to generate this data with all the compu-tational physics put in place. This generated data is then used to inverselyestimate the accelerationﬁeld from the data at the surface. Althoughsuch forward simulations to generate data are infeasible in real-timescenarios where we need estimates of what is happening in the subsur-face from the reading on the surface almost immediately, the frameworkrobustness would eventually lend itself to that scenario. The scenario isthat the recording at the seismogram and/or geophone would be fed intothe Bayesian/MCMC fraemwork as an input, and the framework wouldprovide an estimate of the accelerationﬁeld around the fault as the output. In this work, we work on arriving at estimates of critical slipdistance in the rate and state model by running a spring-slider-damper asthe forward model instead of using a full-ﬂedged forward simulator. In the future, we will be deploying the coupled ﬂow and geomechanics simulator as the forward model, and gradually arrive at the aforemen-tioned scenario.
