the basis of various performance parameters. Data pa ckets are transmitted through IASEN–2 [8] and IASEN– 3 to a preset number of destinations. Results show  that IASEN–3 has better throughput and processor utilization than the IASEN–2 [8] in faulty and non–faulty network scenario. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In sec tion 2, structure of IASEN–3 is discussed. Section 3 shows the routing algorithm. In section 4, the performances factors are explained. Results are shown in section 5. At last, section 6 is followed by conclusion and references. 2. Proposed Interconnection Network The structure of Irregular Augmented Shuffle Exchange  Network–3 is based on IASEN–2 [8]. In Fig. 1, we can see that it has 16 sources and 16 destinations, hence the size of IASEN–3 is N =16. All the sources and destinations are tightly coupled with the comple te network through multiplexers (Mux) and demultiplexers (Demux). This is a 3–stage MIN. In first and last stage, each source or each destination is connected with three switching elements (SEs) of that particular stage e.g. source 11 is connected with SE f, a and d and therefore f, a and d are the primary, first alternate and second alternate SEs for source 11. Similarly, we can find out the primary, first alternate and second alternate SEs for other sources and destinations. The size of each SE in first and third stage is 2×3 and 3×2 respectively. In stage 2, the size of each SE is 8×8.

3. Routing Algorithm of IASEN–3 In the routing algorithm of IASEN–3, if request arrives at the primary SE of first stage (PSE
1) or primary SE of third stage (PSE
3), then we have to check that SE. If it is busy or faulty (FBY) then first alternate SE  0 1      0     1

(AE1) will get the request of that particular stage. If AE 1 is busy or faulty then request will be arrived at second alternate SE (AE2). In case all the SEs i.e. PSE
1, AE1 and AE2 of first stage or PSE 3, AE1 and AE2 of third stage are not responding properly then request will be dropped. If request arrives at SE i of second stage and it is busy or faulty then SE j of second stage will receive the request. If it is also busy or faulty then request will be dropped. Finally, we can say that, if the required SEs of all three stages are in working condition then data will be transmitted from the given source to its given destinations otherwise data transmission process will be stopped. In third step of algorithm the term “Node” may be the SE of second stage or the given destination.

End ______________________________________________________________________________________ Theorem: IASEN-3 is a single switch fault tolerant network in every stage.  Proof: Let the source is 2 and destinations is 9. We assumed that SEs b, i, and o are faulty. In this situation the rest of the paths are as follows: Path 1: 2-6-Mux-d-j-k-Demux-1-9  Path 2: 2-10-Mux-f-j-k-Demux-1-9  Path 3: 2-6-Mux-d-j-q-Demux-13-9  Path 4: 2-10-Mux-f-j-q-Demux-13-9  These available paths prove that IASEN-3 is a single switch fault tolerant network in every stage.  4. Performance Evaluation Parameters  This section discusses the various performance factors of IASEN–2 and IASEN–3. 107  Ved Prakash Bhardwaj and Nitin   /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  104 – 109 
4.1. Bandwidth (BW) “BW is defined as the expected number of destination receiving requests in any given cycle. It means it is the total number of requests matured [5– 7]”. It is calculated as follows: 
 Here
, is the request generation probability and  is the total number of destinations. The general probability equation can be written as:

4.2. Message Transmission Time (tt) It is the time that all generated data packets will take from a given source to a single destination. It is given by the following formula: 
 
 
: Total number of data packets 
 : Total number of stages in the network 
:  Routing time between two nodes and node may be source, destination or any SE.  
: Transmission time when single SE is faulty in every stage of the network 4.3. Throughput(TP) “TP means average number of cells delivered by a netw ork per unit time. It is also defined as maximum number of traffic accepted by a network per unit time [5–7]”. TP can be calculated using the given formula: 
 4.4. Processor Utilization(PU) “It is defined as percentage of time the processor is active doing computation without accessing the global memory [5–7]”.PU can be calculated using the given formula: 
 5. Performance Comparison of IASEN–2 and IASEN–3 In order to compare the performance of IASEN–2 [8] and IASEN–3, message multicasting is performed in faulty and non–faulty network condition. Let the source is 5 and it has transmitted the data packets to destinations 1, 3, 5, 9 and 11. Data is transmitted in non–faulty and single switch faulty conditions. In this paper, we assumed that routing time
 of a data packet is 0.01 ms in non–faulty case and 0.02 ms in single switch faulty case. In this research work, both terms “Single switch faulty” and “faulty” represents that single switch is faulty in each stage during the transmission of data packets. The offered load or request generation probability is 
 and it is assumed to be . Data packets are generated on the given probabilistic values and then sent to destinations 1, 3, 5, 9 and 11. As explained in equation (10) and (11), we will calculate the transmission time of IASEN–2 [8] and I ASEN–3 in faulty and non–faulty cases. Equations of section 4 are used to calculate the throughput and processor utilization of IASEN–2 [8] and IASEN–3 in faulty and non–faulty condition. IASEN–2_F and IASEN–3_F are the IASEN–2 and IASEN–3 in faulty case as shown in Fig. 2. On the basis of the bandwidth , TP of IASEN–2 and IASEN–3 have been calculated.  109  Ved Prakash Bhardwaj and Nitin   /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  104 – 109
