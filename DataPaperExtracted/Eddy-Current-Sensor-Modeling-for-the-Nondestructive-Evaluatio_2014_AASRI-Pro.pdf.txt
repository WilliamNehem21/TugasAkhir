 1. Introduction Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) is an important parameter in Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) for the structural integrity assessment of structures containi ng cracks and singular stress fields [1]. SIF gives a measure of the intensity of the stress field in the crack tip region. It gives also the possibility to analyze a crack growth or a catastrophic failure if a load is applied to the structure [2]. The stress intensity factors can be calculated using stress and strain analysis or parameters that measure the energy released by crack growth. SIF can be estimated analytically or using numerical techniques [3, 4].Analytical methods are more complex to calculate SIF, however, they have some advantage; an analytical solution can be applied for a range of crack lengths and on the other hand, numerical techniques require the calculation of stress or strain field for each crack length corresponding to each value of SIF.  Stress and strain fields for a given structure can be  calculated using several techniques [5]. The most common and available ones can be found in several commercial packages employing the Finite Element Method (FEM) [6] or the Boundary Element Method (B EM) [7]. Nowadays, new techniques based on mesh less methods such as the Extended Finite Element Mode l (XFEM), are emerging and have several advantages compared to the traditional methods, particularly in problems of fracture mechanics [8]. 2. J-Integral  To determine the energy quantity that descri bes the elastic-plastic behavior of materials, Rice [9] introduced a contour integral or a line integral that encloses the crack front as shown in Figure 1.

Displacement extrapolation  The displacement extrapolation method was developed to obtain crack tip singular stresses and stress intensity factors using only nodal displacements of elements around the crack tip [10]. The near crack tip displacement field may be expressed as a series function of the stress intensity factor, the position to the crack tip as well as the orientation to the crack propagation direction.

The results of simulation are shown in figures 2, 3, and 4. The control by Eddy currents requires the use of very high frequencies.

I with respect to the propagation of crack’s depth. It is obvious that the difference in impedance 
ǻZ is dependent on the crack’s depth. The latter is proportional to the increase of 
ǻZ. Moreover, SIF K I is evaluated when the depth decreases with ǻZ leading to a decrease of 
KI. Then, the depth of defection influences the impeda nce. Figure 4 shows the variation of the impedance Z -2 -1 0 1 2-202468

7. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the usefulness of Eddy current sensors as a tool to control cracks and micro cracks in materials. The simulations performed in this study led to the following conclusions: 
-Determination of the impedance in only one point is not enough to confirm the presence or the absence of a defect for two types of materials (non -magnetic or magnetic). This behavior leads us to the evaluation of the impedance along the tube.  
-Detection of an external defect requires the energy of the sensor using high frequencies. 
-The position of defect (internal, middle or external) has a large effect on the impedance. Obtained results show the great sensitivity of the differential sensor with respect to the detection of the surface defects. However, the major disadvantage of this type of sensor lies in the fact that it is unable to detect a defect located between two reels. 
-Determination of SIF is an important parameter  in detecting singularities in a given model. 0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.09
