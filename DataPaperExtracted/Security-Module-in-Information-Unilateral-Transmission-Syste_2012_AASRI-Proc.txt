Abstract 
Physical isolation among different conf idential levels Networks are always being used to keep data unrevealed, information unilateral transmission system transmits data across networks. Information security module is essential in system and being used to make sure data untouched in low confidential level network. MD5 algorithm is used in digital signature and RSA arithmetic is used encoding and decoding process. Experiments approve its efficiency and security.

1. Introduction According toǉLaw of PRC Keeping National SecretǊrule: “Computer which recorded national secrets cannot link to internet or other public networks directly, must isolate from them, it is called “physical isolation”. Networks of government, military and bank are independent to keep data safe. Physical isolation solved disclosure in a way, but set obstacles to obtain information from external networks. Unilateral Transmission System transmits data from low security  level to high unilaterally, and prevents data from leaking out. Security module uses RSA and MD5 algorith m to insure data against destroying, tampering and replacing, promises its security and reliability.

2. System Design Unilateral Transmission System includes gap and softwa re system, gap is laid between different security level networks, data “flows” through it unilaterally from low security level network to high, and there is no direct physical link in it. Host computer in low securi ty level network (external network in short) encodes data to QR codes, camera in gap catches QR codes which in clude data and display on screen, then host computer in high security level network (internal network in shor t) decodes them back to data. Security module consists of RSA encryption and MD5 signature process which app lied to terminal computer in external network, and decryption, signature authentication process app lied to host computer in internal network.

Structure initialization Define a structure in process, the structure consists  plain text block (512bit), and hashed value (128bit). During hashing process, all the hashed values are computed from plain text are passed by it. 3.3. Group data Group filled data, 512 bits a group, N groups. 3.4. Compute groups Assign primitives to 4 integer chaining variable, which are 32 bits, they are: A=0x01234567ˈB=0x89ABCDEFˈC=0xFEDCBA98ˈD=0x76543210Ǆ Assign primitive A, B, C, D to variable a, b, c, d. Divide 512 bits data block to 16 strings of 32 bits. Compute Each 32 bit string 4 rounds. There are many processes in a round, the first process in 4 rounds are different, the rest process are the same. These are 4 nonlinear functions used in process. F(X,Y,Z) =(X&Y)|((~X)&Z) G(X,Y,Z) =(X&Z)|(Y&(~Z)) H(X,Y,Z) =X^Y^Z I(X,Y,Z) =Y^ (X| (~Z)) If the counterpart bits of X, Y and Z are independent and symmetrical, the results are independent and symmetrical too. FF(a, b, c, d, M′, s, n) shows a = b + ((a + F(b, c, d) + M′ + n) << s) GG(a, b, c, d, M′, s, n) shows a = b + ((a + G(b, c, d) + M′ + n) << s) HH(a, b, c, d, M′, s, n) shows a = b + ((a + H(b, c, d) + M′ + n) << s) II(a, b, c, d, M′, s, n) shows a = b + ((a + I(b, c, d) + M′ + n) << s) After these 4 rounds compute process, add A, B, C, D to  a, b, c, d separately. Then compute next group of data, the output are the cascades of A, B, C and D. When all the groups of data are computed, cascade the outcome, we get the MD5 results.
 [2]  4. Working Theory of Internal Network Terminal RSA encryption algorithm has high intensity, being difficult to crack, it costs much time to encrypt data by comparing with DES and other encryption algorithm, as computer hardware improved day by day, RSA encryption speed is receptible. The more secret key it us es, the more time program runs, in the system, 1024 bit secret key is suitable.

If problems below happen then decryption failed: cannot divide clearly; filling cluster is less than 64 bit or mismatch with type labeled by BT; BT is not accord with practical type. 5.
