treated on time. Generally, there are no symptoms asso ciated with cervical cancer, so it is essential that  women often perform tests to prevent and detect possible lesions as early as possible. Exfoliative cytology is the most common way of an early diagnosis of this disease. There are other methods such as HPV DNA testing, colposcopy exam, visual inspection with acetic acid (AAVI), and visual inspection with Lugol's iodine (LIVI) [3]. The colposcopic inspection is a medical  procedure in which a colposcopic camera is used to visually examine the cervix and capture digital images of the same. Often during this test, it is common to use acetic acid or Lugol's iodine to procure a contrast of the cervix and thus aid in the diagnosis of any lesion. Although there are different reasons why cervical cancer can originate, HPV (human papillomavirus) infection is one of the most common. Lesion classi fication is performed using the Bethesda system established by the National Cancer Institute (NCA ) in 1988. This system classifies morphological premalignant lesions into two categories: low-grade squa mous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL) and high-grade intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL). The former categor y includes the simplest alteration, the reactive inflammatory lesion, suggestive of HPV infection or condylomatousKoilocytosisatypia. This category also includes the next evolutionary level, Cervical intraepith elial neoplasia (CIN) I or mild dysplasia.The HGSIL includes histological lesions CIN II and CIN III or moderate and severe dysplasia, respectively [8] (Fig 1).

In recent times there have been major advances from  a computational point of view in digital image processing and its subsequent analysis for diagnostic pu rposes. Parallel to this, techniques such as data mining and machine learning can provide a set of methods that c ould be used to detect patterns of behavior on large amount of data. One such technique for preparing a databa se for data mining processing is feature selection. Feature selection serves to identify the best subset of features for a particularly given data mining task. Although the minimum number of attributes that can be used is debatable, for instance, in the classification task, we may assume that the more attributes the higher the discriminatory power. However, several experiments with learning algorithms have shown that it is not always so because, as it has been detected, some experiments have had high runtimes, others have had very high occurrence of redundant or irrelevant attributes while showing a degradation in their classi fication power [11]. Different experiments have shown that feature selection decreases the error rate of classifiers. This is so because through this process we try to choose the minimal subset of attributes according to follo wing two criteria:  first that the hit rate does not drop significantly, on the contrary, it is desirable that it incr eases. Second, that the distribution of the resulting class be as similar as possible to the original class distribu tion when all attributes are taken into account.  In this Health y Sick

paper, the authors try to compare different methods of feature selection, based on the accuracy of the learning algorithms, with the objective of selecting the best subset of features that provides an effective classification of images for the diagnosis of cervical precancerous lesions. 1.1. Previous works Current literature surveys show several works related to feature selection methods focused on search techniques, their applications in classification, comparis ons, clustering, introduction of new methods, and combination thereof as indicated in [4], [5]. [6], and [8]. In other medical areas the work of Martin et al. [1] applied feature selection methods available in WEKA [2] to a database containing variables involved in the nutritional status of children aged 6 to 11 years. The purpose of that study was to specify which method determined the factors that contributed the most to nut ritional assessment.  In another study Blakrishnan [3] tried to find an optimal feature subset of the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset using Symmetrical Uncertainty Attribute Evaluator and Fast Correlation-Based Filter. Gu yon et al [7] studied the problem of selecting a small subset of genes from broad patterns of gene expression data recorded on DNA micro-arrays utilizing Support Vector Machine methods based on Recursive Feature Elimination. The studies just mentioned have the common goal of comparing the performance of attribute selection methods with the results obtained by learning algorithms and thus, determining which met hod significantly improves the results from different situations, with diversity of information, and high or low dimensionality. 2. Data source description For this research, the authors used a database of cervical digital images from the hospital Maria Teresa del Toro in Maracay (Venezuela). Previously this data was used in an EVA: Recognition System of Precancerous Lesions in the Cervix [9]. This set of images was also used by [10] for thestudy of Pre-cancerous Cervical VideocolposcopicImage Detection using an Artificial Neural Network.  The data under study was obtained by taking two images of the cervix of each patient. Th e first image was taken after an application of acetic acid and, the second, after an application of Lugol's iodi ne. Each image was classified by physicians in one of the following three categories: a) Healthy: refers cervical images that do not show any injury or alteration; b) BG: refers to images with a LGSIL c) AG: refers to im ages with a HGSIL. The letters BG and AG, in Spanish, stand for low and high grade respectively; we will continue using these letter combinations throughout the remainder of this paper. The characterization of the images is based on the statistical texture analysis of first and second-order. The first-order is based on the histogram of each plane and the second-order in the co-occurrence matrix. All images were analyzed in RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) planes (Fig 2). To obtain greater accuracy of the learning algorithms, the images were treated in the two following manners: Initially, they were classified using the healthy, BG, and AG categories  (Fig. 3). Second, the BG and AG images were grouped in a single sick category. After grouping the images in these categories, the authors ran the learning algorithms to discriminate the images into two groups : healthy and sick. The algorithms were then run anew on the sick category to differentiate between the AG and BG images. 3. Feature selection algorithms  Table 1 shows the algorithms used for feature selec tion using the data mining tool Weka version 3.6 [2]. The algorithms that evaluate subsets of attributes are distinguished with the letter s. Likewise, the algorithms that evaluate the total set of attributes are distinguished with the letter t. The s-algorithms were combined with 278   A. Aguilera et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  275 – 281 
search methods, as show in the table 2, with the exception of the Ranker search method that was used solely the t-algorithms.

 4. Results and conclusions The present study was conducted on two groups of cervix images. One group had images with acetic acid application and the other images with Lugol's iodine application. There were 63 textural features extracted from these images; 21 per each layer Red, Green and Blue (R, G and B). Each subset generated by feature selection methods (scenarios in Table 3) was tested with different classifiers. Table 3 shows the highest percentage of correct answers obtained for each type of image discriminated on the three original classes (Healthy, BG and AG).

 For the Lugol’s iodine images, the best classification accuracy was obtained with the S5 scenario that correctly classified 82.46% of the images using the metaclassifier Decorate from decision tree RandomTree. In acetic acid image group it was observed that the use of feature selection methods had no benefit for the classification process. This is due to the fact that the highest percentage of correctly classified instances (71.93%) was obtained with S1. In this latter scenario no feature selection method was used and all attributes were considered in the classification process.  From all the images under consideration we can observe that the set of images with Lugol’s iodine provided better  accuracy results based on the percentatge of correctly classified instances. Table 4 shows the results obtained by discriminating between healthy and sick classes with the two types of images. For the Lugol’s iodine images, the highest percentage of rated instances was 89.47%. This was obtained by the metaclassifier AdaBoostM1 from REPTree decision tree using S4. For acetic acid images, the highest percentage obtained was 84.21% using the Decorate metaclassifier from J48 decision tree with a S5.We can also observe that the percentage of correctly classified instances is significantly increased when the AG and BG classes were grouped into a single sick class.

The experiments with the sick class for the two types of images produced the best results, namely, the LADTree decision tree provided a 86.67% instances correc tly classified in a S3 for Lugol's iodine images and the metaclassifier AdaBoostM1 and REPTree decision tree providing a 89.47% with a S9 for acetic acid images. Table 5 presents a summary of the scenarios and classi fiers that provided the best performance in each experiment, class, and group of images.  The best results  were obtained by analyzing the cervix images with Lugols’ iodine, combining the sick classes, and perf orming the discriminating classification using only two classes in each case. Currently data analysis real life applications clearly show the need to manipulate a reduced number of attributes. The experiments performed in this study shows that the feature selection is a process that provides significant benefits because the obtained models are more understandable and perform better the learning algorithms than when the complete data set is used.
