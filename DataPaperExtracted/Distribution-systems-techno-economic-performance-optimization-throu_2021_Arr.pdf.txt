This article presents three new multi-objective optimization methodologies as a solution for enhancing thetraditional EDN techno-economic performance through integrating Distributed Generation (DG) of differentcategories. A combination of four types of DG resources is presented for identifying the optimal mix sizing andpositioning through applying the Whale Optimization Algorithm, Sine Cosine Algorithm and Multi-Verse Opti-mization Algorithm. The proposed approaches are constructed and subjected to a multi-objective function tominimize the active power losses, improve the voltage Stability and decrease overall additional costs. Whiletaking into consideration the allowable margin of DG units ’penetration level and their operating power factor in addition to the systems’voltage proﬁle boundaries. The methodologies have been applied to two IEEE benchmark test systems (33-bus and 118-bus) besides a realistic part of the distribution grid of the Egyptian distributionnetwork which is added as a practical case study. However, the proposed base cases have failed in keeping thevoltage magnitudes boundaries at all busbars especially the realistic case, but the proposed algorithms haveattained almost the same signiﬁcant results regarding both of voltage stability and power loss for the medium-sized network IEEE 33-bus system. Furthermore, for both of the two large scale systems (IEEE 118-bus systemand the realistic network), the MVO has proved its superiority compared to the proposed algorithms in addressingthe optimization problem with higher results ’accuracy. Meanwhile, the MVO has reached the optimal solutions for all cases in less time and iterations number.
1. IntroductionThe transition towards sustainable electric power systems is facingmany techno-economic and environmental challenges in recent years;this has led researchers to think aboutﬁnding suitable solutions to these challenges. The national and international vision towards a clean envi-ronment, the increased electricity demand, as well as the fast develop-ment of RERs prices and technologies have played an important role inthe progress of the DG resources integration to the Electric DistributionNetworks (EDNs) and they are predicted to be commonly used in the nearfuture [1]. DGs are locally supplying the consumers with electricity, as itis connected directly to load centers, and as a result, they reduce theoverall expenditure needed for the new centralized power plants andtransmission lines infrastructure projects [ 2]. Modern DG-integrated EDNs performance is affected by several factors, including penetrationlevel, DGs technologies, operating scenarios and location. Optimizedsizing and siting of various forms of DGs due to prede ﬁned study based on speciﬁc objectives and limitations play a signiﬁcant role in achieving positive outcomes and eliminating their negative impacts [ 3]. The EDNs voltage proﬁle and the active power losses are inﬂuenced according to the distribution system topology. The voltage stability is used as animportant indication to ensure the voltage stability of the entire system.DGs integration planning will require an analysis of several variables,such as DGs’number, capacities, the best possible locations, and theoperating characteristics impact on the system performance such assystem loss, voltage proﬁle, economics, stability and reliability issues [ 4]. Some of the technical key advantages of the DG-integrated EDNs are:improving the voltage proﬁle, reducing the EDNs losses, improving fre-quency, increasing the overall energy efﬁciency, reducing the pollutants emissions, enhancing the EDNs security and reliability, relieving the

Some of the other economic advantages are delaying the totalinvestments required for upgrading the facilities, reducing the opera-tional fuel costs, reducing the reserve requirements and the associatedcosts, and increasing the security for critical loads [ 5]. The determination of the optimal capacity and placement of DG units in the distributionsystems is of great importance for achieving their highest potentialpositive effects. Researches have demonstrated that an improper selec-tion of the position and size of DG could lead to greater system activepower losses and voltage deviations [ 1]. Therefore, several scientiﬁc researches have tried to address the optimal siting and capacity of DGunits in EDNs through many different approaches. The techniques may becategorized into four categories: Analytical Expressions (AEs),Meta-heuristic techniques (MMs), Numerical Methods (NMs), andAnalytical Expressions Meta-Heuristic Methods (AEMMs) [ 6,7]. In Ref. [8], the authors presented three multi-objective optimizationmechanisms to reduce the active power losses and to improve the voltageproﬁle, within maintaining the framework of the DG cost installationconstraints, through determining its optimum placement and size intothe distribution networks. Three intelligent optimization techniquesPractical Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithms (GA), andGravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) are introduced to prove their ef-ﬁciency. A comparative analysis of different optimization techniques,including Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO), Dragon ﬂy Algorithm (DA) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), was proposed in Ref. [ 9]t o determine the optimum locations and sizes of DGs in radial EDNs toreduce the active power losses. The suggested techniques have beenimplemented on IEEE 69-bus and 119-bus under two load power factors.Results showed that MFO gives betterﬁndings than WOA and DA algo- rithms. WOA is used to determine the DG units ’sizing and siting opti- mization problem in many researches as follows: In Ref. [ 10], different DG types are employed through applying the WOA on IEEE 15-bus,33-bus, 69-bus, 85-bus and 118-bus benchmark test systems. The ﬁnd- ings of the proposed technique have been compared to various forms ofevolutionary algorithms. The attained results from the WOA algorithmproved that it is better when integrating DG type that injects both realand reactive power at 0.9 pf. In addition, a complicated problem of DGssizing and location is addressed in Ref. [ 11]. Where, WOA algorithm is tested on IEEE 15, 33, 69 and 85-bus test systems for the active powerlosses minimizing and improving the voltage pro ﬁle as the considered objectives. In this study, to improve the performance of the system, fourDG types are introduced, but every single type is discussed separatelywith aﬁxed power factor value. The WOA proved its capability ofﬁnding-high quality solutions for large-scale systems compared to otherevolutionary algorithms. Furthermore, a WOA-SCA Hybrid algorithm forimproving the bus voltages of the DG-integrated EDNS is explained inRef. [12] through the allocation of DSTATCOMs and DGs on IEEE33-busand IEEE-69 bus. The exploration and exploitation steps of the proposedscheme are determined using Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) and WOA,respectively, to improve the convergence rate of the WOA. Resultsproved the enhancement in the voltage pro ﬁle and reduction of the total systems losses. Moreover, in Ref. [13], WOA is introduced for single DGintegration into the IEEE 30-bus radial transmission system. Before theoptimization phase, a preconﬁgured Fast Voltage Stability Index (FVSI)has been used as an indication to identify the location of installing thesingle DG. The achieved results have been veri ﬁed with the Fireﬂy al- gorithm (FA) and WOA showed more improvement in voltage stability,
the voltage proﬁle and power losses. The Multi-Verse Optimization Al-gorithm (MVO) technique has been proposed in Ref. [ 14] and applied into two benchmark test systems (IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus) for theoptimal solution of single DG type accommodation in the EDN. Amulti-objective function is formulated to improve the performance ofEDNs. The objectives considered are decreasing the active power losses,minimizing the voltage deviation and enhancing the VSI. The ﬁndings are compared to the results attained by GA, PSO, hybrid GA-PSO,Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) and Quasi-OppositionalLearning Based Optimization (QOTLBO) algorithms and found to beefﬁcient. SCA has been employed toﬁnd the optimum size and location of single and two DGs in radial EDNs in Ref. [ 15]. The proposed meth- odology is tested on IEEE 15, 33, 69 and 85 radial EDNs. Minimizing thepower loss and improvement of the voltage pro ﬁle are the main objec- tives of this research. Theﬁndings obtained have demonstrated the

2validity of the proposed method and its positive effects on the system interms of power loss reduction and the improvement of the voltage pro ﬁle and have demonstrated the efﬁcacy and robustness of the proposedmethod. From the above initial review, it is noticed that, however, manyoptimization algorithms have been applied to solve the DG location andsize problem concerning the differentﬁtness functions, which aims to improve the distribution network’s performance. Most of these re-searches considered the operating power factor of the DG units a ﬁxed value and not an optimization vector variable. In addition, the proposedtechniques have been applied to small-scale IEEE test systems and havenot been subjected to practical case studies. Also, the DG units ’max capacity ranges have not been set and did not consider the branches ’ security constraints. Besides that, the multi-DGs problem of multi-typeshas not been addressed at the same time to ﬁnd the optimal mix of DG types. Moreover, the additional required investments are not consideredas an optimization objective at the same time to get the optimal solutionswith minimum expenditures. The major contributions of the presentedarticle can be summarized as follow: (i) This research proposes threenovel algorithms called Whale Optimization Algorithm, Sine Cosine Al-gorithm and Multi-Verse Optimization Algorithm for solving four typesof DERs allocation problem. (ii) Formulating a multi objective function tooptimize the Voltage Stability, the active power losses and the overallcosts is developed. (iii) The system’s operational variables are consideredsuch as the DG units operating power factor in addition to the system ’s policies and regulations constraints including (a) the operating powerfactor limitations, (b) the system’s voltage proﬁle boundaries and (c) DG units’penetration level range (iv) The proposed approaches are validatedby applying them to various IEEE test systems (33 and 118 buses), inaddition to a realistic case study. (v) The attained results are comparedwith other optimization algorithms.This article’s content is divided into eight sections, as follows: Thecharacteristics of different used DG types are presented in section II.Section III discusses the proposed strategic positioning and sizing algo-rithms. A description of the problem formulation, the objectives andconstraints are given below in section IV. Section V describes the IEEEbenchmark test cases and the practical distribution system. while, Sec-tion VI presents the problem validation. The ﬁndings are analyzed indetail in section VII. The conclusion of the paper is outlined in sectionVIII.2. Characteristics of DG typesMost of the DG beneﬁts’researches have classiﬁed DGs into four different types. In this study, a combination of four DG types is intro-duced for siting and sizing problem to determine the optimal mix of DGs.These types are identiﬁed according to the operation criteria as follows[16,17]: In theﬁrst type, the active power only is generated. However,reactive power only is produced in the second type. In addition, DG re-sources deliver active and reactive power in the third type. Moreover, inthe fourth type, resources can produce active power and consume reac-tive power.3. Proposed algorithms based methodologiesThe following three-optimization algorithms are proposed for theefﬁcient planning of multiple distributed generation resources as follows:3.1. Whale Optimization AlgorithmThe WOA is inspired by the special hunting activity of humpbackwhales, which are intelligent swimming creatures. Normally, they tend tohunt small
ﬁshes near to the sea surface. Humpback whales use aspecialized hunting process called the bubble net feeding technique.Where, they move around the targets and generate distinctive bubblesacross a ring or 9-shaped path [10,18].To simulate such behavior in WOA, there is a 50% chance of choosingbetween both the shrinking encircling system and the spiral system tochange the whale location, which is represented in this research by theoptimization problem vectors, which are DG type, location, size andoperating power factor during the optimization. In WOA, the best currentpotential solution is believed to be the target prey and the other searchagents are trying to change their positioning towards it. The numericalsimulation of WOA involves three stages as follows: The encircling prey,the spiral bubble-net feeding strategy, and the scan for food sources.

43.1.1. The encircling prey stageThe Humpback whales are to identify and encircle the position of theprey, which is represented as the objectives of minimizing total activepower losses, enhancing the FVSI and minimizing the new cost of in-vestment. Initially, the WOA considers the target prey (O.F) to be thecurrent best candidate solution, as the location of the optimal solution isnot known beforehand; this stage is simulated as shown in equation (1) and (2)and the search candidate will be changed if a better candidatesolution is found.D!¼jC

Bubble-net attacking stageThis is a hunting technique; in it, sharks are doing narrowing encir-cling mechanism through a spiral update process for positioning, which isrepresented in the current work by operating constraints, which are DGsoperating power factor limits, DG capacity penetration levels and voltageproﬁle boundaries.

Multi-verse optimization algorithmSeyedali M. et al. developed MVO [19]. The optimization software was created based on the idea of the big bang model and the Multiverseconception. Originally, according to the theory, the Big Bang is simplythe cause of the existence of every element in this world. However, thelatter concept deals with the presence of some universes. Almost everyuniverse could have various physical rules, which react and collide witheach other according to multiverse theory. The numerical model of MVO

5is divided into three different stages, which are black holes, white holes,and wormholes [20].White holes: is a mirror image of big-bang and its theory is usedduring the exploration step in the optimization process. In this stage, thepromising potential solutions that are considered in this work by the DGunits’size, location and operating power factor are determinedrandomly. Also, theﬁtness (inﬂation rate) of each randomly generatedpopulation is determined according to upper and lower boundaries,which are the predeﬁned operating constraints of DGs operating powerfactor limits, DG capacity penetration levels, and voltage pro ﬁle boundaries from equation(7).U

In this step, the process of roulette wheels is used toconstruct the entire white/black tunnel at normal in ﬂation levels, which can be used for objects exchanges between universes.

Then, theexploration and exploitation phases are repeated until the convergence isattained. Here, the convergence criterion is made equal to the maximumiterations/generations set to the optimization algorithm. Also, the abovesolution steps are explained in a detailedﬂowchart shown inFig. 5.3.2.1. Sine Cosine AlgorithmSCA is an innovative optimization methodology developed in Refs.[21] by Mirjalili’s, where its function update depends on cosine and sinefunction rules. Through the lookup for the optimization problem, thealgorithm randomly begins theﬁrst population (the optimization prob-lem vectors, which are DG type, location, size and operating power factorduring the optimization) with random search agents/solutions. Then, thesearching agents are directed to the best position P
iin the searching area according to the deﬁnedﬁtness function, which consists of minimizingtotal active power losses, enhancing the FVSI and minimizing the newcost of investment. That assesses and evaluates each search agent.Therefore, the algorithm tracks the P position obtained for each iterationby evaluating all search agents in the population.

Fast Voltage Stability Index (FVSI)Stability is a key factor in the study of distribution systems. This wasexplored in several publications by multiple methodologies. Due tochanges in power generation, the voltage stability of the systems in thisstudy is advised to prevent the collapse of voltage.The line stability index can be calculated using the fast and accurateformula shown in equation(15)for the determination ofFVSI[24].FVSI results for all lines ranges between zero and one, where this value mustTable 1The proposed methodologies outcomes versus existing other researches.

i/C201.05.5. Study casesThe research presents the application of the three proposed algo-rithms to different IEEE benchmark systems (33-bus and 118-bus) asmedium and large-scale models to conﬁrm the efﬁciency of the proposed optimization methodologies in determining the optimal O.F [ 29–32]. IEEE 33-busis an RDS consisting of 33-buses, 32 branches, onecentral generator, one substation, with a total active and reactive load of3.71 MW and 2.3 MVAR, respectively. Simulation studies are carried outon this widely used distribution system to verify the effectiveness of theproposed optimization techniques in solving the problem of the optimalplacement and sizing of DGs. The key driver of selecting this test systemarises from the fact that the IEEE 33-bus test system has large losses ofpower compared to its total capacity, which makes it a suitable selectionto prove the capability of DGs for reducing power losses signi ﬁcantly. IEEE 118-busis a large scale power system consists of 118-bus, 54generators and 186 branches with an active and reactive load of 4242MW and 1438 MVAR, respectively. Therefore, this system is chosen toperform the study cases, to demonstrate the applicability of the proposedtechniques to larger systems. This system is conducted in light of thesurvey, which indicates that few studies are applied to such complexnetworks and to check the remarkable performance of the algorithms insolving such large-scale systems.Fig. 8displays a single line diagram of the realistic part of theEgyptian EDNs from the Canal Electricity Distribution Company (CEDC).It consists of 171-bus, two 66/11 kV main step-down transformers eachof a 25 MVA rated capacity, and a number of 87 different ratings step-down transformers (11/0.4 kV) connected directly to loads. Themaximum active and reactive loading of the grid is 15.68 MW and 8.63MVAR, respectively [33].6. Algorithms’validationThe proposed methodologies with the pre-mentioned objectives andconstraints are validated by installing a single DG test (of the ﬁrst and the third category), this test is applied on the IEEE 33-bus test system. Theobtained outcomes are compared to other existing works. Table 1sum- marizes theﬁndings for both power loss and voltage magnitudes. Where,it is reported that the single DG ofﬁrst type achieves an improved per-formance compared to existing approaches. However, it is a DG withminimal capacity that needs fewer additional costs. It is also noticed thatpromising results are obtained while applying a single DG of the thirdcategory for both voltages and power losses with a limited DG ’capacity.7. Results and discussionThe multi-objective DG siting and sizing algorithms for the four DGmentioned above types are implemented using Hadisaadat and Mat-power loadﬂow toolboxes on many benchmark IEEE test systems (33-busand 118-bus). Studies are also conducted on a realistic part of theEgyptian EDNs (171-bus). The Optimal DGs sizing and siting effects onthe system’sP
loss,FVSI, voltage proﬁle and the total additional invest- ment cost are summarized inTables 2 and 3, respectively.Table 2il- lustrates the base case loadﬂow results, where the attained results arevalidated by comparing with Hadisaadat, Matpower and ETAP12.6 re-sults for the same test systems under the same operating conditions.Table 3describes the results achieved by applying the proposedoptimization techniques for each system. The optimal sizes and locations

10of DG types mix are determined for each case study using the three-optimization algorithms. In addition, the third and the fourth DG-typeoptimal operating power factor is determined. Furthermore, the ob-tained results from WOA, MVO and SCA are compared and summarized.Where it is noticed that MVO scored the optimal results regarding the O.Fvalue for the three introduced networks. However, there is symmetrybetween the obtained results from MVO and WOA in the case of IEEE 33-bus in addition to another similarity between results of MVO and SCA inthe case of the realistic system.Furthermore, for the IEEE 33-bus system, it is found that the three-optimization techniques almost scored the same system ’s enhancement in terms of FVSI and SCA scored the maximum enhancement in terms ofP
loss. Moreover, for the IEEE 118-bus system, WOA scored the maximumenhancement in terms of P
lossand FVSI, but unfortunately, it wasaccompanied by increases in DG type’s number and capacity. In addition, for the realistic case study, it is reported that both MVO and SCA scoredthe optimal enhancement regarding both FVSI and SCA.7.1. For IEEE 33-bus systemFig. 9reﬂects the convergence curves resulted from applying thethree-optimization methodologies into the IEEE 33-bus system. The re-sults demonstrate that with the same iterations number and at the samesearch agents’dimension, MVO and WOA converge at almost the sameiterations number. However, MVO achieved the best O.F value with avery slight difference compared to WOA.FromFig. 10, it is concluded that MVO and WOA almost give theoptimal O.F value. However,Fig. 18shows that MVO is converged in lesstime.Fig. 11shows that the three-optimization techniques give almostthe same enhancement regarding the system ’sFVSI. However,Fig. 13 illustrates that SCA provides a very slight enhanced result in terms of lossminimization, but this technique is selecting a higher DG capacity of typeI to be installed at bus 12, which leads to a higher O.F value (see Fig. 12). Fig. 14shows a comparison between the voltage magnitudes at basecase (without installing any DGs) for each bus (v0) of the IEEE 33-bus test system and the new voltage magnitudes after applying the optimizationproblem. FromFig. 20, it is noted that WOA, SCA and MVO almostachieved a typical efﬁcient improvement in the overall system ’s voltage proﬁle where the maximum voltage improvement ratio reaches about5.5% at buses 32 and 33, which are the buses at and near to the locationof the installed DG unit from the third type category.7.2. For IEEE 118-bus systemThe convergence curves are shown in Fig. 15; results showed that for the same number of iterations (300) and the same number of searchagents (100), MVO converged in the minimum iterations number withthe best O.F value.FromFig. 16, it can be noticed that MVO scored the best objectivefunction value, andFig. 18illustrates that MVO is also converging at theminimum running time. However, it is concluded from Figs. 17 and 19 that WOA scored the maximum loss reduction (6.86%) and best FVSI

11enhancement, but this improvement was combined with the disadvan-tage of increasing the DG types mix and capacities.Fig. 20shows the voltage proﬁle enhancement of the IEEE 118-bussystem after applying the proposed optimization techniques. The pro-posed techniques resulted in achieving a voltage pro ﬁle enhancement in certain areas of the system. However, MFO achieved a voltage pro ﬁle improvement in certain regions of the system, where the maximumimprovement ratio of up to 4.8% regarding the base case at bus 88, wherethe DG of the second type is installed.7.3. For the realistic systemFig. 21shows the convergence curves for the realistic system andresults show that the MVO and SCA gave the same optimal value of theO.F. However, MVO converges in the minimum iterations number.

12FromFigs. 22, 23 and 25, it is reported that both MVO and SCA scoredalmost the same optimal results in terms of O.F, FVSI enhancement andP
lossreduction that reached about 15.1%. However, WOA converged inthe minimum running time, as shown in Fig. 24. A promising improvement of the realistic grid voltage pro ﬁle is shown inFig. 26. In addition, it is deduced that the MVO technique resulted inthe best improvement in voltage magnitudes at the busses or near thoseto which the third type DG is installed. The maximum voltage improve-ment occurred at busses 158, 161 and 162 with an improved ratio of upto 6.3%.8. ConclusionThis paper has developed a techno-economic multi-objective opti-mization framework for the multi-distributed generation of differentcategories siting and sizing. Three modern optimization algorithmswhich are; Whale Optimization Algorithm, Sine Cosine Algorithm andMulti-Verse Optimization Algorithm are employed to solve objectivefunction which aims at minimizing the power losses, improving thesystems’voltage stability and decreasing overall additional costs. Thiswork considered an allowable margin for the DG units ’penetration level, operating power factor and the systems ’voltages proﬁle boundaries. Theproposed algorithms are applied on two benchmark test systems IEEE(33-bus and 118-bus) in addition to a realistic distribution network (171-bus) in the region of Canal Electricity Distribution Company-Egypt.The outcomes have proved the effectiveness of the Multi-Verse opti-mization algorithm, Whale optimization algorithm and Sine Cosine al-gorithm in addressing the optimization problem compared to otherexisting researches. In addition, the proposed algorithms ’have attained almost the same signiﬁcant results while solving the medium-sizednetwork IEEE 33-bus system; meanwhile, the MVO has reached theoptimal solution in less time and iterations number. However, for both ofthe two large scale systems (IEEE 118-bus system and the realisticnetwork), the MVO has proved its superiority compared to the proposedalgorithms in addressing the optimization problem with higher results ’ accuracy in less time and iterations number. The attained results appli-cation into the proposed systems (IEEE 33-bus, 118-bus and the realisticsystem) have demonstrated that the voltage pro ﬁles are improved simultaneously as the system’s voltage stability is enhanced by 19.7%,15.3% and 21.2%, respectively, whereas, the base cases have failed inkeeping the voltage values boundaries at all busbars. Furthermore, theactive power losses are signiﬁcantly reduced for the above-mentionedsystems by 43.7%, 5.22% and 15.1%, respectively. This work shall beextended to considering the customer’s hourly demand according to the
