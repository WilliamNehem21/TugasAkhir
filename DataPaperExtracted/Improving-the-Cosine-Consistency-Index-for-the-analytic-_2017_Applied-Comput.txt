KEYWORDSConsistency improvement;Analytic hierarchy process;Literature review;Multi-criteria decisionmaking;Decision support systemsAbstractAnalytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is one of the popular decision support systems formulti-criteria decision making problems. The AHP has different theories for prioritization, consis-tency evaluation and consistency improvement, a review of which is presented in this study beforediving deep into the core contribution. Consistency evaluation is one of the key computations whileusing the AHP. This paper describes a method that can be employed to improve the consistency ofthe judgment matrix utilized by using the Cosine Consistency Index (CCI). The approach describeduses a cosine maximization method to revise the entries in the judgment matrix on an iterative basisuntil the CCI is improved. The recommended method entails that it is possible to modify any judg-ment matrix to achieve CCI of desired level. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested with numer-ical examples and improved CCI values are validated through paired sample t-test. The results of this study showed that the algorithm signiﬁcantly improves CCI values with the inclusion of pro-posed approach.

1. IntroductionThe Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is one of the morepopular decision-making techniques that are widely utilizedto address Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) prob-lems. This method breaks down the problem into a hierarchyof sub-problems. Then from the elicited judgments fromexperts on the comparative performance or criticality of thesub-problems, priorities are computed. These priorities enablethe decision making related to sorting, ranking or selecting themost suitable alternative in MCDM problems [1]. One of the biggest advantages of a AHP approach is that it helps decision

However, as a MCDMtool, it does have inherent disadvantages and the way in whichcriteria are aggregated is often criticized as potentially risking aloss of information, for example, in situations in which trade-offs between good and bad scores occur. Furthermore, AHPinvolves a large amount of pairwise comparisons [4], which could sometimes become tiring during judgment elicitation.Moreover, some of the studies adopt fuzzy set theory [7]and analytical network process[8,9]to offset the limitations in tra-ditional AHP. Also various theories exist as to which decisionmaking processes can effectively help a group of people tomutually agree on problems and opportunities. Techniquessuch as structuring, ordering, grading and evaluating havebeen comprehensively explored across a wide variety of studiesrelating to group decision making processes [10]. Previous research into AHP as a MCDM tool has indicated that itcan be very effective when applied to a group decision problembecause it allows the priorities of each participant to be accu-rately estimated[11–15]and subsequently improved throughquantitative methods[16–18]before being aggregated into aset of preferences that reﬂect the requirements of each partici-pant[19–24].In order to ensure that AHP is implemented in an effectivemanner, it is important to ensure that the judgment matrixupon which it is based has a Cosine Consistency Index (CCI)that is approximately equal to 1. According to the literature[25], it is acceptable for a CCI to be above 0.90, but anythingbelow 0.90 is unacceptable. However, while their insights areuseful, they failed to extend how CCI can be improved. Con-structing a judgment matrix that delivers an acceptable CCIis extremely challenging because it is very difﬁcult to comparethe various elements of the matrix, and the human capacity todo so is limited. Moreover, some recent studies on decisionmaking in hierarchical collaborative production planning[26], knowledge discovery[27]and service-oriented enterprisearchitecture[28]have failed to address and statistically validate[29,30]consistency improvement in preferences. This becomesall the more critical for the experts in more complex problemsand in the presence of incomplete or subjective information.One method of improving the CCI of matrices that demon-strate inconsistency (CCI < 0.90) could be to return them toexperts who have the ability to restructure them via a series ofrelevant judgments in a manner that ensures increased CCI.Although such an approach may yield reliable and accurateresults, it is largely impractical because of both the longer timerequirements of such an approach and the availability of expertsfor subsequent rounds of judgment elicitation. As such, there is aneed to develop a method of improving the consistency of judg-ment matrices that demonstrate CCI < 0.90, so that the revisedmatrix achieves an acceptable consistency (CCIP0.90). Once such a matrix has been developed, it would then be possible toderive the reasonable priority vector of the ﬁrst matrix by apply-ing the Cosine Maximization Method (CMM). The CMM cal-culates CCI value by calculating average similarity betweenpriority vector and each column of AHP matrix with an objec-tive of maximizing the CCI value. Previous research have exam-ined this type of approach[15,31–35]and highlighted the needfor methods of consistency improvement through convergencefocused iterative approaches.This study proposes an approach that can be used toimprove the cosine consistency of a given judgment matrix,so that more priorities can be evaluated for prioritizationand empirical ﬁndings from data. The research will describethe use of an algorithm on a matrix that exhibits inconsistentCCI to develop a consistent judgment matrix that yieldsacceptable CCI (CCIP0:90). A numerical example thatdemonstrates the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposedalgorithm will also be presented followed by validationthrought-test.2. Theory and methodsBefore moving on to the actual contribution in the currentstudy, it is important to review the background of develop-ments in the methods of AHP. So we ﬁrst evaluate the differentmethods within AHP and subsequently the different methodsfor consistency evaluation within AHP. Subsequently we nar-row down our discussion to the Cosine Maximization (CM)and CCI approach developed by Kou and Lin [25]and how the current study extends it.2.1. Prioritization methods using AHPThe prioritization method provides a process by which the reli-able priority vector can be obtained from expert judgments. In
recent years, a number of prioritization methods haveemerged. However, the performance and suitability of thesedecision support methods have met with a lot of academic con-troversy and often it has been proposed to try out hybridapproaches for improving results, from the classic literatureto recent studies[25,36,37]. A review of 20 popular prioritiza-tion methods within AHP has been summarized in table pro-vided in the supplementary materials (i.e. Eigen vectormethod[38], weighted least squares method[39], additive nor- malization method[15], least squares method[40], gradient Eigen weight and least distance method[41], geometric mean method[42], geometric least squares method[43], logarithmic least squares method[44], goal programming method[45], log- arithmic goal programming method[46], fuzzy preference pro-gramming method[47], unusual and false observations[48], singular value decomposition method[49], interval prioritymethod[50], linear programming method[51], data envelop- ment analysis method[52], correlation coefﬁcient maximiza-tion[53], Bayesian prioritization procedure[54], weight estimation with evolutionary strategy[55], and heuristics andre-evaluation based method[56]). Since there are so manyapproaches for prioritization under different constraints andcontexts, Srdjevic[57]argued that a better priority vectorcan be derived when various prioritization methods are com-bined. The availability of so many methods within AHP alsohighlights the difference of outcome in comparable methods,due to which there is a need to explore methods on improvingconsistency of priorities.2.2. Methods for consistency evaluation using AHPIn view of such focused studies on challenges of priority estima-tion when information and judgments may be imprecise and lessclear to the experts, the need for measuring consistency of suchcontexts was established. Several researchers have identiﬁedmethods of measuring the extent to which PCM is consistent.Seven common methods and indexes for consistency evaluationImproving the Cosine Consistency Index 119have been reviewed in table provided in the supplementarymaterials (i.e. logarithmic-least squares[58], geometric consis-tency index[11], random index method[59], the induced matrixmethod[60], statistical consistency test[61,62], consistency ratiomeasure[63]and harmonic consistency index[64]). Vargas[65] employed a statistical approach to develop a statistical method-ology for the consistency test. Consistency index in previous the-ories has been used as a reliable source to validate the ﬁnalsolution and to interpret weights for each expert in consensusmodels[66,67]. Further, group decision making problems canbe effectively described by multiplicative preference relationsusing consensus degree[68]. Some of the previous studies havetried to assess the vulnerability pairwise comparison matrixusing dynamic changes to criteria importance by focusing onpreference at one or more times[69]. In this study, we focuson the Cosine Maximization Method, which is one of the emerg-ing approaches. The reason for focusing on this method isbecause it provides high ﬂexibility and efﬁciency based on mul-tiple performance criteria such as Euclidean distance and mini-mum violation for improving the consistency of a judgmentmatrix[25]. Further it develops the same ordinal stability for pri-oritization as multiple other methods such as Eigen vector basedmethods and additive normalization methods, while it performsbetter than weighted least square methods and logarithmic leastsquare methods. Further in terms of Euclidean distance basederror measures, CMM has the lowest error reported as com-pared to other methods such as Eigen vector based methods,additive normalization methods performs, weighted leastsquare methods and logarithmic least square methods. This iswhy, this study focuses on the CMM and attempts to addresssome of its existing limitations as discussed in forthcomingsections.2.3. Methods for consistency improvement in AHPA range of approaches associated with consistency improve-ments was investigated by many authors, such as Peters andZelewski[70]and Ishizaka and Lusti[71]. Moreover, one ofthe recent studies proposed a set of properties that describe afamily of functions for representing inconsistency indices[72]. Seventeen common consistency improvement methodshave been reviewed in table provided in the supplementarymaterial (i.e. Eigen value improvement[73], convergent itera-tive algorithm[33], least square method[74], triplet selection [75], heuristic algorithm[70], controlled error consistent matrixdevelopment[71], weak transitivity[76], Gower plot and linearprogramming[77], auto generate consistent matrix[16], con- trolled linguistic preference deviation[78], adaptive AHP method[79], missing value multi-layer perceptron[80], orthog- onal projection and linearization[81], integer programming[82], consistency and consensus improvement[67], consistency optimization[83]and ordinal consistency improvement meth-ods[84]
). Among such approaches, a CMM provides an efﬁ-cient and valid means of identifying a priority vector in theAHP. CMM offers a number of advantages over other prior-itization methods: it enables derivation of a consistency indexfor the PCM, removes the need for statistical modeling andfacilitates the calculation and interpretation of the CCI. Overthe past few decades a signiﬁcant body of academic workhas explored many facets of pairwise comparison methodol-ogy, but it is only in recent years that studies by Koczkodajand Szwarc[85]and Brunelli and Fedrizzi[86]have begun to address the key issue of calculating the most viable inconsis-tency indices. Within the AHP, the most effective methodologyfor identiﬁcation of the priority vector has long been debated,and seminal works were published by Cook and Kress [87], Fichtner[88]and Barzilai[89]. However, Ishizaka and Lusti[90]demonstrated by statistical analysis that, in the majorityof cases, the variations between the different methods werenot statistically signiﬁcant, and did not materially affect theoutcome of the AHP. In addition, a recent study has foundthat properties 3 and 4 from a proposed list of 6 did not cor-respond to the Cosine Consistency Index[72]. 2.4. Cosine Maximization Method (CMM)Before moving to the technical use of CMM for the purposesof deriving priority vectors, a fundamental understanding ofthe associated deﬁnitions and theorems is required. These areelaborated as follows:Deﬁnition 1.MatrixA¼ðaijÞn/C2nis positive reciprocal ifa

The hierarchy thatresults from the use of AHP represents the complex decisionproblem. Within this, the cosine similarity measure represents120 G. Khatwani, A.K. Karthe similarity between the priority vector and each column vec-tor of the PCM. This type of measurement system has beenapplied to both information retrieval[92,93]and AHP[94] models.The cosine similarity ofTheorem 1can be utilized to derivea reliable priority vector from a given PCM.

In one piece ofresearch, Saaty[38]developed the use of a CI that was corre-lated with the use of the eigenvector method (EV) and this wasrepresented as follows:CI¼ðk/C0nÞ=ðn/C01Þð13Þ wherenis the dimension of the PCM,kis the principal eigen-value of the PCM, the Perron root[95]and approximate prior-ity vector ofA. According to this approach, a PCM needs to beperfectly consistent forCI¼0. However, while a large numberof different methods and approaches have been presented inthe existing literature, there is a lack of consensus on theireffectiveness and reliability[32,96–98]. As such, there is a dis-tinct requirement to produce a new consistency index relatedImproving the Cosine Consistency Index 121to the CM method that measures the inconsistency level of aPCM in a standard and reliable manner.According to the rules presented inTheorem 3, bearing in mind the fact thatC
/C3is the optimal objective function valueof the optimization model(12), for PCM to be perfectly con-sistent, we require the following:C
/C3¼n ð14Þ Otherwise,0<C
/C3<n ð15Þ The inﬂuence of the size of a PCM can be eliminated by divid-ing the objective function valueC
/C3byn. This results inC/C3=n, which is the CCI of the PCM and takes on values in the inter-val (0,1]. The following emerges:CCI¼C
/C3=n ð16Þ In the event the PCM is perfectly consistent:CCI¼1 ð17Þ Otherwise0<CCI<1 ð18Þ and this condition entails that the PCM demonstrates relativeconsistency.This study has not addressed methods by which CCIthresholds can be identiﬁed, nor has it examined the relation-ship between the consistency of CCI and PCM. While there isno benchmark cutoff measure for CCI, given its implicationsfor PCM, it is pertinent to expect a CCI of at least 90% [25]. Through considering the practical application of CM, itbecomes apparent that this method does offer some distinctadvantages over prioritization approaches. It is easy to com-pute, provides a consistent measurement method and isunique. However, the method will only be effective if it isapplied to a complete and precise PCM that offers the required

ji¼1=a ij, for alli;j2N, especiallya ii¼1,i2N. The judg- ment matrix always represents a positive reciprocal matrix.Ann/C2njudgment matrix is consistent ifa

KarFurther, it can be observed fromFig. 3that Q–Q plot ofCCI improvement values shows no obvious deviations fromnormality for WGM approach.Thus the improvement in outcome is established based onthe proposed method of improvement on the CCI. The averagenumber of iterations in such improvement is also an indicationof the low computational complexity of the method, forimproving judgments to provide priorities with signiﬁcantlyhigher consistencies.5. ConclusionThis paper described the use of a corrective model that utilizescosine maximization to produce a comparison matrix thatexhibits consistent CCI. The CM technique is used to maxi-mize the sum of the cosine angle between each column vectorand derived priority vector of a PCM. An algorithm has beensuggested for determining transformed PCM and the weightvector. The cosine maximization was employed to amend apair of entries that exhibited maximum errors, thus ensuringthat the resulting matrix maintained all major information thatwas present in the original matrix. Through applying either theWAM form or the WGM form detailed in Step 5 of theapproach, it was possible to revise the matrix in an effectivemanner. As such, the approach recommended is viable andcan be applied to inconsistent CCI ratings of <0.90 in orderto create a positive reciprocal matrix that demonstratesCCIP0:90. Further, for given scenario it was possible toestablish that average number of iterations required in achiev-ing a CCIP0:90 for WAM form and the WGM form isalmost similar. The algorithm converges to CCI = 1 but thisstudy limits its improvement scope to near approximate valueTable 2The average number of iterations required to achieve CCIP0:90 for 20 different datasets using WAM.

More- over, the number of iterations of WAM and WGM to achievedesired consistency level depends on context speciﬁc require-ments and computational time and cost constraints. Finally,the algorithm was tested with numerical example andimproved CCI values were validated through paired samplet-test. It can be concluded that algorithm signiﬁcantlyimproved CCI values with the inclusion of proposed approach.The study successfully carried out in the present researchhas considerable consequences for managers. Notably, it ispossible to exploit the proposed soft computing technique asa crucial decision-making instrument for managers. This isadvantageous with respect to the way it can optimize thematrix consistency to desired level. In the context of optimiza-tion, it is possible for managers to utilize the technique to selectdifferent alternatives without being subject to bias toward acertain alternative or criteria. In terms of applicability, a majorchallenge of using AHP for empirical research is getting amplenumber of consistent responses which may facilitate generaliz-ability of results. This approach will ensure that moreTable 5The average number of iterations required to achieve CCIP0:90 for 20 different datasets using WGM.

Karresponses may be modiﬁed systematically, so that the consis-tency challenge may be addressed, and more priorities are usedfor empirical data collection and analysis.The next steps of the research should involve the practicalapplication of the proposed approach to real-life case studies.Through using these case studies, it will be possible to comparethe effectiveness of the proposed methodology with similarexisting approaches. This work can potentially be extendedin the future to include the amalgamation of statistical mea-sures that can precisely describe optimal consistency levels.Further, some future research can be in direction of improvingthe algorithm which reduces the number of iterations forreaching the optimal consistency index using cosine maximiza-tion method. Moreover, the purpose of study was to develop aCCI improvement method rather to check the signiﬁcant devi-ation of new matrix priority vector from original matrix prior-ity vector. However, future studies can focus on addingconstraint that checks for signiﬁcant deviation of new matrixfrom original matrix for achieving optimum consistency level.Some possible limitations for proposed method are that theCM for priority vector derivation method fails on impreciseand incomplete matrix. The scope of conversion of impreciseinformation and incomplete judgments from experts to priori-ties that satisfy all requirements surrounding consistency (oreven consensus) has not been explored. Finally, threshold forCCI for achieving desirable value is yet to be derived usingrelationship between PCM consistency and CCI, and couldbe taken forward in future exploration of the method.Appendix A.
