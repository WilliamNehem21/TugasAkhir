Speckle noise is a characteristic artifact in breast ultrasound images, which hinders substantive informa-tion essential for clinical diagnosis. In this article, we have investigated the use of Non-local means (NLM)ﬁlter, which is robust against severe noise, to remove speckle noise in breast ultrasound images. Medicaldiagnosis systems cannot employ traditional NLM ﬁlters, which exhibit the slowest performance due totheir computational burden during the weighted averaging process. We have integrated a novel auto-mated clustering based preclassiﬁcation scheme using spatial regularized fuzzy c means (FCM) to allevi-ate the process. The appropriate number of clusters for each image is calculated automatically throughGap statistics. Moreover, the rotationally invariant moment distance measure increases the chance ofgetting more similar regions for NLM process. The algorithm is evaluated on a breast ultrasound database,which consists of 54 images including 28 benign and 26 malignant. Two statistical measures, Pratt’s ﬁg-ure of merit (PFM) and equivalent number of looks (ENL), are used to evaluate the noise suppression per-formance as well as the capability of preserving the ﬁne details. The results of the proposed method arecompared with the other three state of the art methods quantitatively. The proposed method demon-strated excellent despeckling performance with PFM of 0.91 and ENL of 7.415. The robustness againstspeckle noise and the acceptable processing time make the method more appropriate for computer aideddiagnosis systems./C2112017 The Authors.

1. IntroductionWorldwide, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed can-cer in women and accounts for 14% in overall cancer deaths [1]. Early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer increase the surviv-ability of patients and reduce mortality [2,3]. Ultrasound imaging is an effective, convenient, inexpensive and radiation-free imagingtool for breast tumor diagnosis[4]. Ultrasound has higher sensitiv-ity for detecting lesions in dense breasts, commonly found amongyoung women[5]. Reduced rate of false-positive results in ultra-sound brings down the number of unnecessary biopsies, whencompared to mammography[6]. Since the tumor contour is themost important information for diagnostic decision, the physiciancould observe more clearly the difference in shapes and sizes ofmalignant and benign breast lesions using ultrasound [7]. Many ultrasound computer aided detection and diagnosis(CAD) systems have been developed to provide computerized esti-mation of the probability of malignancy [8]. The traditional B- mode grayscale ultrasound remains the standard in the clinic dueto physicians’ familiarity with it[9]. However, the most important deﬁciency of ultrasound is the poor quality of the image, when it iscorrupted by speckle noise during the acquisition process. Theexistence of the speckle ruins the image quality and impacts thediagnosis accuracy[10,11]. The objective of image denoising taskis to remove the speckle noise while retaining the signal featuresas much as possible in order to increase the diagnostic accuracy.An accurate model of speckle noise formation is necessary for thedevelopment of a despeckling algorithm.

models were developed to describe speckle noise, there is no uni-versally accepted model available yet. However a general model[12]for speckle noise is given asgðn;mÞ’fðn;mÞuðn;mÞ, where gðn;mÞis the observed image,fðn;mÞis the original image and uðn;mÞmultiplicative component of speckle noise.Typically, speckle reduction is accomplished by applying vari-ous ﬁlters. However, these ﬁlters also remove ﬁner edge details,which are essential for producing an accurate contour of the tumorfor diagnosis[13]. Directional average ﬁlter[14], and partial differ- ential equation (PDE) based ﬁlters [15–19]are able to preserve important features such as edges, corners and point targets, whileremoving speckle noise in ultrasound images. The anisotropic dif-fusion (AD) ﬁlter[15]utilizes the local estimations of the imagestructures where the image smoothing is devised as a diffusiveprocess and it is stopped at lesion boundaries to preserve the dis-continuities. Filters such as speckle reducing AD (SRAD) [16], adap- tive window AD (AWAD)[17], oriented SRAD[18]and speckle suppressing AD (SSAD)[19]were also utilized for despecklingultrasound images. Although the PDE based methods exhibitedimproved speckle reduction and edge preservation, they losemeaningful details during iterations by producing blurred low con-trast edges and speckle is often retained in the high intensityregions. Moreover, in all these methods, the restored value of apixel only depends on its spatial neighborhood pixels of the sameimage context, known as locally adaptive recovery paradigm [20]. Buades et al.[21]proposed non-local means (NLM) approach,which exploits speciﬁc characteristics of natural or texture imagessuch as repetitive patterns. NLM ﬁlter is based on the category ofdirectional average ﬁlters[14]and it replaces each pixel with aweighted average of other pixels with similar neighborhoods. TheNLM ﬁler produced the promising results on severely noiseaffected images[21–27]and ultrasound images[28–31]. The drawback of the NLM algorithm is that it consumes more process-ing time during the calculation of weights. Many methods wereproposed to speed up the processing by eliminating dissimilarpatches before the weight calculation. Techniques such as prese-lection of contributing neighborhoods based on mean and gradientvalues
[24], use of local mean and variance to eliminate dissimilarpixels[23], use of fast Fourier transform (FFT) [25]and utilization of several critical pixels in the center instead of all neighborhoodpixels[26]were used during the calculation of weights. Greweniget al.[27]used two similarity measures: moment invariants androtationally invariant block matching (RIBM). The method identi-ﬁed similar patches present in several rotated or mirroredinstances to obtain more suitable regions. This method improvedthe despeckling performance of NLM considerably, but not the pro-cessing speed. Zhan et al.[31]introduced a weight reﬁning NLMmethod, where weight calculation is performed in lower dimen-sional subspace using PCA instead of the original noisy image spaceto reduce computational cost. Although the preselection processimproves the preservation of detail rich regions, the ﬂat regionsare slightly degraded[28]. In fact the ﬂat regions contain a largenumber of similar pixels, which tends to improve denoising perfor-mance. Yan et al.[32]presented the concept of clustering basedpreclassiﬁcation to increase the computational speed without

The computational intensity is alleviatedconsiderably by performing the weighted averaging within eachcluster. The ﬁlter produced superior quantitative results whenthe appropriate number of clusters with sufﬁcient number of pixelcandidates is chosen manually.In this article, we have proposed a novel framework for NLM ﬁl-ter to remove speckle noise in breast ultrasound images. We haveintegrated an automated clustering based preclassiﬁcation schemeinto the NLM model to increase the computational speed as well asthe noise reduction performance. During preclassiﬁcation process,feature vectors are calculated for the image using moment invari-ants and are clustered by spatial regularized FCM algorithm. Mean-while, the gap statistics automatically calculate the appropriatenumber of clusters for each image. The weighted averaging processis performed using RIBM within each cluster and it identiﬁes moresimilar regions in an image. Thus, the NLM has been facilitatedwith more suitable regions without eliminating any pixel candi-dates to yield superior denoising performance with reduced pro-cessing time.2. Methods2.1. The image databaseThe image database consists of 54 B-mode breast ultrasoundimages including 28 benign and 26 malignant cases. These imageswere acquired through high end ultrasound system (Prosound F75,Hitachi medical systems Europe, Switzerland) from differentpatients over different periods with the consent of the patients[33]. It complies with the HONcode (health on the net foundation)standard for trustworthy health information. The study protocolsare approved by institution’s ethics committee of Gelderse ValleiHospital, Ede, the Netherlands.2.2. The NLM algorithmThe NLM algorithm makes use of the self similarity of patches inan image[21]. In an image, the restored intensity NLð

Pre-classiﬁcation using spatial regularized FCM clusteringThe Hu’s moment invariant[27]is used as image descriptor. ForanN/C2Mimage with anN/C2Mpatch centered at locationi, where ði¼1;2;3;...;N/C2MÞ, the moment invariants of the patch are rep-resented by a vector ofð1/C27Þ. Totally,ðN/C2NÞvectors for the entire image are constructed. The clustering based preclassiﬁcationis performed for deﬁning a set of candidates that contains differentpatches from all over the image, which serve as lookup table (LUT)for block matching process. The spatial regularized FCM is used asclustering algorithm. The objective function is deﬁned as follows:Jm¼Xci¼1XNk¼1lmikkxk/C0vmk2þa

2.4. Calculating number of clusters using gap statisticsTibshirani et al.[35]discovered that the ‘‘within cluster disper-sion”, an error measure decreases when the number of clusters ‘ k’ increases. However, when a speciﬁc value of ‘ k’ is reached, the error measure becomes ﬂat. The value of ‘ k‘at such an ‘elbow’, indicates the appropriate number of clusters and it can be assigned to anyclustering algorithm automatically.At ﬁrst the input image datax

2.5. RIBM based nonlocal ﬁlteringIn NLM algorithm, lack of repetitive patterns in an imageleads to insufﬁcient candidates for weighted averaging. Also,the use of moment invariants during preclassiﬁcation might havepossibly left rotationally unaligned candidates at neighborhood.The RIBM can solve these problems by ﬁnding similar regions50 K.M. Prabusankarlal et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 14 (2018) 48–54in an image[36]. The RIBM estimates the angle of rotationbetween two blocks by its centroid and using this value, it ﬁndsthe position of the corresponding pixel in another block by rotat-ing its vector. The new similarity measure in discrete form isgiven as[32]:dRðNi;NjÞ¼X

ResultsThe method is evaluated on breast ultrasound image database,using two statistical parameters namely Pratt’s ﬁgure of merit(PFM)[16]and equivalent number of looks (ENL) [30]. We have compared the results of the proposed method with other threestate of the art NLM based methods: traditional NLM (TNLM)[21], NLM with RIBM[27]and improved NLM[32]. In our experi- ments, the same set of NLM parameters ( Table 1) are used for all these methods. In theFigs. 1 and 2, (a) is the original image fromthe database, (b) the processed image by the method [21], (c) by the method[27], (d) by the method[32]and (e) shows the pro- cessed image by our method.Table 2shows numerical results pro- duced by all the evaluated methods. The values shown are themean values of entire images in the database. An ANOVA test isalso performed to analyze signiﬁcant improvements in the denois-ing performance of the proposed algorithm over other methods. Asshown inTable 2, the proposed method produced PFM and ENLvalues of 0.91 and 7.415 respectively, which are signiﬁcantlyhigher than the other three methods with all pvalues < 0.05. The values of PFM and ENL for each individual image are plotted inFigs. 3 and 4for comparison. All algorithms have been run on Mat-lab 2009a (Mathworks Inc., USA), in an Intel Core i5 processor(Intel Corp., USA) based PC with 8 GB RAM.4. DiscussionWe have presented a NLM based method for removing specklenoise from breast ultrasound images by considering its robustnessagainst heavy noise[21]. The traditional NLM is a simple and effec-tive way to reduce noise, while keeping details of the images unaf-fected. A limitation of the ﬁlter is that it can identify patches assimilar to a given patch with same structure and orientation butsimilar patches with similar structure but different orientationsdo not have inﬂuence in the average [39]. To rectify this issue, the orientation of patches is estimated and corrected beforeweighted averaging process using RIBM [27,36]to obtain more suitable regions.The lower processing time is an important criterion for medicalimage denoising. So we have concentrated methods, which reducecomputational time. Yan et al.[32]used clustering based preclas- siﬁcation[32]to achieve faster processing without the eliminationof any pixels in weight calculation. The k-means algorithm is usedfor clustering, where the value of k(number of clusters) has been set manually though visual perception as well as through peak sig-nal to noise ratio (PSNR) values. In k-means algorithm, the patchesare divided into distinct clusters and each element of a patchbelongs to exactly one cluster. This restricts the candidates to bepresent in more than one cluster. Such a restriction is not presentin fuzzy clustering where the elements of a patch can spread over
Fig. 4.Equivalent number of looks (ENL) is an inherent parameter for measuring noise level in an image. ENL is calculated from a small rectangular homogeneou s region of the images.
Fig. 5.The graph shows appropriate number of clusters automatically selected foreach image through gap statistics. The number of clusters varied from 920 to 1315for the 54 images in the database.52 K.M. Prabusankarlal et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 14 (2018) 48–54more than one cluster with an association deﬁned by a member-ship function. This property increases the probability of gettingmore suitable candidates from each cluster for weighted averaging.However, the FCM does not consider the spatial information in theimage context[34], which makes it very sensitive to noise andother imaging artifacts. In spatial regularized FCM algorithm, thelocal spatial information is incorporated into the FCM [34],i n which the neighborhood effect acts as a regularizer.Moreover, in clustering based preclassiﬁcation methods, thenumber of clusters impacts the denoising performance [32]and the estimation of optimum number of clusters is the major chal-lenge. If the number of clusters is more, fewer candidates are pre-sent in each cluster and degrade the denoising performance. Incontrary, if clusters are less, more number of candidates are pre-sent in each cluster and make the method sluggish. In our work,we have used gap statistics[35]to choose appropriate number ofclusters which leads to optimum performance. The curve in Fig. 5 shows the appropriate values of kproduced for each image of our database. It can be observed from the graph that the value ofkis unique for each image, which varies from 920 to 1315.The PFM is used as a metric to evaluate the preservation ofedges. It uses the distance between all pairs of points to quantifythe quality of edges. It is observed from the curves ( Fig. 3) that our method produced PFM values comparatively higher for themost of the images in the database, which demonstrates betteredge preservation. The range of PFM is between 0 and 1 and highervalue is for ideal edge detection. Canny’s method, which producessingle response for each selected edges is used for edge detection[16]with standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel
r¼0:1. We achieved a higher PFM of 0.91, when compared to other methods:TNLM (0.7), NLM-RIBM (0.759) and improved NLM (0.819). Theinherent parameter, ENL is an effective index for estimating thespeckle noise level in images[30]. The value of ENL correspondsto smoother homogeneous region in the despeckled image. Thecomparison of ENL values is shown in Fig. 4. The ENL is calculated on a small rectangular homogeneous region in the original imageand the value obtained is 4.43. The proposed method producedhigher value of ENL (7.415), when compared to TNLM (5.566),NLM with RIBM (5.829) and improved NLM (6.031), manifests bet-ter despeckling ability over other methods. The TNLM [24]con- sumed 28 s, the method[27]consumed 31 s, the method[32] consumed 6.8 s and the proposed method consumed 7.2 s. The pro-cessing time of the proposed method (7.2 s) is slightly higher thanthe method[32](6.8 s), because of the implementation of gapstatistic in preclassiﬁcation stage. The acceptable processing timeand the ability of preserving image details while removing specklenoise make it suitable for computer aided diagnosis systems.5. ConclusionIn this article, we have presented a novel NLM framework forremoving speckle noise in breast ultrasound images. The proposedmethod has improved the NLM performance in two ways: an auto-mated clustering based preclassiﬁcation scheme through gapstatistics and a new similarity measure using rotationally invariantmoment distance measure. The results have shown that the pre-sented method gives better quantitative results compared to otherstate-of-the-art NLM based methods. Thus, the robustness againstnoise and low processing time make the ﬁlter appropriate forultrasound computer aided breast cancer diagnosis systems.Financial supportThis research did not receive any speciﬁc grant from fundingagencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-proﬁt sectors.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to acknowledge Dr. T.S.A.
