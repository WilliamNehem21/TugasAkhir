Abstract 
According to the problem of emitter characteristic parameters are showed by interval and uneasy to identify, an emitter fusion recognition method based on the PSO-BP neural network is proposed. The method train the network by training samples which are reasonable structured according to the distribution in the interval, so as to determine the network structure and confirm the emitter type through the emitter ch aracteristics parameters. At the same time, the BP neural network is optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The coding method of the network output, training data size and deviation rate on the in fluence of the recognition are researched by simulation, and the validity of this method are verified by the results.

methods, including method based on the bayesian theory, method based on the fuzzy pattern recognition, method based on the rough set theory
 [2], method based on evidence theory, method based on artificial neural network, and so on. These methods have relatively succ essful applications in recognition of radiation sources. But these methods are generally aim at the measured parameters showed by the scalar form, and solve the problem of radar emitter recognition whose parameters are me asured with some error. For another case of the measured parameters are interval type is less discussion. This article mainly aims at the radar parameters of template library for the interval representation and measured values for the scalar form, focus on recognition problem that characteristic parameters are interval type using BP neural network. But the BP neural network easy to get local optimal, and the convergence speed slower in late training, so using the PSO algorithm to optimize the BP neural network to find the optimal weights and thresholds of the network before training in the paper, thus speeding up the convergence speed of training and effectively avoiding algo rithm into local optimal at the same time. 2. PSO-BP neural network 2.1. PSO algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm

12[ , ,..., ]T ii i i Dxx x x , its velocity is 12[ , ,..., ]T ii i i Dvv v v . The particles exchange information by tracking 2 extreme values in each of iteration. One of extreme values is the optimal solution which found by the 
i particle itself, called individual extreme value, denoted by 12[ , ,..., ]T ii i i Dpp p p . Another is all particles found in the optimal solution, called group extreme value, denoted by 
12[ , ,..., ]T gg g g Dpp p p . Particles update the 2 extreme values according to formula (1) and (2) to update their velocities and positions.

The most significant feature of the BP neural network is that it no needs the exact mathematical expressions between input an d output, it only need to be trained by a certain amount of sample data, then it will be able to establis h the mapping relationship between the input and output. 215  Yu Zhi-fu et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  213 – 219 
However, the BP neural network is easy to fall into local optimum in the training process. In order to overcome the deficiencies of the BP neural network, the PSO algorithm are used to obtain the optimal initial value of the network weights and thresholds. Using the PSO algorithm to train the BP network, the particles in the PSO algorithm need to be encoded. The dimension of  each particle is equal to all the BP neural network connection weights number and thresholds number. The dimension number is

Fusion recognition model This article focuses on the type of radar emitter recognition problem. So-called radiation source recognition is the process of matching emitter characteristic parameters detected and in the radar template library so as to 216   Yu Zhi-fu et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  213 – 219 
obtain the radiation source type [4]. From the point of view of neural network classification, its purpose is to confirm the nonlinear mapping of parameter feature space and radiation source models space. The characteristic parameters mainly are carrier frequency RF (radio frequency), pulse width of the PW (The pulse width), pulse repetition interval PRI (The pulse the repeat interval), the modulation of the MOP (pulse modulation on the in radar pulse)
 [5], and so on. Assume there are types of radar

iju represent the value of the j characteristics parameters of the class i of the radar template. RF, PW and PRI are selected for characteristic parameters, which are interval type indicator. Therefore for each 
iju have bilateral constraintmin max[, ]ij ijuuCC , so expectations ()ijEu  can as the median of constraint condition. The maximum deviation rate 
ijJ which referred to the deviation rate is defined at formula (8) to measure the degree of value deviates from its median value.

ijJ is closely related to the target recognition rate K. Large deviation rate show that a wide range of features parameter values. It means that the possible overlap parts are more among different types of radiation source characteristic parameter ranges, and less conducive to the target identification. Therefore, it can be concluded that the bigger deviation rate, the lower recognition rate. Recognition rate can defined as 
0/rNNK                                                                                                                                                       (9) Where,

This paper reasonable constructs training samples according to the distribution of the radiation source characteristics parameters in the range. In this process, the neural network is equivalent to the data fusion center. The fusion recognition model is shown as Fig.1.

Simulation and analysis In order to verify this algorithm performance, the emitter recognition simulation was carried out. Proposed there are 3 species of radar in the template radar library , the characteristic parameters of the radar as RF, PRI and PW.

Simulation A: 1500 emitter samples to be identified are structured based on data in Table 1, corresponding to 500 samples per radar, and randomly selected half of them as training samples, the other half as test samples. Assuming the emitter characteristic parameter v alues uniformly distributed in the range, then to identify emitter samples are uniform random sampling in the known char acteristic parameter value range of template radar. Training samples are normalized and used  as the input of BP neural network and PSO-BP neural network. The input nodes of neural network are as same as the number of radar types, and the output node number is 1. The corresponding relations are show n in the Table 3 of PSO-BP1. The number of hidden nodes identified as 3 according to the empirical formula (3). Parameter settings in the PSO algorithm are shown in Table 2.

 In order to study the optimization effect of PSO algorithm to BP neural network, drawing training error convergence curve of BP neural network and PSO-BP neural network in the condition of the same target error and no limiting the number of iterations in Fig.2(a). The results show that the BP neural network is easy to fall into local minima in the latter period of training, wh ile the PSO-BP neural network can achieve the accuracy requirements with seldom number of iterations, and its  convergence velocity is faster than PSO-BP neural network. Drawing training error convergence curve of both two methods in the condition of the same number of iterations as 20 times but no limiting target error in Fi g. 3, the results show that the PSO-BP neural network can achieve higher accuracy in the same number of  iterations. Fig.2(a) and Fig.2(b) show that the PSO algorithm can effectively overcome the deficiencies of the BP neural network. Curves are the experimental results of 20 times of Monte-Carlo. During the experiment in Fig.2(a). 218   Yu Zhi-fu et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  213 – 219

 Simulation B: In order to study the deviation rate influence on recognition rate, while maintaining the data in Table 1 median value unchanged, assume all kinds of radar deviation rate are the same. When the emitter characteristic parameters obey uniform distribution in th e interval, then according to the mean value and deviation rate can determine characteristic parameters range and construct the training samples. The number of samples is as same as simulation A. The curve of reco gnition rate in the different deviation rate is shown in Fig.4(a). Label PSO-BP1, PSO-BP2 and PSO-BP4 on beha lf respectively of the output node number of 1, 2 and 4. The figure aims to study the different coding  method influence on recognition rate. The corresponding relationship is shown in Table 3, and the symbol O in  the table on behalf of the output layer nodes.

According to the Fig.4(a), it is obvious that the sm aller of deviation rate of characteristic parameters the higher recognition rate, which is consistent with theoretical analysis results. In addition, the recognition rate of different curves in Fig.4(a) is different, which in dicates that the number of different encoding methods and network output nodes have influence on recognition rate. The more number encoded bits, the higher recognition rate. But the increasing of encoded bits will  enlarge the complexity of the network, and eventually result in increasing running time.   Simulation C: In addition to the number of the training samples, the rest of the simulation conditions are the same with simulation B of PSO-BP2 method. Fusion recognition results under different population sizes and different method are shown in Fig.4(b) and the curves in the figure are the result of the 20 Monte-Carlo experiments. The graph annotation of PSO-BP2-500 represents second kinds of coding method and each kind of radar is constructed of 500 samples. The rest of  the annotation can reason by analogy. PSO-BP2-500 of Fig.4(b) is corresponding to PSO-BP2 of Fig.4(a). The simulation results show that the increase of training data size can improve the recognition rate. But the more  number of training samples, the longer time of training network. Different training times of neural network corresponding to different sample number are shown in the Table 4.

5. Conclusion A kind of emitter recognition method based on PSO-BP neural network is proposed. The biggest difference related to the method of fixed value of characteristic parameters is the construction of sample data. The deviation rate is defined in the model to reflect the degree  of the value of the characteristic parameters deviate from its center, and then the deviation rate influence on recognition rate is studied in the simulation. PSO algorithm is applied to improve the BP neural networ k. The simulation results show that the PSO algorithm can effectively overcome the defects of the BP ne ural network. Simulation experiments also studied the influence of the neural network output coding and samp le data size to recognition rate. The final results show that the proposed target recognition method is effective and it has some value in engineering. The main problem of model is no considering the characteristic parameters with discrete value in the selection of emitter parameters, such as modulation information MOP. The ne xt research focus is to construct model of more general while without losing practicality.   References [1] Liu Hai-jun Liu Zheng Jiang Wen-li.
