Article history:Received 22 December 2021Received in revised form 3 February 2022Accepted 8 February 2022Available online 11 February 2022Physical land suitability assessment is a prerequisite for enhancing yield production and enables the agriculturalcommunities to use the right place for the right crops. Maize is one of stable one food crops of Ethiopia and cul-tivated in three agroecological zones: highland, midland and lowlands. Despite these facts, maize yield is verylow due to a lack of knowledge and information gaps on land suitability. Physical land suitability for maize culti-vation is essential to minimize the problem of food security. The present study aims to identify the potential landsuitability for maize production in the Didessa watershed, Western Ethiopia using Multi-Criteria Evaluation(MCE) and geospatial technologies. Land use land cover (LULC) change, climate, topography, soil, and infrastruc-ture facilities were considered for maize land suitability assessment. The MCE based pairwise comparison matrixwas applied to estimate land suitability for maize crop cultivation. The results showed that, about 977.7 km

(14.1%) is highly suitable, 4794.9 km2(69.1%) is moderately suitable while 1118.8 km2(16.1%), and 51.5 km2
(0.7%) of the study area were categorized under marginally and not suitable for maize production, respectively.This research provides crucial information for decision making organs and the farming community to utilizepotential areas for maize cultivation.© 2022 The Authors.

1. IntroductionAt global level about 1, 162 million tons of maize are produced in2020 (Solanki et al., 2020). Maize production in the world increasedfrom 313 million tonnes in 1971 to 1162 million tonnes in 2020,which indicates an increment by 3.07% per year ( Nyagumbo et al., 2016). Agriculture is the backbone and the major source of income inEthiopia (Berhanu and Poulton, 2014;Headey et al., 2014). Maize farm- ing is widely practiced in many regions of Ethiopia ( Kassie et al., 2015). It is widely cultivated for commercial bene ﬁt not only in Ethiopia, but also at global level (Linda et al., 2015;Habibie et al., 2019). Despite this, some people are unable to eat because of a lack of food ( Regassa and Stoecker, 2012;Mota et al., 2019). In poor nations such asEthiopia, the inability to exploit existing technologies for yield develop-ment results in low maize yield (Asfaw et al., 2012;Abate et al., 2019). Low yield harvesting is results in food shortage caused by a lack of tech-nological access have been reported in the country ( Bewket, 2007;Dijk et al., 2020).Around the late 17th century, maize crops were introduced inEthiopia (Huffnagel, 1961;Abate et al., 2015). In Ethiopia, maize is cul- tivated in highland, midland, and lowland agro-ecological zones ( Elias et al., 2013;Tessema and Simane, 2019;Dendir and Simane, 2019). Increasing agricultural output through the use of innovative croptypes and farm inputs in Ethiopia is gaining traction ( Tamene et al., 2017;Sime and Aune, 2018;Silva et al., 2021). Apart from using better varieties and agricultural inputs, determining the appropriateness of agiven parcel of land before investing in agriculture can help maximizethe use of existing land resources (Ahamed et al., 2016). Land suitability assessment is very crucial for land use planning ( Vasu et al., 2018; Habibie et al., 2019;Mehrjardi et al., 2020;Al-Taani et al., 2021). Despite its relevance, land suitability evaluation for maize production has re-ceived little attention in the country as a whole and in the study areaspeciﬁcally. In Ethiopia, some research has been conducted on the phys-ical suitability of land for maize production ( Girma et al., 2015;Alemu and Worku, 2017;Debesa et al., 2020).

journal homepage:http://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/artificial-intelligence-in-agriculture/climate (rainfall and temperature), soil, land use, and elevation were in-cluded in prior studies. However, the land surface temperature (LST)was not considered in physical land suitability assessment in the previ-ous research. Thus, this research intended to incorporate the LST as aphysical land suitability determining criterion.2. Materials and methods2.1. Descriptions of the study areaThis study was conducted in Didessa watershed in western parts ofEthiopia. Geographically, Didessa watershed is located between 7
°49′ 30″to 8
°54′30”Na n d3 6°1′00″to 37°6′00″E(Fig. 1). The topography of the Didessa watershed ranges from 1354 m to 3154 m above meansea level. The watershed covers a total area of 6942.9 km
2.2.1.1. ClimateThe study area received maximum amount rainfall during the sum-mer season (June to September). Study conducted by Wedajo et al. (2019)in Didessa River sub basin indicates that the average minimumand maximum temperature is 13 °C, and 26.5 °C, respectively. Otherstudy byGemeda et al. (2021)at Bedele station, which is located withinthe Didessa River sub-basin found that the mean minimum and maxi-mum temperature is about 11.9 °C, and 26.2 °C, respectively.2.1.2. Soil typesThe study area has a large variety of soil types. Among the existingsoil types, Haplic Alisols was the most dominat which covers an areaof 4235.7 km2(61.0%) and the least dominated soil type was RhodicNitisol with an area of 518.6 km
2(7.5%).2.2. Data sources and descriptionsLandsat images of OLI/TIRS 2020 were downloaded from U.S. Geo-logical Survey (USGS) website (https://www.usgs.gov/) for Land use land cover (LULC) classiﬁcation. Climate data was obtained from Na-tional Meteorological Agencies (NMA) of Ethiopia while soil data wasobtained from Ministry of Water and Irrigation Engineering (MoWIE)and elevation data was extracted from ASTER DEM ( Table 1;Fig. 2).2.3. Data analysis2.3.1. RainfallRainfall data of four stations from near and within Didessa water-shed namely Gimbi, Nekemte, Bedele and Arjo were obtained from

35Ethiopian National Meteorological Agency. We interpolated the climatedata of four stations using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) tech-niques to obtain annual rainfall data for areas using stations in andaround the study area. This annual rainfall was interpolated with a 30m resolution and then extracted to the study area.2.3.2. Land surface temperatureIn the present study, the LST was retrieved from the thermal bandsof the Landsat OLI/TIRS of 2020 (Adeola et al., 2017). The mono window algorithm was applied to retrieve LST from the thermal bands of the OLI/TIRS images. Accordingly, LST was retrieved from Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS)with thermal bands of band 10 used by mono-window algorithm fol-lowing (Guo et al., 2020;Sekertekin and Bonafoni, 2020). Digital num- ber (DN) was converted to the spectral radiance of thermal bands ofLandsat TIRS (Dener and Alves, 2016;Ziaul and Pal, 2018).Consequently, LST was estimated using the brightness temperature ofthe two bands of thermal infrared, mean and difference in land surfaceemissivity (Cheng et al., 2015).Step 1: Conversion of digital numbers to top of atmosphere (TOA)spectral radianceThermal data in the Landsat sensor and deliver a manner of signify-ing pixels are stored in a digital number that has not yet been calibratedand converted into radiance units (Aik et al., 2020;Moisa et al., 2022) using (Eq.(1)).Lλ¼ML∗QCalðÞ þAL ð1ÞwhereLλ¼Top of Atmosphere TOAðÞspectral radiance Wm

NDVI calculation is critical for determining the proportion of vegetation (PV). Further-more, emissivity (ε), which is linked to PV, should be determined(Eq.(3)).NDVI¼

From this organization we extract the topography of thestudy area, which very crucial to understand land suitability for maizeproduction. Maize crop cultivation was more favorable in lowlandareas and vice versa (Gorfu and Ahmed, 2011;Rashid et al., 2013).2.3.4. Soil dataSoil data of the study area was obtained from the Ministry of Waterand Irrigation Engineering and clipped to the study area. In addition, thesoil data were converted to raster format by 30 m spatial resolution andreclassiﬁed according to a previous studyDebesa et al. (2020)for over- lay analysis.2.3.5. Land use land cover typesMultispectral Landsat OLI/TIRS layer were stacked and extracted tothe Didessa watershed. The LULC of the study area was classi ﬁed using supervised classiﬁcation maximum likelihood algorithm. An imagewas classiﬁed into cultivated land, forest, grassland, dense and openwoodlands and urban areas using the ERDAS Imagine 2015 software.2.4. Pairwise comparison approach for criteria weight estimationBased on expert opinion weight values from comparison of thecriteria were processed using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP)model (Saaty, 2004; Abine, 2021). This model was developed bySaaty (1980)to compare the relative importance of each criterion. Saaty (1980)provided the scale range to indicate the relative importance of

38each factor, which ranges between one and nine. Finally, the weights ofthe pairwise comparison matrix priorities were computed ( Table 2). The consistency ratio (CR) was calculated to check the consistency ofcomparisons (Yohannes and Soromessa, 2018). The CR was calculated using (Eq.(7)). The CR values ranges from 0 to 1 ( Saaty, 1980; Malczewski, 2000). A CR <0.1 is a reasonable level of consistency. Calcu-lating consistency index (CI) is very important for crop land suitabilityanalysis and calculated using Eq.(7).CI¼

39out rainfall there is no agriculture speciﬁcally the rain-fed agriculture is not operational at all. The Didessa watershed's northwestern areas wereunsuitable for maize crop development ( Fig. 3). According toKindu et al. (2009)stated that rainfall is most important parameter for siteselection of maize crop cultivation.3.2. Land surface temperature estimationThe LST of the study area was determined using the thermal band ofOLI/TIRS 2020 Landsat image. Warm temperatures are suitable formaize crop cultivation, while cold temperatures are not. About 1340.3km
2(19.3%) of the study area is very appropriate for maize production.The most appropriate areas were concentrated in the central and north-ern parts of the study area (Fig. 4). However, with an area of 1171.3 km
2
(16.9%), the south western areas of the study area were not appropriatefor maize crop production (Table 3). Theseﬁndings are consistent with Habibie et al. (2019), who found that high LST are optimal for maizecrop productivity.

403.3. Agro ecological zones of the study areaThe agro-ecological zones of the study area were extracted fromdigital elevation model. Previous research Hurni (1998),Gorfu and Ahmed's (2011)were used to create the Agro ecological zone (AEZ)Didessa watershed. Theﬁndings of this study revealed that low-lands dominated core parts of the study area, whereas midlandsdominated substantial portions (Fig. 5). Our results showed that a total of 1640.8 km
2(23.6%) of the research area was found to behighly favorable for maize crop cultivation ( Table 4). Previous studies conducted byGorfu and Ahmed (2011)andRashid et al.(2013)conclude that lowland areas are appropriate for maizefarming.3.4. Soil typesEutric Vertisols, Haplic Acrisols, Haplic Alisols, Haplic Nitisols, andRhodic Nitisols are among the major soil types in the study area(Fig. 6). Haplic nitisols and rhodic nitisols were found to be highly favor-able for maize production, with an area of 727.7km
2(10.5%) (Table 5). However, with a total area of 988.2km
2, Eutric vertisols were not

41adequate (14.2%). This study'sﬁndings are consistent with earlier re-search (Sultan, 2013).3.5. Soil textureThe study area's soil texture was divided into six groups. Sandy clay,clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, sandy loam, and loamy sand. With anarea of 80.7km
2(1.2%) of the soil texture of the study area is highly ap-propriate for maize production. With a total area of 10.3km
2, sandy clay is unsuitable (0.8%). The sandy clay loam dominates most of the studyregion, which covers 3826.7km
2(55.1%) and is moderately appropriatefor maize agriculture (Table 6;Fig. 7). The study'sﬁndings were more consistent with those of the prior study ( Hussien et al., 2019).3.6. Soil drainageSoil drainage map of the study area is presented ( Fig. 8). There are ﬁve categories of drainage in the study area including well, moderate,somewhat excessive, excessive and imperfect. Study by Al-Mashrekiet al. (2015)prove that well and moderate drainage were suitable formaize production. Results showed that 6143.1km2(88.5%) of the entire area of the Didessa watershed is highly suited for maize agriculture,whereas 372.7km
2(5.4%) is not suitable (Table 7).3.7. Soil depthThe most essential soil property for determining viable land formaize crop development is soil depth ( Kindu et al., 2009). Maize crop productivity beneﬁts greatly from deep soil depth. Based on soil depthwe can classify land suitability for certain crops. The soil depth class ofthe study area is presented (Fig. 9). The results revealed that 4209.4km
2(60.6%) is highly favorable for maize production, while73.2km
2(1.1%) is unsuitable (Table 8).3.8. Land suitability for maize productionFrom aggregated eight factors, land suitability for maize productionwas produced (Fig. 10). The results showed that 977.7 km
2(14.1%), and

2(16.1%), and 51.5 km2
(0.7%) were marginally and not suitable for marginally and not suitablefor maize production, respectively (Table 9). This data clearly indicates that majority of the study area is moderately suitable for maizeproduction. Similar researchﬁndings were reported byDebesa et al. (2020)at Dabo Hana district. The lowland area, which is concentratedin the central part of the study area were highly and moderately suitabledue to warm temperature (High LST) is more favorable for maize pro-duction. Consequently, western part and some eastern parts wereTable 7Soil drainage and suitability classes.S/No Soil drainage Area (km

ConclusionUnderstanding land suitability for crop production enhances yieldsand contributes towards the achievements of UN Sustainable Develop-ment Goals such as no poverty and zero hunger. Land suitability evalu-ation for maize production at watershed scale is crucial to enhance foodsecurity in agriculture-based economy like Ethiopia. Several factorssuch as: climate, LULC, LST, soil, topography, and infrastructure's datawere used to evaluate physical land suitability for maize production.In this study, geospatial techniques were employed to identify physicalland suitability for maize production in the study area. The results of thestudy showed that the area with low elevation and high LST are highlysuitable for maize production. Results revealed that about 977.7km2
(14.1%), and 4794.9km2(69.1%) were highly and moderately suitablefor maize production, respectively. About 1118.8 km
2(16.1%), and 51.5 km
2(0.7%) were marginally and not suitable for maize production,respectively. Theﬁndings of this research can support decision makingorgans to promote intensive maize production in Didessa watershed.In order to enhance food security, the farming communities in thestudy area should cultivated the highly and moderately suitable areafor maize production. Moreover, in order to sustain the life of the farm-ing communities' similar crop speciﬁc physical land suitability will beconducted in the study area.Compliance with ethical standardsNA.Consent for publicationNA.Availability of dataData used for this study will be available based on request from thecorresponding author.
