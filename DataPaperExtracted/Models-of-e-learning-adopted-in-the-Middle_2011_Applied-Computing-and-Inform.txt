KEYWORDSInternet penetration;E-learning;E-learning drivers andbarriers;Middle East;Saudi ArabiaAbstractTraditional academic institutions as well as newly established onlineor hybrid educational organizations in the Middle East (ME) are still in the earlyphases of trying to get students and their parents to accept and adapt to the con-cept of e-learning. Different countries and different universities within individualcountries within the ME have achieved various levels of success to this regard.While some traditional universities have already started offering a good numberof e-learning courses, others are still in the very early stages of setting up suchprograms. This paper presents a general overview of the current situation of e-learning in the ME. It presents drivers and barriers to e-learning, the differenttypes of e-learning initiatives, steps being taken towards overcoming the chal-lenges, and a possible future of e-learning through a case study of ongoing devel-opments by an authority on e-learning in Saudi Arabia.

IntroductionCensorship in most Middle Eastern countries is common practice. For this reason,many of the countries within this region were hesitant to widely adopt the Internet.Governments were concerned about external political inﬂuences that might try tonegatively manipulate their people. They were also concerned about immoralmaterial such as pornography. Exposure to such material could be considereddangerous to youths and to the religious moral values of those nations ( Mirza, 1998).The United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 1995 was among the earliest countries togrant its citizens access to the Internet (ITU, 2001). The latest to connect to theInternet were Syria and Saudi Arabia, with connections established in the late1990’s (Wheeler, 2004). Certain academic and research organizations in both SaudiArabia and Syria, however, did go online much before the general public were ableto (Mirza, 1998; Wheeler, 2004).Governments that resisted the Internet eventually realized that they cannot af-ford to remain isolated from the remainder of the World. They, as well as earlyInternet adopters, made sure that they had put into place strong technical mea-sures that can be used to prohibit access to undesired sites. People of the ME typ-ically have several ISPs to choose from when seeking Internet access, however,nationwide Internet trafﬁc goes through proxy servers that are typically controlledby specialized governmental agencies. Saudi Arabia’s gateway to the Internet forexample had for many years been facilitated through the Internet Unit at the KingAbdulaziz City for Science and Technology (Internet Unit, 2008), as of late, how- ever, this responsibility has been transferred to the Commission on Telecommuni-cations and Information Technology.Ever since Internet access became possible, the region has been experiencing tre-mendous growth in the number of people going online. Table 1shows old and re- cent statistics of number of Internet users in ME countries. Iran has the highestjump in Internet penetration with number of users increasing 128 folds between2000 and 2009. Both Syria and Saudi Arabia, which were among the latest to al-low Internet access to their nationals experienced the second and third highestInternet penetration growth rates by nearly 11,800% and 3,750% respectively. Is-rael enjoys the highest rate of Internet users in a Middle Eastern country witharound 73%, followed by the UAE with almost 61%, Bahrain with 55%, Qatarwith 52%, Iran with 48.5%, Kuwait with around 37%, and Saudi Arabia witharound 27%. Lebanon and Jordan have Internet penetrations of just less than24%, while remaining ME countries have internet penetrations of less than20%. The worst level of Internet penetration can bee seen in Iraq with only 1%of the population accessing the Internet.The most recent ﬁgures, as reported inTable 2, have the overall Internet pen-etration rate of the Middle East already reaching 28.3% by September of 2009.This number puts the Middle East internet penetration rate much ahead of the84 A.A. Mirza, M. Al-AbdulkareemWorld-wide rate of 25.6%. According to previously listed statistics at the samesource, June 2008 ﬁgures had the Middle East trailing the rest of the world-wideinternet penetration rate by 0.6% with 21.3% in comparison to a world-wide rateof 21.9%. Prior data of December 2007 had Internet penetration in the ME at only17.4% in comparison with a World-wide rate of 20%. These ﬁgures show that theME region has enjoyed tremendous growth over the past few years in the numberof Internet users.According to Wheeler’s 2004 study, the number of Internet users in the ME rep-resented less than 1% of world-wide users, a very low ﬁgure in contrast with apopulation constituting around 3% of the World population. According to Sep-tember 2009 statistics however, as represented byTable 2, the percentage of Inter- net users in the ME has reached 3.3% of the World-wide internet user population.Additionally, the use growth column of Internet users between 2000 and 2009shows a 380% growth World-wide, while the use growth in the Middle East forthe same period is 1,648%. Such data is an indicator that as years pass by, moreand more ME citizens are going online, and naturally along with it, comes the po-tential for more and more users of e-learning.Table 1Internet penetration in Middle Eastern countries ( InternetWorldStats, 2010).

We then present several initiatives and models for intro-ducing and utilizing e-learning in the region. We ﬁnally conclude with a look atpossible future of e-learning in the ME through a case study of undergoing devel-opments in Saudi Arabia.Drivers of e-learning in the Middle EastThe ME in general has been a late follower when it comes to the adoption of e-learning. This can be greatly attributed to the delay in the adoption of the Inter-net as a whole by most governments of the region. As a result, little research withregard to the beneﬁts, limitations, barriers, and acceptability of e-learning in theME has been published. Generally, however, recently published research seems toindicate a high approval level by both faculty and students. We look in this sec-tion at a few research efforts that highlight the value of e-learning in the MiddleEast.Tubaishat (2008)of Zayed University, an all girl university in the UAE, con-ducted a study regarding e-learning’s impact on social and cultural limitationsof higher education. He pointed out the fact that in the ME region social valuesand expectations with regard to males and females are different. Female studentsat Zayed University are not allowed to be present on campus after working hoursof the day nor on weekend days. Utilization of learning management systems(LMS) makes it possible for students to interact with faculty members at any per-iod of the day or night. When confronted with a male faculty member, female stu-dents may also feel a little shy when participating in in-class discussions. Hisresults revealed that the 74.2% of the students were more comfortable in postingtheir opinions on discussion boards as opposed to having to speak-up in the class-room. 71.2% felt that they had become more conﬁdent in expressing their ideas.Additionally 85.6% of the students were satisﬁed with the online classenvironment.Abdeen et al. (2008)describes the great advantage attained through e-learningin overcoming the difﬁcult situations created by political problems and physicalwall barriers constructed by the Israeli occupying forces in the West Bank, Pales-tine. As a result of the inability to move about between university campuses andhospitals, students and faculty of Al Quds University were forced to resort to vid-eoconferencing, telemedicine, and e-learning in fulﬁlling parts of their educationalrequirements. Three campuses and seven hospitals were connected to enable ablended form of education. Online technology has been utilized to deliver coursesin basic medical sciences and clinical training. Even though they were able to over-come the ban on free movement between centers of education, the author stillcomplains of low speed Internet access and difﬁculties to overcome technical prob-lems for lack of qualiﬁed technical expertise.86 A.A. Mirza, M. Al-AbdulkareemAbbad et al. (2009)investigated the major factors affecting the students’ adoptionof e-learning in Arab Open University in Jordan. They investigated the IT adoptionas source of e-learning adoption. In their study they developed an extended versionof Technology Adoption Model to investigate the factors inﬂuencing the students touse e-learning. The results show that prior and extensive use of the internet was oneof the major factors. The students who were more conﬁdent that they are able to usee-learning on there own, are more likely to become good users of e-learning. Theavailability of technical support and the ease of use are the other major factors.Additional research that presented speciﬁc country research include: researchon the attitude of Kuwaitis students and people in general regarding e-learning(Al-Khashab et al., 2007); the perceived relevance of online MBA programs on cit-izens of the Arabian Gulf countries (Anwar, 2008); and, an Arabic language re-search regarding the affect of supporting a traditional course with e-learningmaterial on the performance of English course students in Saudi Arabia in com-parison with students taking the same course through solely traditional meansof course delivery (Al-Jarf et al., 2003). Results of the later revealed that studentsbeneﬁting from the e-learning course material who were encouraged to participateonline without any grades being rewarded or deducted for such participation,performed much better than the other students. Failure rate of students in thee-learning section was only 10% in contrast to a failure rate of 30% in the mainlytraditional course. Other research with regard to e-learning in the Middle EastincludesFuraih (2005) and Alzamil (2004).Barriers to e-learning adoption in the MEA 2007 nation-wide study conducted by the Saudi Arabian Communications andInformation Technology Commission (CITC, 2007) of over 7,500 individuals re-vealed that only 49% of society members are aware of e-learning, while only5% of those who are aware of it have ever personally used it! This represents avery low percentage of acquaintance with e-learning systems, not only at the aca-demic level, but also at the employee development level carried out by either gov-ernmental or private organizations.A good number of reasons can be blamed for the passive attitude that manyME governments took in response to e-learning. The biggest and probably mostimportant reason was the very low Internet penetration rate by the general public(Al-Kahtani et al., 2005). This factor in itself can be attributed to several reasonsincluding the high initial costs associated with Internet access, low speed and qual-ity Internet connections, and the fear that Internet connection would bring-aboutimmoral values and corruption to the family (Mirza, 1998). The conservative reli- gious clerics were continuously warning of the dangers the Internet will bring tothe society. Many adhered to the warning.Another important reason for the hesitation of many university academics toresort to e-learning is the low public esteem for online learning. The onlineModels of e-learning adopted in the Middle East 87degree is seen to have less job opportunities and is not comparable to tradi-tional degrees (Dirani and Yoon, 2009). Additionally, the learner’s attitudeand lack of prior knowledge of IT use are major factors that affect the accep-tance of e-learning by students (Selim, 2007; Ozkan and Koseler, 2009;Abbad et al., 2009).Yet one more cause for not rushing into the adoption of e-learning in the Mid-dle East is the great lack of online repositories that contain educational material inthe Arabic language (Al-khalifa et al., 2008). A great percentage of faculty mem-bers may not be capable of creating such material, and hence, courses would notlend themselves to e-learning. Training and workshops are recommended to bridgethe technology gap and improve faculty self-perception ( Georgina and Olson, 2008). Scientiﬁc programs such as computing sciences, medicine, and engineeringmay be more applicable for e-learning in the ME as most scientiﬁc colleges teachtheir courses in the English language, and hence, electronic course material may bemore readily available.E-learning initiatives in the Middle EastThe 21st century has witnessed a growing interest in most countries of the MEwith regard to the adaptation and application of e-learning. Different govern-ments have rushed to establish e-learning projects and programs. This includese-learning for K-12 and college students. Oman’s Ministry of Education for in-stance has established ongoing relations with Edutech Middle East, a providerof technology-enabled learning solutions, since 2002 to integrate around 590schools around the country with e-learning solutions ( Computer News Middle East, 2006). Other countries in the Middle East have been somewhat slower inadopting e-learning solutions for their schools. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Educa-tion, for example, has just recently started a pilot study of e-learning implantationin ﬁve secondary schools within the Kingdom (Hassan, 2008). When it comes to institutions of higher education, similar types of variations ine-learning adoption can be seen across the different parts of the ME. Three mainmodels of college-level e-learning institutions can now be found in different partsof the region. These include a virtual e-learning model, a hybrid e-learning model,and a traditional university e-learning model.Virtual e-learning modelThe virtual model involves the establishment of specialized online universities.Examples of such universities include the Syrian Virtual University ( http:// www.svuonline.org) inaugurated in 2002 by President Bashar Al Asad of Syria;the Hamdan bin Mohammed e-University (http://portal.etqm.ae/en/home/), ini- tially established as the e-TQM College out of Dubai in the UAE, also establishedin 2002; the Mediterranean Virtual University (http://ls-ewdssps.ces.strath.ac.uk/88 A.A. Mirza, M. Al-AbdulkareemMVU/) established as a Jordanian initiative in 2004; and, the Knowledge Interna-tional University (http://www.kiu.com.sa/website/index.php), established in 2007 and based in Saudi Arabia.The Syrian Virtual University offers various degrees including diplomas, bach-elor’s, and master’s degrees in business, technology, and quality management.They offer their degrees in cooperation with several British and American univer-sities such as Ohio University, Robert Gordon University, and University of Yorkto name a few.The Hamdan bin Mohammed e-University is dedicated to providing both aca-demic degrees at the master’s and bachelor’s levels, as well as professional diplo-mas and certiﬁcates. Their college degrees include a bachelor in business andquality management, and masters of science degrees in organizational excellence,public health: excellence in health care management, and innovation and changemanagement. For professionals they offer both certiﬁcate and a diploma programsin quality assurance, diploma in foundation and human resources, and a profes-sional senior hospital and health services manager program.The Mediterranean Virtual University (MVU) was a developed as a cooperativee-learning initiative. This cooperative program involved eleven different universi-ties from ﬁve Mediterranean countries. These countries included Jordan, Egypt,Malta, Turkey, and the UK. Each partner university developed no more than fouronline courses for a total of 40 courses. These courses made up programs in com-puter science and engineering. The idea was that a student can complete a degreeprogram through a set of online courses that originate from different universitiesunder the umbrella of the MVU. Even though registration in the universityinitially started in 2006, it seems that the university is no longer active.The Knowledge International University (KIU) is a university specializing inonline degree programs in Islamic studies. They also offer degree programs in eco-nomics and management, and computer and information technology. What distin-guishes this university from other virtual universities in the region is that Arabic isthe main language of study. Special units within the university include the Collegeof Islamic studies for non-Arabic speakers and the Institute of Arabic language fornon-Arabic speakers.Hybrid e-learning modelThe hybrid model involves the creation of actual physical buildings that studentscan visit for purposes of registration, taking exams, and meeting with facultymembers once every two weeks. The greater responsibility falls upon the studentfor using the course management system for obtaining course material, contactingthe course instructor, and submitting assignments.The Arab Open University (AOU) is the most popular institution following thehybrid e-learning model. Its headquarters is located in Kuwait with other branchesset-up in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. The ﬁrstModels of e-learning adopted in the Middle East 89branches of the AOU were established in 2002 in Kuwait, Jordan, and Lebanon. In2003, branches in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Egypt also started operations. TheOman branch is expected to start excepting students in the very near future. Totalnumber of students enrolled in all countries has already exceeded 22,000 back inMarch of 2007 (Golden, 2007). The Saudi Arabia branch is the largest in numberof enrolled students with nine developed centers already in operation across thecountry.Traditional University e-learning modelDifferent established universities within the Middle East have responded toe-learning differently. The greatest majority of e-learning initiatives in the MEwithin the traditional university e-learning model are in the form of supportingtraditionally attended course with learning management systems. Going back asfar as 2004, WebCT alone had 45 different customers in the Middle East. Thisnumber includes non-academic institutions as well, however, it does represent avisible level of interest in e-learning tools. The University of Sana’a in Yemendeployed in 2004 Microsoft’s Learning Gateway Solution, a powerful e-learningplatform, to its 70,000 students and staff (Kleeßen, 2004). Even though WebCT was available to Saudi Arabia’s King Saud University faculty back in 2004, it wasnot received with great enthusiasm at that time. Faculty that knew about its avail-ability complained about the effort needed to learn the tool and quickly dismissedits utilization. With very few exceptions, department heads, college deans, and theuniversity rector cared less about encouraging faculty to use the technology.In more advanced applications of e-learning by traditional universities, severalinstitutions in the ME have already allowed their students to sing-up for courseson a distance-learning basis. King Abdulaziz University in Saudi Arabia, whichhad for many years already accepted students on a ‘‘study through correspondence’’program was a perfect candidate to providing e-learning technology for its students.The Hashemite University in Jordan has taken much faster strides in its efforts toestablish e-learning services. They have recently completed a project with EdutechMiddle East that built an eLearning Center that enables the simulation of ‘‘a class-room atmosphere though a digitized, internet-enabled eLearning module equippedwith visual and descriptive educational content’’ (Arabian Busines.com 2008). Thepartnership involved the integration of several tools for learning management(Blackboard), content capture (Tegrity), synchronous collaboration (Elluminate),content development (Lectora), and online testing and assessment (QuestionMarkPerception). A custom developed web-based registration system was also producedas part of the partnership.Future anticipated developments – a case study from Saudi ArabiaAs a case study of prospective e-learning future in Middle Eastern countries,we present in this section a case study regarding such future from Saudi90 A.A. Mirza, M. Al-AbdulkareemArabia. Saudi Arabia’s budget appropriation for education and manpowerdevelopment in 2007 was Saudi Riyals SR 96.7B (equivalent of US $25.8B)and SR 105B in 2008 (equivalent of US $28B). Expenditure for e-learning pur-poses in Saudi Arabia was expected to top US $125 M in 2008 ( MENAFN Press, 2008).The Saudi Arabian National ICT plan released in 2003 had called for the imple-mentation of e-learning and distance learning and all their prospective applica-tions in higher education. Moreover, a national center of e-learning wassuggested as the means to provide the technical support as well as the tools neces-sary for the development of e-learning content. The carrying out of the plan’sdirectives with regard to e-learning can be attributed to the increasing demandresulting from rapid population growth, shortage of professional instructors interms of both quality and quantity, and high ﬁnancial costs. Most higher educa-tion related costs within Saudi Arabia are paid for by the government. Studentsenjoy higher education at no charge. They are further encouraged to pursue highereducation through a monthly stipend that is paid to them of a value almost equiv-alent to US $200.An e-learning-based instructional system has been established in the formof a national center that supports the educational processes in tertiary insti-tutes at all levels and stages, free from the restrictions of time and place. Thiscenter is to incorporate all universities collective efforts and experiences inestablishing e-learning and distance learning concepts. Beneﬁts are to bereaped by different members of society regardless of their socioeconomic oracademic backgrounds.The establishment of the National Center for E-learning and Distance Learningby the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Higher Education, has started as a project aim-ing to become an international leader in research, development, and implementa-tion of an e-learning architecture and infrastructure using open standards. Thevision of the center is to: ‘‘empower people through creative e-learning in lifelongeducation.’’ Nine universities have already signed agreements with the center totake advantage of its services (University World news, 2008). The center’s mission is to deliver quality higher education through e-learning, promote education viatechnology, ensure quality standards for e-learning, and bridge the gap of educa-tion and technology. The center has stated many goals to achieve in the comingfuture, these goals include:/C15To collaborate with higher education, government and corporate partners tosolve complex e-learning problems./C15To provide complete e-learning solutions to strategic partners./C15To develop quality standards for e-learning./C15To establish alliance with major international e-learning bodies to share e-learn-ing resources./C15To develop rules and regulation governing e-learning programs in Saudi Arabia.Models of e-learning adopted in the Middle East 91/C15To establish awareness of e-learning programs./C15To develop infrastructures for e-learning in Saudi Arabian universities.The National Center for e-Learning and Distance Learning has started manyprojects to achieve its goals. JUSUR is a custom-developed LMS, and is alreadyused by three major universities in Saudi Arabia. The future release of the JSUSRproject is to include other tools based on Web 2.0 technology. ZAD is a digitallibrary project which already includes more than 90,000 electronic book titles ofand other educational resources. Other projects of the center that support the e-learning initiative include promoting e-learning to the public, establishing a callcenter for student support, and building a national learning objects repository.The National Learning Object Repository is a promising project that enables staffand universities in Saudi Arabia to share learning objects.ConclusionDespite the delayed application of e-learning within most ME educational sys-tems, the wheels of change have ﬁnally started turning. The great economic upturnexperienced by many countries of the ME over the past few years, especially bythose that are oil producers, has ﬁnally started to pay-off. Governments arenow much more willing to confront the challenges of the educational system. At-tempts at altering K-12 educational systems have already been started. This in-cludes the introduction of technology into the classroom at early years of studyin most ME countries, and likewise for the English language.Even though a great percentage of members of society may still be unfamiliarwith technical advancements and concepts of e-learning, plans are being put intoplace where such technology can become widely recognizable and usable in thevery near future. Training and workshops should be given more attention to in-crease the faculty perception of e-learning. On the other hand, the availabilityof by laws that govern the e-learning and distance learning will help encouragingstudents to participate in these types of learning.References
