Face Recognition is a computer application that is capable of detecting, tracking, identifying or verifying humanfaces from an image or video captured using a digital camera. Although lot of progress has been made in domainof face detection and recognition for security, identi ﬁcation and attendance purpose, but still there are issues hindering the progress to reach or surpass human level accuracy. These issues are variations in human facialappearance such as; varying lighting condition, noise in face images, scale, pose etc. This research paper presentsa new method using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) algorithm combined with advanced image processing techniquessuch as Contrast Adjustment, Bilateral Filter, Histogram Equalization and Image Blending to address some of theissues hampering face recognition accuracy so as to improve the LBP codes, thus improve the accuracy of theoverall face recognition system. Our experiment results show that our method is very accurate, reliable and robustfor face recognition system that can be practically implemented in real-life environment as an automatic atten-dance management system.
1. IntroductionThe human face is a sophisticated multidimensional structure that canconvey a lot of information about the individual, including expression,feeling, facial features. Effectively and efﬁciently analyzing the features related to facial information is a challenging task that requires lot of timeand efforts. Recently, many facial recognition-based algorithms forautomatic attendance management has been proposed, successfullyimplemented and used as in Refs. [1–4] and also new algorithms devel- oped or some existing algorithms improved or combined with othermethods, techniques, or algorithms to build facial recognition systems orapplications as in Refs. [5–8].Although lot of achievements have been made in devising facialrecognition algorithms and systems, but to reach human level accuracy offacial recognition, some major issues associated with these algorithms/systems should be greatly mitigated or addressed as argued in Ref. [ 9]s o as to realize a reliable and accurate facial recognition-based automaticattendance management system, which can be very useful in the area ofsubstantiation.The main challenges for successful face detection and recognitionsystems are; illumination conditions, scale, occlusion, pose, background,expression etc., as highlighted in Refs. [ 10,11]. Various algorithms and methods have been proposed to address these challenges; N.PattabhiRamaiah Ref. [12] uses illumination Invariant Face Recognition usingConvolutional Neural Networks to address illumination conditions,Abass et al Ref. [13] addresses the issues of shift and rotation usingcomplex wavelet transform (CWT) and Fisherface. To address issuesrelated to pose, Kishor et al Ref. [14] proposes robust pose invariant facerecognition using Dual Cross Pattern (DCP), LBP and Support VectorMachine (SVM).In our research work, which is divided into two main sections: Theﬁrst section focused mainly on improving the face recognition algorithmwhile the second section focused on the attendance management systembased on the recognized human faces. In the ﬁrst section, a digital live camera will be used at the entrance to capture images of staffs entering anofﬁce or a building, which some advanced image processing techniques,such as contrast adjustment, noise reduction using bilateral ﬁlter, image histogram equalization, are applied to the captured images to improvetheir quality, then the Haar Algorithm will be applied to the capturedimages to detect individual faces, which will be used as an input to theFace Recognition System.And also the same advanced image processing techniques above, plusImage Blending technique will be applied, a prior, to the training/tem-plate face images, then the improved input images will be compared withthe improved training images using the LBP algorithm, to yield animproved LBP codes to recognize faces, thus the facial recognition

In the second section, the metadata of the recognized facialimages such as date and time are automatically extracted to automati-cally mark attendance of each individual.2. Related workKohonen Ref. [15] is one of the early pioneers of the most famous facerecognition system, which employed a simple neural net using networkof Eigenfaces by approximating eigenvectors through face images auto-correlation matrix. Although, the method was not very successful to bepractically implemented in a real-life environment due to associated highdemand for normalization and positioning when run in a large databasewith many types of face conditions.In harnessing and improving the work of Kohonen, Kirby and Sirovichin 1990 as in Ref. [16], directly calculated the Eigenfaces using algebraicmanipulation with fewer than 100 faces to implement facial recognition,which was further improved by Turk and Pentland in 1991 as in Ref. [ 17] by determining the exact location and scales of faces and also the use ofcoding residual error originated from Eigenfaces, but in a minimallyconstrained environment.Better and more novel approaches than Kohonen approach for facialrecognition using; Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fisherfaces andthe traditional Local Binary Patterns (LBP) were proposed, particularlythe LBP, because it has a simple theory with computational simplicity,invariant with respect to any monotonic transformation of gray scale, haspowerful rotation-invariant analysis with a uniform pattern and dis-criminates excellently between different various kinds of texture as inRef. [18], but It is known that the LBP is not as robust as the viola-jonesand other algorithms for face detection as highlighted in Refs. [ 19–21], because of issues such as noise, illumination variation, background, pose,scale and occlusion etc.In addressing the issue of illumination variation, Ref. [ 22] mitigated illumination variation in facial recognition by combining the strengths ofrobust illumination normalization, local texture-based face representa-tions, distance transform based matching and kernel-based featureextraction and multiple feature fusion, but the solution addressed onlyillumination issues. To address issues of noise in facial recognition, Ref.[23] employed shearlets and LBP for dealing with heavy noise in facerecognition, by taking advantage of robust features and edge detectioncapabilities of shearlets in the presence of high level of noise. In thismethod, each face is divided into blocks, individual classi ﬁer is used for each block and then combine the similarity scores from all the blocks forbetter performance, but the solution is limited to noise only.Recently, different methods, techniques and algorithms were com-bined with either the traditional LBP or modi ﬁed LBP to achieve facial recognition and enhance facial recognition accuracy. In Ref. [ 24]a Real-Time Multiple Face Recognition using Deep Learning on EmbeddedGPU System was proposed and the method used face detection based onconvolutional neural network (CNN) with face tracking and state of theart deep CNN face recognition algorithm.In addition, in Ref. [25] a Local Binary Pattern Histogram(LBPH)-based Enhanced Real-Time Face Recognition was used to achievereal-time face recognition in low and high-level images and Ref. [ 26] proposes a method of Improving the Recognition of Faces using LBP andSVM Optimized by PSO Technique, in this method, two feature extrac-tion algorithms namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and LocalBinary Pattern (LBP) techniques are used to extract features from images.In the recognition process, it uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) forclassiﬁcation combined with Particle Swarm Optimization.In another approach in Ref. [27], facial recognition was achievedusing Modiﬁed Local Binary Pattern and Random Forest, which the signand magnitude features are combined for the improvement of facialtexture classiﬁcation performance and when compared with the tradi-tional LBP for multiple patch variations on a challenging facial dataset,this method proven to be more accurate.All these techniques, methods, algorithms reviewed does not whollyaddresses issues affecting facial recognition accuracy such as illumina-tion variation, noise, scale, sharp, pose in one shot, while our method wasable to do that and also our method focuses on enhancing features of
input and training images, thus improved LBP codes and achieved betterrecognition results.3. Improved LBP algorithmIn our work, we acknowledge the fact that capability of the LBP facerecognition algorithm highly depends on the accuracy performance offeature extraction and comparison stage, which also highly depends onthe quality of both the input face images and the training/referenceimages participating in the face comparison process. In order to improvethe face recognition accuracy of the LBP algorithm, we exploited thefollowing image quality properties of our input and reference face im-ages: illumination, sharp, noise, resolution, scale and pose, so as to obtainthe best quality images that will expose better details of image featuresfor more accurate feature extraction and comparison.3.1. Proposed methodologyOurﬁrst improvement approach is to apply the Contrast Adjustmentmethod on our input face images as deﬁned in equation(1). We tested this method with different values of alpha and beta to select the one thatgives the best detection and recognition accuracy result, which are 1.5(

4(1)–(4) to the original input images, we obtained an improved highquality images using our method, which implies better image quality thatwill expose better image features and enabled more accurate imagehistograms for facial image comparison as shown in section 4,Fig. 3(a) to (d), thus resulted in an improved LBP codes, that will stimulate theoverall face recognition accuracy.4. ExperimentsIn this research paper, we present an effective and ef ﬁcient approach using advanced image processing techniques to improve face recognitionaccuracy based on local binary patterns algorithm. In this section, we ’ll give experiment results from two interconnected parts to demonstrateour method.In theﬁrst part, the LBP cascade classiﬁer is employed for multiple face detection and tracking.ﬁrst, we’ll capture faces from a live digital camera or sourced from a digital image and apply the LBP cascadeclassiﬁer algorithm to detect faces. To improve the accuracy of the LBPface detection algorithm to the level of Haar cascade classi ﬁer face detection algorithm as in Ref. [30] or even better while maintainingspeed, we used image processing techniques de ﬁned in equations (1)–(4).Our experiment result for this part is shown in Figs. 3 and 4and Table 1. Using our approach, we were able to improve the face detectionaccuracy rate, which is an integral part of the overall face recognitionaccuracy rate, while at the same time reducing the number of falsepositives and false negatives.In this experiment, the Haar classiﬁer algorithm is used to detect faces in an image as shown inFig. 4 (a). The Haar classiﬁer algorithm consist of four (4) phases; integral image, Haar-like features. AdaBoost andCascading Classiﬁer, in which the input face images will be representedas integral imagesﬁrst, to compute Haar-like features, for optimizationreason, the AdaBoost will be used for feature selection, then the selectedfeatures will be passed through a cascading classi ﬁer to classify faces in an image.Aside the Haar Classiﬁer algorithm, our proposed improved LBPmethod is also used to detect faces in an image as shown in Fig. 4(b). Comparing the two methods inFig. 4, it is shown that our proposed method outperformed, the Haar Classiﬁer algorithm for Face Detection and also in the number of detected faces, represented as true positive orfalse positive, represented as features that are incorrectly detected asfaces or false negative, represented as faces that are not detected as facesin an image. InTable 1, for face detection, the Haar algorithm, theoriginal LBP and the improved LBP using our method are compared usinga dataset of 226 images, which our method perform better in all cases.4.1. Linear blending of training imagesAfter the face detection process, we ’
ll use the LBP algorithm aided with the advanced image processing techniques de ﬁned from equation (1)through equation(4), to better extract facial features so as to compareand recognize human faces.In the second part, before applying the LBP face recognition algorithmon detected face images, we employed image blending technique on ourtraining images datasets. Image blending is a linear interpolation oftenused to blend two images f
0and f 1as shown inFig. 5, in order to improve the visual quality of images by minimizing intensity variations effects.The linear blending is deﬁned in equation(7), where (
α) and (1- α) areblend fractions used in a weighted average of each component of eachpixel as highlighted in Refs. [31,32].GðxÞ¼ð1/C0αÞf0ðxÞþ αf1ðxÞ (7) In our work, we created three different datasets each containingdifferent orientations and conditions of faces that are con ﬁned to 181/C2 181 pixels:dataset [I], dataset [II],anddataset [III].No image blending was applied in the dataset [I], the linear blending of 1.0 alpha(
α) was applied on dataset [II], and linear blending of 0.5 alpha ( α) was applied on dataset [III]. We tested the improved LBP face recognitionalgorithm on these three datasets and selected the one that gives the bestface recognition accuracy result in our system, which is dataset [III].Prior to conﬁning the training images to 181/C2181 pixels, we empirically tried different pixel values on the training datasets to check whether itwill have any impact on the face recognition accuracy, which it does,although the impact is not that much, but the best result was selected,which is 181/C2181 pixels.We improved the quality of both our input face images and trainingimages, using our proposed methods deﬁned in equations(4) and (5). Now we apply the LBP algorithm aided with our methods to extract moredetailed and visible facial features to increase comparison certainty formore accurate face recognition.InTable 2, we show the performance evaluation of the original LBPalgorithm that was run on our dataset [I], the dataset without any imageprocessing. We used the following metrics in our evaluation: False Neg-atives, Unknown faces, and False Recognition. We calculated the facerecognition rate as follows:Face Recognition Rate¼(Total Number of Faces - a total number of False Recognition)/(Total number of Faces) * 100%.InTable 3, we show the performance evaluation of our improved facerecognition method using equation (3) and (4) that was run on our dataset [III], which was processed using equation (7)with an alpha (
α) value of 0.5. Using the same metrics and face recognition rate formulaabove.Fig. 6below shows the result of recognized faces of three (3)different people.In addition, InTable 4, the face recognition accuracy of our proposedmethod is compared with three (3) other different existing methods in acontrolled environment, respectively.The results inTable 4, shows that our method compared to otherdifferent methods, proves to be very robust to be implemented in acontrolled real-life environment and the novelty of our method iscentered towards the combination of the LBP algorithm with advancedimage processing techniques such as contrast adjustment, bilateral ﬁlter, histogram equalization and image blending for both input images andtraining images, which is more of incremental contribution to the LBPimprovement.5. Attendance systemAfter successfully recognizing human faces, the recognized face im-ages will be fetched into our attendance system to mark attendance ofindividuals.5.1. Attendance databaseIn our attendance database, we will extract each recognized faceimages to mark the attendance of individuals, using date and time educedfrom recognized face images as shown in Table 5.S.M. Bah, F. Ming Array 5 (2020) 100014
55.2. Flowchart of algorithm
Figure shows theﬂowchart of the algorithm. As depicted in the ﬂow- chart, the captured input face images are processed using our proposedimage processing techniques, then the face detection algorithm is appliedto detect faces. Once faces are detected, the face recognition algorithmaided with our proposed method will be applied to recognize faces. Oncefaces are recognized, the metadata of the recognized faces will beextracted to mark attendance using the attendance system.6. ConclusionIn conclusion, in our research, after preprocessing the input faceimages using some advanced image processing techniques such ContrastAdjustment, Bilateral Filter, Histogram Equalization, so as to have betterimage features and the same advanced image processing techniques willbe applied to the training/template face images plus an image blendingmethod to ensure high quality training/template face images. The pre-processed input face image will be divided into k
2regions, then the LBP code will be calculated for every pixel in a region of the input face imageby comparing the center with the surrounding pixel. If the surroundingpixel is greater than or equal to the center pixel, then it is denoted asbinary 1, else it is denoted as 0.This process will be repeated for each and every pixel of all otherregions, to get the binary pattern so as to construct the feature vector ofthe input face images. For every region, a histogram with all possiblelabels is constructed. These constructed histograms with all its binsrepresent a pattern and contain the number of its appearance in the re-gion. The feature vector formed is then constructed by concatenating theregional histograms to one big histogram, which is unique for each in-dividual, and is compared with the template face images to recognizefaces. This method improves the LBP code and our experiment resultsshow that our method is very accurate and robust for facial recognitionsystem that can be implemented in a real-life environment. It is alsoimportant to state that our research does not address the issue of occlu-sion and mask faces in facial recognition, but addressing these issuescould be a perfect future work of this paper.AcknowledgementsWe wish to thank everyone at the Machine Vision and Robotic Lab inChangchun University of Science and Technology for their valuablesupport throughout this research work.
