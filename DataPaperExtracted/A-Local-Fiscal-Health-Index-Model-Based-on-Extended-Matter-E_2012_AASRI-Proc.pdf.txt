Abstract 
Due to the influence of the fiscal crisis, the health of the local finance operation has been paid more and more attention. As a result, this essay puts forward a local fiscal heal th index model according to the problem of the operation of the local fiscal healthy operation. By describing the related concepts and application mechanism of the extenics and matter-element model, the extended matter-element evaluation model will be constructed, which will be used as the evaluation method of local fiscal health index model. With expert investigation and entropy weight method, the essay selects indicators from all kinds of indicator selections which affect the lo cal fiscal health of the operation, establishing the local fiscal health index model, and use the extended matter-element evaluation model to evaluate the local financial. Results demonstrate that the local fiscal health index model, which is based on the extended matter-element evaluation, is a practical model.

1. Introduction As an important part of the national finance, the local finance plays an important role in the rapid and stable development of the country's economy. Local fiscal  health run is influenced by various economic and social factors, therefore, existence of potential risks to the future operation effect. Nowadays, many models or

system can only reflect the past or current local fiscal conditions, which do not reflect the future direction of the local finance. It gets a lot of restrictions in  the practical application. Therefore, the practical local fiscal health index model will analysis and monitor the operation of the local financial accurately, which makes a difference in the stable and rapid development of economy.  At present, with the construction of local fiscal index model, there are many widely applied methods, such as expert research method, data mining and so on. Hana Po lackova (1998) established the famous fiscal risk matrix--Polackova matrix[1], in which proposes the c oncept of direct debt, contingent debt, dominant debt, implicit debt. It is an effective tool to analyze and evaluate the local government debt. Lifeng Liu(2001) adopted some internal factors and external factors indicators to evaluate the sustainability and fiscal risk degree of the national debt policy[2]. However, these indi cators on reflection of fiscal risk is partial and scattered, which have the certain capriciousness. Therefore, combining with the extenics and matter-element evaluation theory, the essay constructs the local fiscal health index model based on extended matter-element evaluation, which provides new basis of monitoring the health of the local finance operation.  2. The local fiscal health index model based on extended matter-element evaluation This essay uses the extended matter-element model to  build the local fiscal health index model. The basic thought is that using the extended matter-element method as a evaluation m odel of local financial health index model, then selecting all the indicators of local fiscal health index model, ensuring the practicability and validity of the model, reducing the complexity of the influence factors in the financial operation process and making the model can monitor the health of the local finance operation through the way of combining the data and the index model. The specific steps of local fi scal health index model based on extended matter-element evaluation are shown in Figure 1.

2.1. The local fiscal indicators at all levels The indicators selection in this article will center on th ree key factors that affect the local financial health operation - income, expenditure and debt. After taking experts investigation, the local financial risk comprehensive evaluation can be made of 14 indicators in all. The details are shown in Figure 2.

2.4. The determination of the weighting coefficients by Entropy Method The information entropy can be used to evaluate the degree of system information order and its utility. the judgment matrix consists of evaluation indicators determine the weighting coefficient of indicators. The calculation procedure is as follows:  (1) Construct judgment matrix R of m things and n evaluation indications:

In the formula: maxx ij is the most satisfied one and minx iis the most unsatisfied one among the different things with the same evaluation indicator.  (3) According to the definition of entropy, the entropy of n evaluation things and m evaluation indicators is as follows:

In the formula: K j (p0) is the comprehensive association degree of matter-element about level j. K j (vi) is the association degree of matter-element about level j. w
i is the weighting coefficient of every evaluation indicators. If K
j (p0) = maxK j (p0), j ƒô (1, 2, 3,..., m), the evaluation indicator v ibelongs to level j. According to the formula (8), K
1 (p0) = 0.513219348, K 2(p0) = 0.309932985, K 3 (p0) = 0.376313759, K 4
(p0) = 0.275210922. Because Max K j (p0) = K 3 (p0) = 0.376313759 belongs to the conservative level, although it don't have much risk, it's still far away from security level, it is necessary to pay more attention to the development of the local fiscal health K
3(p0). 3. Peroration The essay puts forward local fiscal health index model based on extended matter-element evaluation to ensure segment domain and classical domain through of indicators at all levels through the extended matter-element evaluation, calculating the weighting coefficient of indicators at all levels through entropy method, analyzing the association degree and finally arrive at the situation of local finance operation. Experiment shows that the local fiscal health index model constructed by extenics theory can make the complex uncertainty questions be abstracted as formalized model. It has clear concepts, simple calculation and high resolution of evaluation results.
