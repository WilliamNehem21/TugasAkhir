Keywords:Agricultural machinery operationsLower limb exerted forcesInstrumented foot transducerAutonomous data logging and visualizationErgonomics and safetyAgricultural machinery typically requires lower limb actuation forces for operations such as treadling, pedalingand tractor based. However, limited systems exist for assessment of such forces that have ergonomic in ﬂuence. This study, therefore developed and evaluated a single board computer integrated foot transducer (IFT) and au-tonomous data logging and visualization system to monitor dynamic lower limb exerted forces. The system con-sists of custom developed load sensors sandwiched into foot shaped units that ﬁt operator's both feet. Stamped forces at crank angles for operations typical to pedaling while at height (above ground level) for operationrepresenting typical treadling operations were recorded on-board a memory card and displayed on a liquid crys-tal display. Evaluations were conducted by imposing external loads that signi ﬁcantly increased (pb0.05) the foot exerted forces. Force trends were periodic with peaks of 73, 85, 110.5 and 145.4 N for left foot and 41, 50, 131.7and 145.4 N for right foot at loads of 10, 30, 50 and 70 N, respectively during pedaling operations. Similarly, theleft lower actuation limb exerted forces of 139, 249 and 255 N at 5, 10 and 15 N of imposed loads, respectivelyduring treadling operation. System was also evaluated for tractor operations and exerted forces ranged from92 to 164 and 107–176 N for clutch pedal engagement at lower to higher tractor speeds on farm and tarmacadamroads, respectively. Similarly, for brake pedal engagement, such forces ranged from 106 to 173 and 120 –204 N on farm and tarmacadam roads. These forces varied signi ﬁcantly at different forward speeds. Results suggest poten- tial of such system for foot exerted force assessments typical to agricultural machinery systems in real ﬁeld. De- signs may be evaluated or reconsidered to minimize musculoskeletal disorder risks during prolonged operations.Work-rest schedules protocols can be developed by ergonomists for safe, ef ﬁcient and comfortable operations. © 2020 The Authors.

1. IntroductionLower limb forces are critical to operate most agricultural machinerysystems that could be small (stationary or self-propelled) and large sys-tems such as tractors or tractor driven. Small systems are typical to smallscale growers (e.g. in developing countries) such as pedal operatedthreshers and millers, treadle operated pumps, maize shellers etc. Suchsystems either require continuous or periodic actuation forces or forcesfor brake, clutch and foot throttle operations in tractors ( Agrawal et al., 2007).Ergonomics has been concerned about ‘ﬁtting the task to the human’through identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of threats to human health in various work environments and eliminate themthrough user centered product design ( Miles and Steinke, 1993; Agrawal et al., 2007;Chowdhury et al., 2012;Waters, 2012;Patelet al., 2013). For example, foot operated tractor controls signi ﬁcantly contribute to the lower back pain due to lumbar spine ﬂattening and disc pressures (Jafrey and Haslegrave, 1995). Newtonian anthropome- try reveals limitation of lower limb application forces to 30% of the5th percentile strength for agricultural operations and are limited to50% for short durations (up to 5 min) ( Agrawal et al., 2009;Gite et al., 2009;Tiwari et al., 2010;Patel et al., 2014). Moreover, male workers can apply 1.5 times more force and power than females due to a greatermuscle strength, muscleﬁbers and muscle cross section area ( Miller et al., 1993;Agrawal et al., 2009;Gite et al., 2009;Tiwari et al., 2010). On the contrary, female muscles are more fatigue resistant and recoverfaster than male muscles (Fulco et al., 1999;Glenmark et al., 2004). Poor ergonomic designs of agricultural machinery may lead to lower limbmusculoskeletal disorders such as acute trauma and cumulative trauma(Whiting & Zerrnicke, 1998). Acute trauma is a result of occupationalload imposition exceeding the human tolerance limits while repetitionof such imposition causes cumulative trauma ( Carter and Banister, 1994). Similarly, working in a standing posture for a high durationArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 96 –103

journal homepage:http://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/artificial-intelligence-in-agriculture/may cause discomforts and musculoskeletal disorders in the back andfeet (Arcand et al., 2000;Gregory & Callaghan, 2008;Roelen et al., 2008;Tissot et al., 2009) that creates energy substrates, metabolic fa-tigue, tissue strain and deformation due to compression ( Laperriere et al., 2006).Above studies indicate lower limb actuation forces to be critical for ef-ﬁcient agricultural operations. Moreover, estimation of such forces andforce requirements may assist in design reconsideration and ergonomicoptimization of agricultural machinery to improve tolerance limits andminimize health hazards (Mehta et al., 2007;Agrawal et al., 2009). Com- mercial lower limb force assessment units are majorly employed by theautomobile or large-scale manufacturing industries for example; brakingpedal force transducer (Tokyo Measuring Instruments Laboratory Co.,Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), pedal dynamomet er (Professional Calibrated Equip- ment instruments, Southampton, UK), compression force transducer(Wika Instruments, Lawrenceville, GA, USA), pedal force sensor (MonadElectronics). However, such systems are expensive and their applicationby small-scale agricultural machinery related industries is very limited.Custom grade lower limb force transducers have been developed andexperimented but majorly for sports or medical purposes. A force trans-ducer with hall-effect sensor mounted between crank and pedal was de-veloped to measure actuation forces and power employed during bicyclepedaling that reported an accuracy of 97% ( Stapelfeldt et al., 2007). A pedal was instrumented with straingauges to measure actuation forcesand peak torque during cycling (Bini et al., 2013). A piezoresistive dyna- mometer was also developed to estimate pedaling force reporting 99% ofaccuracy (Valencia et al., 2007). These systems are majorly accompaniedwith complex data logging systems in addition to their utility for sportsand medical purposes under controlled laboratory conditions. Any suchsystem has not been developed or experimented for agricultural ma-chinery systems in realﬁeld conditions that offer with minimum datarecording complexities. A study was therefore conducted to develop acustomized instrumented foot transducer (IFT) system integrated to asimpliﬁed data visualization and logging system to evaluate dynamicforces exerted by lower limbs during agricultural machinery operations.Included are also the preliminary eval uations under varied load imposi- tions and under real operating conditions of treadle, pedal and tractoroperations.2. Materials and methods2.1. Foot force transducer and data logging systemAn instrumented foot transducer (IFT) was designed and developed tomeasure forces applied by the lower limbs of an agricultural machineryoperator. The system is a sandwiched structure with plastic foam spongeplaced between two shoes shapedﬂat aluminum plates (Fig. 1a). At two shoe ends, plastic casings were placed ( Fig. 1b) as per the instep length of 95th percentile male agricultural workers (208 mm) with the totallength based on the 95th percentile foot length (269 mm) to accommo-date all the male and female agricultural workers ( Gite et al., 2009). The plastic casings consist of small bevel type spiral iron plate with the endat the geometrical center having a conical hole. A conical pin in the casingcover inserts into this hole (Fig. 1c & d) to induce compressive forceswhen acted upon by an external force on the aluminum plates. To esti-mate these forces, two strain gauges were mounted on each spiral ironplate making it a load sensor. Each load sensor then forms a half bridgeand two load sensors on each sandwic h unit forms a Wheatstone bridge that outputs voltage in proportion to applied force. Pair of Velcro stripswere attached to the aluminum plates for attachment to operator's feet(Fig. 2).

Hota et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 96 –103The output of Wheatstone bridge was connected to the single boardcomputer (Arduino Uno, ATmega328P, Open source community) via anampliﬁer (HX711, Avia Semiconductor, Xiamen, China) to obtain thenet actuation force. This board (Fig. 3) was custom programmed to ac- quire actuation forces values with respect to position (height/angle). Ahall-effect sensor and magnet strips were used to provide the position(or angle) information. A data storage module (SD card, Sparkfun Elec-tronics, Boulder, Colorado) was used to record these forces. These unitswere ensembled in a plastic box mounted with a liquid crystal display(LCD, Winstar Display Co. Ltd. Taiwan, China) to display forces in realtime. This box was also provisioned for attachment to the operator'slower back.2.2. System functionalityPertinent to force assessments during a treadling operation, the hall-effect sensor wasﬁrst mounted on the treadle platform opposite to arigid bar with three magnet cells at three heights (110, 167 and225 mm)ﬁxed along entire stroke of the treadle platform ( Fig. 4a). This arrangement was made in order to record the actuation forceswith respect to the height. Similarly, for the force assessment during apedaling operation, the hall-effect sensor was ﬁxed on a rigid bar against the pedal gear mounted with twelve magnet cells around its cir-cumference (Fig. 4b). This arrangement provides force measurementswith respect to the angle of pedal crank from vertical at a resolution of30°. Here 0° represents left pedal at the extreme top while right pedalat the extreme bottom position. Similarly, 180° from vertical representsleft pedal at the extreme bottom while right pedal at the extreme topposition.The single-board computer was custom programed for different op-erations (treadling, pedaling and tractor) in the Integrated Develop-ment Environment (Arduino IDE v1.8.4, www.arduino.cc) for all autonomous data logging, storage and visualization process. The systemon switching ON (Fig. 5) scans if the operating unit is at the base location(height = 0 cm for treadle and angle = 0° for pedal). Once the operatingunit reaches base location, the actuation force is applied via the instru-mented foot transducer for the continuous treadling and pedaling actu-ation. During the actuation, the hall-effect sensor keeps on scanning forthe magnet cells along the operation stroke. As a magnet cell is detectedby the hall-effect sensor, its position is registered in the single boardcomputer and pertinent actuation forces detected by IFTs at these posi-tions are also recorded. This position stamped force data is then storedon-board the memory card, displayed on the LCD screen and sent via se-rial communication to the receiving computer.2.3. Calibration and preliminary assessmentsThe IFTs were initially calibrated to eliminate any systematic mea-surement errors. Each IFT was imposed over by dead weights from 0 to30 kg incremented by 1 kg. Corresponding output loads were recorded,and calibration curves were obtained ( Fig. 6) that were signiﬁcantly lin- ear (Simple linear regression, F
l, 28 (left) = 3.13 × 1032,Fl, 28 (Right) = 9.77 × 10
31,pb0.05) with determination coefﬁcient (R2) of 0.99. These equations for both IFTs were inserted in the single board programto obtain lower limb exerted forces.IFTs were employed to measure the lower limb actuation forces dur-ing typical pedaling (Fig. 7a), treadling (Fig. 7b) and tractor operations (Fig. 7c) for a random selected human subject. Forces exerted by theright and left lower limbs were recorded with respect to height for trea-dling operation at external imposed loads of 5, 10, and 15 N and with re-spect to crank angle for pedaling operation at loads of 10, 30, 50 and70 N. These loads were suspended through a belt pulley system at theshaft center of the custom treadling and pedaling platform. The operatorused his right foot on the operating treadle while the left foot on theground during the treadling operation. The actuation forces for engage-ment and disengagement of the brake and clutch pedals were measuredduring a tractor hauling operation at three different forward speeds andon two different land surfaces (tarmacadam and farm road).3. Results and discussions3.1. Force measurement during pedaling operationPertinent to a typical pedaling operation the actuation force exertedby the right foot under 10 N of externally applied load ranged from−32 N at the crank angle of 60° to 23 N at the crank angle of 210°.
Fig. 3.Block diagram of the integrated data logging and visualization unit for lower limb exerted forces.98 S. Hota et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 96 –103Similarly, the force exerted by the left foot ranged from−38 N at the crank angle of 240° to 63 N at the crank angle of 30° ( Fig. 8a). At 30 N of external load, right foot exerted pedal force ranged from−16 N at30° crank angle to 42 N at 210° crank angle and that for left foot rangedfrom−23 N at 210° to 84 N at 30° crank angle ( Fig. 8b). With an exter- nal load of 50 N, pedal forces ranged from−23 N at 60° to 63 N at 210° for right foot and−32 N at 240° to 99 N at 30° (Fig. 8c) for left foot. Pedal force with 70 N external load ranged from−40 N at 60° to 82 N at 240° for right foot while for left foot it ranged from−14 N at 210° to 104 N at 30° crank angle (Fig. 8d). It was also observed that for the cy-cles where force exerted by one foot was positive, the force exerted bythe other foot was negative similar to as observed by Bini et al. (2013). This can be attributed to the fact that while one foot appliesforce, the other foot experiences the reaction force to maintain the equi-libria of system forces. At the 0° crank angle, the right crank pedal is atthe extreme bottom position where the force is typically exerted bythe left foot while at the 180°, the left crank pedal is at the extreme bot-tom experiencing the force exerted by the right foot ( Bini et al., 2013). It was also observed that the magnitude of pedal actuation forces also in-creased with the increasing external loads. These pedal actuation forcesfor both right and left foot were signiﬁcantly different under different crank angle (one-way ANOVA, F
1,22(left) = 27.23, F 1,22(right) = 27.58, pb0.05).The force exerted by the foot was also observed with respect to timesince the operation initiation (Fig. 9). During initiation, forces by bothfeet tended to 0 N followed by a peak actuation force at 30° crankangle to overcome the system operational inertia. Exerted forces thentended to be steady with respect to time once a steady operationalspeed was maintained (Balbinot et al., 2014;Quintana-Duque et al., 2015). Trends of pedal actuation forces for both right and left footwere similar with peaks of 73, 85, 110.5, and 145.4 N for left foot and41, 50, 131.7, and 145.4 N for right foot at external loads of 10, 30, 50and 70 N, respectively. Similarly for a 15 s period, mean exerted forcesof 16.1, 30.8, 40.6 and 41.8 N by the left foot and 15.5, 20.3, 37, 38.5 Nby the right foot were observed at external loads of 10, 30, 50 and

Hota et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 96 –10370 N, respectively. These actuation forces by both feet were signi ﬁcantly different under different external loads and increased with the increas-ing loads (one-way ANOVA, F
3,36(left) = 406.11, F 3,36(right) = 478.28, pb0.05).3.2. Force measurement during treadling operationLower limb exerted forces for a typical treadling operation weremeasured at average speed of 60 strokes/min at three different externalloads with height above ground (Fig. 10) and time since operation (Fig. 11). Force trends for two limbs showed periodic increase anddecrease for application by the right foot with peak at 225 mm aboveground and support by left foot. At 5 N of external load, peak forceexerted by the right foot was 128 N and minimum at 110 mm heightabove ground (−212 N). While at 15 N of external load, maximum re-corded force on left IFT was 218 N at 225 mm height from the groundand that by right foot was 159 N and at 10 N was 188 N.Force application peaked at operation initiation to overcome the sys-tem inertia and thereafter a steady state trend followed. Irregular pat-terns between the force trends of the left and right limbs indicate theimpact of dynamic reactions experienced by the operator. Moreover,the negative forces and opposite phase indicate the rising of treadle

Hota et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 96 –103platform majorly by the system gained inertia whereas, the positiveforces indicate that the operator had to apply force to push down thetreadle platform. With respect to time of operation, force exerted bythe actuating lower limb (right) ranged within−228 N to 218 N and the reaction on support limb (left) ranged within−166 to 139 N at 5 N of external applied load. Similarly, at 10 N, the right limb exertedforces ranged from−295 N to 249 N and for left limb it ranged from−195 N to 255 N. At 15 N of external imposed load, right limb exertedforces were recorded in the ranges of−295 to 269 N and that for left limb in ranges of−211 N to 287 N. Mean right limb exerted forces for15 min duration of operation were 87.8 N, 111.7 N and 145.6 N at theexternal loads of 5 N, 10 N and 15 N, respectively. Similarly, left limbsupport forces were 95.2 N, 128.6 N and 175 N at the external loads of5 N, 10 N and 15 N, respectively. It was also observed that maximumforce was exerted at the topmost position whereas, the minimumforce was exerted at the bottommost position of the treadle platform.3.3. Force measurement during tractor operationAverage actuation forces required for tractor clutch and brake pedalengagement are shown inFig. 12. H1, H2 and H3 represent the highrange of forward speeds of the tractor where H3 is the highest and H1is the lowest. Clutch pedal engagement forces ranged from 92 to164 N and 107–176 N for H1–H3 speed ranges on farm and tarmacadam

Hota et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 96 –103roads, respectively. Similarly, for brake pedal engagement, such forcesranged from 106 to 173 N and 120 –204 N on farm and tarmacadam roads. It was apparent that the high actuation forces were exerted forbrake and clutch engagement at high speeds. This can be attributed tothe fact that a high resistive force is required to counter the body athigh momentum. Similarly, a lesser force is required to stop the tractormoving at slower speed. It was also observed that the pedal actuationforces were comparatively higher on tarmacadam surface as comparedto the farm road due to lower friction coefﬁcient of the tarmacadam sur- face. Higher actuation force for brake pedal engagement was observedcompared to the clutch pedal engagement during the tractor operation(Mehta et al., 2007).4. ConclusionCustomized instrumented foot transducers were successfully devel-oped and preliminarily evaluated for measurement of the forces exertedby the lower limbs during typical small to large scale agricultural oper-ations of treadling, pedaling and tractor or any foot operated systems.Custom load sensors based on strain gauges were developed and inte-grated to the single board computer for data logging, on-board storageand visualization in real time. Evaluation of the developed system forpedaling operation indicated peak pedal actuation forces of 73 N,85 N, 110.5 N and 145.4 N for left foot and 41 N, 50 N, 131.7 N and145.4 N for right foot at external loads of 10 N, 30 N, 50 N and 70 N,respectively. Similarly, maximum forces exerted by actuating lowerlimb (right) during treadling operations were 139 N, 249 N and 255 Nfor 5 N, 10 N and 15 N of external loads, respectively. Clutch pedal en-gagement forces ranged from 92 to 164 N and 107 –176 N for lower (H1) to higher tractor speed (H3) ranges on farm and tarmacadamroads, respectively. Similarly, for brake pedal engagement, such forceswere higher than clutch engagement and ranged from 106 to 173 Nand 120–204 N on farm and tarmacadam roads.Major advantages of the system were its operator friendliness andlimited dependencies forﬁeld evaluations. Developed IFT can be usedfor dynamic force assessment at different position, different joint anglesduring adaptation of different working postures, so that the risk assess-ment of the operation can be achieved. Such system may be utilized bythe agricultural machinery manufacturers for force assessments, designreconsiderations and enhancing any potential safety features to mini-mize the musculoskeletal disorders due to improper design and dimen-sions. Moreover, protocols can be developed by the ergonomists forefﬁcient work-rest schedule pertinent to any operation. This systemmay also be highly applicable in the developing countries where smallscale growers form the major population and small-scale agriculturalmachinery is representative in the farms.Conﬂict of interestThe authors declare no conﬂict of interest.
