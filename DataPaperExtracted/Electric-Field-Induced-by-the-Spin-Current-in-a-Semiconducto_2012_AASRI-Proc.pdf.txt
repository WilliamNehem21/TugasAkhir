Abstract 
Using a new spin current definition the spin current and sp in-current-induced electric field in a weak semiconductor Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling nanowire (quantum wire) have been investigated theoretically. It is found that two nonzero linear spin current density elements take on oscillation p eaks at the center of nanowire and their strengths can be changed by the number of propagation modes and Dresselhaus constant, respectively. Moreover, the spin-current-induced electric field has been calculated and its strength is  measurable with todayâ€™s technology which can  be used to spin current detection. Our consequences also show that the strengths of spin current and spin-current-induced electric field for the Dresselhaus case are smaller than that for the Rashba case.

1. Introduction The intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect in se miconductors has attracted intensive attentions for its important role in semiconductor spintronics.[1, 2] Ther e are two types of intrinsic SOC in semiconductor heterojunction two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), namely Rashba SOC (RSOC) and Dresselhaus SOC (DSOC).[3, 4] In the situation of SOC, a moving spin is under an equivalent magn etic field with its strength depending on momentum of the particle. Similar to a sy stem with an external magnetic field, it is natural to ask whether a persistent current exists in a SOC system.

 Spin current in the ballistic systems has been investigated in several years.[4-12] However, there still exists a lot of debates over the correct definition of spin current.[4, 6, 9, 10] Rashba first suggested that the conventional definition I
S=Re< <s vË† Ë† should be modified to eliminate the nonzero spin current.[4] After Rashbaâ€™s work, Sun et al. bring forward a new definition by using the conventional (linear) spin current and a angular spin current describing the spin motion and rotation, and further they also discussed the reasonableness of this definition in details.[5, 7-11] In the following, we will use the definition studying spin current and spin-current-induced electric field in a weak Dresselhaus nanowire (quantum wire), and all nonzero spin current density elements are calculated and demonstrated analytically. 2.

Results and discussion In the following, the numerical examples of nonzero line ar spin current density elements and spin-current- induced electric field will be presented.

-24 A.m2 and the factor g=2. In the situation of hard-wall potential confining, it is assumed that the QW is elongated with a fixed area s=Ld and then the number of propagation modes (that is, the width of QW) will be decreased accordingly.[17] The initial length and width of QW are taken as L
0=300 nm and d 0=240 nm while the incident electron energies E

Figure 2 shows jns,xx and jns,yy, jTs,xx and jTs,yy (summing jns,xx and jns,yy from the 1th to the nth mode, respectively) as a function of no dimension coordinate u=x/d. From the figures one can find 
jns,xx and jns,yy  show equal strengths and more oscillations for the 1th to 4th mode case, as well as when the number of propagation modes increasing, 
jTs,xx and jTs,yy also present more oscillations at the center of QW and their altitudes increase accordingly. It should be noted that 
jTs,xx and jTs,yy (or jns,xx and jns,yy) do not have a inverse symmetry relation and the altitude of 
jTs,xx (or jns,xx) is a little larger than that of jTs,yy (or jns,yy) since two elements are different physical quantities. Furthermore, the nonzero element 
jTs,xx (or jns,xx) is special because it is the spin current density flowing along the confined x  direction with the spin pointing to the transverse x direction. The existence of this element is due to spin  precession in accompany with the electron motion.[7] From Eq.(15) the direction of 
TEK (Ï‰EK=0) can be known in the y-z plane and its strength can be expressed as E
T =2,2,z s y sE E+ . In Fig.3 (a)-(d), the contour patterns of E T for one mode to four modes case are shown as functions of u and z. One can find that E
T mainly distributes at the nearby area of QW along the z direction and the area expands accordingly with the increasing of propagation modes. Furthermore, our results find that the spin-current-induced electric field for the Dresselhaus case is smaller than it for the Rashba case, moreover 224   Xi Fu and Feng Zhong  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  220 â€“ 225 
 one can find when the number of propagation modes increases the strength of E T decrease rapidly indicating that the DSOC has a less influence than the RSOC to the E
T. 
 
Fig. 3: The contour patterns of ET for different modes case as functions of 
u and z. Fig. 4: The plots of jTs,xx,  jTs,yy and ET for different Dresselhaus constant case with three modes in the QW. 
In Fig.4 the influences of Dresselhaus constant Î² D on jTs,xx, jTs,yy and E T for three modes case are demonstrated. It should be pointed out that in some 2DEG systems, the DSOC can lead to linear k-splitting and its strength increases with the decrease of thickne ss,[18] therefore, it would become comparable with the RSOC.[19] From the figures whenÎ²
D increases from 1.0h10-12 eVm to 2.0h10-12 eVm, the altitudes of jTs,xx, 
jTs,yy and E T increase for twice accordingly and a linear increasing relation withÎ² D exists. Furthermore, from Fig.4 (c) and (d) for the case of Î²
D =2.0h10-12 eVm (dashed line), E T can reach ~10-5 V/m which is as much as that of mesoscopic semiconducting ring in Ref.10. Moreover, in Fig.4 (c) the electric potential difference between two points (60 nm, 200 nm, 2 nm) and (60 nm, 200 nm, 50 nm) forÎ²
D =2.0h10-12 eVm can be calculated as about 0.289 nV which is also smaller than it for the RSOC case. However, this potential value is still measurable with todayâ€™s technology [20] indicating that the spin-current-induced electric field can be detected which provide a way of spin current detection for the DSOC instance. 4. Conclusion In this paper, we have studied the spin current an d spin-current-induced electric field in a Dresselhaus nanowire (quantum wire). Using the electron wave-func tions and definition of spin current, the linear and angular spin current densities and its induced electric field s have been calculated. It is found that two nonzero linear spin current density elements have peaks at the center of nanowire and their strengths can be changed by the number of propagation modes and Dresselhaus co nstant. Moreover, for the Dresselhaus QW instance the spin-current-induced electric field can also be detected which makes a way of spin current detection.
