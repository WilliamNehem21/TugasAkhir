Food is considered  as a basic need of human being which can be satisﬁed  through  farming.  Agriculture  not only 
fulﬁlls humans’  basic needs, but also considered  as source of employment  worldwide.  Agriculture  is considered  as 
a backbone  of economy  and source of employment  in the developing  countries  like India. Agriculture  contributes  
15.4% in the GDP of India. Agriculture  activities  are broadly categorized  into three major areas: pre-harvesting,  
harvesting  and post harvesting.  Advancement  in area of machine  learning  has helped improving  gains in agricul- 
ture. Machine  learning  is the current technology  which is beneﬁting  farmers to minimize  the losses in the farming 
by providing  rich recommendations  and insights about the crops. This paper presents  an extensive  survey of lat- 
est machine  learning  application  in agriculture  to alleviate  the problems  in the three areas of pre-harvesting,  
harvesting  and post-harvesting.  Application  of machine  learning  in agriculture  allows more eﬃcient  and precise 
farming with less human manpower  with high quality production.  
1. Introduction  
Agriculture  is considered  an important  pillar of the world’s  econ- 
omy and also satisﬁes  one of the basic need of human being i.e. food. 
In most of the countries  it is considered  the major source of employ-  
ment. Many countries  like India still use the traditional  way of farming,  
farmers  are reluctant  to use advanced  technologies  while farming  be- 
cause of either the lack of knowledge,  heavy cost or because  they are 
unaware  about the advantages  of these technologies.  Lack of knowl- 
edge of soil types, yields, crops, weather,  and improper  use of pesti- 
cides, problems  in irrigation,  erroneous  harvesting  and lack of informa-  
tion about market trend led to the loss of farmers  or adds to additional  
cost. Lack of knowledge  in each stage of agriculture  leads to new prob- 
lems or increases  the old problems  and add the cost to farming.  Growth  
in the population  day by day also increases  the pressure  on the agri- 
culture sector. Overall  losses in the agriculture  processes  starting  from 
crop selection  to selling of products  are very high. As per the famous  
saying “Information  is the Power ”, keeping  track of information  about 
the crops, environment,  and market,  may help farmers  to take better 
decisions  and alleviate  problems  related to agriculture.  Technologies  
like blockchain,  IoT, machine  learning,  deep learning,  cloud comput-  
ing, edge computing  can be used to get information  and process  it. Ap- 
plications  of computer  vision, machine  learning,  IoT will help to raise 
the production,  improves  the quality,  and ultimately  increase  the prof- 
itability  of the farmers  and associated  domains.  The Precision  learning  in

E-mail address: kailas.patil@vupune.ac.in  (K. Patil). the ﬁeld of agriculture  is very important  to improve  the overall yield of 
harvesting.  
Blockchain  technology,  cloud computing,  internet  of things (IoT), 
machine  learning  (ML) and deep learning  (DL) are the latest emerging  
trends in the computer  ﬁeld. It has been already  used in diﬀerent  do- 
mains like healthcare,  cybercrime,  biochemistry,  robotics,  metrology,  
banking,  medicine,  food etc. to solve the complex  problems  by the re- 
searchers.  Many applications  of machine  learning,  IoT in diﬀerent  do- 
mains are presented  [1–5] . Deep learning  algorithms  are making  ma- 
chine learning  more powerful  and accurate.  By using automated  ma- 
chine learning  (AutoML)  one can cut the demand  of ML experts,  auto- 
mate the ML pipeline  with more accuracy.  
While performing  agriculture  tasks the steps as below is generally  
followed  by farmers.  
Step 1: Selection  of Crop 
Step 2: Land Preparation  
Step 3: Seed Sowing  
Step 4: Irrigation  & fertilizing  
Step 5: Crop Maintenance  [use of pesticides,  crop pruning  etc.] 
Step 6: Harvesting  
Step 7: Post-Harvesting  activities  
As per the above algorithm,  the agriculture  related tasks are catego-  
rized in the for major sub areas. Fig. 1 shows these four sub-domains  of 
agriculture  tasks.

2 Harvesting  Fruit/crop  size, skin color, ﬁrmness,  taste, quality, maturity stage, market window, fruit detection  and classiﬁcation.  [7] 
3 Post-harvesting  Factors aﬀecting the fruit shelf-life such as temperature,  humidity,  gasses used in fruit containers,  usage of chemicals  in 
postharvest  and fruit handling processes  to retain the quality, fruit grading as per quality. [7] 
During pre-harvesting  tasks farmers  focuses  on selection  of crops, 
land preparation,  seed sowing,  irrigation,  and crop maintenance  which 
includes  use pesticides,  pruning  etc. In yield estimation  the farmers  do 
the activities  like yield mapping  and counting  the number  of fruits so 
that they can predict the production  and make the necessary  arrange-  
ments required  at the time of harvesting  or post-harvesting.  While har- 
vesting  farmers  are focused  on maturity  of crops or fruits market need 
quality.  Whereas  in post-harvesting  farmers  are focused  on post-harvest  
storage  and processing  systems.  Fig. 2 shows the important  factors that 
should be considered  in each stage of farming.  Table 1 summarizes  few 
works in each stage of agriculture  tasks. 
The major branches  of the agriculture  are Agronomy,  Horticulture,  
Forestry,  Livestock,  Fisheries,  Agriculture  Engineering  and Economics.  
The scope of the paper is conﬁned  to use of machine  learning  in agri- 
culture,  speciﬁcally  on fruits. 
In the following  sections,  the review of the most recent techniques  
of machine  vision systems  used for classiﬁcation  and object detection  in each stage of farming  is presented.  Section  2 explains  the use of ML in the 
pre-harvesting  stage. In Section  3 , usage of ML in the stage of harvesting  
is explained  and in Section  4 usage of ML in the post-harvesting  stage is 
explained.  Sections  5 and 6 focuses  on discussion  and challenges  in use 
of the Artiﬁcial  Intelligence  (AI), ML, and DL. 
2. Pre-harvesting  
Pre-harvesting  parameters  play a key role in overall growth  of 
crop/fruits.  In pre-harvesting  machine  learning  is used to capture  
the parameters  of soil, seeds quality,  fertilizer  application,  prun- 
ing, genetic  and environmental  conditions  and irrigation.  Focus- 
ing on each component  it is important  to minimize  the overall 
losses in production.  Here few important  components  in the pre- 
harvesting  are considered  and how neural networks  and machine  
learning  are used to capture  the parameters  of each component.

2.1. Soil 
Liakos, et al. [8] and Sharma,  et al. [9] presented  a soil manage-  
ment survey with the application  of ML techniques  for prediction  or 
identiﬁcation  of soil properties  (estimation  of soil temperature,  soil dry- 
ing, and moisture  content).  The categorization  and estimation  of the 
soil attributes  help farmers  in minimizing  extra cost on fertilizers,  cut 
the demand  of soil analysis  experts,  increase  proﬁtability,  and improve  
health of soil, whereas  Suchithra  and Pai [10] presented  pH values and 
soil fertility  indices classiﬁcation  and predication  model. Yang, et al. 
[11] observed  that important  indicators  of soil fertility  are pH values and Soil Organic  matter (SOM) and thus the authors  have done prediction  of 
SOM and pH parameters  in paddy soil. Morellos,  et al. [12] has predicted  
organic  carbon (OC), nitrogen  (TN), and moisture  content  (MC) param- 
eters of the soil. The aim of study was to compare  machine  learning  
algorithms  and linear multivariate  algorithms  on basis of their perfor- 
mance of prediction.  As soil moisture  is frequently  associated  with vari- 
ability in yield, Johann,  et al. [13] have estimated  the moisture  content  
of soil using with Auto-regressive  error function  (AREF)  along with ma- 
chine learning  algorithms.  Nahvi, et al. [14] developed  a new model by 
employing  Self-adaptive  evolutionary  (SaE) agent in extreme  machine  
learning  (ELM) architecture.  This new model is used for the assessment

of daily soil temperature  (ST) at 6 diﬀerent  depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50 
and 100 cm. The detail summary  of work done by diﬀerent  authors  on 
soli parameter  is mentioned  in Table 2 . 
2.2. Seeds 
Seed germination  is a vital factor for quality of seed, which is an 
important  determining  factor of yield and quality of production.  Seed 
germination  rate calculation  is still done manually  with the help of 
trained  persons  which is not only a tiresome  process  but also prone 
to error. Thus, various  machine  leaning  and image recognition  tech- 
niques have been proposed  by diﬀerent  authors  to automate  the process  
of seed sorting and calculation.  Various  computer  vision, machine  learn- 
ing techniques,  Convolution  Neural Network  (CNN) methods  have been 
presented  in D. Sivakumar,  et al. [15] , Huang,  et al. [16] , Zhu, et al. 
[17] . Image recognition  technique  for seed sorting with high accuracy  
is developed  by Young, et al. [18] . Ke-ling,  et al. [19] used a multi- 
layer perceptron  neural network  model for improving  the accuracy  of 
the classiﬁcation  method  to separate  pepper seeds of high-quality  from 
low-quality.  Uzal, et al. [20] and Veeramani  et al. [21] used the deep 
neural network  (DNN) model using CNN for the assessment  of the quan- 
tity of seeds per pod in soybean  and for sorting of haploid  seeds on basis 
of shape, phenotypic  expression,  and the embryo  pose. Nkemelu,  et al. 
[22] , built a model using CNN for plant seedlings  classiﬁcation  into 12 
species.  Medeiros,  et al. [23] assessed  the proﬁciency  of computer  vision 
as an alternative  to routine  vigor tests to expedite  the process  of accurate  
evolution  of seed physiological  potential.  Amiryouseﬁ,  et al. [24] used 
image analysis  technique,  principal  component  analysis  (PCA), to save 
time and cost of placing  seeds in diﬀerent  clusters  by reducing  the fea- 
tures to be considered  for clustering.  Vlasov,  et al. [25] , Kurtulmu  ş , et al. 
[26] used machine  learning  (ML) techniques  for eﬃcient  seed classiﬁca-  
tion. The detail summary  of work done by diﬀerent  authors  is mentioned  
in Table 3 . 
2.3. Pesticides  and disease detection  
In-time  disease  detection  is the most important  task to save crops 
from major loss. Some farmers  regularly  analyze  leaf or branches  of 
tree while growing  and identify  the diseases  or many times to avoid 
the diseases,  they apply the pesticides  on all the crops equally.  Both the 
activities  are based on human experience  which is prone to errors and 
risky. Decision  of which pesticide,  when to apply and where to apply is 
totally dependent  on type of disease,  its stage and aﬀected  area. Appli- 
cation of unnecessary  pesticide  on all the crops may harm crops as well 
as farmer’s  health. Precision  agriculture  helps farmers  for application  of 
the right pesticide  at right time at right place. Many works combined  
pesticides  prediction  with the detection  of disease  on plants. This section 
discusses  bout disease  detection  using machine  learning.  
Alagumariappan,  et al. [27] , developed  a real-time  decision  support  
system integrated  with a camera  sensor module  for plant disease  iden- 
tiﬁcation.  In this work authors  evaluated  the performance  of three ma- 
chine learning  algorithms  namely,  Extreme  Learning  Machine  (ELM) 
and Support  Vector Machine  (SVM) with linear and polynomial  kernels  
and observed  that the performance  of ELM is better when compared  to 
other algorithms.  Savary,  et al. [28] studied  how diseases  cause the crop 
losses and their implications  for global food production  losses and food 
security.  The objective  of this work is to show that crop loss research  is 
vital and should be consider  as full branch of plant science.  
Sujatha,  et al. [29] , compared  the ML algorithms  (SVM, RF, SGD) 
with DL algorithms  (Inception-v3,  VGG-16,  VGG-19)  in terms of citrus 
plant disease  detection  and observed  that DL methods  performed  much 
better. Karada ˘g, et al. [30] studied  detection  of healthy  and fusarium  
diseased  peppers  (capsicum  annuum)  from the reﬂections  obtained  from 
the pepper leaves with the help of spectroradiometer.  Artiﬁcial  Neural 
Networks  (ANN), Naive Bayes (NB) and K-nearest  Neighbor  (KNN) ma- 
chine learning  algorithms  were used for classiﬁcation.  Authors  claimed  that leaf reﬂections  can be used in disease  detection.  Pandya  [31] , pre- 
sented data about diﬀerent  types of pesticides,  their applications  and 
impact on environment.  Arsenovic,  et al. [32] discussed  the shortcom-  
ings of available  DL models used for plant disease  detections.  A novel 
model is built which consist of two-stage  architecture  Disease  Net, for 
classiﬁcation  of plant disease,  which achieved  93.67%  training  accu- 
racy. Barbedo  [33] , explored  the new approach  by using DL to identify  
plant diseases  from individual  lesions and spots instead  of considering  
entire leaf. This approach  helps to detect multiple  diseases  on the same 
leaf with 12% higher accuracy.  Saleem,  et al. [34] , presented  a detail 
review of DL models used to envision  diﬀerent  diseases  of plant. Many 
research  gaps have been enlisted  in the plant disease  detection  and sug- 
gested that advanced  DL algorithms  should be used to increase  the ac- 
curacy.  
Liu, et al. [36] , Kour, et al. [37] studied  the apple leaf diseases  
and apple fruit diseases  respectively.  A CNN model was proposed  to 
classify  apple leaf diseases  into Brown spot, Rust, Mosaic,  and Al- 
ternaria  leaf spot. A new dataset was created  consisting  of 13,689 im- 
ages of diseased  leaves which was used to train the novel architecture  
based on AlexNet  in [34] . For apple disease  detection  and classiﬁcation  
in Kashmir  Valley, another  model called Fuzzy Rule-Based  Approach  
for Disease  Detection  (FRADD)  was proposed  in [35] . Though  the ac- 
curacy of the model is good, it takes into account  only one disease  
known as scab and limited numbers  of fruit types. Xing, et al. [38] pro- 
posed a new model called Weakly  DenseNet-16,  to overcome  the limi- 
tations of pre-trained  models which are trained  on ImageNet  dataset.  A 
dataset consisting  of 17 species of citrus pests and seven types of cit- 
rus diseases  (9051 images of citrus pests and 3510 images of citrus 
diseases)  was created.  Weakly  DenseNet-16  performed  well with the 
accuracy  93.33%  as compared  to MobileNet-v1  (85.04%),  MobileNet-  
v2 (87.82%),  ShuﬄeNet-v1  (83.44%),  ShuﬄeNet-v2  (83.21%),  NIN- 
16 (91.66%),  SENet-16  (88.36%),  and VGG-16  (92.93%).  Doh, et al. 
[39] proposed  a solution  to detect the citrus fruit diseases  using their 
physical  attributes  such as the texture,  color, structure  of holes on the 
fruit and morphology.  The proposed  solution  composed  of K-Means  clus- 
tering technique,  ANN and SVM algorithms.  Results show that the use 
of SVM with ANN helps in increasing  disease  detection  and classiﬁca-  
tion rate. The detailed  summary  of the published  works is presented  in 
Table 4 . 
3. Harvesting  
After taking care of parameters  in pre-harvesting  stage like soil, 
seeds, weeds etc., when the fruits/vegetables  are ready then harvest-  
ing is the most important  stage. The important  parameters  should be 
focused  in this stage are fruit/crop  size, skin color, ﬁrmness,  taste, qual- 
ity, maturity  stage, market window,  fruit detection  and classiﬁcation  for 
harvesting.  Careful  and right harvesting  of fruit is directly  correlated  
with the proﬁt. In the survey,  we observed  that auto-harvesting  robots, 
machine  learning,  deep learning  techniques  are achieving  better results 
and helping  farmers  in reducing  the losses in harvesting  stage. This sec- 
tion presents  the application  of ML, DL algorithms  in the harvesting.  
Hua, et al. [40] presented  a detail survey on automated  fruit harvest-  
ing systems  for sweet pepper,  tomato,  apple and kiwifruit  as an example  
to demonstrate  the recent advances  in intelligent  automatic  harvesting  
robots in horticulture.  The use automatic  robots in ﬁeld helps to increase  
the production,  saves the harvesting  time which ultimately  increase  the 
proﬁts of the farmers.  Kushtrim,  et al. [41] developed  a CNN model 
based on single shot detector  (YOLO)  algorithm  for on-tree fruit detec- 
tion. A dataset consisting  of real and synthetic  images of apple and pear 
trees was created.  For labeling  the images,  open-source  labeling  tool 
called as BBox-Label-Tool  was used. More than 5000 images of pear and 
apple fruits were used while training  the model. Amazon  cloud platform  
was used to train the model. The model achieved  more than 90% accu- 
racy for on-tree fruit detection.  Two deep neural network  models were 
investigated  in the proposed  work, a small CNN model and a VGG-16

ﬁne-tuned  model to classify  the fruits by Hossain,  et al. [42] . The ﬁrst 
model was built with six layers while the second was ﬁne-tuned  visual 
geometry  group-16  pre-trained  DL model. Two datasets  were used to 
evaluate  the performance  of the proposed  models.  Dataset-1  is publicly  
available  and it consists  of 2633 color images whereas  dataset-2  con- 
sists of total 5946 images,  distributed  among 10 classes.  It was claimed  
VGG-16  ﬁne-tuned  model achieved  excellent  accuracy  on both datasets.  
Kirk, et al. [43] studied  on improving  network  performance  on unseen 
data through  a structured  approach  and analysis  of the network  input. 
Instead  of modifying  network  architecture  and increasing  depth of neu- 
ral network,  the fusion of features  was chosen.  Result shows that the 
model complexity  for more accuracy  and generalization  capabilities  can 
be avoided  by using bio-inspired  features.  It is claimed  that for the color 
centric data classes this approach  shows more promising  results with the 
robust DL model in real world. For this the work author created  dataset 
consists  of 6189 images over 2 months,  August and September  2018, 
and manually  annotated  150 of them. Altaheri,  et al. [44] proposed  a 
machine  vision system to categorize  date fruit images according  their 
maturity  stages which help in harvesting  decision.  A dataset of 8072 
images were created  consisting  of ﬁve date types: Naboot  Saif, Kha- 
las, Barhi, Meneiﬁ,  and Sullaj with diﬀerent  pre-maturity  and maturity  
stages. The images were captured  in various  angles, scales, illumination  
conditions,  and there were few occluded  images.  Transfer  learning  from 
two famous  CNN models AlexNet  and VGGNet  were used to build the 
three classiﬁcation  models to classify  date fruit according  to their matu- 
rity stage, type, and whether  they are harvestable  or not. Result shows 
that VGG-16  model outperformed  with the accuracy  of 99.01%  in 20.6 msec. Bauer, et al. [45] developed  a platform  that chains up-to-date  ML 
techniques,  modern  computer  vision, and integrated  software  engineer-  
ing practices  to measure  yield-related  phenotypes  from ultra-large  aerial 
imagery  named as AirSurf.  Author claims that this platform  help to in- 
crease the yield and crop marketability  before the harvest.  Zhang, et al. 
[46] developed  a harvesting  robot for autonomous  harvesting  which 
consists  of low priced gripper  and ML technique  for detection  of cutting-  
point. The purpose  of the study was to develop  an autonomous  harvester  
system which can harvest  any crop with peduncle  rather than damag-  
ing to its ﬂesh. Onishi,  et al. [47] proposed  a new system (robot arm) 
consisting  of Single Shot MultiBox  Detector  (SSD) and stereo camera  for 
autonomous  detection  and harvesting  of fruits. The system was tested 
on apple tee called “Fuji ”. Robot arm detects the harvestable  fruit po- 
sition and harvest  it by twisting  the hand axis. An experimental  result 
shows that system was able to detect 90% fruits and took only 16 s for 
harvesting.  Liu, et al. [48] proposed  a novel pipeline  consisting  of seg- 
mentation,  3D localization  and frame to frame tracking  for accurately  
counting  the fruits from order of images.  This model was evaluated  on 
orange and apple fruits dataset.  Table 5 , presented  the detail summary  
of harvesting  techniques.  
4. Post-harvesting  
Post-harvesting  is last and most crucial area in agriculture  which 
require  more attention.  After successfully  completing  all stages starting  
from yield-estimation  till harvesting,  negligence  in post-harvesting  may 
spoil all the eﬀorts and cause severe loss to farmers.  The subtasks  that

can be consider  in this stage are shelf-life  of fruits and vegetables,  post- 
harvest  grading  and export. Every country  has their own standard  rules 
and regulations  for grading  the fruits [49–51]  . 
In [52] , an information  manual  with directions  for “Post-harvest  
management  of mango for quality and safety assurance  ”was presented.  
This is very insightful  for all the stakeholders  of horticultural  supply 
chain. Study showed  that wrong post-harvest  handling  methods  can af- 
fect the quality and quantity  of fruits which increases  the overall losses. 
31% losses which are identiﬁed  at retail level were caused by decay 
only. The other practices  which add losses are poor harvesting,  careless  
handling,  and improper  packaging  and carriage  conditions.  
The wrong disease  management  during production  causes the de- 
cay at high-level  of pre-harvest  infections.  The decays in the form of 
anthracnose  and stem end rot are very commonly  observed.  A train- 
ing manual  for “handling  fresh fruits, vegetables  and root crops ”f o r 
Grenada  was presented  in [53] , as a part of the “Agricultural  Market-  
ing Improvement  ”Project  TCP/GRN/2901  which was implemented  by 
Grenada  Government  and FAO. The goal of this project was to increase  
the proﬁts for horticulture  products  and root crop growers  through  a 
well-organized  agricultural  marketing  system.  This document  provides  
in detail study about all post-harvest  stages with how to minimize  the 
losses in every stage. Ucat, et al. [54] explored  the use of image pro- 
cessing with deep leaning  algorithm  to classify  Cavendish  banana  as 
per their grades.  Python,  OpenCV  and Tensorﬂow  were used to build 
the model to classify  the bananas  into diﬀerent  categories  such as Class 
A big-hand  or small-hand,  Class B big-hand  or small-hand  and Cluster 
class (part of hand). Result shows that the model achieved  more than 
90% classiﬁcation  accuracy.  Ireri, et al. [55] proposed  a machine  vision 
system for post-harvest  tomato grading.  The system works on RGB im- 
ages given as an input to the system.  Dataset  was created  by manually  
labeling  the tomato images into four categories  according  to their de- 
fect, healthy  and ripeness  parameters.  Four diﬀerent  models were built 
to classify  image into one of the category  according  to the matching  fea- 
tures, total 15 features  were considered  while taking the decision  Result 
shows that RBF-SVM  performed  well as compared  to others for cate- 
gory 1 i.e. healthy  or defected  with 0.9709 detection  accuracy.  Piedad,  
et al. [56] developed  a system for banana  (Musa acuminata  AA Group ’Lakatan’)  classiﬁcation  using ML techniques  based on tier-based.  A non- 
invasive  tier-based  technique  was used in this study. ANN, SVM and RF 
classiﬁers  were used to classify  bananas  into extra class, class I, class 
II and rejected  classes.  Result shows that the random-forest  algorithm  
outperformed  as compared  to others with the 94.2% accuracy.  Lia, et al. 
[57] studied  and compared  two hyper-spectral  imaging  technologies  
namely  long-wave  near infrared  (LW-NIR)  and short-wave  near infrared  
(SW-NIR)  for early identiﬁcation  of Bruise of ‘Pinggu’  peaches.  An im- 
proved watershed  segmentation  algorithm  based on morphological  gra- 
dient reconstruction  and marker  extraction  was developed  and tested 
on multispectral  PC images in this study. Experimental  result shows 
that a proposed  algorithm  accurately  classiﬁed  96.5% of the bruised  and 
97.5% of sound peaches  respectively.  An automated  real–time  grading  
system with quality inspection  for apple fruit was developed  by Sofu, 
et al. [58] . The developed  system comprises  a roller, transporter  and 
class conveyors  joined with an enclosed  cabin with camera,  load cell 
and control panel units. System not only classiﬁes  the apples on the 
basis of color, size and weight parameters  but also identiﬁes  defective  
apples. The proposed  system took only 0.52 s to capture  the apple image 
and process.  Average  15 apples per seconds  were sorted by the system.  
Author claims average  sorting accuracy  between  73 and 96% and the 
system can be used to sort diﬀerent  fruits like orange,  potatoes  and so 
on. A grading  and sorting system based on machine  vision for date fruit 
was developed  by Ohali [59] . The system was able to categorize  the date 
fruit into three classes (grade 1, 2 or 3) from the given RGB image as 
an input. A back-propagation  algorithm  was tested in the study which 
showed  80% accuracy.  Fruits and vegetables  quality depends  on their 
parameters  like shape, size, texture,  color and defects.  Diﬀerent  meth- 
ods needs to apply in order to classify  the fruits and vegetables  accord-  
ing to their quality parameters  like data collection,  pre-processing  of 
data, image segmentation,  feature extraction,  and ﬁnally classiﬁcation.  
Bhargava,  et al. [60] presented  a detail survey to compare  the various  
algorithms  used in every stage of the fruits and vegetables  quality in- 
spection.  Meshram,  et al. [61] proposed  a new framework  called “MNet:  
Merged  Net ”to reduce the fruits misclassiﬁcation  problem.  Author cre- 
ated his own dataset of top Indian fruits consists  of 12,000 images with

5. Discussion  
This paper has extensively  reviewed  the available  literature  on appli- 
cation of machine  learning  and deep learning  in agriculture.  Diﬀerent  
state-of-the-art  machine  learning  and deep learning  models in diﬀer- 
ent stages of agriculture,  including  pre-harvesting,  harvesting  and post- 
harvesting  in diﬀerent  domains  were reviewed.  Deep learning  technol-  
ogy is becoming  mature day-by-day.  This survey shows that use of CNN 
in agriculture  is huge and it is also getting remarkable  results.  By ex- 
ploiting  depth, other structure  and hardware  support,  the learning  ca- 
pacity and accuracy  of the CNN is signiﬁcantly  improved.  Still there 
are challenges  like dataset creation,  time required  for training  and test- 
ing, hardware  support,  deployment  of big models on small devices  like 
boards or android  phones,  user awareness  etc. 
A popular  technique  called “Transfer  Learning  ”is often used to miti- 
gate the problems  of small dataset,  time required  for training  and to im- 
prove the accuracy  of the model. Internet  of Things (IoT) systems  com- 
bined with machine  learning  provides  a beneﬁcial  solution  to improve  
farming  gains. Real time parameters  of the farms are gathered  using IoT, 
and the collected  data is used by machine  learning  algorithms  either to 
predict or for recommendations  to farmers  for improvements  in farm- 
ing. From the survey it is also observed  that Single-Shot  Convolution  Neural YOLO (You only look once) is a state-of-the-art,  real-time  object 
detection  system which must be used for detection  and localization  to 
increase  the classiﬁcation  accuracy.  
Automated  machine  learning  (AutoML)  is the latest approach  which 
can be used to build highly eﬃcient,  more accurate,  high quality ML 
models in a less time [ 62 , 63 ]. AutoML  is used to automate  the entire 
ML pipeline  shown in the Fig. 3 , starting  from data cleaning  to model 
selection  and hyperparameters  tuning.  These are time-consuming  and 
iterative  tasks of machine  learning  model development.  As compared  to 
traditional  ML model development  which is time-consuming,  resource-  
intensive,  need domain  expertize,  AutoML  can accelerate  the complete  
process  to get production-ready  model in less time without  requiring  
domain  expertise.  In depth surveys  on automated  machine  learning  (Au- 
toML) is presented  in [64–69]  . 
6. Challenges  and recommendations  
From this survey one can comprehend  the importance  of machine  
learning  in the agriculture  domain.  In each phase of agriculture  starting  
from pre-harvesting  to post-harvesting,  researchers  have applied  ma- 
chine learning  algorithms  to solve the complex  problems.  Today’s  need 
is to develop  precise and customized  machine  learning  models which 
can perform  fast, automatically  analyze  bigger, more complex  data and 
help to optimize  the agriculture  processes  like classiﬁcation,  recommen-  
dations  or predications.

Fig. 3. Steps of Machine  Learning  used in literature.  
The beneﬁts  of machine  learning  in agriculture  domain  are enor- 
mous. However,  the beneﬁts  come with its challenges.  Few such chal- 
lenges while implementing  machine  learning  algorithms  in agriculture  
domain  are listed as follows:  
1) Data: Data is the most fundamental  requirement  to build the machine  
learning  models.  Many researchers  faced the challenges  regarding  
data like lack of data, unavailability  of data in required  format,  poor 
quality of data, data may contain  extraneous  features  etc. From this 
survey it is observed  that, many researchers  use data source sites like 
Kaggel,  Meandly,  IEEE Dataport  etc. to get the data to build models.  
If the required  data is not available  then researchers  need to build 
their own dataset [70–75]  . 
2) Pre-processing  of the data: As there are lot of problems  associated  
with data, one has to apply the diﬀerent  pre-processing  techniques  
to make the data suitable  for training,  testing,  and validation  testing 
the model. This might be time consuming  process.  
3) Selection  of machine  learning  algorithms:  Wide list of machine  learn- 
ing algorithm  is available  which make it diﬃcult  to ﬁnd out more 
suitable  algorithm  to build the customize  machine  learning  model. 
Many times, it is required  to do random  selection  or after compar-  
ing results of multiple  algorithms  one can come to conclusion  for 
best suitable  algorithm.  This trial-and  error technique  may delay the 
model deployment  process.  
4) Training  and testing of the machine  learning  model: Building  the accu- 
rate model needs huge data for training.  Testing  and validation  are 
also important  to check the accuracy  of the model before its deploy-  
ment. Building  a model from scratch for best desired  and possible  
outcomes  needs long training  and multiple  time testing which are 
very time-consuming  tasks. It needs high conﬁguration  hardware  re- 
sources;  domain  knowledge  programmers,  testing tools etc. Overﬁt-  
ting and underﬁtting  are the common  challenges  faced while build- 
ing the models.  
5) Deployment  of models:  This is the most challenging  phase to bring the 
models in the production  as there is absence  of deployment  skills, 
third party library dependencies,  size of models,  complex  real-world  
scenarios,  deployment  platform  hardware  limitations,  (like android  
phones,  embedded  boards)  etc. 
Some more challenges  are important  to make a note of: 
1) Understanding  the business  need and identiﬁcation  of problem.  
2) Understanding  user and their interaction  with technology  
3) User friendly  application  design. 
4) Performance  of models in the real-word  scenarios.  
5) Power consumption  by model and battery  limitations  to run the 
model on the devices.  6) For computer  vision models camera  conﬁgurations  at user end. 
The applications  of machine  learning  and deep learning  in the ﬁeld 
of agriculture  are huge with many challenges.  After this in-depth  sur- 
vey following  are a few recommendations  to make the implementation  
process  more fast, accurate,  smooth  and deployable.  
1) Focus to build a machine  learning  model to solve speciﬁc  problem  
like classiﬁcation  or recommendation.  
2) For training  the model try to create own dataset and make this avail- 
able to other researchers  through  open platform  like Kaggel,  Me- 
andly, IEEE Dataport  etc. 
3) For testing and validation  of the models use publically  available  
dataset.  
4) To reduce the time required  for training  a model use the “Transfer  
Learning  ”techniques.  
5) AutoML  is the state-of-the-art  approach  which can be used to build 
more accurate,  high quality ML models in a less time. 
6) Deployment  of the model in real-time  application  is recommended  
to help the intended  users in their mundane  work. 
7. Conclusion  
In this paper an in-depth  survey of applications  of machine  learning  
algorithms  in agriculture  domain  is presented.  According  to this review,  
agriculture  activities  are broadly  categorized  into three major areas as 
pre-harvesting,  harvesting  and post harvesting.  Important  parameters  
to be considered  in each stage are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1 . Ma- 
chine learning  algorithms/techniques  used in each stage are reviewed  
and presented  in Tables 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 respectively.  Machine  learning  is 
the state-of-art  technology  which is used to solve complex  problem  in 
the agriculture  and helping  farmers  to reduce their losses. In this survey 
it is seen that machine  learning  algorithms  have obtained  remarkable  
outcomes  to solve agriculture  related problems.  
Our study indicated  that there is need to follow the machine  learning  
pipeline  with standard  experimental  methods.  Researches  should create 
their own dataset and make this available  to others through  diﬀerent  
platforms,  so that others can use it for testing and validation  of their 
own models.  This comprehensive  survey of various  machine  learning  
algorithms  used in diﬀerent  stages of agriculture  will be more helpful 
to other researches  who are working  in this ﬁeld.
