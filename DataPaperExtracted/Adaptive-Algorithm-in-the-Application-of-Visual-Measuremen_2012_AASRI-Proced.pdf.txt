Abstract 
Focus on the problem that noise is existing in the input si gnals and output signals of visual measurement system , if calculate via the classic least mean square algorithm or recursive least square , it would generate the larger errors ; Or calculate directly , the calculation work loading is too complex . So the solution of weight vector could be as the limited best optimization solution of Rayleigh Quotient of augmentation input vector self correlation matrix , take iteration estimation to the augmentation input vector and set up the function relationship between step factor and error ; The simulation analysis experiment results indicate the standard to lerance of proposed adaptive total least squares algorithm is 0.0375mm ; but the one of normal total least squares algorithm is only 0.0598mm . Obviously , the proposed algorithm has more high precision than normal total least squares algori thm , and its structure is simple , the calculation speed is faster .

 1. Introduction In the application of visual measurement system of single camera , the characteristic point is as the target to the measured point . Generally , to achieve the coordinate of measured points via the measurement to the characteristics point . The advanced defined coordinate of the characteristic point is marked as input matrix 
A , the measurement result of the characteristic point is as output matrix b, then the transition matrix x between 
A and bcould be calculated by linear simultaneous equations b x A.During the data processing of visual measurement system of single camera , the least square solution of linear simultaneous equations 
b x A has been the general requirement . But only when th e noise or error of vector b is 0 , the error's sum of squares is minimum , the least squares estimation wo uld be close to the best optimization solution . But the error is existing in vector 
A and b, the least squares estimation is not the best optimization . In this case , the best way is total least squares (TLS)[1-3]. But in mo re cases , the TLS algorithm is batch mode based on direct singular value decomposition , it needs to take singular value decomposition for 
N N matrix , its calculation is too complex and in the case of 
N is too large , it's very difficult to do . Focus on this point , the scientific research workers in domestic and oversea make a lot of research analysis , SUYKENS J. et al., 1999 present Least squares support vector machine classifiers [4]; SANCHEZ A. et al., 1995 presents Robustization of a learning method for RBF net-works [5]; KRUGER U. et al., 2008 present Robust partial least squares regression: part I algorithmic developments [6] . Summary  the above research analysis results , to propose one kind of method which is to achieve step length recursio n formula of TLS algorithm based on the cost function gradient . 2. Normal Total Least Sqares Algorithm For the solution of linear simultaneous equations 
b x A, due to the input matrix Aand the output matrix 
b are get by actual visual measurement system , so the noise interference error is always existing , least squares estimation is not the best optimized in the statistics viewpoint , its covariation would be increased due to noise interference error . Define the disturbance matrix

The experimental results and data analysis In order to validate the performance of the proposed adaptive total least square algorithm , so compare the proposed adaptive total least square algorithm with th e normal total least square algorithm . Apply adaptive total least square algorithm in visual measurement syst em of single camera to calculate the attitude of optical characteristics points . Define the parameters of measuremen t system is as below: the focus of the camera is 12.026mm;The size of the imaging plane is 
mmmm28. 612. 8 ;Locate 5 optical characteristics points in CMM, their coordinates could be measured directly by CMM. And define randomly the position of fifty determinands , use separately the normal total least- squares algorithm and adaptive total least-squares algorithm to calculate the attitude of their optical characteristics points. Then compare the results calculated by every algorithm with the actual coordinate measured by CMM .
