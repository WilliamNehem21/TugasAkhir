Abstract 
In this paper, impulsive Nicholson's  blowflies  model is studied. By using  Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem , we obtain some sufficient conditions for the existence of  positive periodic solution. In addition,  the nonexistence of positive periodic solution is also investigated. Our results extend and improve the previous literatures.

1. Introduction As we know, population dynamics  have received great attention  from  many  authors. In the natural ecological  systems,  there exist a lot of discontinuous, impul sive phenomena, for instance, people release or harvest a species at fixed time, many species are given birth in stantaneously and seasonally, and so on. Introducing the impulsive effect to ecology model can describe the species and  the ecological systems more truly and reasonablly. Impulsive differential equation has become a hot and important study topic[1-3,5,11- 14].

A very basic and important ecological problem in the study of population dynamics concerns the existence of positive periodic solutions. Recently, many authors investigated the existence of positive periodic solution by using  Krasnoselskii cone fixed point theorem  and  Mawhin's coincidence degree theory[9-14].  In this paper,we consider impulsive Nicholson's blowflies model

In [7][8],the oscillation and global attractivity of Nicholson's blowflies model  were studied. The purpose of this  paper is to obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of positive  periodic solutions of system (1.1) by using Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem. Furthermore, we also investigate the nonexistence of positive  periodic solutions of system (1.1).

Remark . In the study of periodic  solution, most of the previous literatures  required that fis superlinear or sublinear. However, in this paper, 
()(, ) ()tuft u b t u eE  ,which is neither superlinear nor sublinear.We obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of positive periodic solution in case that 
fis neither superlinear nor sublinear ,which extend and improve the results of previous literatures.In addition, we also obtain sufficient conditions for the nonexistence of  positive periodic solution.
