Deep learning ABSTRACT  
COVID-19 is a pandemic disease that began to rapidly spread in the US, with the first case detected on January 
19, 2020, in Washington State. March 9, 2020, and then quickly increased with total cases of 25,739 as of April 
20, 2020. Although most people with coronavirus 81%, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), will have little to mild symptoms, others may rely on a ventilator to breathe or not at all. SEIR 
models have broad applicability in predicting the outcome of the population with a variety of diseases. However, 
many researchers use these models without validating the necessary hypotheses. Far too many researchers often 
“overfit ” the data by using too many predictor variables and small sample sizes to create models. Models thus 
developed are unlikely to stand validity check on a separate group of population and regions. The researcher 
remains unaware that overfitting has occurred, without attempting such validation. In the paper, we present a 
combination algorithm that combines similar days features selection based on the region using Xgboost, K- 
Means, and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to construct a prediction model (i.e., K-Means- 
LSTM) for short-term COVID-19 cases forecasting in Louisana state USA. The weighted k-means algorithm based 
on extreme gradient boosting is used to evaluate the similarity between the forecasts and past days. The results 
show that the method with K-Means-LSTM has a higher accuracy with an RMSE of 601.20 whereas the SEIR 
model with an RMSE of 3615.83.   
1.Introduction 
In December 2019, unknown viral pneumonia was identified in 
Wuhan, China [1]. In February 2020, the WHO identified it as a coro-
navirus – and named it COVID-19, which presents as an acute respira -
tory syndrome and a highly communicable disease that is highly 
efficient at the person to person transmission. According to guidance for 
diagnosis and treatments for COVID-19 issued by the World Health 
Organization, COVID-19 was transmitted through respiratory aspirates, 
droplets, contacts, and feces, and aerosols transmission is highly possible 
[2]. Since its initial detection, the COVID-19 has spread rapidly; it has 
been declared a pandemic and has infected over 5.2 million people in 
more than 210 countries [3,4]. Despite measures implemented in China 
during the initial phase of spread, 
Multiple epicenters have emerged across the world, especially in certain European countries and in the United States of America (USA). 
The USA has 1.6 million confirmed cases and 96,662 deaths, the most of 
any country in the world, as of the date _according to the World coro-
navirus update [4]. In the USA, the State of Louisiana has 25,739 
confirmed cases (9th highest State) and 1,540 deaths (8th highest State) 
as of the date [5]. The mean age of those who died in Louisiana was 70 
years, and lots of patients had diabetes 36.65% and cardiovascular 
diseases 20.92% [6]. On March 23, 2020, the Governor of Louisiana 
implemented extraordinary measures to limit the transmission by 
implementing the Stay at Home order that intended to scale back the 
people available in contact with those infected. This decision was made 
in light of a daily rate of infection consistently between 1.5% and 3.5%, 
with an overall average of 2.6% from March 9 until May 13, 2020, and 
the proportion of patients admitted to intensive care units consistently 
between 14 and 16% who were actively infected [7].

2The rapid spread of COVID-19 has highlighted the need to under -
stand how population dynamics interact with pandemics [8]. For 
example, the effects of the virus are more severe in the elderly. Popu -
lation aging is currently more pronounced in wealthier countries, which 
may lessen the impact of this pandemic in lower-income countries with 
weaker health systems and younger age structures. Climate variables 
can also be a direct cause of biological interactions between COVID-19 
and humans. Optimal temperature, humidity, and wind speed are vari-
ables that can determine the survival and transmission of the SARS virus 
[9–11]. Weather changes are very significantly correlated with changes 
in mortality rates due to pneumonia [12]. The extreme weather condi -
tions that accompany long-term climate change may also contribute to 
the spread of the West Nile virus in the United States and Europe [13]. 
Certain climatic conditions can be considered as the top predictors of 
respiratory diseases such as SARS. 
Several statistical and mathematical models, such as the SEIR [14] 
(susceptible, exposed, infected, and resistant) model, have been 
designed to simulate the effect of disease on many levels. In the SEIR 
model, the transmission of disease or the incubation period is incorpo -
rated. The SEIR model is useful for estimating the dynamics of trans -
mission but the model rests on simplifications. These models are usually 
written as ordinary differential equations (ODE) as opposed to more 
comprehensive models of the nonlinear dynamics comprehensively that 
include the time-variant and probabilistic variables into the models. It is 
necessary to define all the parameters for estimation like rate of trans -
mission of disease. The data scarcity renders at an early stage models 
that are unfeasible to predict the trend disseminate. The accuracy of 
forecasting the future cases of COVID-19 can be improved relative to the 
SEIR model can be improved by including these features in a model. 
To overcome limitations of the SEIR model approach and assist 
public health planning and policymaking, we are using deep learning 
models for real-time forecasting of the new and cumulative confirmed 
cases of COVID-19 in total across Louisiana state. Viruses can be trans -
mitted by being influenced by several factors, including climatic con-
ditions (such as temperature and humidity), and population density, 
race, but few models include the effects of climate, population density 
on COVID-19. In this study, we compare the performance of K- Means- 
LSTM models to more traditional compartmental models (SEIR) for 
estimating the spread of an infectious disease outbreak. The deep 
learning model is equipped with individual parish demographics, population density, age, temperature, humidity, average household in-
come per year, and risk of COVID-19 for the parish to understand these 
effects on COVID- 19 transmission and to produce more accurate 
predictions. 
The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the data 
source. Section 3 gives a brief description of the epidemiologic trans -
mission model used for forecasting. Section 4 introduces the proposed 
method —section 5 comparative analysis of different experimental re-
sults. Section 6 is the Discussion and conclusion. 
2.Methods 
2.1. Datasources 
Data on the COVID-19 pandemic is available from the GitHub re-
pository managed by the John Hopkins University was collected for the 
modeling. This is a collection of publicly available data from multiple 
sources, which are processed and delivered by the Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). The 
COVID-19 Data (by John Hopkins University) contains the daily number 
of confirmed deaths and recovered people. The Basic information con-
tains information about the date, country (Reconfirm: country or 
county), and State of the cases. Notice that the data are provided to the 
public strictly for educational and academic research purposes. In this 
study, we are focused on the State of Louisiana State daily figures, and 
the three variables of deaths, confirmed cases, and recoveries. The data 
refer to daily cumulative cases and cover the period from January 22, 
2020, until April 19, 2020. The data are updated daily, and the files used 
in this paper have been downloaded from [15]. 
Demographic data for the State of Louisiana was downloaded [16]. 
The following variables were collected: parish name, parish population, 
parish population density, race (white, African American, Asian, other, 
or unknown), ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic), age by categories, 
average daily temperature, average daily humidity, and the median age 
in the parish. In the analysis, we included only parish demographics 
data, which were reported with the COVID-19 cases repository managed 
by John Hopkins University. 
The weather data is included in this research for the period of 
research were obtained from the [17]. The data consist of temperature 
minimum (•F), temperature maximum (•F), temperature average (•F), 
and humidity (%). 
2.2. Data preparation 
Our analysis is based on the following information:  
≡The daily reported the number of confirmed cases from March 3, 
2020, to May 26, 2020, in Louisiana state parishes.  
≡Demographic information of these Louisiana state parishes. 
≡Temperature and humidity during our study period at these Louisi -
ana state parishes.  
≡We combined all three data into one final dataset. 
2.3. Data analysis 
Pearson correlation test was used to examine the relationship be-
tween weather and daily COVID-19. Table 1 shows that, among four 
weather variables, only temperature average (•F) significantly corre -
lated with COVID-19 (r 0.439; p D.001), with a medium level. 
Temperature minimum, temperature maximum, and humidity were not 
significantly correlated. 
With COVID-19. So we used only Temperature avg •F from an all- 
weather variable for further analysis. Table 1

32.4. SEIR model 
Kermack and McKendrick (1927) first proposed the SEIR type 
epidemiological models for the modeling of infectious disease studies. 
SEIR models people are divided into population four states: susceptible 
(S), exposed/latent (E), infectious (I), and recovered/removed (R) in-
dividuals and models are applied to based on the classification of the 
contamination of individuals involved and shown in Table 2. 
The population size is N where N S E I R. Here, we normalize 
to one, so all results should be interpreted infractions of the relevant 
State S S/N, I I/N, E E/N, and R R/N. The dynamics between the 
four states are described by differential equation (4) – (6), and the 
transfer rates between these four states decide how an epidemic plays 
out over time. Where σ is the incubation rate (the latent rate at which a 
person becomes infectious); γ is the recovery rate (determined by 1/D 
where D is the duration of infection); ξ the rate at which recovered 
people become susceptible (due to low immunity or other health-related 
issues), and β is the infectious rate (the probability of disease- 
transmitting to susceptible persons from an infectious person).

In this model, the R0 value is important. It tells about the conta -
giousness of the disease. 
R0 determines an average of what number of people can be affected 
by a single infected person over time. R 0It depends on the exponential 
rate of growth of the COVID 19 outbreak, as well as additional vari-
ables such as the latent duration (time from infection) and infectious 
duration, all of which can not be determined directly from the results. R0 
can be calculated using the ratio of the transmission rate to the recovery 
rate shown in Equation (5).

In this section, we first present the overview of our proposed deep 
learning architecture and then discuss each component of the fore-
casting framework process is shown in Fig. 1. 2.6. The Overall Procedure 
First, we estimate the probability of COVID-19 from age and race for 
each parish in Louisiana mentioned below. Then, a clustering algorithm 
is applied to the features to find the optimal grouping of time series data 
of COVID-19 confirmed cases and parishes. After clustering, each cluster 
of time series data of COVID-19 confirmed cases and parishes would go 
through a.

2.6.1. Estimating the probability of COVID-19 from age and race 
COVID-19 case rates are available either by age or by race, but not 
for each and race mix. We model the model rate with a logistic to obtain 
these estimates between age brackets (e.g., 10–20, 20–30, …etc.) and 
race (white, African American, Asian, other, or unknown), ethnicity

Current data sources say that probabilities (Aavg) and Pc(Rk) are in-
dependent [20]. To assume a mutual distribution, we assume a linear 
(logistic) relationship between age group, different races: Where δageαi
has a value for each age group and δrace are scalars. The marginal dis-
tributions Pc(Aavg) and Pc(Rk) are reported by Louisiana Facility [21]. We 
assume that these distributions are the same in COVID-19 patients as in 
the general population [21]. 
3.Feature selection 
To improve learning performance and quality extraction features, 
data must be preprocessed and more features displayed to promote 
model learning. Feature extraction is used to compress large data sets 
utilizing dimensionality reduction procedure in time series data mining. 
Using feature extraction, computational efficiency can be increased, and 
the use of more sophisticated algorithms is possible. Most methods of extraction of the features are standardized in nature; the features 
extracted are typically based on application. Therefore, one set of fea-
tures that work well on one application may not be relevant to another 
application. The identification feature involves the application of 
Datamining techniques like clustering algorithms to derive usage pat-
terns from the data. Extracting the simplified characteristics of data from 
time series will offer a more significant reduction in dimensionality 
(Features) compared to other approaches. 
This section presents an alternative to conventional feature selection 
by calculating the weights of the feature using the Xgboost algorithm 
and combining the weighted feature using the clustering of the k-means 
algorithm. Three ensemble implementations in common packages such 
as XGBoost [22], scikitlearn [23], and the python package [24] enable a 
user to use clustering and XGBoost to compute a measure of feature 
importance. 
3.1. Feature-weight learning algorithm: extreme gradient boosting 
Xgboost [25] is an improved decision-making algorithm based on the 
gradient boosting tree and can create boosted trees efficiently and run in 
parallel. The core of the algorithm is to optimize the value of the 
objective function. Unlike the use of the feature vectors to calculate the 
similarity between the forecasting and history days, gradient boosting 
constructs the boosted trees to intelligently obtain the feature scores, 
thereby indicating the importance of each feature to the training model. 
The value of a feature depends on how the predictive output changes 
dramatically when replacing such a feature with random noise. With the

7COVID-19 instances, we take multiple features as input for the Xgboost 
algorithm to measure the functional significance. In the Xgboost algo-
rithm ’s training course, we can obtain how each feature contributes to 
the prediction results. COVID-19 cases are sensitive to the Risk of 
COVID-19 of the parish for COVID-19 case forecasting (shown in Fig. 2). 
The essential values of all features that will be used as a priori knowl -
edge of the subsequent clustering algorithm are now extracted from 
them. 
3.2. K-means 
Clustering is the most useful tool for data mining, compression, 
probability density estimation, and many other essential tasks. There are 
many clustering algorithms like K-means, PAM, DBSCAN, many more. 
K-means algorithm is the most used clustering method. J. Macqueen 
originally proposed the K-Means algorithm in 1967 [26]. 
The steps of using clustering for feature selection are presented as 
follows.  
≡The input data is normalized  
≡The forecasting day is selected as the first center D0.  
≡The next center uj is selected, where uj Is the most distant point from 
the cluster centers previously identified { 0, u1, u2, , , ut 1}. Steps 2 
and 3 will be repeated until the centers K are identified.  
≡The weights of the features are calculated by using the algorithm 
Xgboost. After that, the weights are attributed to each feature, 
thereby providing them with different levels of importance. Let wp be 
the weight is associated with the feature p. The norm is presented as 
follows.

a. That data point is allocated to the closest cluster.  
b. Updating the clusters is achieved by recalculating the centroid 
cluster. The algorithm executes (a) and (b) repeatedly until conver -
gence is attained. 
Our proposed method Xgboost-k-means can more easily combine 
features into one cluster than the simple algorithm k-means does. The 
features may then be the input data for subsequent loading to forecast 
the number of cumulative COVID cases. For forecasting the number of 
confirmed, features were extracted from raw data, as mentioned in the 
data source. We extracted 12 features from the data. Deaths, confirmed 
cases, recovered. Parish name, the population of the parish, population 
density of the parish, race (aggregated into white, African. 
American, Asian, other, and unknown), ethnicity (Hispanic or non- 
Hispanic), and median age. Temperature average (•F). 
4.LSTM model 
The LSTM is an improvement on RNN [27]. It contains a processor 
that determines whether the information is useful or not, in which the 
working part is named as a cell. There are three doors in a cell: the input 
layer door, the forget-gate, and the output layer door. Input layer door 
and forget-gate both work on the State of cells. However, the role of the 
input gate is to selectively record new information into the cell state, 
while forget-gate is aimed at selectively forgetting information about 
cell states. The output layer gate acts on the hidden layer to output in-
formation. The structural model is shown in Fig. 3. In this study, the aim 
was to estimate the number of positive COVID-19 cases through time; as 
this is a well-suited task for the LSTM model, we used this model in our 
study. 
The architecture is divided into two parts: 1) Encoder 2) Decoder is 
shown in Fig. 4. The encoder aims to prediction the COVID-19 cases we 
have already known, yet y [M 1] and Y[M] present the COVID-19 cases of the previous day and the features 
of this day, respectively. The decoder generates an output sequence y^ 
{y^
|M|, y^
|M1|,.y^
|M n|} that is the forecast of The COVID-19 cases for the 
next n1 day. All the separate LSTM for each parish forecasts are added 
to get the total number of COVID-19 cases. 
4.1. Parameter setting and training 
Each city in Louisiana was trained using its case data. Because of the 
relatively small dataset, we developed a more straightforward network 
structure to prevent overfitting. The model was optimized using Adam 
optimizer and ran for 500 iterations. Although during optimization, the 
network was validated by predicting active cases, the same network was 
used to predict death, recovery, and the current number of cases. The 
COVID-19 cases from March 9, 2020, until May 19, 2020, were used for 
tests, and rest were used for training. Standard backpropagation is used 
to train the network using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a 
gradient-based technique. We used the Keras [28] library with the 
TensorFlow backend [29] to train the proposed models and parameters 
used in optimum is shown in Table 4. 
5.Result 
We compared our K-means-LSTM prediction results with the results 
of the SEIR model are shown in Fig. 6. To accurately assess the perfor -
mance of the SEIR model, K-means-LSTM and LSTM, Root means square 
error (RMSE) were calculated and shown in Table 5, and their formulae 
presented in Equation (9) using python package [30].

Confirmed Cases: First COVID-19 case was reported in Louisiana on 
March 9, 2020. Reports the growth rate of cases on that specific date 
shown in Fig. 5. There are several dates with outlier growth rates due to 
testing rollouts. Louisiana is leading in the per capita test score relative 
to the rest of the United States. Seventy-five thousand individuals have 
been studied in a population of nearly 4.7 million people. . Every day, 
Louisiana received around 5,600 new tests, with 6.8% of those showing 
positive results. A total of 306 new cases are reported by the State per 
day [31]. 
The K-Means-LSTM model was evaluated for different parishes. The 
proposed K-Means- LSTM can fit the case count by parish well using 
demographics, population density, average age, temperature, humidity, 
average household income per year, and risk of COVID-19 for the parish. 
In general, the model fits well where the case counts (data points) are 
higher than 45, and as data becomes richer, the fit improves 
significantly. 
The comparison has also been made for the confirmed COVID-19 
cases, predicted COVID-19 cases with K-Means-LSTM and SEIR from 
5th to May 13, 2020. Out of 64 parishes, three parishes are selected 
based on data points are shown in Table 5(a)- 5(c) and experimental 
results in RMSE in Table 6. 
6.Discussion 
It takes effective strategies to prevent and control the epidemic 
spread. Estimating the epidemiological pattern of outbreak prevalence is 
critical for the allocation of medical services, 
For controlling manufacturing activities, and even for the country ’s 
national economic growth. Thus, it is essential to create a reliable and 
suitable forecasting model that can help governments as a reference to 
decide on emergency macroeconomic strategies and medical resource 
allocation. SEIR model is one of the most commonly used epidemio -
logical models. 
Although SEIR-based models were widely used to model the COVID- S.R. Vadyala et al.

819 outbreak, they do contain some degree of uncertainty. As an alter-
native to the SEIR model, this research proposed a deep learning model 
(K-Means-LSTM) as a new trend in advancing outbreak modeling. The K- 
Means-LSTM strategy does not predict the infection’s pandemic and 
spread. Instead, it predicts the infected cases time series. The K-Means- 
LSTM is used for this analysis to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak for 
Lousiana. This study suggests K-Means-LSTM as a useful tool for 
modeling the outbreak based on the results reported here and given the 
complex nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and its parish-to-parish 
behavioral variation. Training data is used to train the algorithm and 
ascertain the best set of parameters to be used in K-Means-LSTM. K- 
Means- LSTM has three main advantages. First, the model learns not 
only from the historical COVID- 19 data but also from COVID-19’s 
applied demographic data, weather, and risk for each parish. The 
model’s second advantage is its capacity to be applied at different scales. 
It can currently forecast the spread in a parish and State. Lastly, the 
model can forecast short and long-term forecasts that could be a reliable 
decision-making tool. 
7.Limitation 
In comparison, we note that the width of prediction intervals made 
by K-Means-LSTM decreases on average as more data is used for pre-
dictions. It can partially be attributed to the larger number of cases and 
the longer initial forecast time seen in many parishes. K-Means- LSTM 
outperforms the commonly used SEIR, but more features and input data 
are needed to estimate the trends. Although we have promising results 
for data from Louisiana, these new approaches need to be further 
assessed on other datasets. However, the findings presented are 
encouraging and will inspire the group to adopt these new tools quickly. 
8.Conclusion 
Accurate COVID-19 case forecasting is a significant problem for 
public health authorities to efficiently and timely coordinate patient 
care and other services required to solve the epidemic. In this research, 
we propose a K-Means-LSTM neural network to tackle the issue of 
variance and precision in predicting the number of reported cases in the 
traditional SEIR model. The findings of the study will help policy and 
healthcare efficiently prepare and provide services to handle the situa-
tion in these states over the next few days and weeks, including nurses, 
beds, and intensive care facilities. The data should be updated in real- 
time for more precise comparisons and future perspectives.
