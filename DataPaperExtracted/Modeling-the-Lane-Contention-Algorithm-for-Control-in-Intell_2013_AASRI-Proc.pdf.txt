1. Introduction 
Delegating the responsibility of safe driving on an autonomous vehicle needs the autonomous system to be extremely robust. In an attempt to design a robust guida nce system for the autonomous vehicle we decided to go refer the most complex system designed which is “humans”. In humans we peculiarly observe that there exists an array of senses we possess that provide the required robustness and efficiency in chores that we perform. It clearly displays that in human beings th e various senses we possess precisely complement each other to support a process. Let us take a brief example case shown in figure 1a-b.   
    
Figure 1.a- Human Sensory Perception    Figure 1b- Car Sensory Perception 
Suppose a human has to navigate from a blue room  to a red room in a complex of rooms where the additional information for navigation is that the red roo m is extremely hot while the blue room is cold. As seen the path the human follows to reach the right destination is V-R-N-J-F-B-C-D path where he uses his eyes for identifying the color. Also the temperature incr eases as the human approaches the hotter room. This additional sense increases speed of approach and also facilitates choosing the direction and hence the path for reaching undergoes optimization. This indicates that the navigation efficiency increases as an array(in this case two) of sensors which are eyes and skin are used for color detection and temperature sensing respectively. This can now be equated to autonomous navigation system. Suppose a vehicle needs to navigate for place A to place B. Primarily a GPS will be used for navigation by utilizing its co-ordinate information for path determination and tracking. To complement this navigation process we propose to add the element of pedestrian and lane tracking mechanisms for making naviga tion robust and fast. This is illustrated in figure 1b. 
2. Mathematical Modelling for Lane Contention Using SCILAB It is necessary to do a mathematical modelling for pred icting the controller action based on changing inputs. The Model Predictive Control [1] algorithm is used below to take these into account where the inputs used are acceleration (positive and negative), mass, inertia and steering, peer position of vehicles in the neighbourship set whereas the outputs are the positional co-ordinates of the vehicles. Consider the parameters 
R:No of Measured Process Variable; S: No of Control Ou tputs; P: Prediction Horizon; M: Control Horizon. A: Dynamic Matrix =
; where a 11 = Matrix of Step-Response coefficients and 
45  Mayur Parulekar et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  43 – 49 
u = Vector/Matrix of control Outputs of S variables for the next M sampling instants. In Dynamic Matrix Control which is a subset of Mode l Predictive Control we wish to have Np future outputs match some optimum trajectory by finding the best values of Nc future changes in the manipulated variables. This is same as fitting Np data points with an equation with Nc co-efficients where Np should be greater than Nc, obviously. Suppose there are Np data point s that give the values of measured variable y at Np known values of two variables X1 and X2 shown in ta ble 1 below then we wish to find the values of two parameters M1 and M2 such that the measured variab le y is given by the equation from table 1 and where 
 is the predicted value of y given by 
 = M 1X1 + M 2X2(1) Table 1 DATA POINTS X

 We can apply this to each of the data points as 
i = M 1X1i + M 2X2i (2) The Performance Index is the error in prediction, given by; J = 
2 OR J = 2     (3) Differentiating J w.r.t M
1 and M 2 and setting the derivatives to zero, we get;  
 = 2  =  0         (4) 
 = 2  = 0 OR M 12 + M 2  =   (5) And M
1  + M 22 =        (6) These two equations become: X
TXM = XTY  (7) Where, X = 
              M =              Y =  and M = (X
TX)-1XTY              (8) Suppose our model consists of N
cparameters for N c variables then  
i = m 1x1i + m 2x2i + … + m NcxNci (9) In this case, our parameter vector becomes: m = 
     an N c x 1 vector(10) 46   Mayur Parulekar et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  43 – 49 
Similarly, the coefficient matrix becomes: X = Nc x N p matrix   (11) Now, we may define the Performance Index as: J = 
 + X2           (12) The partial derivative of J with respect to m
k is: 
 = 2 + 2  =  0             (13) For the first parameter m
1, this equation can be written as: m
1  + m 2  + … + m Nc  =     (14) All these equations can be written in the matrix form as: [X
TX +  ] = XTY OR m = [ XTX +  ]-1XTY       (15) 2.1 Step Response Module Suppose 
m1 is the step change in the input at t=0 and y 1 is the response at t=T s Then, At t= 0  
 = 0 At t= T
s   = b 1m1 At t= 2T
s  = b 2m1 + b 1m2 At t= 3T
s  = b 3m1 + b 2m2 + b 1m3 At t= 4T
s  = b 4m1 + b 3m2 + b 2m3 + b 1m4 At t= 5T
s = b 5m1 + b 4m2 + b 3m3 + b 2m4 + b 1m5 Similarly, the output for N
p instants with N c changes in the input variable can be written as shown below 
 This can be written as: 
(16) Where B is N
p x N cis the coefficient matrix;  is N p x 1is the output vector and  is N c x 1 input vector We define a new N
p x N c matrix A as: 
 whose elements are related to those of B as follows: a
ik = b i+1-k with b i = 0 for i  Then, the value of the output can be written as: 
         (17) If there have been N
p changes in the manipulated variable during the previous N p steps and if no other changes were made, the output would change in fu ture because of the old changes in the input. 
         (18) 47  Mayur Parulekar et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  43 – 49 
However, at the current instant, the 0th, we can measure the actual output of the process. If the model were perfect and if there were no disturbances, the actual and predicted values would be equal. The predicted value at the 0
th instant is given by: 
           (19) The difference between 
 and  is added to the predicted value at the ith sampling period so that the response will be improved. 
       (20) 
 The last expression is used in the DMC calculations wh ere the closed loop response will be given by: 
(21) Thus the DMC algorithm finds the best values for the manipulated variables, (AM)
newby minimizing a performance index J. By least squares formulation, we can write: (
m)new=  [ATA + 2I]-1 AT Y We then proceed as follows  1-Calculate the Np values of Yol,i  from the past values of the manipulated variables and the present measured value of the controlled variable Y
m. 2-Calculate the Nc values of the future changes in the manipulated variables from the above equation. 3- Implement the first change 
mi. 4- Measure the controlled variable Y
m at the next instant and repeat  
We can now represent the vehicle modeling equations in state space format based on the Will & Zak Model 
     (22) Based on the above equations we can simulate lane contention for a vehicle using SCILAB  
1 = - xx3 + (Fyf + F yr); 2 = x 3; 3 = (l1Fyf – l 2Fyr); 4 = - xx2 – x 1 (23) Where, 
 = Steering angle of front wheel; = Heading angle; F yf/r = Lateral force on front tire/rear tire; m= mass of vehicle=1280kg, I=2500kg.m
2; I= Moment of Inertia of vehicle = 2500 kg.m2; l1 & l 2 = distance from centre of gravity to front axle & rear axle =1.2m and 1.22m respectively.
 
3. Results on SCILAB and Simulation of System using Java Applets Using the data available and equations from the SAE we demonstrate our system behavior using SCILAB [2] where we train the car to initially understand and create a reference based on step input seen in figure 2. 48   Mayur Parulekar et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  43 – 49 
 Fig.2- x1: velocity in y direction; x2: heading angle 
; x3: yawing velocity; x4: absolute velocity in y-direction 
In figure 3 each car is associated with the following state vectors- position (x, y), velocity (v), acceleration (a), and current lane (l). It will update its informati on based on current speed & heading of its neighbour which will be a random, stochastic and indeterminist fun ction of time and thus do a lane contention.  It will then use this information and based on its own safety  & control calculations make a decision whether to continue in the same lane or undertake an overtaking manoeuvre as shown in 3(a-c) below.

In terms of static obstacle avoidance the system under target can behave as shown in fig.4a below. This is extended for dynamic obstacles using the car where the proc essing is done taking into instant each prediction horizon t and control horizon using a LiDAR[3] and proximity sensors mounted on our test car fitted with LabVIEW [4] and Ackerman steeringshown in fig (4b-c) which does mapping of the target environment to decide the best lane to be in which is reported in our prior work of vehicular localisation [5-6]

4. Conclusions We have introduced our work with stress on need of more sensing requirements for robust autonomous self-driven and self-aware vehicles. With this, we in troduce the concept of lane contention and the need for mathematical modelling based on the reason that software  computation being faster can reduce the constraints on hardware. The modelling is used to train the system  to initially learn the behaviour of the car from prior references and, with change in the dynamics of th e vehicle optimize itself to provide same performance irrespective of hardware weaning thus introducing optimization at run time. We have then validated our work with control of a formation of vehicles using simulati on based on results obtained from Scilab computation. 5. References
