Furthermore, it proposes generalcriteria for evaluating the quality of any website regardless of the type of servicethat it offers. The dimensions of the criteria are content quality, design quality,organization quality, and user-friendly quality. These dimensions together withtheir comprehensive indicators and check list can be used by web designersand developers to create quality websites to improve the electronic service andthen the image of any organization on the Internet.

driving the global economics but also transforming societies into knowledge-basedeconomics all over the world. In the last few years, the Internet has shown a rapidgrowth in terms of commercial trade volume, which led to a new deﬁnition ofalmost all aspects of business. The deployment of recent information and commu-nication technologies enabled ﬁrms to provide higher quality services, lower pricesfor customers, and increase the proﬁt margins for business. Also, the new technol-ogy created new trends in business and produced new era in business, ﬁnance, andeconomics (Sui and Rejeski, 2002; UNCTAD/WTO and JEDCO, 2001 ). The Internet created a new business environment, far different from anythingthat has come before, enabling any company to conduct its entire set of businessprocesses and practices online (Vlosky and Westbrook, 2001). E-business is any business process performed via an Internet-based, computer-mediated network(Moodle et al., 2000). There are many categories of e-business; for example Busi-ness to Business (B2B), Business to Consumer (B2C), Consumer to Business(C2B), and Consumer to Consumer (C2C). E-business and e-commerce tend tobe used interchangeably leading to policy incoherence.Recently, we have seen a proliferation of electronic websites with a tremendousamount of information either with high quality, or with low quality, as well as sitesthat are outright misleading (Fogg et al., 2001; Heimlich, 1999). The number of websites grew from 17 million in the middle of 2000 to 65 million in the middleof 2005 (Pew Internet and American Life Project, 2006). The explosion of the web has determined the need of measurement criteria to evaluate the aspects re-lated to the quality in use, such as usability and accessibility of a web application.The objective is to make a website useful, proﬁtable, user linking, and accessible(Signore, 2005). Awareness of quality issues has recently affected every industrialsector (Mich et al., 2003). An organization with a website that is difﬁcult to useand interact with gives a poor image on the Internet and weakens an organiza-tion’s position. Therefore, it is important for any organization to have the abilityto make an assessment of the quality of their e-commerce service, in order to im-prove their offerings over time and benchmark against competitors and the bestpractices in any industry (Barnes and Vidgen, 2002).In the last decade, numerous studies have focused on the designs of websites forgeneral information seeking purposes and for electronic commerce purposes(Zhang and Dran, 2001). The design and commercial development of websitesare very critical to e-commerce success (Barnes and Vidgen, 2002). Numerous practitioner reports and reviews have been published seeking to identify the goodand bad features of websites. Site reviews range from theoretical and scientiﬁcopinions to surveys of successful sites and features to existing successful e-busi-ness. Although, there has been a signiﬁcant research on supporting electronic com-merce, most of the existing empirical research focusing on success factors ofwebsites is mainly exploratory in nature (Liu and Arnett, 2000). Up to our knowl- edge, there is no standard framework or benchmark deﬁning website effectiveness(Basu, 2002).12 L. Hasan, E. AbuelrubThis paper reviewed the most recent evaluation criteria methods which wereused in different websites, and proposes a general comprehensive framework forevaluating the quality of any web service regardless of the type of service that itoffers. The remaining of the paper is as follows. Section 2 gives a brief reviewof the previous work. Section 3 discusses and analyzes the proposed framework.Section 4 deﬁnes the dimensions of the proposed framework and its indicators.Section 5 concludes the paper and suggests some future work.2. Previous workAs the dependency on web services increases, the need to assess characteristicswith website quality and success increases. Websites characteristics are important;they have been a constant concern of research in different domains and they werewidely studied in the e-commerce literature (Hasan and Abuelrub, 2006). Although there has been a signiﬁcant research on supporting e-commerce, manyexisting empirical studies focusing on the quality of websites is mainly exploratoryin nature. Most of the current studies are either dealing with a limited number ofquality factors or directed toward a speciﬁc web service. Thus, while there shouldbe a considerable number and variety of factors associated with web site success,little research exists about the combination of these factors and services. Recently,research and studies are accumulating including different models and/or frame-works to evaluate the quality and performance of websites. We categorized theprevious studies that investigated the quality dimensions of websites accordingto the type of service that the website offers; for example business and commercial,educational, banking, governmental, and others. This section brieﬂy reviews theprevious studies according to the website service.Business and commercial websites were studied from different perspectives.Some researchers investigated website features or factors that are critical to e-busi-ness success, in which they called them critical success factors ( Delone and Mclean, 2004; Lin and Joyce, 2004; Liu and Arnett, 2000; Madeja and Schoder,2003; Molla and Licker, 2001). Other researchers address key issues, ideas andstrategies to be considered in the management of online business from customersatisfaction perspective, and they assess whether a website has been built with acustomer’s goals in mind (Chanaron, 2005; Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Srivihok,2000; Webpartner, 2005; Zhang and Dran, 2001). Another group of researchersinvestigated the perspective of web designers in order to elicit factors that theyconsider important when designing or developing effective websites ( Chanaron, 2005; Tan and Tung, 2003). Other researchers developed generic tools or measure-ment frameworks for the assessment of website quality ( Barnes and Vidgen, 2001, 2002; Fitzpatrick, 2000; Gledec, 2005; Lin et al., 2004; Mich et al., 2003; Signore,2005). Some researchers concentrated on some important features; they either pro-posed a framework to measure the important features of the website or usedprevious models to ﬁnd out to which extent e-business websites incorporate theseAssessing the quality of web sites 13important features. (Basu, 2002), (Lim, 2002), and (Singh and Fisher, 1999) con- centrated in their studies on website usability, (Heimlich and Wang, 1999) pro- posed key issues of website’s structure, while (Cao and Zhang, 2002) examined factors that affect e-commerce website design.Heimlich (1999)discussed content evaluation of websitesHussin et al. (2005)studied the extent in which companiesincorporate ethical and trustworthy elements on their websites, while Fogg et al. (2001)investigated how different elements of websites affect people’s perceptionof credibility.Educational websites were also studied from many different perspectives.Zhang and Dran (2001)developed a theoretical framework for evaluating web-site quality from a user satisfaction perspective. Others concentrated on somespeciﬁc features of websites. For exampleLautenbach et al. (2006)developed a framework to measure usability of websites, while Yoo and Jin (2004)inves- tigated and evaluated the design of university websites. Other researchers, whileassessing the university websites took in consideration other features. Osborne and Rinalducci (2002)designed the criteria to evaluate web resources forutilization within the context of scholarly research within the discipline ofthe art history.Singh and Sook (2002)attempted to ﬁnd solutions to user prob-lems and involved evaluating South African university websites on certainfactors.Banking websites were studied from many different perspectives using differentmodels.Diniz et al. (2005)andZhang and Dran (2001)proposed a model to eval- uate and build digital business environment from the user’s point of view, whileother researchers proposed a speciﬁc framework to evaluate the Internet bankingwebsites and the service quality of Internet banking ( Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Vijayan and Shanmugam, 2003; Wenham and Zaphiris, 2003 ). Other researchers adopted through their studies a number of previous models to evaluateInternet banking websites. For example,Awamleh and Fernandes (2005)used Diniz Model to evaluate websites of foreign and local banks in the United ArabEmirates.Guru et al. (2001)evaluated the web presence of banks in Islamic coun-tries based on a Diniz Model too.Paynter and Chung (2002)examined how New Zealand banks enhanced their retail banking services through the Internet usingHerey’s Model for website evaluation.Governmental websites were studied from different perspectives. Zhang and Dran (2001)developed a theoretical framework for evaluating website qualityfrom a user satisfaction perspective through theoretical and empirical investiga-tions. WhileKrauss (2003)identiﬁed seventeen comprehensive quality dimensionsthat can be used to rate website quality features that are important to e-govern-ment websites, other researchers concentrated on other features. For exampleKokkinaki et al. (2005)presented a framework for evaluating existing e-govern-ment initiatives in Cyprus. It includes content characteristics, design characteris-tics, and common features of e-government websites. Choudrie et al. (2004) described the issues related to the accessibility, quality, and privacy of government14 L. Hasan, E. Abuelrubweb using a common set of performance metrics and web diagnostic tools whichare WebXact, Ntmechanic, and Vizcheck.Ma and Zaphiris (2003)studied the usability and content accessibility of UK e-government websites and investigatedwhether they are ranked high in terms of accessibility. The usability and accessi-bility of ﬁfty selected UK e-government websites were measured using two auto-matic evaluation tools, Bobby and LIFT.Abanumy et al. (2005)investigated the issue that makes a website accessible and explored the importance placed on webaccessibility with respect to e-government websites.Other researchers addressed other kinds of web services from different perspec-tives.Lin and Joyce (2004)studied different e-commerce models of online auctionwebsites. Six critical success factors for a successful online auction website wereidentiﬁed. They include design and content, consumer education, security, cus-tomer support, online community, and market positioning. Barnes and Vidgen (2001)deployed WEBQUAL in the domain of Internet auctions and identiﬁedthree quality dimensions; information, interaction, and site design. Lim (2002) evaluated the impact of four relevant factors to e-shopping; usefulness, ease ofuse, enjoyment, and security. Results showed that perceived ease of use and use-fulness of the e-shopping website have a signiﬁcant direct impact on the successof the site.3. Discussion and analysisThe objective of this research is to develop a theoretical, comprehensive, and mea-surable framework for assessing the quality of websites in order to provide straightforward criteria to encourage improvements of website design and its implemen-tation. Furthermore, we aim to develop a framework that is capable of reliableapplications across a broad range of websites regardless of the service they pro-vide. A multi-phase approach was adopted that included a wide range of literaturereview, review of leading sites, identiﬁcation of success factors from research andindustry literature, comparison of factors with published industry scoring studies,and using our own experience in the ﬁeld. Our process overlaid industry and aca-demic research to identify quality factors in order to meet the objectives of thisresearch.After deep and comprehensive review of different evaluation methods and theirelements that were used in different services over the Internet, we propose4-dimensions criteria which are comprehensive and include all previous dimen-sions and elements, in order to be used as general criteria to evaluate all kindsof websites. The dimensions of the proposed criteria are content quality, design quality, organization quality, and user-friendly quality . In order to investigate how our proposed criteria were used in previous studies, we re-arranged eachelement of each dimension of the previous work to be under one of the fournew dimensions. The result of re-arranging the dimensions of previous work intothe proposed 4-dimensions criteria is shown inFig. 1.Assessing the quality of web sites 15We summarized the common quality dimensions according to the servicethat a website offers. Common dimensions that were used in evaluating e-busi-ness and e-commerce websites were concentrating on currency, accuracy, com-prehensive and value added content, ease of use, reliability, availability of theneeded information, speed of downloading, customization, effective internalsearch, different types of service and support to customers, security and privacyin all types of transactions, logical grouping of website elements, and attractivedesign that will attract the user and encourage him/her to spend more time inthe website (Barnes and Vidgen, 2001, 2002; Basu, 2002; Cao and Zhang, 2002;Delone and Mclean, 2004; Fitzpatrick, 2000; Fogg et al., 2001; Gledec, 2005;Heimlich, 1999; Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Hussin et al., 2005; Lim, 2002;Lin et al., 2004; Lin and Joyce, 2004; Liu and Arnett, 2000; Madeja andSchoder, 2003; Mich et al., 2003; Molla and Licker, 2001; Signore, 2005; Singhand Fisher, 1999; Srivihok, 2000; Tan and Tung, 2003; Webpartner, 2005;Zhang and Dran, 2001).Common dimensions that were used to assess the quality of educational web-sites were concentrated on currency, accuracy and comprehensibility of informa-tion, ease of use, clear layout of websites, and an attractive design ( Lautenbach et al., 2006; Osborne and Rinalducci, 2002; Singh and Sook, 2002; Yoo and Jin,2004; Zhang and Dran, 2001). Common dimensions that were used to assess thequality of banking websites focused on ease of use, customization, internal searchfunction, security of transactions, aesthetic effects, and useful interaction betweenusers and websites in order to get instant feedback from website to user ( Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Awamleh and Fernandes, 2005; Diniz et al., 2005; Guruet al., 2001; Paynter and Chung, 2002; Vijayan and Shanmugam, 2003; Wenhamand Zaphiris, 2003; Zhang and Dran, 2001). Common dimensions that were usedto assess the quality of governmental websites are quick response time, up-to-date,accurate information, effective search tool, easy to understand, and secure trans-actions (Abanumy et al., 2005; Choudrie et al., 2004; Kokkinaki et al., 2005;Krauss, 2003; Ma and Zaphiris, 2003; Zhang and Dran, 2001 ). Common dimen- sions that were used to assess the quality of auctions and e-shopping websites aredesign, content, security, support, and ease of use (Barnes and Vidgen, 2001; Lim,2002; Lin and Joyce, 2004).

The proposed frameworkThe proposed framework attempts to integrate knowledge and experience fromdisparate sources, a range of reference disciplines and empirical practices. Theobjective is to identify measurable features and indicators that currently comprisea successful web site. A set of features are developed that comprise a current rep-resentation of a perfect website. The proposed framework can be used to comparebetween the quality of websites, to identify a path for improvement of a website,and to provide a guideline for designers and developers when creating newwebsites.After we reviewed each evaluation criterion, we added its indicators to the suit-able place of the proposed 4-dimensions criteria, besides adding some indicators inwhich we see them important from our own experience. Our criteria include allmain indicators of the previous studies of evaluating the quality of websites.Fig. 2summarizes the hierarchy of the proposed framework.4.1. Content qualityIt is generally agreed that content quality is an important dimension which dealswith the characteristics of websites’ information.Singh and Sook (2002)called this dimension the king dimension of any website, since it is the major source of valueto customers (Molla and Licker, 2001). This dimension has been addressed by avariety of researchers in different ways. Some researchers studied the content ofwebsites without taking into consideration other dimensions (Granath, 2005;Heimlich, 1999), while others considered content quality or information qualityas one of the basic dimensions of their evaluating models ( Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Barnes and Vidgen, 2001, 2002; Basu, 2002; Delone and Mclean, 2004;Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Lin and Joyce, 2004; Liu and Arnett, 2000; Mich et al.,

The following indicators and check elements, which are summarized in Table 1 are the most important relating to the content quality dimension.1.Timely: The currency of websites’ information and how much it is up-to-date,how frequently the website is updated, and is it clear when the site was updated(Barnes and Vidgen, 2001, 2002; Cao and Zhang, 2002; Choudrie et al., 2004;Fitzpatrick, 2000; Fogg et al., 2001; Granath, 2005;Heimlich, 1999; Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Lautenbach et al., 2006; Liu andArnett, 2000; Madeja and Schoder, 2003; Mendo, 2005; Molla and Licker,2001; Osborne and Rinalducci, 2002; Signore, 2005; Srivihok, 2000; Zhangand Dran, 2001).2.Relevant: The extent to which websites’ information is comprehensive, completeand provide the right level of details (Barnes and Vidgen, 2002; Delone andMclean, 2004; Fitzpatrick, 2000; Gledec, 2005; Granath, 2005;Heimlich, 1999; Mich et al., 2003; Molla and Licker, 2001; Osborne and Rinalducci,2002; Tan and Tung, 2003; Zhang and Dran, 2001 ), informative, meaning, value added according to its audience (Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Webpartner,2005), and ﬁt to users’ need (Cao and Zhang, 2002; Kokkinaki et al., 2005;Krauss, 2003; Mich et al., 2003; Osborne and Rinalducci, 2002; Singh andSook, 2002). So, websites include information about the organization’s objec-tives (Awamleh and Fernandes, 2005; Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Kokkinaki

Design qualityThis dimension concerns with the visual characteristics of websites’ design that at-tract the users and encourage them to stay longer time viewing the website andreenter it. Most previous studies cover this dimension for its importance. All com-panies put a great effort to design their websites in an attractive and innovativeway since poor design can mean that potential readers never see excellent materialas they may become bored, confused, and eventually abort their attempt to viewthe information (Singh and Sook, 2002).Yoo and Jin (2004)explained extensively twelve characteristics that concentrate on website design dimension. Someresearchers consider this dimension as an important dimension in their evaluatingmodel. They called it design, display, or presentation of information ( Barnes and Vidgen, 2001; Heimlich, 1999; Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Kokkinaki et al., 2005;Lin and Joyce, 2004; Signore, 2005; Singh and Sook, 2002; Singh and Fisher, 1999;Tan and Tung, 2003), while others described this dimension as part of the usabilitydimension of their criteria (Barnes and Vidgen, 2002; Basu, 2002; Lautenbachet al., 2006; Ma and Zaphiris, 2003).The following indicators and check elements, which are summarized in Table 2 are the most important relating to the design quality dimension.1.Attractive: The design of the website is innovative (Krauss, 2003) has an aesthetic effect by its graphics and animation (Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Barnes andVidgen, 2001, 2002; Basu, 2002; Cao and Zhang, 2002; Chanaron, 2005; Fogget al., 2001; Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Krauss, 2003;Paynter and Chung, 2002; Singh and Sook, 2002; Tan and Tung, 2003; Wenhamand Zaphiris, 2003). It has an emotional appeal which makes the user happy,pleasant, enjoyable, and cheerful when visiting the website ( Barnes and Vidgen, 2001, 2002; Basu, 2002; Cao and Zhang, 2002; Fitzpatrick, 2000; Krauss, 2003;Lim, 2002; Liu and Arnett, 2000; Singh and Sook, 2002; Zhang and Dran, 2001 ). 2.Appropriateness: The design of the website is appropriate to the type of the web-site (Barnes and Vidgen, 2002). Images used within the pages serve their func-tional purposes (Heimlich, 1999; Osborne and Rinalducci, 2002) Images, colors,20 L. Hasan, E. Abuelruband text are appropriately balanced on each page (Heimlich and Wang, 1999), and a fewer number of screens in each page (Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Yoo andJin, 2004).3.Color: This concerns with the effective use of background and text colors whendesigning the website (Abanumy et al., 2005; Basu, 2002; Chanaron, 2005;Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Lautenbach et al., 2006;Lin and Joyce, 2004; Singh and Sook, 2002; Singh and Fisher, 1999; Tan andTung, 2003). According to background color, light colors are preferred to beused (Wenham and Zaphiris, 2003). Concerning text color, it shouldn’t exceedfour colors within the same page (Yoo and Jin, 2004). 4.Image/Sound/Video: It concerns with the non text elements which are usedwithin the website (Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Basu, 2002; Chanaron,2005; Heimlich, 1999; Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Kokkinaki et al., 2005;Krauss, 2003; Lautenbach et al., 2006; Mich et al., 2003; Osborne andRinalducci, 2002; Paynter and Chung, 2002; Singh and Sook, 2002; Singhand Fisher, 1999; Tan and Tung, 2003). Few number of image/sound/videoshould be used and size of image/sound/video should be small since large sizeof image/sound/video per page will slow downloading the page which is not pre-ferred by users (Signore, 2005; Yoo and Jin, 2004). Alternative text should beused for all non-text elements (Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Ma and Zaphiris,2003; Signore, 2005).5.Text: It concerns with the characteristics of text used within websites’ pages(Basu, 2002; Chanaron, 2005; Lautenbach et al., 2006; Singh and Fisher,1999; Tan and Tung, 2003). There should be consistency in text, pages shoulduse one font size except for titles (Yoo and Jin, 2004). Text font should be cho-sen among the most readable ones (Abanumy et al., 2005; Kokkinaki et al.,2005; Signore, 2005) with relative size (Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Signore,2005). Pages should not use all capital letters unless in titles or headings sincethey are hard to read and are space wasting (Signore, 2005; Yoo and Jin,2004). Pages should use white space or breathing space between page elementsto avoid crowded pages (Lin and Joyce, 2004; Yoo and Jin, 2004).

If pages use scrolling text, it should not hide alarge amount of information (Yoo and Jin, 2004). Pages should show the text ﬁrstthen the image(s) to see text while downloading image(s) ( Yoo and Jin, 2004).4.3. Organization qualityThis dimension concerns with the logical grouping, categorization, or structure ofwebsites’ elements in order to help the user to reach the required informationquickly, navigate easily within the website, feel comfortable within its layout con-sistency, and keep him/her informative that he/she is still in the same website(Abanumy et al., 2005; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Mich et al., 2003; Tan and Tung,2003; Webpartner, 2005).Heimlich and Wang (1999)proposed structure themes that extensively cover most elements of this dimension. Most researchers referredto the elements of organization dimension as part of usability dimension in theirmodels (Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Diniz et al., 2005; Paynter and Chung,2002; Singh and Sook, 2002; Singh and Fisher, 1999; Wenham and Zaphiris,2003), while others referred to the elements of organization dimension as partof other dimensions like information (Achour and Bensedrine, 2005), communica- tion (Hussin et al., 2005), content (Molla and Licker, 2001), or navigation (Basu, 2002; Signore, 2005; Tan and Tung, 2003).The following indicators and check elements, which are summarized in Table 3 are the most important relating to the organization quality dimension.

Hasan, E. Abuelrub1.Index: An index or a link to all the website’s pages is available from the mainpage, so that the user will have an idea about all main categories of the website(Fitzpatrick, 2000; Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Wenham and Zaphiris, 2003 ). 2.Mapping: Adequate website map or navigation bar/menu is available in eachpage to facilitate navigating the website (Achour and Bensedrine, 2005;Chanaron, 2005; Fitzpatrick, 2000; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2004;Paynter and Chung, 2002; Signore, 2005). A user can know the current pagethat he/she is in while browsing from the navigation title ( Chanaron, 2005; Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Ma and Zaphiris, 2003 ). 3.Consistency: A general layout of each page is consistent through the website(Basu, 2002; Diniz et al., 2005; Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Kokkinaki et al.,2005; Lautenbach et al., 2006; Wenham and Zaphiris, 2003 ). 4.Links: Links work properly; it should take the user where he/she is intended togo (Fogg et al., 2001; Granath, 2005;Heimlich, 1999; Hussin et al., 2005;Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Liu and Arnett, 2000; Signore, 2005; Singh and Sook,2002; Singh and Fisher, 1999). Assistant links are available in each page so thatthe user can get back to the main page from every section of the website, thelinks can help the user to return to top of the page within the long pages ofthe website, user can return to the original website when he/she follows externallink of any page (Basu, 2002; Fitzpatrick, 2000; Heimlich and Wang, 1999 ). Worthy links that take user to other related websites are available ( Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Granath, 2006; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Singh and Sook,2002), no dead links (Hussin et al., 2005; Signore, 2005), and the link’s color is changed after the user has visited it (Heimlich and Wang, 1999). 5.Logo: Organization logo is clear and noticeable in every page of the website(Lin et al., 2004).4.4. User-friendly qualityNearly all previous studies included this dimension or at least one of its indicatorsin their criteria model because of its importance. It concerns with many issues thathelp any user regardless of his/her education or experience to ﬁnd the neededinformation within a reasonable time (Lautenbach et al., 2006), the capability of the website to maintain speciﬁc level of performance when used ( Gledec, 2005), and interactivity or connectivity which emphasize the existence of interaction be-tween user and website using different tools.The following indicators and check elements, which are summarized in Table 4 are the most important relating to the design user-friendly dimension.1.Usability: The website is easy to use, understand, operate, ﬁnd information, ornavigate (Abanumy et al., 2005; Awamleh and Fernandes, 2005; Barnes andVidgen, 2001, 2002; Basu, 2002; Chanaron, 2005; Delone and Mclean, 2004;Diniz et al., 2005; Fitzpatrick, 2000; Fogg et al., 2001; Gledec, 2005; Heimlich,Assessing the quality of web sites 231999; Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Krauss, 2003; Lautenbachet al., 2006; Lim, 2002; Lin and Joyce, 2004; Liu and Arnett, 2000; Ma and Zaphiris,2003; Molla and Licker, 2001; Paynter and Chung, 2002; Signore, 2005; Singh andFisher, 1999; Srivihok, 2000; Tan and Tung, 2003; Wenhamand Zaphiris, 2003; Zhang and Dran, 2001). It is easy to ﬁnd the website usingexternal websites (Basu, 2002; Heimlich, 1999; Mich et al., 2003; Srivihok,2000), and it is clear to the user that new information is added to the website.2.Reliability: Website’s address is appropriate and easy to remember ( Fogg et al., 2001; Granath, 2005;Mich et al., 2003; Vijayan and Shanmugam, 2003), short download time (Choudrie et al., 2004; Delone and Mclean, 2004; Fogg et al.,2001; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Mich et al., 2003; Molla and Licker, 2001; Paynterand Chung, 2002; Singh and Sook, 2002; Srivihok, 2000; Tan and Tung, 2003;Webpartner, 2005), multi browser support (Abanumy et al., 2005; Kokkinakiet al., 2005; Ma and Zaphiris, 2003), and work properly using different screensettings. Few ads are in the website’s pages to avoid long time downloading ofwebsite’s pages (Achour and Bensedrine, 2005) and there is a way to measure itsefﬁciency by counting the number of visitors (Basu, 2002; Delone and Mclean,2004). Also, the website is available 7 days/week, 24 h/day ( Abanumy et al., 2005; Awamleh and Fernandes, 2005; Basu, 2002; Delone and Mclean, 2004;Diniz et al., 2005; Fogg et al., 2001; Gledec, 2005; Molla and Licker, 2001;Webpartner, 2005).3.Interactive features: The website has clear instructions to use different parts/sections/forms of it (Vijayan and Shanmugam, 2003). Help function and clearerror messages are available to help users (Achour and Bensedrine, 2005;Granath, 2006; Heimlich, 1999; Lin and Joyce, 2004; Liu and Arnett, 2000;Signore, 2005; Singh and Sook, 2002; Srivihok, 2000; Wenham and Zaphiris,2003). FAQ is available that summarizes frequently asked questions and theiranswers (Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Hussin et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2004;Lin and Joyce, 2004; Molla and Licker, 2001; Paynter and Chung, 2002;Vijayan and Shanmugam, 2003). Effective internal search tool to search thecontent of the website is available(Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Awamlehand Fernandes, 2005; Basu, 2002; Cao and Zhang, 2002; Diniz et al., 2005;Fogg et al., 2001; Guru et al., 2001; Heimlich, 1999; Heimlich and Wang,1999; Hussin et al., 2005; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Krauss, 2003; Lin et al.,2004; Liu and Arnett, 2000; Paynter and Chung, 2002; Yoo and Jin, 2004;Zhang and Dran, 2001). Communication channel and feedback exist betweenuser and website through email, chat rooms, online community, or suggestionform (Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Awamleh and Fernandes, 2005; Barnesand Vidgen, 2002; Basu, 2002; Cao and Zhang, 2002; Delone and Mclean,2004; Diniz et al., 2005; Fitzpatrick, 2000; Fogg et al., 2001; Gledec, 2005;Guru et al., 2001; Heimlich, 1999; Heimlich and Wang, 1999; Hussin et al.,2005; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Krauss, 2003; Lin et al., 2004; Lin and Joyce,2004; Madeja and Schoder, 2003; Mich et al., 2003; Molla and Licker,24 L. Hasan, E. Abuelrub2001; Paynter and Chung, 2002; Singh and Sook, 2002; Vijayan and Shanmu-gam, 2003; Webpartner, 2005). Follow-up service is offered and users cantrack their order easily (Liu and Arnett, 2000).4.Security/Privacy: In order to gain users’ trust, effective mechanisms are used tokeep the transactions secure (Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Awamleh andFernandes, 2005; Barnes and Vidgen, 2001, 2002; Delone and Mclean, 2004;Diniz et al., 2005; Fitzpatrick, 2000; Gledec, 2005 ; Granath, 2005;Hussin et al., 2005; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Krauss, 2003; Lim, 2002; Lin et al., 2004;Lin and Joyce, 2004; Liu and Arnett, 2000; Molla and Licker, 2001; Paynterand Chung, 2002; Singh and Sook, 2002; Zhang and Dran, 2001 ). In order to gain users’ conﬁdence, privacy of personal information is needed so thatinformation cannot be handled or read by unauthorized users ( Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Barnes and Vidgen, 2002; Basu, 2002; Diniz et al., 2005;Granath, 2006; Kokkinaki et al., 2005; Krauss, 2003; Lim, 2002; Lin et al.,2004; Lin and Joyce, 2004; Liu and Arnett, 2000; Molla and Licker, 2001; Paynterand Chung, 2002).5.Customization: The process of tailoring the content of the website according to theneeds and performances of speciﬁc users (Achour and Bensedrine, 2005; Awamlehand Fernandes, 2005; Barnes and Vidgen, 2001, 2002; Basu, 2002; Delone andMclean, 2004; Diniz et al., 2005; Fogg et al., 2001; Guru et al., 2001; Madejaand Schoder, 2003; Mich et al., 2003; Singh and Sook, 2002; Webpartner, 2005 ). 5. Conclusions and future workRecently, the Internet has shown a rapid growth in terms of commercial trade vol-ume which led to a new deﬁnition of almost all aspects of business. The deploy-ment of recent information and communication technologies produced new erain business, ﬁnance, and economics. The Internet created a new business environ-ment far different from anything that has come before. The explosion of the webhas determined the need of measurement criteria to evaluate the aspects related tothe quality of web applications. Awareness of quality issues has affected everyindustrial sector in recent years, since an organization with a website that is difﬁ-cult to use and interact with gives a poor image on the Internet and weakens anorganization’s position. Therefore, it is important for an organization to assessthe quality of its e-commerce service, in order to improve its services over timeand benchmark against competitors and best practices in any industry.This paper reviewed the most recent evaluation methods which were used inevaluating the quality of different websites, and proposes a comprehensive frame-work for assessing the quality of any website regardless of the type of service thatit offers. The dimensions of the framework along with their indicators and checklist are summarized in the Appendix below. Furthermore, our framework is capa-ble of reliable applications across a broad range of websites regardless of the ser-vice they provide. These dimensions with their indicators, after being given certainAssessing the quality of web sites 25weights, could be operationalized and converted into a questionnaire. The ques-tionnaire could be applied to different website domains, such as business, educa-tion, banking, commerce, government, and others. Results from the analysis of thequestionnaire will help in evaluating these dimensions and their indicators andmake the needed update on them.Appendix A
