ABSTRACT
Seismic random noise reduction is an important task in seismic data processing at the Chinese loess plateau area, which bene ﬁts the geologic structure interpretation and further reservoir prediction. The sparse inversion is one of the widely used tools for seismic random noise reduction, which is often solved via th e sparse approximation with a regularization term. The
ℓ1norm and total variation (TV) regularization term are two commonly used regularization terms. However, the ℓ1
norm is only a relaxation of the ℓ0norm, which cannot always provide a sparse result. The TV regularization term may provide unexpected staircase artifacts. To avoid these disadvantages, we proposed a work ﬂow for seismic random noise reduction by using the self-paced learning (SPL) scheme and a sparse representation (i.e. the continuous wavelet transform, CWT) with a mixed norm regularization, which includes the
ℓpnorm and the TV regularization. In the implementation, the SPL, which is inspired by human cognitive learning, is introduced to avoid the bad minima of the non-convex cost function. The SPL can ﬁrst select the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) seismic data and then gradually select the low SNR seismic data into the proposed work ﬂow. Moreover, the generalized Beta wavelet (GBW) is adopted as the basic wavelet of the CWT to better match for seismic wavelets and then obtain a more localized time-frequency (TF) representation. It should be noted t hat the GBW can easily constitute a tight frame, which saves the calculation time. Synthetic and ﬁeld data examples are adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed workﬂow for effectively suppressing seismic random noises and accurately preserving valid seismic re ﬂections.
1. IntroductionThe loess plateau of the Ordos Basin in northwest China is one of themain target regions for oil and gas exploration, especially the shale oil inChina. The topography and landform of the loess plateau are complexand its surface layer contains too thick Quaternary loess, which results inserious noises in the collected 3Dﬁeld data. Several types of incoherence(random) noises have a bad inﬂuence on the successive seismic signalprocessing and interpretation (Gu et al., 2021;Qu et al., 2021;Li et al., 2021). Therefore, how to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of thecollectedﬁeld data is one of the main research contents for the loessplateau area in China.During past decades, many denoising methods have been proposedforﬁltering seismic data, such as the predictive ﬁltering-based methods (Chen and Sacchi, 2017), the mode decomposition-based methods ( Yu and Ma, 2018), the rank reduction-based methods ( Zhang et al., 2020), the sparse transform-based methods ( Wang et al., 2019) and machine learning-based methods (Zhong et al., 2021). Among these, the sparse transform-based methods are proposed to reduce seismic random noisebased on various time-frequency (TF) transforms ( Liu et al., 2016,2019;Xue et al., 2021). For the noisy seismic data, the TF energy of the randomnoises distributes among the whole transform space, while the TF energyof the valid seismic data is often restricted in a small TF space ( Wang and Gao, 2013). In a word, the TF spectrum of the valid seismic data is sparse.Therefore, the sparse inversion with a sparse regularization is widelyused in the sparse transform-based random noise methods ( Yuan et al., 2012). The
ℓ1norm, as one of the commonly utilized sparse regulariza-tion, has been applied in many sparse transforms to reduce seismicrandom noises, containing the wavelet transform ( Wang and Gao, 2013), the curvelet transform (Wang et al., 2010), the synchrosqueezing trans- form (Anvari et al., 2017). However, the
ℓ1norm, which is only a relaxed version of the
ℓ0norm, may underestimate the high-amplitude compo-nents of the sparse results. Meanwhile, it may lead to abnormal resultsdue to the soft-thresholding strategy ( Ding and Selesnick, 2015). To alleviate the above disadvantages, TV regularization is introducedin sparse inversion, which can accurately maintain the structure edges.Ma and Plonka (2007)proposed a curvelet-based denoising method witha projected TV diffusion.Lari and Gholami (2014)proposed a curvelet-TV regularized seismic random noise reduction method, inwhich the Bregman iteration method is introduced to address this

However, the TV regularization, as a piece-wiseregularization, may produce undesirable staircase artifacts ( Ma and Plonka, 2007;Selesnick et al., 2020).Recently, the
ℓpnorm regularizationGonin and Money (2017), which can provide the sparser solution, is widely used in the sparseinversion-based random noise reduction method. However, the
ℓp
norm-based cost function is non-convex and the solution will suffer froma bad minima. To alleviate this problem, curriculum learning (CL), whichis inspired by the humans and animals learning way, is proposed ( Bengio et al., 2009;Kumar et al., 2010). The CL willﬁrst train the easy samples and then select the complex samples into learning. Although the CL canobtain an accurate solution for the non-convex optimization problem, ithas a well-known limitation, which needs prior knowledge to de ﬁne the easy and complex samples. In practice, the de ﬁnitions of easy and com- plex samples are difﬁcult. Self-paced learning (SPL) is present to identifythe easy and complex samples adaptively ( Meng et al., 2017). Self-paced learning canﬁrst select the simple samples into the training scheme andthen automatically learn the complex samples. In every training scheme,the simple and complex samples are determined by the SPL model itself.Thus, the SPL can avoid the bad minima for the above problem andobtain an accurate result.According to the above analysis, we proposed a seismic random noiseattenuation workﬂow based on the SPL and a mixed norm (named SRNA-SPL-MN). The mixed norm, including the TV regularization and the
ℓp
norm, can not only address the main drawbacks of the traditional regu-larization but also generate accurateﬁltered results. The SPL scheme is introduced in this workﬂow to overcome the bad minima for the non-convex optimization problem. In the implementation, The CWT withthe generalized Beta wavelet (GBW), which matches better for differentseismic wavelets, is introduced in this study to generate a localized TFrepresentation (Gao et al., 2006). Moreover, the GBW can constitute atight frame, which beneﬁts from saving the expensive calculation.This paper is organized as follows. Weﬁrst give a brief introduction of sparse theory. Then, we propose a random noise reduction model calledSRNA-SPL-MN and then an effective split Bregman-based optimizationalgorithm is applied to obtain accurateﬁltered results. Next, synthetic and post-stackedﬁeld data examples are used on our proposed work ﬂow, respectively. Finally, the conclusion is given.2. Theory of sparse representationIn this section, weﬁrst review the sparse representation based on theGBW. Then, we describe the theory of the sparsity-based seismic randomnoise reduction method.2.1. The generalized beta waveletIn the past years, although several sparse transforms have beendeveloped, the CWT still has an important impact on seismic data pro-cessing and interpretation (Wang and Gao, 2013). For a given signals(t), the CWTWT(a,b)i sd eﬁned as:WTða;bÞ¼1ﬃﬃﬃapZþ∞/C0∞sðtÞψ*/C18t/C0ba/C19dt¼Z

224For the CWT, selecting an appropriate basic wavelet is a key point,which should match for different seismic wavelets. The CWT with thebest basic wavelet will provide a high localized TF representation. TheMorlet wavelet is commonly used in seismic data processing and inter-pretation, which is given in the frequency domain asΨ

ω) is the Fourier transform of ψ(t).σis the radian frequency.a σ
is a constant to maintain the normalization of the energy. Clearly, theMorlet wavelet is a wavelet with a Gaussian envelope. For a larger
σ(σ> 5.33), the second term of equation (2)can be ignored and the Morlet wavelet can be regarded as an analytic wavelet. However, the Morletwavelet is not entirely analytic and does not match for the real seismicwavelets, which may lead to unsatisfactory TF localization ( Wang and Gao, 2013).To achieve a high TF localization, we utilize the recently proposedGBW as the new mother wavelet in this work. The GBW can achieve anadaptive trade-off between time and frequency localization, which isgiven in the frequency domain(Wang et al., 2017).Ψα;βðωÞ¼Uð ωÞaα;β/C182arctanð ωÞ

Clearly, selecting propera α,βcan match different seismic wavelets.Then, a high localized TF representation can be obtained by the GBW.Furthermore, the CWT can construct a tight frame in the certaincondition based on the frame theory in Mallat (1999), which may beneﬁt for the proposed seismic random noise reduction work ﬂow in this paper (Wang and Gao, 2013).

A great challenge of random noise reduction method ishow to accurate estimate the noise-free seismic signal from the noisyseismic signal.From above analysis, the noise-free seismic signal can been recoveredfrom its inner products based on the tight frame analysis operator(Mallat, 1999). Thus, based on equation(4)and sparse representation theory, the approximation~xcan be obtained by a minimized optimiza-tion problemx

ℓ1 norm regularization term is commonly used in thisproblem. Then, the minimization problem can be a lasso problem,x

Many optimization methods have been utilized to solve such problem(Daubechies et al., 2004;Beck and Teboulle, 2009) and these algorithms are implemented by an iterative updating scheme and a soft-thresholdingstrategy, which is given bysoftðx;λÞ¼8<:x/C0λ

ℓ1norm has some drawbacks. One is that the ℓ1norm is the approximate representation of the
ℓ0norm and cannot generate the sparsest solution. Therefore, the
ℓ1-minimization problem will lead tounderestimated results for the high-amplitude component ( Selesnick, 2017). On the other hand, the thresholding strategy is always introducedto solve the
ℓ1-minimization problem and an inappropriate thresholdingparameter will lead to undesirable results.To alleviate the disadvantage of
ℓ1norm, the TV regularization, which can preserve edges, is addressed in seismic random noise attenu-ation. The TV regularization optimization problem is givenmin

ℓ1norm, which suffers from the similar limitation of the ℓ1norm.

2263. The proposed seismic random noise reduction method basedon self-paced learning3.1. The
ℓpnorm regularizationAccording to above analysis, the
ℓ0norm is used to provide the sparsest solution of equation(6). However, the
ℓ0norm-based optimi- zation problem is a non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness (NP-Hard) problem, which is difﬁcult to solve. Recently, the
ℓp,0<p<1- based problem is proposed, which is deﬁned as

iis theith element ofx.Fig. 2describes geometric sketch maps of the
ℓp,p¼0.8 , theℓ1norm and the ℓ2norm, respectively. Clearly, the ℓ2
norm only provides smoothness and the ℓp,p¼0.8 norm maintain much sparser than the
ℓ1norm.Fig. 3also gives the comparison for differentnorms. Obviously, the
ℓp,0<p<1 norm can preserve the sparsest result,which can be introduced in the sparsity-based model.3.2. The self-paced learningRecently, a machine learning algorithm, called curriculum learning(CL), is proposed. The CL, inspired by the humans and animals learningscheme, can learn the easy samples and then select the complex samples.Many empirical evaluations have demonstrated that the CL can avoid thebad minima for a non-convex problem. However, the CL needed a prior todetermine the simple and complex samples, which was dif ﬁcult in the real application.To overcome above disadvantage, the SPL was addressed by Kumar et al. (2010), which formulated the key principle of CL as an optimalproblem. The SPL can select the simple and complex samples automati-cally, which is deﬁned asmin

η) is the SPL regularization to calculate the weightedvalues.
ηis the age parameter to control the learning pace. With theparameter
ηincreasing in every iteration, more complex samples will beintroduced in the learning scheme. The SPL regularization h(w,
η) has a general deﬁnition, which is given as follows:Deﬁnition(SPL regularization term (Zhao et al., 2015)) Supposewis the weighted values,eis the loss function,
ηis the age parameter,h(w, η) is the SPL regularization term, if.1.h(w,
η) is convex with respect tow2[0, 1]. 2.w(
η,e) is monotonically decreasing with respect to e, and it holds that lim
e→0w(η,e)¼1, lim e→∞w(η,e)¼0. 3.w(
η,e) is monotonically increasing with respect to η, and it holds that lim
η→0w(η,e)¼0, lim η→∞w(η,e)/C201.wherew(
η,e)¼arg min w2[0,1] weþh(w, η). The above deﬁnition gives an easy understanding for the SPL. Thecondition 2 demonstrates that the SPL can ﬁrst select easy samples. The condition 3 indicates that when the age parameter becomes larger, theSPL may include more complex samples into training. Compared with theCL, the SPL can automatically select the easy or complex samples bylearner itself.3.3. The proposed SRNA-SPL-MN modelAccording to the advantage of the
ℓp,0<p<1 norm and the SPL, we proposed a mixed
ℓpnorm-based seismic random noise reduction methodto avoid drawbacks of the single regularization. In our proposed method,the mixed norm, including theℓp,0<p<1 norm and the TV regularization, can boost the advantages of the sparse regularization and the TV regu-larization, while provide more accurate denoised results. The SPL is alsoapplied in this model to avoid the bad minima, which is introduced bythe
ℓpnorm regularization term. Thereby, the proposed optimizationmodel is given bymin

ηincreasing, more complex samples will beincluded in the training scheme.3.4. The algorithm of the proposed modelObviously, the proposed SRNA-SPL-MN model in equation (14)is non-convex and non-smooth, which is challenging to solve. However,when the parameterxisﬁxed, the equation(14)is a convex problem, which is easy to solve. While the parameter wisﬁxed, the equation(14) become a mixed norm-based optimal problem, which can be solved bythe alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm ( Shen and Cheng, 2016) and the split Bregman algorithm ( Yin et al., 2008). Thus, weﬁrst divide the proposed SRNA-SPL-MN model into twosub-problem and then optimize each of them with other ﬁxed. Atﬁrst, when thexisﬁxed, the equation(14)can be a regarded asmin

The time sampling number is 601 and the timesampling interval is 1 ms. The noisy synthetic seismic signal, which isgenerated by adding White Gaussian noise, is given in 4(c) and the SNRvalue is 5 dB. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed seismicrandom noise reduction method, three comparison methods are appliedin this example, including the
ℓ1norm regularized sparse random noisereduction method (named GBW-L1), the TV denoising method, the mixednorm-based denoising method (called GBW-M). The regularizationparameter of the GBW-L1 is selected based on the noise level ( Yang et al., 2019). The TV regularization parameter selection strategy is given inDing and Selesnick (2015). For the GBW-M method, we also use theBregman algorithm to solve the optimal solution. The parameter pof the GBW-M is set asp¼1 andp¼0.5, respectively. Unfortunately, theregularization parameters selection in the GBW-M and our proposedSRNA-SPL-MN method are still an open problem and thus these param-eters are obtained by empirical validation.Fig. 5describes the denoised results by above-mentioned methodsand the SNR values of these methods are listed in table Table 1. Clearly, the GBW-M method and our proposed method performer better than theTV denoised method and GBW-L1 method. In order to describe thecomparison among these denoised methods in detail, Fig. 6gives the enlarged denoised results ofFig. 5from 0.1s to 0.23s and the denoisedresults in the black box is enlarged. The TV denoised method, which hasthe lowest SNR value (SNR¼11.92 dB), produces the unexpectedstaircase artifacts denoted by the red arrows, while some effective signalsare leakage. The black box indicates that the GBW-L1 has some ineffec-tive denoised results. For the GBW-M, when the parameter pis set as 0.5, this method may lead to less effective signal leaking than the GBW-Mwithp¼1, which can be also demonstrated by the SNR value of thedenoised results in table ?? Thus, the parameter pof the proposed SRNA- SPL-MN is set 0.5 and the denoised result is represented by the red line inFig. 5. Obviously, the proposed SRNA-SPL-MN with the highest SNR(SNR¼13.48 dB) can reduce the random noise more effectively and alsoensure a more signiﬁcant signal.5. Field data applicationsTo further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SRNA-SPL-MN method, an example of 3D real seismic data is given in this section.The 3D real seismic is shown inFig. 7, which comes from the loess plateau area in China. The real 3D seismic data includes 500 Inline tracesand 500 Xline traces, respectively. The time sample interval is 2 ms andthe time sample number is 500. We also select GBW-L1 and GBW-M withp¼0.5 methods as the comparison methods. Following the analysis ofthe synthetic example, we setp¼0.5 in this application.The denoised results and the corresponding difference sections ofthese three methods are shown inFigs. 8 and 9, respectively. From the difference sections inFig. 9, these three mentioned methods make littleeffective seismic signal leaking. Unfortunately, the GBW-ℓ1attenuates a little random noise especially within the black arrows in Fig. 8(c). From Fig. 8(a) and (b), our proposed method has the best performance toreduce random noises and maintain the effective signals. Furthermore,the seismic traces of Xline 300 and Inline 300 are given in Fig. 10. Clearly, the proposed method can ensure more effective seismic signalthan the other two denoised methods. Then, the normalized Fourierspectrum of these four seismic traces is illustrated in Fig. 11and the results reveal that the proposed method attenuate more random noise,especially in the high frequency part (shown in the black box).The denoised results.6. Conclusion and discussionWe propose a sparse transform-based seismic random noise reductionmethod via mixed norm regularization and self-paced learning in thisstudy. The regularized term is consisted of a mixed norm, including the
ℓp
norm and the TV regularization. This mixed norm can not only boost theadvantages of the
ℓ1norm and the TV regularization but also providesparser results than the above two traditional regularizations. Mean-while, SPL, which can avoid the bad minima for the mixed norm regu-larized optimization problem, is introduced in the proposed method. Inthe implementation, the SPL selects the high SNR seismic data ﬁrst into the mixed norm regularized problem and then learns low SNR seismicdata. Moreover, an enhanced Bregman iteration algorithm is addressedto solve the above optimization model. In a word, the proposed randomnoise reduction method has the best performance for improving the SNRvalues for the seismic data, especially for the complex environment. Toshow the performance of our proposed work ﬂow, a synthetic seismic signal and a 3D real loess plateau data examples are successfully applied.Compared with the two traditional denoising methods, our proposedworkﬂow can reduce more random noises, while maintaining the validseismic signals.Due to the introduction of three regularization terms in the proposedmodel, the proposed method should take more experimental to set theregularization parameters. Although the proposed method boosts theperformance of seismic data denoising, it is a signi ﬁcant task to improve the parameters selection scheme. Furthermore, the proposed model isonly focus on the seismic random noise reduction in this paper, whichcan be extended to solve seismic data reconstruction and seismic randomnoise reduction simultaneously. Another topic of the future work couldbe to remove the seismic coherent noise.
