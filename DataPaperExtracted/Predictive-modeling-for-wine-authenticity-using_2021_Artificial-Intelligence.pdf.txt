Key-words:Wine classiﬁcationSupport vector machinesFeature selectionSouth American winesMachine learningThe purpose of this paper is to classify wines from 4 different countries in South America. Each class of wines isformed by samples considered by experts as representatives of the following commercial categories: “Argentin- ean Malbec (AM)”,“Brazilian Merlot (BM)”,“Uruguayan Tannat (UT)”and“Chilean Carménère (CC)”. The 83 samples collected were analyzed according to their composition of volatiles, semi-volatiles and phenolic com-pounds. We built a decision system for classi ﬁcation based on support vector machines (SVM), along with Correlation-based Feature selection (CFS), and Random Forest Importance (RFI), which measures the relative im-portance of the input variables. First, we use CFS to select a subset of variables among 190 chemical compounds.Thirteen chemicals were selected as correlated to the category and uncorrelated with each other. Afterwards,these chemical compounds were organized according to the importance ranking given by the RFI and classi ﬁed with SVM. The study clearly indicated that SVM in combination with feature selection methods was able to iden-tify the most important chemicals to classify the wine samples. Among the compounds identi ﬁed in the wine samples, the variable subset deﬁned by the feature selection methods, which were catechin, gallic, octanoic acid, myricetin, caffeic, isobutanol, resveratrol, kaempferol, and ORAC, were able to achieve an accuracy of93.97% in classifying the commercial categories.© 2021 The Authors.

1. IntroductionThe combination of instrumental analyses with machine learninghave allowed the successful classiﬁcation of various products and foods according to geographical origin, varieties, and the type of farmingsystem (conventional or organic) (Jiménez-Carvelo et al., 2019;Versari et al., 2014). The main reason to discriminate food products is qualitycontrol and authentication, in order to avoid unfair competition thatcan create a destabilized market and disrupt the regional economyand even the national economy ( Callao and Ruisánchez, 2018; Cordella et al., 2002).Particularly, the wine classiﬁcation according to variety and region isan important issue because it is an easily adulterated product in terms ofdilution of wines with water, the addition of alcohol, mislabeling, andblending with, or replacement by, wine of a lesser quality of denomination.Analytical techniques such as High Performance Liquid Chromatogrphy(HPLC), coupled mass spectrometry detection (MS), Fourier TransformInfrared (FTIR), among others, are able to describe wines in chemicalscompounds that can reveal useful information about the identity of eachwine (Versari et al., 2014;Villano et al., 2017). The world wine production reached in 2018 a volume of 292.3 mil-lion of hectoliters, being more than 30 million hectoliters only inArgentina, Chile, Brazil and Uruguay ( Wine, 2019), representing an im- portant sector of economy of these countries. South American wineshave been the object of study of several research in order to classifythe geographical origin and varietal. These studies have been performedmainly by the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and LinearDiscrimination Analysis (LDA) (Belmiro et al., 2017;Llobodanin et al., 2014;Pisano et al., 2015;Versari et al., 2014). The use of linear methods is enough to obtain satisfactory results and the methods are easy forchemists to understand. However, there are several physical-chemicalparameters that characterize samples, resulting in complex data withsome nonlinearity. Classical linear methods such as discriminant analy-sis cannot model this nonlinearity. This way, nonlinear methods are re-quired (Jiménez-Carvelo et al., 2019;Li et al., 2009). Support Vector Machines (SVM) is one of the most popular andsophisticated machine learning techniques. This technique separatesthe samples by an optimal hyperplane that maximizes the distancesArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 157 –162

When there are no linear decision boundaries, theoriginal dataset (x) is converted into a new space f(x) which there is alinear decision boundary that separates the samples into their classes.SVM has been successfully used in many different applications, suchas: food science (Araújo et al., 2019;Richter et al., 2019;Soares et al., 2018;Turra et al., 2017), medicine (Froz et al., 2017;Vogado et al., 2018), forensic science (Maione et al., 2018), among others. In previous studies, someVitis Viníferawines from South America were analyzed with machine learning using feature selection and sup-port vector machines based on their antioxidant activity, phenolic sub-stances, anthocyanins and color (Costa et al., 2018, 2019;da Costa et al., 2016). The use of feature selection allowed to identify the most impor-tant chemical descriptors that characterize the geographical origin ofwines. The study of Soares (Soares et al., 2018) also classiﬁed South America wines based on elemental concentrations, machine learningand feature selection. The authors proposed a new ﬁlter feature selec- tion method and achieved seven elements that classi ﬁed the wines in 99.9% of accuracy.Information like a reduced set of chemical descriptors that can clas-sify food samples obtained from feature selection methods can reducecosts related to the chemical analysis of uncorrelated compounds, re-duce the computational time required to analyze the data, can improveaccuracy and provide useful information to prevent and to identify foodfraud.In this study, samples of South American wines were analyzed basedon the phenolic, semi-volatile and volatile compounds. Few studies hadused feature selection methods to classify wine samples based on phe-nolic and volatile compounds. The study of ( Rebolo et al., 2000) used ﬁve chemical compounds selected based on Stepwise Bayesian Analysisalgorithm to classify Galician red wines along with LDA, k-nearestneighbors and soft independent class modeling. Mihena et al. ( Mihnea et al., 2015)c l a s s iﬁed different pre-fermentative maceration techniquesof Mencía wines with forward stepwise linear discriminant analysis.This technique was also used to select the most important chemical pa-rameters to classify Chinese rice wines ( Shen et al., 2012), Andalusian sweet wines (Márquez et al., 2008), and the variety of Chinese redwines (Zhang et al., 2010).The objective of this study is to characterize the main phenolic, semi-volatile and volatile compounds which are able to discriminate the four“Commercial Categories”of South American wines, named ArgentineanMalbec (AM)”,“Brazilian Merlot (BM)”,“Uruguaian Tannat (UT)”and “Chilean Carménère (CC)”, based on Support vector machines (SVM)combined with feature selection methods named Correlation Based Fea-ture Selection and Random Forest Importance. To our knowledge, this is
theﬁrst study to combine SVM and two feature selection methods toclassify wine samples based on phenolic, semi-volatile and volatilecompounds.2. Material and methods2.1. MaterialA group of wine experts from the “Brazilian Association of Somme- liers (ABS-SP, São Paulo, Brazil) ”was invited to list examples of winesthat were the best representatives of four categories: “Argentinean Malbec (AM)”,“Brazilian Merlot (BM)”,“UruguaianTannat (UT)”and “Chilean Carménère (CC)”. The ABS-SP group is formed by expertswith elevated experience in the wine degustation, market and technol-ogy (www.abs-sp.com.br). The following question was placed to the ex-perts:“If you had to show to someone what is an authentic, for example,Argentinean Malbec, which wine would you recommend? ”To answer this question, the experts elaborated a list containing the brand and vin-tage of each category. From this list, 83 wines (2008 –2015) were pur- chased from the local stores covering a price range from 12 to 135USD for 750 mL bottle. The list of wines applied in this study included14 UT, 26 MA, 33 CC and 10 BM. The bottle was opened, the wine wasimmediately aliquoted and kept at -80 °C until the analysis. The re-agents 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil (DPPH), ﬂuorescein, 2,2′-Azobis (2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH), epicatechin,caffeic acid, gallic acid, ferulic acid, rutin, trans-resveratrol, myricetin,quercetin, kaempferol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (SigmaChemical Co, St. Louis, United States). The anthocyanins cyanidin-3-glucoside, delphinidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside and malvidin-3-glucoside were obtained from PolyphenolsLaboratories AS (Polyphenols SA, Sandnes, Norway). All other chemicaland solvents were analytical grade.2.2. MethodsThe semi-volatile compounds were analyzed using QuadrupoleTime-of-Flight (QTOF) Liquid Chromatography –Mass Spectrometry ac- cording to 5991-3335EN Application Note (Agilent Technologies, Inc.,Palo Alto, USA). Volatiles and phenolic compounds were analyzed ac-cording toCabredo-Pinillos et al. (2004)andJaitz et al. (2010), respec- tively. The antioxidant activity of the samples was analyzed by threemethods. ORAC was carried out according to Huang et al. (2005). DPPH analysis was based on method reported by Brand-Williams et al. (1995), while FRAP was performed according to Benzie and Strain (1996). The distribution of the compounds found is as follows: 21 phe-nolic components, 29 volatiles and 140 semi-volatiles. More informa-tion about the HPLC chromatograms is given by Valentin et al. (2020).2.2.1. Support vector machinesSupport Vector Machines (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) is one of the best known and most used classiﬁcation algorithms which aim toﬁnd a hyperplane with maximum margin to separate the classes of data.This hyperplane is a special type of linear model. In the linear case adatabase with two class of data is easily separated by a hyperplane intwo groups, which one represents one of the classes and the othergroup represents the other class. The samples that are closest to themaximum-margin hyperplane are called support vectors. The non-linear cases begin to be solved in 1995 when Cortes & Vapnik intro-duced the use of the soft-margin, which uses slack variables to penalizesamples that characterize the non-linearity of data. When there are nolinear decision boundaries the original dataset (x) is converted into anew space f(x) by the kernel trick. In the new space f(x) there is a lineardecision boundary that separates the samples into their classes.2.2.2. Feature selectionThe feature selection (variable elimination) helps in understandingdata, reducing the effect of high dimensionality, reducing computa-tional time and improving the classiﬁer performance (Chandrashekar and Sahin, 2014). We use Correlation-based feature selection (CFS) toselect a subset of the most important variable and Random Forest Im-portance (RFI) to order the variables selected. The CFS selected a featuresubset that contains features highly correlated with the class, yet uncor-related with each other (Hall, 1999). The Random Forest Importance(RFI) uses the random forest classiﬁer to measure the importance of input variables (Breiman, 2001). This technique is aﬁlter feature selec- tor, which uses variable ranking as the principle criteria for variable se-lection by ordering.2.2.3. Performance analysisThe classiﬁcations occurred by the use of 10-fold cross validation toevaluating the performance of SVM. This technique splits the dataset (inour case, 83 samples) into 10 folds and performs 10 classi ﬁcations. Each classiﬁcation is accomplished in the following way: nine folds are usedto train the model and the tenth fold is used to test the model, generat-ing a precision rate (accuracy). This process is performed until all tenfolds are used for testing. At the end of the process, the performanceof the classiﬁcation model is given as the average of the accuracyN.L. da Costa, L.A.

158obtained in each partition. All machine learning tasks and graphs wereperformed using the R software (RC o r eT e a m ,2 0 1 7).3. Results and discussionFig. 1shows the steps carried out in this study. After select the wines,they were analyzed according to their composition of phenolic, volatilesand semi-volatiles compounds. Next, we applied the machine learningtechniques to investigate the distinction of the commercial categories.About 600 peaks were isolated to volatile compounds, semi-volatilecompounds by negative mode and semi-volatile compounds by positivemode compounds. From them, just the peaks that it was possible to iden- tify the formula were selected (169 peaks). The dataset used in this studyhas 83 samples described in 169 volatile and semi-volatile compoundspeaks besides 21 variables relative to antioxidant activity and phenoliccompounds associated to one of the classes (AM, BM, CC, UT). The num-ber of samples of each class was distributed as follows: 26 ArgentineanMalbec samples, 10 Brazilian Merlot samples, 33 Chilean Carménèresamples, and 14 Uruguayan Tannat samples. The class labels (the chem-ical categories) were selected by a panel of wine experts on base on theirsensory properties. This aspect is essential because researchers, usually,do not have this information, and proportion of market share can bemore related to price conditions than wines authenticity.3.1. Classiﬁcation and analysis of all datasetThe classiﬁcation algorithm SVM was applied considering the original190 variablesﬁrst (169 volatile and semi-volatile compounds peaks and21 variables relative to antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds).Results achieved in this step are considered as “references”to which any others can be compared. The SVM model obtained 39.76% of accuracyby the use of all 190 variables. All the samples were classi ﬁed as“Chilean Carménère”. The accuracy value obtained in this model is explained bythe number of CC samples. There are 33 CC samples in the databaseand all samples were classiﬁed as CC. Only the 33 CC samples were cor-rectly classiﬁed, which represent 39.76% of the total samples.An exploratory analysis by means of principal component analysis(PCA) was carried out to investigate this result. This technique is basedon a linear transformation of data into different orthogonal coordinatesusing maximum variance and minimum correlation. By reducing thenumber of features from 190 original variables to two principal compo-nents, the information is enough to allow an examination of the samplesaccording to the commercial category in a 2D-plot ( Fig. 2). There is no natural separation among the classes. Three clusters can be identi ﬁed, however, each one is formed with samples of all classes.Theﬁrst conclusion is that all phenolic and volatile compounds can-not discriminate among the commercial categories. The low classi ﬁcationr a t ec a nb ee x p l a i n e dc o n s i d e r i n gt h ef a c tt h a ti sp o s s i b l et oe x i s t sn o i s eor irrelevant variables in our dataset. Therefore, we applied feature selec-tion methods to select a subset of variables from the input which can ef-ﬁciently describe the input data and discriminate among the classes.3.2. Feature selectionCFS were applied to all dataset and returned 13 variables. They are:ORAC, octanoic acid, isobutanol, 2-phenyletanol, isorhamnetin, ethyllactate, sv(+) 16 - not identiﬁed semi-volatile, gallic, catechin, caffeic,myricetin, resveratrol and kaempferol. Table 1shows the mean and the standard deviation of the chemical's concentration for eachcommercial category along with the results of Kruskal Wallis test. Thevariables ORAC, 2-phenyletanol and gallic present a very close concen-tration values for the commercial categories AM, BM, and CC, and ahigher concentration for the UT (pvalue <0.05). The UT concentrationsfor these variables presented a signiﬁcant difference. The variables octanoic acid and isobutanol showed highest values for the BM and CCcategories (p
value <0.05) and AM and UT were not signi ﬁcant different from each other. Ethyl lactate and resveratrol presented a highest con-centration values for the BM wines ( pvalue <0.05). There is no pattern among the statistical differences in the variable's concentrations amongthe commercial categories. An advanced analysis is need to differentiatethe categories based on this chemical composition.A PCA analysis was carried out on the selected variables. Fig. 3 shows the score plot of theﬁrst two principal components. A natural

159separation between BM and CC can be observed. The samples of AM andUT are separated from BM and CC, but there is an overlap between theseclasses. The variables selected by CFS showed more discriminativepower than all phenolic and volatile compounds when analyzing thedistance among the samples.The variables selected by CFS were submitted to a ﬁlter method of feature selection, the RFI. This method ranks the features according tothe classiﬁcations performed by the Random Forest classi ﬁer by the use of one variable at time as predictor. The feature selection performedby the CFS aimed to reduce the number of variables and the RFI goal wasordering the features wherein the variables were selected and appliedto the predictor according to the importance of each one. Fig. 4shows the importance of each variable according to RFI.3.3. Classiﬁcation resultsBased on the information of the RFI, we performed 13 classi ﬁcation models as follows. Theﬁrst classiﬁcation model used only the most im-portant variable (catechin), the second classi ﬁcation model used the two most important variables (catechin and gallic), and so forth, untilthe thirteenth classiﬁcation model, which used the thirteen variablesselected by CFS.Table 2shows the results obtained from these thirteenclassiﬁcation models. It is presented the model ID, the variables used asinput to SVM and the accuracy values for each classi ﬁcation model. The higher result is the one that used nine variables, catechin, gallic,octanoic acid, myricetin, caffeic, isobutanol, resveratrol, kaempferoland ORAC, with 93.97% of accuracy. Just one variable results in thelower accuracy, 68.49%. These value increases when variables areadded. The peak of accuracy occurs with the #09 classi ﬁcation model. This value decreases and stabilizes between a range of values whenmore variables are added.Table 3shows the confusion matrix of the classiﬁcation model #09. All samples of CC class were correctly classi ﬁed. One sample of BM class, two samples of AM class, and two samples of UT class weremisclassiﬁed. These results suggest that the CC class is the purestamong them, in which the nine chemical components of the subset#09 is able to correctly classify all the samples. The other data classeshave few samples that were misclassiﬁed, indicating that there is a little similarity among the others commercial categories. However, the classi-ﬁcation model achieved a good classiﬁcation rate of 93.97%.4. DiscussionPhenolic and volatile proﬁles are the most involved compounds inthe sensory identity of wine (Villano et al., 2017). Thus, these com- pounds can be used on discriminatory analysis to classify wines.Table 1Descriptive statistical analysis of South American commercial Categories wine data.Variable AM BM UT CCORAC (mMol TE) 21.31 ± 1.13

160However, as the results of this study demonstrated, there is some vari-ables that do not contributed to the classi ﬁcation model. The use of all chemicals resulted on a low predictive performance and there is noclear separation on the PCA score plot. The selection of a feature subsetplayed an important role to classify the commercial categories of SouthAmerican wines.It was found that a group of phenolic and volatile was the more dis-criminative compounds. The model #09 used seven phenolic and twovolatile compounds. The ORAC was previously identi ﬁed by the use of feature selection as one of the main chemicals that are able to classifyChilean and Brazilian Sauvignon Cabernet wines ( da Costa et al., 2016), Uruguayan and Brazilian Tannat wines ( Costa et al., 2018), and South American Merlot wines (Costa et al., 2019).Zhang et al. (2010) selected 11 volatiles compounds from Chinese red wines by the use ofstepwise linear discriminant analysis. The authors found that estersand alcohols are responsible for varietal classi ﬁcation of Chinese Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Gernischt and Merlot wines.Márquez et al. (2008)found that the variablesα-terpineol, 5-methyl-2-furaldehyde, isoamyl alcohols, ethyl decanoate, hexanaland p-cymene was the mainly descriptors to classify Andalusian sweetwines. The study ofMihnea et al. (2015)correctly classiﬁed all samples of Mencía wines by the use of 22 of 42 variables, mainly alcohols, estersand acids.Although the use of variable selectors improves the performance ofclassiﬁcation models and reduces the experimental costs, there is littleresearch in the area of wine classiﬁcation using these techniques. Thefuture of food authentication depends on combining the informationfrom different analytical techniques (Villano et al., 2017) and modeling algorithms capable to handle the non-linearly of data and complexproblems, such as artiﬁcial neural networks, SVM, decision trees andrandom forest, that show a great potential and more advantages com-pared to conventional ones (Jiménez-Carvelo et al., 2019). Therefore, our results strongly contribute as an application of machine learningand feature selection methods to a wine database composed of fourcommercial categories described on phenolic and volatile compounds.5. ConclusionThis work demonstrated the use of SVM and two feature selectionmethods to classify four commercial categories of South Americanred wines (“Argentinean Malbec (AM)”,“Brazilian Merlot (BM)”, “Uruguayan Tannat (UT)”and“Chilean Carménère (CC)”). Among the 190 variables that described volatiles, semi-volatiles, antioxidant activ-ity and phenolic compounds, 13 were selected by CFS. From this vari-able subset nine chemicals were identiﬁed by RFI with a classiﬁcation capacity greater than the set of 13 variables. The SVM was able to clas-sify the samples according to their respective classes in an accuracy of93.97%. The compounds selected were catechin, gallic, octanoic acid,myricetin, caffeic, isobutanol, resveratrol, kaempferol, and ORAC. Thatnot only reduced the experimental cost effectively, but also made theanalysis of the results more comprehensible due the reduced numberof variables. PCA was used to an exploratory analysis before and afterfeature selection. Theﬁrst plot did not show any patters or groups. Onthe other hand, the PCA score plot based on the selected variablesshows some trends and separation among the classes.One aspect that differentiates this research from the other studiesthat conducted wine classiﬁcation is that we use feature selection tech-niques to identify a subset of chemical compounds that were able toclassify the data from multiple sources. In addition, our methodologycan be applied in other products and wines to identify the most impor-tant chemicals which characterize the classes, reduce data dimensional-ity, and improve the classiﬁcation rate.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in ﬂu- ence the work reported in this paper.References
