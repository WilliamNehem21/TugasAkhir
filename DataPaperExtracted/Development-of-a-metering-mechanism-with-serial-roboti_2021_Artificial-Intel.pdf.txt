Keywords:Tomato seedling transplantingFeeding conveyorRobotic transplantationSeedling sensing systemThis paper describes the development of an automated metering mechanism for vegetable transplanter. Itconsisted of a 3- DOF serial robotic arm and an automatic feeding conveyor. The robotic arm was developed topick and drop tomato seedlings raised in biodegradable paper pots. The volume of each pot was 50 cm

(3.5 cm diameter and 5.2 cm height) with a maximum total weight of 47 g including pot mix and seedling. A ma-trix type feeding conveyor was developed to convey the pot seedlings to a prede ﬁned position where the robotic arm could pick up these seedlings one by one. LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) - LED (Light Emitting Diode) sens-ing unit was used to perform the intermittent movement of the conveyor. The developed system was evaluatedunder both laboratory andﬁeld conditions. The robotic arm was able to pick and drop 20 seedlings per minuteand its effective cycle time per handling one seedling was varying from 2.5 to 3.1 s. Power consumption of theconveyor of the developed system and the robotic arm was 18 W and 16 W, respectively. The conveying,metering and overall efﬁciency of the developed metering mechanism under laboratory condition were96.83%, 95.91% and 92.86%, respectively as compared to 94.7%, 93.28% and 88.33%, under ﬁeld condition. The de- veloped robotic arm based metering mechanism was simple, light in weight and effectively handled the pot seed-lings without damage and would thus help in mechanizing transplanting of vegetable seedlings.© 2021 The Authors.

1. IntroductionPlanting of seed/seedling is an important operation for raising anycrop. Vegetable crops like tomato and brinjal give better productivitywith transplanting of best-grown seedlings instead of sowing theseeds directly into the agriculturalﬁeld. Unavailability of suitable vege-table transplanting machinery in developing countries such as India,manual transplanting is opted for cultivating vegetables, which requiresconsiderable manpower, and thus it is expensive. Shortage of laboursduring the peak transplanting period adversely affects the timelinessof this operation, thereby reduces crop yield ( Khadatkar et al., 2018; Vivek et al., 2019). In manual transplanting, seedlings are manuallyplanted in the soil by maintaining a recommended row-to-row andplant-to-plant spacing. Since manual transplanting is more prone toerror, it results in non-uniform plant distribution which makes it dif ﬁ- cult to operate several other agricultural machinery such as plant pro-tection implements and harvesting implements required for raisingthe plants (Parish, 2005;Kumar and Raheman, 2008, 2011). Therefore, mechanization in the transplanting of vegetable seedlings becomes es-sential to overcome the shortage of labour and will help to completethe transplantation process in less time with good uniformity of plantdistribution in theﬁeld.A transplanter generally consists of a metering mechanism i.e., apicking unit and a seedling dropping unit. It is designed based on typeof seedlings used (bare root, plug and pot seedlings). Kumar and Raheman (2010)developed paper pot type vegetable seedlings usingrecycled bio-degradable paper. The paper pots were ﬁlled with vermicompost, soil and sand at an optimum proportion to raise seed-lings.Nandede et al. (2014)standardized the potting mix (farmyardmanure: sand: soil) for better growth of vegetable seedlings in paperpots and found these seedlings suitable to use in the agricultural ﬁeld using a transplanter. The main advantages of paper pot seedlings are:individual seedlings have sufﬁcient space, nutrients and conducive con-ditions for better seedling germination and growth ( Kumar and Raheman, 2008) and withstand the transplanting shock ( Dihingia et al., 2017). The transplanters are commonly classiﬁed into two catego- ries a) semi-automatic and b) automatic type. The semi-automatictransplanters require additional workers for feeding and steering oper-ation, while the automatic transplanters require a single operator tocarry out transplanting in theﬁeld (Tsuga, 2000;Kumar and Raheman, 2011).Tsuga (2000)developed three models of automaticself-propelled vegetable transplanter for plug seedlings and paper potseedlings. The planting rate of the seedlings in the ﬁeld was 60 hills/ row/min.Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 52 –63

The performance of the transplantersprimarily depends on several parameters such as seedling feeding rateof the pickup unit, seedling row to row spacing and optimal forwardspeed of the machine (Kumar and Raheman, 2008). These automatic transplanters produce vibration, require high input power and themetering mechanism of mechanical type automatic transplanters arecomplicated to design and fabricate (Prasanna and Raheman, 2012). In order to avoid the complexity associated with mechanical trans-planters and to reduce power consumption, researchers have developedelectronic-basedrobotictransplantersforhandlingplugandpotseedlings.Hwang and Sistler (1986)incorporated robotic manipulator (5 degree of freedom (DOF)) in a commercially available mechanical transplanter fortransplanting pepper crop seedlings in the ﬁeld. This system utilized an 8-bit microcomputer for master control of the robotic movement. The pri-mary purpose of the manipulator was to pick pepper pot seedlings from ahorizontal conveyor and place it at a dropping point. This transplanter in-cludedaplanttray,afurrowopener,plantkickerandtwopresswheelsandits transplanting rate was slightly more than 6 plants per min. Ting et al. (1990a)conducted a study on work cell layouts for transplanting plugseedling using a Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm (SCARA). Acomputer program was developed for analyzing the interactions of thework cell layout, the robot arm motion and the material ﬂow.Ting et al. (1990b)designed a swinging and sliding needle type gripper for picking,holding and placing the plug seedlings. The gripper was attached on aSCARA robot arm with a capacitive proximity type sensor for identifyingthe plug seedling grasped by the gripper. Ryu et al. (2001)developed a transplanting system based on an image recognition system for beddingplants using a three-axis gantry type robot. This system consisted of animage recognition device, a tray conveyor, a manipulator, and an end-effector. This transplanter was specially developed for greenhouse appli-cations at a transplanting rate of 30 plants per minute. Tian et al. (2010) designedanddevelopedasimplegantry-typearmwithafeedingconveyorsystem to handle plug seedlings. The unit comprised of a programmablelogiccontroller(PLC)basedcontrolsystem,seedlingpickupunitandacon-veyor system for plug seedlings. The planting rate was reported as 1800 to2400 seedlings per hour.Hu et al. (2014)designed and analyzed the di- mensional synthesis and kinematic simulation of a 2-DOF parallel robotarm for transplanting plug seedlings from a 128-hole tray to a 50-holetray. The transplanting capacity of the developed system was up to 55plantsperminute.Xinetal.(2018)implementedanautomaticmechanismfortransplantingplugseedlings.Itconsistedofageartrainseedlingpickingmechanism, a photoelectric sensor (for seedling recognition) and a push-type seedling conveyor. The success rate of the developed system was88.23% and the leakage rate was 16.46%.Shamshiri et al. (2018a)described the achievements of the latest ro-botics technology in agriculture such as the importance of incorporatingadvanced sensing systems, machine vision system ( Joseph et al., 2019, Syed et al., 2019a, 2019b) multi-robot collaboration and the latest soft-ware tools. These advanced techniques could help in the ef ﬁcienttransplanting of seedlings by decreasing the workforce and time takento complete the operation.Shamshiri et al. (2018b)reviewed various simulating software and virtual environments for the use of digitalagriculture. It was found that, with the capability of available softwareplatforms, the performance of the agricultural robotics could be signi ﬁ- cantly improved by incorporating the advanced algorithms, sharing theexisting workspaces and reusing the materials. Also, the utilization ofsoftware platforms forﬁeld operations could signiﬁcantly reduce the cost by reducing the number of real-time experimental errors and opti-maluseoffarmresources.Syedetal.(2019a)investigatedtheapplication of machine vision technology in agriculture and automatic transplantingmachine. It was reported in this study that combined use of robot, sensorand machine vision technology in transplanter could improve quality oftransplanting, efﬁciency and reduce the labour requirement.Syed et al. (2019b)proposed a non-destructive method of seedling measurementsystemforitsuseinautomatictransplanters.Theyhaveusedmachinevi-sionsystemalongwithadepthcameratoobtaintheseedlingdata.The3Dmodel of the seedlings was generated from the collected data with thehelp of a point cloud clustering algorithm. Rahul et al. (2019)developed a 2 DOF parallel robot for transplanting paper pot seedlings. The dutycycle timeofthe robot forpickupand placementof eachseedlingwasre-portedas2.25swithapowerrequirementof22W. Viveketal.(2019)de- veloped a gripper for vegetable transplanting robot, which was utilizedfor transplanting plug seedlings and the success rate of the transplantingsystem was reported as 92.47% and 91.32% for chilli and brinjal, respec-tively.Yung et al. (2019)developed a serial robotic arm for transplantingtomatoseedlingfromatraytoabox.Theaveragecycletimeoftheroboticarmforpickingandplacingoperationwas2.82s,andthesuccessofplant-ingwasreportedas93.86%.Rahuletal.(2020)developedaﬁrmwarethat could be implemented on embedded systems. They tested the controllerwith a 4 DOF parallel robot arm to transplant pot seedlings. It was re-ported that the developed embedded system reduced the overall costwith the cycle time and success rate of 3.5 s and 93.3%, respectively.Robotic transplanters utilize an individual unit of power source(motor) for picking the seedlings, which eliminates the need of complexmetering mechanism and complex power transmission system re-quired in case of internal combustion (IC) engine operated mechanicaltransplanter (Ryu et al., 2001;Hu et al., 2014;Rahul et al., 2019, (Rahul et al., 2020)2020). Robotic transplanters require less inputpower, and they are adjustable to control speed and transplanting rate(Sakaue, 1996;Hu et al., 2014). Robotic transplanters can be equippedwith advanced sensors to detect the environmental changes andsmart actuators to provide the required torque and forces to the ma-chine components for delicate removal of seedlings from the conveyorand drops into a delivery tube. Hence, there is a need to develop a ro-botic vegetable transplanter equipped with an advanced control systemin the metering mechanism that should work well in the actual ﬁeld condition with a lesser power requirement and easy to operate.The use of serial robotic arm could be advantageous for use in vege-table transplanters in many ways such as: workspace to robot size ratiois high; the complexity of kinematics computation is simpler along withbig workspace and compact size (Pandilov and Dukovski, 2014). These advantages make the serial robotic arm to be more suitable for vegeta-ble transplanting in theﬁeld. However, an automatic feeding conveyorwith a seedling sensing unit is required to supply pot seedlings contin-uously to the robotic arm of the transplanting system. Therefore, in thepresent study, an attempt has been made to design and develop a serialrobotic arm for handling paper pot seedlings with an automatic feedingconveyor for a vegetable transplanter.2.

12:112)f o rt h es u c c e s s - ful growth of tomato seedlings as recommended by Kumar and Raheman (2011). Tomato seed was planted into the potting mix ofeach pot. It was allowed to grow with regular watering for 21 days.The weight of the paper pot along with the potting mix moistureready for transplanting were 44.0 ± 2.0 g, 46.0 ± 2.0 g and 47.0 ±2.0 g at moisture content of 6 ± 2%, 9 ± 2% and 12 ± 2% (dry basis),respectively.2.2. Conceptual working of robotic arm pickup mechanism and feedingconveyorTheﬂow chart for the working of the robotic pickup mechanism andfeeding conveyor is shown inFig. 1. The pot seedlings are initially loadedto the feeding conveyor cells. During operation, the robotic arm wasprogrammed to pick and drop the pot seedlings one by one from theconveyor to the dropping point without any human intervention. Thefront row of the feeding conveyor, where the sensing unit could detectthe presence of pot seedlings is called the line of action (LOA).Theﬁrst row of pot seedlings was positioned at line of action (LOA) byrotatingtheconveyorshaftusingadirectcurrent(DC)motoroperatedin-termittently by using an electronic control circuit. Whenever the seed-lings were detected by the LED (Light Emitting Diode) –LDR (Light Dependent Resistance) sensing unit, the electronic circuit sensed thepresence of pot seedlings at the LOA and the DC motor was stopped byproviding an appropriate signal to the relay circuit. After positioning theseedlings at LOA, the robotic arm was actuated to pick-up the pot seed-lings present at the robot pick-up position and drop the same at thedroppingpoint.WhennoseedlingwasavailableatLOA,theelectroniccir-cuit provided a control signal to actuate the DC motor of the feeding con-veyor to bring the seedlings to the LOA of the robotic arm. This processcontinueduntilall pots inthe conveyor wereemptiedby the robotic arm.

542.3. Development of a laboratory model of vegetable transplanter with arobotic armThe laboratory model of vegetable transplanter was developed usingan automatic feeding conveyor, electronic circuit, robotic arm, and seed-ling delivery tube.2.3.1. Automatic feeding conveyorThe purpose of using an automatic feeding conveyor was to carry thepot seedlings in upright orientation towards the LOA of the robotic arm.The seedling feeding conveyor comprised a base plate (360 × 345 ×6 mm acrylic sheet) to hold pot seedlings and it was ﬁxed on a mild steel frame (715 mm × 428 mm). Vertical guide bars were provided onthe base plate parallel to each other at an interval of 65 mm. A horizontalslattypechainconveyorwasusedtopushthepotseedlingsby ﬁxingslats (345 mm × 15 mm × 3 mm each) on the chain at an interval of 60 mm.Thus, the combination of moving slats and ﬁxed bars made cells on the base plate for accommodating pot seedlings in an upright orientation.By rotating the conveyor chain with the help of a DC motor (12 V and 60rpm)attacheddirectlytothedrive shaftoftheconveyor,theslatspresentontheconveyorpushedthepotseedlingstoslideoverthebaseplateuptothe robot arm pick up points. The conveyor was designed to carry ﬁve- column of pot seedlings at a time. The robotic arm was ﬁxed to the main- frame in frontof the conveyor topickupthepot seedlings onebyoneandto drop these seedlings into the delivery tube without any interference.The developed feeding conveyor is shown in Fig. 2.2.3.1.1. Electronic circuit for the control of feeding conveyor. A DC motor was used to power the slat type feeding conveyor. The electronic circuitused for actuating the DC motor by continuously monitoring the outputof the LED-LDR sensing unit of the feeding conveyor. The LED was con-nected to a DC power source (+12 V) through a current limiting resistor(100K)whichproducedapointedlightsource.TheLDRwaspositionedinsuchawaythatthepointedlightsourcefromLEDfellontheLDR'ssensingsurface.Thestraight-linelightbeambetweentheLEDandLDRformedtheLOA of the robotic arm. The resistance of LDR decreased when the lightbeam fell on the LDR's sensing surface. A comparator (LM741) IC contin-uously compared the voltage across the LDR and a reference voltage be-tween two resistors (R3 and R4). The output voltage of the comparatorproduced a driving current whenever the voltage difference was high.

55This driving current-controlled the switching of the relay to actuate therotation of the DC motor. A potentiometer was provided to adjust thevalue of the reference voltage.2.3.2. Design and development of the robotic armThe developed 3 DOF serial robot arm consisted of the three links(a
1,a2anda 3)andthree jointangles,asshown inFig.3. Thejointbetween link(a

3and the orientation of AC with AB is θ
2. The joint angle formed between link ( a 2) and link (a 3)i sθ 5. One end of the link (a
3) was connected to the joint ‘B’, and a gripper C (x, y, z) was attached the to the other end of the link. The referenceframe OXYZ is located at the mid-plane of the link ( a
1). Hence, by vary- ing the joint angles at O, A and B, the gripper location, C (x, y, z) could bepositioned at a desired point in the Cartesian space. The gripper point C(x, y, z) was projected on XY plane at point D (x, y, 0). Distance betweenthe base of the robot (0,0,0) and point D (x, y, 0) is r
1whereas the dis- tance between joint‘A’(0, 0, a
1) and gripper point C (x, y, z) is r 2.

Inverse kinematics.Inverse kinematics (IK) was used to computejoint angles for the given end-effector position ( x,y, z) and orientation in Cartesian space using a geometric approach.

andθ 4were decided using the above equations of inverse kinematics.2.3.2.3. Workspace of the robotic arm.The computation of all the reach-able positions of the gripper of the robotic arm in the Cartesian spaceis termed as workspace. The workspace was used to decide optimumlink lengths for the robotic arm. Based on known link length, suitable ac-tuators for the link joints were selected. The forward kinematic equa-tions were used in MATLAB software for generating workspace, asshown inFig. 4. The link lengths for the robotic arm considered for theworkspace are: a
1–50 mm, a 2–100 mm and a 3–170 mm (including the length of the gripper 80 mm). These link lengths were selected to en-sure that the robotic arm could easily pick up the pot seedlings from dif-ferent positions in the conveyor. For generating maximum reachableworkspace, joint angles were provided as given below:Base joint O: 0≤θ
1≤180° (condition for maximum reachability).ShoulderjointA:-60°≤θ
4≤60°(toavoidcollisionbetweentwolinks).Elbow joint B: - 60°≤θ
3≤60°.The designed robotic arm was needed to pick the pot seedlings lo-cated at multiple positions in the feeding conveyor and drop these potseedlings at the dropping point without making any collision withother pot seedlings or with the feeding conveyor. The maximum andminimum reachable position of the gripper in the XY plane togetherwith the workspace of the robotic arm superimposed on it is shown inFig. 5. It can be seen in thisﬁgure that the designed robotic arm had topick seedlings fromﬁve positions (P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5) and drop allthese seedlings at position D. Distance between the base of the roboticarm to the seedling pickup positions P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5 were 180mm, 220 mm, 210 mm, 220 mm and 180 mm, respectively. PositionsP 1a n dP 5b e l o n g e dt ot h eﬁrst row. P2, P3 and P4 belonged to the sec-ond row of the feeding conveyor. The three columns in the middle of theﬁrst row were kept empty as these positions were not covered in theworkspace of the robotic arm as it had to move in an arc.2.3.2.4. Developed robotic arm.The mechanical structure of the roboticarm consisted of three serial links (base-shoulder, shoulder-elbow, andelbow-gripper)whichwereconnectedbyrevolutejoints.Differentserial

56links (shoulder-elbow–100 mm and elbow-gripper –170 mm) were made by using 2 mm thick aluminium sheet. The base was the platformonwhichtheshoulder,elbowandgripperlinkswererested.Abasestruc-ture was constructed to avoid direct load on the base servo motor (usingmounting links, base plate, bearing (608zz) and coupler (base-shoulder−50mm)asshowninFig.6.Allthelinkswereconnectedserially.Abear-ing was attached to the housing of the base plate to avoid direct load onthe base servo motor and to provide smoother movement to the roboticarm. A coupler was used for transferring motion from the base servomotor to the shoulder link. A gripper with two jaws, which opened andclosed by the control of a servo motor, was rigidly ﬁxed to the end of the elbow link. Since the pot seedlings were cylindrical in shape havingadiameterof35mm,awider widthtypegripperjaw withcurvedcontactwasfabricatedusingPLA(Polylacticacid)material(3dprinted)asshowninFig. 6for increasing the holding ability of the gripper jaw ( Yamanobe and Nagata, 2010;Harada et al., 2016).2.3.2.5. Circuit components.The robotic arm comprised three mechanicallink joints which were driven by actuators. Therefore, the accuracy ofthe movement of the robotic arm was dependent on the precise controlof the actuators. Hence, the selection of suitable controller, sensor, elec-tric power converters and actuators were needed. Servo motor, currentsensor, microcontroller (Table 1), buffer IC and 12 V battery were usedfor developing an electronic circuit for the robotic arm.Four servo motors were selected for the robotic arm out of whichthree servo motors for the shoulder joint, elbow joint and gripper (Hi-Tec HS-422, 6 V) and one for the base joint (Dynamixel ax-12, 12 V).A microcontroller (Arduino Uno) was used to compute the algorithmand generate a (PWM) pulse width modulation signal. A buffer IC74LS24 was incorporated for a unit gain ampli ﬁer in an integrated cir- cuit for controlling dynamixel motor to provide pass signals or datapackets. The voltage converter circuit was designed using LM317T andvarious components for getting output voltage in the range of 3 V to12 V. This circuit was used for supplying current with 6 V to the threeservo motors and microcontroller. Two current sensors (ACS712)were used as an overload protection device for the robotic arm. When-ever a high current was detected, a relay switch was activated to discon-nect the circuit from the main power supply.2.3.2.6. Working of the robotic arm.The servo motors wereprovided withprecise angles to ensure proper grasping of the pot seedlings for pickingfrom the pickup positions. There wereﬁve pickup positions P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5 (Fig. 5); thus, joint angles were calculated for each of themusing inverse kinematics equations. Initially, the gripper was kept at Di.e., the dropping point. In order to achieve collision-free movement ofthe robotic arm, the sequence of movement was set in the followingorder: the opening of gripper –upward rotation of elbow –upward rota- tion of shoulder joints–rotation of base joint to move the robotic arm to-wards pick up position–rotation of elbow and shoulder joints to lowerthe gripper–closing of the gripper. The sequence for dropping the potseedlings was in the order: rotation of elbow and shoulder joints to liftthe gripper (while the pot was held between the gripper jaws) –rotation of base joint to move robotic arm near dropping point –rotation of elbow

57andshoulderjointstolowerthegripper –openingofthegripper.Analgo- rithm was written to perform these tasks using the microcontroller.The microcontroller was preprogrammed based on the angle ofjoints and their sequence of movements to reach all picking positionsand dropping position. Theﬂow chart of the working sequence of therobotic arm is given inFig. 7. The robotic arm was initiated by providinga power supply to the input/output pins of the microcontroller. The mi-crocontroller read the pickup and drop locations from EEPROM memoryand provided PWM signals to the corresponding servo motor. A currentsensor was used to measure current consumption by the servo motor,and this current value was monitored by the microcontroller. Whenthe current value exceeded 2 A, the microcontroller generated a pulseto activate the relay switch to stop power supply.2.3.2.7. Simulation of the robot arm for pick and place of pot seedlings. The roboticarmpathplanningandtrajectorywerevalidatedbythekinematicsimulation carried out using ADAMS multibody simulation software. Inorder to determine the position and velocity of the robot joints duringthe pick and drop cycle, a kinematic diagram was constructed by provid-ingtheactuallinkparametersoftheroboticarmandtheperformancewassimulated for the input joint motion for one pick and drop cycle.A simulation cycle refers to the movement of the manipulator fromthe initial position to any pickup positions (P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5) inthe workspace of the robotic arm, picking up of the seedling and then ﬁ- nally dropping the seedling at the dropping position D. Since the roboticarm could reach multiple pick up positions in a similar way. Hence, anyof the pickup and, drop positions was simulated for analysis. The simu-lation analysis presented below is for the complete cycle to fetch theseedling located at position P5, the farthest position among the pickup positions from the dropping point. The motion parameters com-prised the angular rotation of robotic arm joints ( ‘-‘sign indicates coun- terclockwise rotation) in sequence to perform the pick and drop cyclefor seedling P

Performance evaluation of the feeding conveyorThe performance of the feeding conveyor was evaluated in terms ofrun time required for intermittent rotation of the conveyor shaft tomove the pot seedlings into the workspace of the robotic arm and thepower required to operate the feeding conveyor.Initially, the developed electronic circuit for the feeding conveyorwas tested in terms of time taken to move a group of pot seedlings(ﬁve in number) to the workspace of the robotic arm. For this, an oscil-loscope was connected to +ve end of the DC motor and no pot seedlingwas observed at LOA. Then, the conveyor was powered to run the con-veyor to move the pot seedlings to the workspace of the robotic arm.When the seedlings touched the LOA, the conveyor was stopped. Thepulse (V, volt vs time, ms) corresponding to the starting and stoppingof the conveyor was detected with an oscilloscope ( Fig. 8b).2.5. Testing of the developed robotic arm based metering mechanismThe experiment included testing of the feeding conveyor and the ro-botic arm for measuring power consumption and cycle time required topick and drop a single pot seedling. In order to test the performance ofthe designed metering mechanism, experiments were carried out inthe laboratory. This system was also evaluated in the ﬁeld by mounting the metering unit on a propelling vehicle, as shown in Fig. 9.2.5.1. Experimental procedure for evaluating the developed robotic armbased metering mechanismTesting of the developed metering unit was carried out in the labora-tory under the stationary condition and moving condition in the ﬁeld. The robotic arm was pre-programmed to pick and drop pot seedlingsfrom allﬁve positions of the conveying unit. In this experiment, 21 daysold tomato pot seedlings were used for testing. Initially, the pot seedlingswere loaded in the cells of the feeding conveyor except for the ﬁrst row of the feeding conveyor, and then two s eedlings were placed at positions P1 and P5 of theﬁrst row (Fig. 5). The initially loaded seedlings werenoted as Nt. When the conveyor was powered, it pushed the pot seedlingstowards the robotic arm pick up positions (in the working space of the ro-botic arm). After that, the robotic arm was actuated to pick the pot seed-lings and drop the same at the dropping point. During the graspingaction (pick and drop operation) few seedlings got damaged (N
dam)a n d were recorded for further analysis. For efﬁcient picking of pot seedlings, pots were required to be placed accurately at robotic arm pick up positionswithout tilting. The angle of inclination of pot seedlings from the vertical

58was measured at the pickuppositions.The gripper of the robotic arm couldnot hold the seedlings properly when the pot seedlings were tilted above25
0(considered as the threshold angle) from the vertical of the conveyorbase plate. The number of inclined seedlings on the feeding conveyorwas noted to determine the conveying efﬁciency. The seedlings in upright orientation without any signiﬁcant inclination were only allowed to behandled by the robotic arm. The inclination of seedlings present in thefeeding conveyor was closely observed. The signi ﬁcantly inclined seed- lings were removed quickly and counted (N
i). The seedlings were allowed to be picked by the gripper from the pickup positions and to drop the sameat the drop position. The dropped seedlings were carefully observed, andthe number of damaged pots and seedlings (N
dam) was noted. A total of 21 tomato pot seedlings were placed in the feeding conveyor, and six rep-lications were made (21 × 6 = 126 runs) for laboratory tests. In the ﬁeld, six replications were made with each plot of size of 15 × 6 m.2.5.2. Data analysisData on the number of seedlings while feeding, conveying andtransplanting operation was noted down. The seedling conveying ef ﬁ- ciency (CE), metering efﬁciency (ME) and overall efﬁciency (OE) were computedusingthefollowingequations( Nandede and Raheman, 2015):CE¼

Performance of feeding conveyorThe run time of the conveyor computed from Fig. 8bw a sf o u n dt o be 450 ms. Power requirement for operating the feeding conveyorwas found out by measuring the current using a multimeter. A con-stant 12 V DC was supplied and the maximum current consumptionwas measured as 1.5A. The maximum power consumed by the feed-ing conveyor was found to be 18 W (12 V × 1.5 A).3.2. Performance of robot arm3.2.1. Based on the simulation studyFrom the simulation results, the Cartesian position (X, Y, and Z) ofthe gripper with respect to time in one cycle is shown in Fig. 10.I t w a sf o u n dt h a tt h et i m er e q u i r e dt oc o m p l e t eo n ec y c l ew a s2 . 7s .The simulated angular velocity proﬁle of all three joints (base, shoul-der and elbow) of the robotic arm for completing a pick and dropcycle is shown inFig. 11. It can be seen in thisﬁgure that the velocity proﬁle initially increased gradually from the rest position to a maxi-mum velocity and then gradually reduced until it reached the desiredlocation. The maximum velocity of the base joint, elbow joint andshoulder joint was 125° s−1, 117.5° s−1and 173° s−1,r e s p e c t i v e l y . The differences in velocity of active joints were basically to synchro-nize the input joint motion for reaching the different target angularpositions.The translational velocity of the gripper for pick and drop of sin-gle pot seedling is shown inFig. 12. The minimum and maximum ve-locity of the gripper was found to be 93 and 426 mm s
−1, respectively.

603.2.2. Power requirement for operation of the robotic armThe power required for operating the robotic arm depends upon thenumber of joints, the weight of the links and payload (i.e., the weight ofpot seedling). The current consumption of the robotic arm wasmeasured with a multi-meter. By providing a constant DC voltage(12 V), the maximum current required for operating the robotic armwhile handling paper pot seedlings was measured to be 1.33 A. Hence,the power requirement of the robotic arm was found to be 16 W.Table 3Performance of the metering unit under laboratory condition.S.

613.2.3. Cycle time of the robotic armThe cycle time of the robotic arm to pick and drop seedlings wasmeasured using a stopwatch and found to be varying from 2.5 to 3.1 s(for positions P1 to P5). The deviation in average actual cycle time andsimulated cycle time of robotic arm for P5 position was due to friction,gripper opening/closing time and algorithm computation time by themicrocontroller. The robotic arm could able to pick and drop 20 seed-lings min
−1. The time required to move the next group of pot seedlingsto the workspace of the robotic arm in the feeding conveyor was foundto be 450 ms. This means by the time the robotic arm dropped the lastseedlings from a row from position P5, the conveyor could move thenext row of seedlings to the pickup positions. Thus, the robotic armwas able to continuously pick up the pot seedlings from the feeding con-veyor and drop these seedlings into the delivery tube.3.3. Performance of the robotic arm with feeding conveyorThe sequence of operation made by the robotic arm to pick the potseedlings from position P1 and to drop it at D is shown in Fig. 13a–e. The robotic armﬁrst approached a pot seedling and gripped it by actu-ating the gripper (Fig. 13a). Then the pot seedling was lifted from theconveyor by actuating the shoulder and elbow joint of the robotic arm(Fig. 13b). The seedling was then moved from P1 to D by rotating thebase joint (Fig. 13c). Finally, the seedling was dropped at the droppingpoint, D by opening the gripper (Fig. 13da n de ) .3.3.1. Performance of the metering mechanism under the stationary labora-tory condition and moving condition in the ﬁeld The results of the metering unit evaluated under the stationarycondition in the laboratory are summarized in Table 3.T h ec o n v e y - ing efﬁciency of the feeding conveyor refers to successfully placingof seedling at the robot pickup position without tilting, andmetering efﬁciency refers to the successfully picking and droppingof the pot seedlings at the dropping point into the seedling deliverytube without causing any damage to the pots and seedlings. Convey-ing efﬁciency, metering efﬁciency and overall efﬁciency were com- puted using Eqs.(13), (14) and (15), respectively. The average values of the conveying, metering and overall ef ﬁciency under labo- ratory conditions were observed to be 96.83%, 95.91% and 92.86%,respectively.The testing of the metering mechanism in moving conditions in theﬁeld is shown inFig. 14.From theﬁeld tests, the quality of transplanting as indicated by theseedling planting rate, percent missed planting, percent tilted plantingand overall planting efﬁciency are computed and summarized inTable 4for the individual plots. From this Table, it can be seen that thedeveloped metering mechanism could drop on an average 20 pot seed-lings per min. The average percentage of missed planting that occurreddue to damage of pots within the machine during the metering of potseedlings was found to be 4.44%.Kumar and Raheman (2011)reported the percentage of missedplanting and tilted planting as 4.01% and 5.14%, respectively with aﬁeld capacity of 0.026 ha/h for a walk-behind type fully automatic veg-etable transplanter that used pot seedlings. In the present study, aver-age missed plantings and tilted plantings were 4.33% and 5.43%,respectively with an averageﬁeld capacity of 0.021 ha/h. A little highermissed and tilted planting occurred due to damage of pots during themetering process by the feeding conveyor and robotic arm.Around 4 to 6% of the total pot seedlings of tomato planted by the de-veloped metering mechanism were found tilted after falling into thefurrow.Chaudhuri et al. (2002)reported the percentage of tilted plant-ing as 4.00 to 13.43 for the semi-automatic vegetable transplanter dueto soil condition prevailed in theﬁeld. In the present study, pot seed-lings tilted during transplanting due to partial covering of seedlingpots with soil by the furrow closer and failure of pot seedlings to fallin upright orientation through the seedling delivery tube. A close viewof the seedlings dropped into the furrow is shown in Fig. 14(b and c). The average conveying, metering and overall ef ﬁciency of the metering unit in theﬁeld condition were found to be 94.7%, 93.28%and 88.33%, respectively. The sources of reduced ef ﬁciencies from the ideal (100%) are due to: a) inclinations and tilting occurred during con-veying of the seedlings due to friction and operating speed of the con-veyor and b) damage occurring to the seedlings by the robot arm dueto higher force of gripping the seedlings. These reductions in ef ﬁciency are not so high, hence, the developed robotic arm could be successfullyused to handle pot seedlings in a vegetable transplanter.4. ConclusionsA 3 DOF serial robotic arm based metering mechanism was devel-oped to automate the vegetable transplantation process using tomatoseedlings raised in paper pots weighing 44 to 47 g with a total powerconsumption of 16 W. An LDR and LED based sensing system was devel-oped to detect the presence of the seedlings on the feeding conveyor. Itsuccessfully sensed the presence of pot seedlings at LOA and controlledthe movement of the conveyor precisely. The power required for oper-ating the feeding conveyor was 18 W only and it required 450 ms tomove a group of pot seedlings into the workspace of the robotic arm.The developed robotic arm could pick and drop pot seedling fromdifferent positions in the conveyor with a cycle time between 2.5 and3.1 s. These variations were because of variation in the distance of pick-ing positions from the dropping point. The robotic arm could success-fully pick and drop 20 seedlings per min. The average values of theconveying, metering and overall efﬁciency of the developed meteringmechanism were 96.83%, 95.91% and 92.86%, respectively, under labo-ratory conditions as compared to 94.7%, 93.28% and 88.33%, underﬁeld condition. The measured efﬁciencies underﬁeld conditions were found to be reduced due to the vibrations produced during the move-ment of the transplanter in theﬁeld. It was observed that the developedrobotic metering unit could operate at much lesser power input with re-duced size and mechanisms without much difference from the perfor-mance of mechanical type pot seedling transplanter. Thus the use ofrobotic metering mechanism could increase the feasibility of commer-cializing the transplanters by reducing the overall cost withoutcompromising the performance.Declaration of competing interestThe authors have no conﬂict of interestAcknowledgementTheﬁnancial support received from the Indian Council of Agricul-tural Research (ICAR), Ministry of Agriculture, Govt. of India (Agri.Engg.27(4)/2015-AE) to carry out this research work is sincerelyacknowledged.Table 4Performance of the metering unit under ﬁeld condition.S.
