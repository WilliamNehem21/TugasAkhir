Keywords:Response surface methodologyArtiﬁcial neural networkOptimizationTerminalia catappaL. kernelIn this study, response surface methodology (RSM) and arti ﬁcial neural network (ANN) were used to optimize Terminalia catappaL. kernel oil (TCKO) yield. Solvent extraction method was used for the oil extraction, withn-hexane as the extracting solvent. The highest oil yield was obtained at 55 °C, 150 min, and 0.5 mm. The phys-icochemical properties of the TCKO were determined using standard methods. Gas chromatographic (GC) anal-ysis and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) were respectively, used to determine the fatty acid composition andprevalent functional groups in TCKO. At optimum conditions of temperature, particle size and extraction time,the RSM predicted oil yield was 62.92%, which was validated as 60.34%, whereas ANN predicted yield was60.39%, which was validated as 60.40%. The results of the physicochemical characterization of TCKO showedthat the dielectric strength (DS), viscosity, ﬂash and pour points values were 30.61 KV, 20.29 mm
2s−1,2 6 0° C , and 3 °C, respectively. Physicochemical characterization and FTIR results of TCKO indicated its potential industrialapplication, especially as transformer ﬂuid. Fatty acids compositions result indicated that the oil was highly un- saturated; while XRD results ofTerminalia catappaL. kernel (TCK) samples obtained, both before and after extrac- tion, showed difference in their peaks and corresponding intensities, due to the damage effect of solvent. Finally,the obtained optimization results indicated that ANN was a better and more effective tool than RSM, due to itshigher R

1. IntroductionVegetable oil is one of the essential substances that are obtainedfrom seeds and nuts. It often determines the applicability of the seeds/nuts for both local and industrial uses. Recently, the demands formore seeds and nuts with high oil yield have increased. This is attrib-uted to the need for the production of bio based oils for industrial appli-cations. The high biodegradability of bio based vegetable oils hasincreased their demand, hence encouraging the commercial cultivationof such seeds and nuts. As a result of this, more improved and high oilyield varieties of seeds and nuts have been developed in many agricul-tural research institutes across the globe ( Leakey et al., 2003). Conse- quently, over the years, these improved varieties have been massivelyplanted and have grown into important economic trees, bearing theseoil seeds and nuts in large quantities ( Manyong et al., 2005). Some of such oil seeds and nuts include but not limited to soya bean, palmtrees,Jatropha curcas, groundnut,Terminalia catappaL.,Irvingia gabonensis(IG) etc.Lately, global concern about the safety of petroleum and syntheticbased oils, as well as the environmental concern associated with theirnon-biodegradability nature, have led to more attention being shiftedtowards the used of vegetable based oils for both domestic and indus-trial applications. That notwithstanding, the choice of the seeds/nuts isalso of great importance. This is to ensure that more of the non-foodcompeting ones are used for industrial purposes. Hence, one of the rea-sons for the choice ofTerminalia catappaL. in this present work, since it is non-food competing.In Nigeria,Terminalia catappaL. is mostly planted for the provision ofshades and for ornamental purposes, with little or no attention paid tothe seeds and kernels. As such, it is highly underutilized for both domes-tic and industrial purposes, except for the minimal consumption of theﬂeshy fruit and kernels by little children in some rural areas ( Agu, 2014).Terminalia catappaL. belongs to combretaceae family and is na-tive to Malaya and the Andamanso (Iha et al., 2014). The oil content of the kernels varies and ranges between 49 and 64% ( Menkiti et al., 2015;Iha et al., 2014;D o sS a n t o se ta l . ,2 0 0 8). Its kernel is rich in protein and carbohydrate, with the percentage ranges from 17% to 18.39% and25.61%, respectively (Adepoju et al., 2014).Terminalia catappaL. kernel (TCK) contains hung quantity of fatty acid with the total saturated fattyArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 1 –11

journal homepage:http://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/artificial-intelligence-in-agriculture/acid content reported to be 34.2%, while the total unsaturated fatty as64.5% (Iha et al., 2014).With relatively high oil yield ofTerminalia catappaL. kernel, there is need to develop new methods of oil extraction from it, as well as carryout the optimization and statistical analysis of the extraction process pa-rameters. Like other seeds/nuts,Terminalia catappakernel oil can be ex- tracted by a number of methods, such as supercritical method,ultrasound-assisted method, mechanical process and solvent extractionmethods (Da Porto et al., 2012;Yolmeh et al., 2014;Li et al., 2009; Sulaiman et al., 2013). However, higher yield and low turbid oil, aswell as relatively easy operation of solvent extraction equipment, en-courage its utilization, when compared to the other methods men-tioned. Thus, reason behind its application in the present study usingn-hexane as the extracting solvent.Solvent extraction method has been utilized in the past for the ex-traction of vital oil from a number of seeds and nuts, such as Jetropha curcas(Devappa et al., 2010), soyabean (Navarro Cerutti et al., 2012), castor seed (Pradhan et al., 2012), coconut (Sulaiman et al., 2013), to- bacco seed (Nicotiana tabacumL.) (Stanisavljevic´ et al., 2007), grape seed (Fernandez et al., 2010), Avocado (Persea americana)(Dos Santos et al., 2014),Colocynthis vugaris Shradseed (Agu et al., 2018)a n d hemp seed (Kostićet al., 2013), because of its efﬁciency and relatively inexpensive nature. The extraction yield of oil obtained from Terminalia catappaL. by solvent extraction method using soxhlet extractor and n-hexane as solvent is mainly inﬂuenced by the extraction process param-eters. The effects of process parameters like extraction time, particle sizeand temperature were often evaluated for modeling and optimizationpurposes. Hence, the modeling, optimization and statistical evaluationof the process parameters and response (oil yield), during oil extractionprocess, using response surface methodology (RSM) and arti ﬁcial neu- ral network (ANN), become very important.Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is a statistical and mathemat-ical tool used for process optimization that involves the responses thatare to be optimized, based on the process parameters ( Betiku and Ajala, 2014). It is a vital optimization tool that is used in a number of en-gineering applications (Nazghelichi et al., 2011). The usefulness of RSM in industrial research has been seen especially for situations wherebythe numbers of process variables inﬂuencing the response(s) are many (Betiku and Ajala, 2014;Gopinath et al., 2010). One of the very important advantages of RSM is the reduction in the number of experi-mental runs, and still has the capability of providing acceptable results(Onoji et al., 2017;
Betiku and Ajala, 2014). RSM also has the advantage of generating second-order polynomial equation, which relates the de-pendent(s) or response(s) to the independent or process parameters(Onoji et al., 2017). RSM has been used for the optimization of oil ex-traction yields. For instance,Onoji et al. (2017), optimizedHevea brasiliensis(rubber seed) oil extraction using RSM and obtained42.98 wt% oil yield at optimum conditions. Similarly, Reshad et al. (2015)andKostićet al. (2013), respectively used RSM to optimize oilextraction yields of rubber seeds and hampseed, with obtained yieldsof 49.36 wt% and 30.43 wt%, respectively, at their different optimumconditions. In the work ofAgu et al. (2015), RSM was successfully used to optimizeTerminalia catappakernel oil yield, with yield of 60.45 wt% at optimum conditions.Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) are the most common arti ﬁcial learning tool (Betiku et al., 2015;Gueguim Kana et al., 2012). ANNs works on the basis of information processing that is synonymous tothe human brain. As such, it consists of clusters of interconnected neu-rons, hence, can function as a modeling tool for solving complex non-linear processes between the input and output of a system ( Ameer et al., 2017;Nazghelichi et al., 2011). Aside its modeling ability, ANNscan also be used for prediction, control and optimization of processes(Fayyazi et al., 2015;Waewsak et al., 2010;Esonye et al., 2019a). Its op- timization ability has been seen in the optimization of bioprocesses,such as biogas production (Gueguim Kana et al., 2012;Waewsak et al., 2010), methyl ester production (Esonye et al., 2019b), as well as inthe esteriﬁcation and transesteriﬁcation processes (Ofoefule et al., 2019). Over the years, ANNs have been applied in solving several engi-neering, science, medicine, mathematics, neurology, metrology, psy-chology and biology problems (Betiku and Ajala, 2014). However, in terms of oil extraction modeling and optimization, a number of workshave successfully used ANNs. For instance, Onoji et al. (2017)success- fully modeled and optimizedHevea brasiliensis(rubber seed) oil extrac- tion yield using ANNs. Similarly,Zahedi and Azarpour (2011)optimized passiﬂora seed oil extraction using ANNs. ANNs were also successfullyused byShokri et al. (2011)andKostićet al. (2013)for the modeling and optimization ofPimpinella anisumL. seed and hampseed oils extrac-tion, respectively. However, to the best knowledge of the authors, thereis no literature information that compares the ef ﬁcacies of RSM and ANNs in the modeling ofTerminalia catappaL. kernel oil extraction. Therefore, this work focused on the inﬂuence of these process pa- rameters on the oil yield of TCK, as well as the modeling of solvent ex-traction ofTerminalia catappaL. kernel oil using RSM and ANNs, forpossible industrial application of the base ﬂuid as transformer oil. Fur- thermore, the physicochemical properties of the oil were examinedusing standard methods. Furthermore, gas chromatography (GC) andFourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) were used to determine the fattyacid compositions and functional groups present in the oil, respectively.Finally, the X-ray diffractometry was used to reveal the characteristics ofthe crystalline structure of both the TCK and the residue left afterextraction.2. Materials and methods2.1. MaterialsTCK were collected from Nsukka Local Government Area, EnuguState, Nigeria. N-hexane and other chemicals of analytical grades wereprocured from Conraws laboratory chemical vendor in Enugu. The re-agents were used without further puriﬁcation.2.2. Methods2.2.1. Sample preparationPrior to oil extraction fromTerminalia catappaL. kernels (TCK), its external coatings were carefully cracked, and the kernels were removedand cleaned. The kernels were sun dried, and thereafter oven dried at60 °C for 12 h. The dried TCK were then ground using electrical grinder.Different sieve plates sizes were used to separate the ground TCK inother obtain 5 different particle size diameters of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and2.5 mm.2.2.2. Terminalia catappa L. kernel (TCK) oil extractionSolvent extraction method using soxhlet extractor was used for theextraction process. The process was carried out following the proceduredescribed by the authors in their previous works on TCK oil extraction(Menkiti et al., 2015;Agu et al., 2015). The oil yields obtained at the end of the extraction process under the speci ﬁed different process con- ditions (seeMenkiti et al., 2015;Agu et al., 2015) were calculated and recorded. The solute to solvent ratio used for the process was 1:10(15 g, 150 ml), mass-by-volume. The entire process was carried outthree times and the average values that were determined were then re-ported. The solvent extraction using n-hexane, as well as the determina-tion of the percentage oil yields at different conditions, were carried outaccording to the Association of Ofﬁcial Analytical ChemistsAOAC (1979) method no. 963.15.The TCK oil yield was calculated using Eq.

Physicochemical properties of Terminalia catappa L. kernel oil (TCKO)Physicochemical characterizations were carried out on the TCKOsample. Standard methods were used for the determination of thesevital properties. The oil density (AOAC 985.19), iodine value (AOAC993.20) and acidity/acid value (AOAC 969.17), were determined ac-cording toAOAC (1990)approved techniques. On the other hand, theviscosity and dielectric strength were determined following ASTM D445 (2011)andIEC 60156 (2003)standard methods, respectively. Furthermore, pour andﬂash points were determined using ASTM D97and ASTM D93, standard test method, respectively ( ASTM, 2008). The ﬂash point was measured using a Pensky-Martens closed cup tester.The moisture content was determined using ASTM E203 standard testmethod. Every physicochemical property was measured three times,and the average values were calculated and recorded.2.2.4. Fatty acid composition determination of TCKOThe fatty acid proﬁle of TCKO was analyzed using gas chromatogra-phy (GC) (Shimadzu GC–14B, Model 910), according toAOAC (1990) 996.06. This equipment was equipped with a ﬂame ionization detection system. The column was HP 88 capillary column (0.25 mm i.d. × 100 m,ﬁlm thickness 0.25μm–Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The oventemperature program and other operating conditions are as describedin the author's previous work on GC analysis of TCKO ( Menkiti et al., 2017). Each fatty acid quantity acid was determined from the percent-age area of the individual fatty acid ( Menkiti et al., 2017;Zahedi and Azarpour, 2011). The analysis was carried out three times.2.2.5. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysisThe FTIR analysis of the TCKO sample was carried out using BUCKScientiﬁc Infrared Spectrophotometer Model 530.2.2.6. X-ray diffraction (XRD)The XRD analyses of theTerminalia catappaL. kernels (TCK) and its residue after oil extraction were carried out using EMPYREAN analytical,Netherlands.2.3. Design of experimental for TCKO extraction and statistical analysisusing RSMOil extractions from each of TCK sample using n-hexane wasmodeled and optimized using central composite design (CCD). Athree-factor-ﬁve-level CCD, which generated 20 experimental runsthat were afterward carried out, was used in the modeling and optimi-zation studies. The independent/process variables considered for theoptimization process include temperature X
1(°C), particle size X 2
(mm), and extraction time X 3(min). The temperature range of 35 to55 °C, particle size of 0.5 to 2.5 mm, and extraction times of 30 to150 min were carefully chosen. The coded and uncoded levels of theseindependent variables are shown inTable 1. The experimental design was based on CCD, and by using theﬁve levels, the CCD generated 20 ex-perimental runs as shown inTable 2.Table 2shows the run order, var- iable conditions and the columns for the experimental, predicted andresidual values of the TCK oil yields. Multiple regression analysis wasused as a tool for the assessment of the effects of the independentvariables (temperature, particle size and extraction time) on the depen-dent variable (% oil Yield) (Boonmee et al., 2010). Second-order polyno- mial model, shown in Eq.(2)was used to analyze the response surfaceregression procedure for predicting the response variable (%Y).%Y¼β0þβ1X1−β2X2þβ3X3

Conﬁdence levels of 95% were the basis for test ofstatistical signiﬁcance.2.4. Modeling and optimization by ANNCommercial ANN software, using Neural Network Toolbox ofMATLAB R2017a software package was used in this study. The TCKOyield was successfully predicted using Multilayer Full Feedforward(MFFF) and Multilayer Normal Feedforward (MNFF) neural networks.The networks were trained by Incremental Back Propagation (IBP).The ANN architecture consisted of an input layer with three neurons,an output layer with one neuron and a hidden layer. The optimal net-work topology was determined with one hidden layer, while the num-ber of neurons in hidden layer and the hidden layer transfer functionand output layer were determined iteratively, through the developmentof series of networks. The individual ANNs were trained using 1000 iter-ations. The CCD experimental data were used for both training andtesting.2.5. Veriﬁcation of dataThe predicted TCKO oil yields obtained from RSM and ANN werecompared with the experimentally obtained responses. This wasaimed at the evaluation of the efﬁcacy of the both optimization methods. Coefﬁcient of determination (R

Similarly, the RMS was used for comparing theRSM and ANN predicted and experimental values, for purpose ofTable 1Uncoded and coded levels of independent variables of the TCKO extraction process.Variable Symbol LevelAxial (−α) Low Center High Axial (+ α)−1.633−1 0 1 1.633 Temperature (°C) X

Processﬂow chartFig. 1shows theﬂow chart of the processes/steps that are containedin this work. From the chart, it could be seen that prior to the extractionof oil fromTerminalia catappaL. kernel (TCK), the TCK sample wasﬁrst prepared. This was done by sorting, drying and milling the TCK samplein other to obtain the required particles size. Design of experiment wasdone using central composite design (CCD). A three-factor- ﬁve-level CCD, which generated 20 experimental runs that were afterwardcarried out, was used in the modeling and optimization studies. There-after, oil was extracted from the TCK sample using solvent extractionmethod, and n-hexane as the extracting solvent. X-ray diffraction(XRD) analyses were carried out on the milled TCK and residue samplesleft after the extraction. Similarly, physicochemical characterization,Gas chromatographic (GC) analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared(FTIR) analysis, were carried out on the extracted TCK oil (TCKO).Modeling and optimization studies were carried out using response sur-face methodology (RSM) and Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN). Finally,veriﬁcation/validation of the obtained data was then carried.3. Results and discussionOil was extracted from TCK using solvent extraction method.

0is stronger (Talib et al., 2016). Therefore, the model for TCK oil extraction was found to be signi ﬁcant as its p-value was = 0.000 andb0.05. Similarly, the terms (X
1,X2,X3,X32,X2X3) in the TCK model were all signiﬁcant (pb.05) (Table 3). The characteristics parameters that may express the quality (good-ness ofﬁt) of the proposed second order polynomial model (Eq. (6)), are the coefﬁcient of determination (R
2) and adjusted R2(Adj-R2) (Mazaheri et al., 2017). FromTable 4,t h ev a l u eo fR
2for TCK oil extrac- tion process is 96.94%. The closer the R
2to 1 (100%), the better theﬁt. Similarly, the value of the R
2Adj. is 94.18%. The value of R2, shows signif- icant closeness to 1, hence, indicate goodﬁt. The values of the predicted model R
2and the adjusted R2were both found to be very high (Table 4). The closeness between R
2and Adj-R2values, in addition to the lower value of Adj-R
2compared to the R2value, for the model, indicates good-ness of dataﬁt(Mazaheri et al., 2017;Wu et al., 2016;Mirhosseini and Tabatabaee, 2012;Samaram et al., 2015;Betiku and Ajala, 2014;Li et al., 2009;Agu et al., 2018;Agu et al., 2015). In other words, the better the empirical modelﬁt the experimental data (Danbaba et al., 2015). Since the model (Eq.(6)) was statistically signiﬁcant, it was used to predict the optimum condition values for obtaining maximum oil yieldof TCK sample using Minitab 17.0 software. The optimum conditions formaximum TCK oil yield with respect to the proposed model equationwere 55 °C, 0.5 mm particle size and 150 min. At these conditions, theRSM theoretically obtained oil yield was 62.92%, which was validatedas 60.34%. The validation experiment was done by carrying out three in-dependent experimental replicates and the average recorded. The close-ness of the validated and predicted TCK oil yields, con ﬁrmed the adequacy and validity of the models.3.2. TCK oil extraction process: modeling and parameters optimizationusing ANNThe artiﬁcial neural network architecture was developed using Neu-ral Network Toolbox of MATLAB R2017a software package. In this study,several neural network architecture and topologies for the estimationand prediction of TCK oil yield were tested. Thereafter, the best ANNmodel was chosen. Learning algorithm and transfer function effectswere studied through the successful training of neural network model.This was done by employing the different learning algorithms andtransfer functions of ANN. The neural network learning rate is affectedby the transfer function which also aids its performance ( Betiku and Ajala, 2014). A series of topologies were examined so as to determinethe optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer and these valueswere varied from 10 to 15. Also, R
2and RMS were used to measure the predictability of the network. Hereafter, the best topology that is 3–12–1, which has three inputs (temperature, particle size andextraction time), twelve neurons as the optimum, and one output (%oil yield), was chosen and used to predict the oil yield of TCK sample.This was chosen due to the fact that the R2values of both training and testing sets, for the studied sample, were very close or approximately1.0; while the RMS error values were the least of all the topologies.The architecture of the chosen learning algorithm is depicted in Fig. 2. The Multilayer Full FeedForward (MFFF) Incremental Back Propagationnetwork, coupled with sigmoid function consisting of 3 –12–1t o p o l - ogy, was the ANN model used in this study. 10,000 iterations wereused for the learning.Fig. 3(a) shows a comparison of the ANN pre-dicted and experimental values. From the ﬁgure, it could be seen that the ANN was able to predict known data response, that is, the dataused for training. ANN was also able to predict the unknown data, thatis, the data that was not used for training. In other words, the ANNmodel can be used efﬁciently for the description of the relationship be-tween input variables (temperature, extraction time and particle size)for TCK oil extraction. The optimum conditions established for maxi-mum TCK oil yields using the network model were 55 °C, 0.5 mm and150 min. At these conditions, the theoretical oil yield was 60.39%. Thisvalue was validated as 60.40%. The validation experiments were doneby carrying out three independent experimental replicates and the av-erage value noted. The closeness of the validated and predicted oilyield conﬁrmed the adequacy and validity of the ANN model.3.3. Performance comparison of ANN and RSMIn order to check the models obtained from RSM and ANN, both R
2
and RMS were evaluated in the studied TCK sample ( Table 5). The ex- perimental and the predicated (RSM and ANN) models oil yields, themodels residuals and RMS values for TCK oil extraction, are presentedinTables 5. The obtained results indicated that both optimization toolsgave good predictions as supported by high values of the R
2and small values of RMS. The RSM's R
2value was 96.94% (0.9694), while theANN's R
2value was 0.9996 [seeFig. 3(a)]. However, ANN showed ob- servable superiority over RSM due to its higher R
2and smaller RMS ob- tained values. Also, the residual values obtained by calculating thedifference between the experimental and the models' (RSM and ANN)values, for the sample studied, indicated that the ANN had preeminenceover RSM, with smaller obtained residual values. Furthermore, data

Agu et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 1 –11higher than the values reported for cotton seed ( Khan et al., 2010) and soybean (Lawson et al., 2010). Hence, this is an indication of itspotential economic beneﬁt as well as possible industrial application.Similarly, oil yields of 50 and 49%, were reported for TCK obtained inBrazil byIha et al. (2014)andDos Santos et al. (2008), respectively. These values were less than that obtained in this work. These differ-ences in the obtained oil yields for TCK could be attributed to factorslike, geographical location, seed variety, harvest period, soil texturea n dm e t h o do fo i le x t r a c t i o nu s e d( Menkiti et al., 2015;Berti et al., 2011). Consequently, TCKO could constitute an alternative sourceof oil for industrial application as transformer ﬂuid because of its rel- atively high yield.Table 6also shows some important physicochemical properties ofTCKO. FromTable 6, it could be observed that the viscosity and acidityof TCKO were 20.29 mm
2S−1and 4.73 mg KOH/g, respectively. Though,these values differ from that reported by Iha et al. (2014),w i t ht h ev i s - cosity and acidity in this work being higher and lower, respectively,than 5.5 mm
2S−1and 150.9 mg KOH/g oil reported by Iha et al. (2014).I nw o r ko fDos Santos et al. (2008), they reported higher viscos- ity of TCKO (39.8 mm
2S−1). This high viscosity and the lower acid valueof TCKO in this report, compared to those reported by these other au-thors, could be due to the breed of Terminalia catappaL. (Ejikeme et al., 2010). Therefore, it could be afﬁrmed that breeds ofTerminalia catappaL. enhance its yield and oil properties. In this work, the iodinevalue (IV) of TCKO (101.86 g/I
2/100g oil) was higher than the 83.92 g/I
2/100g oil and 70.41 g/I 2/100g oil reported byDos Santos et al. (2008) andMonnet et al. (2012), respectively; but lower than 135.50 g/I
2/ 100g oil reported byAdepoju et al. (2014). The high iodine values of the oil are indication of the high level of unsaturation in the oils. Also,the density and moisture content of TCKO are 890 g/cm
3and 2.1 mg/kg, respectively (Table 6). This density was lower than871 g/cm
3reported byIha et al. (2014), while the moisture content was lower than 2.45 reported byAdepoju et al. (2014). Furthermore, the pour andﬂash points of TCKO are 3 and 260 °C, respectively(Table 6). This pour point value was lower than 11.5 °C reported byOrhevba et al. (2016)forTerminalia catappa. Similarly, theﬂash point in this work was higher than 208 °C, also reported by Orhevba et al. (2016). Finally, the dielectric strength (DS) value of Terminalia catappa kernel oil (TCKO) was 30.61 KV (Table 6). The dielectric strength is de-ﬁned as the maximum electricﬁeld, which a pure material/substancecan withstand under ideal conditions, without experiencing failure ofits insulating properties (Derick et al., 2014). This value was lower than that of soybean oil (39 KV), but higher than that of palm kerneloil (25 KV) (Usman et al., 2012). However, the DS value of TCKO was im-proved with further puriﬁcation and transesteriﬁcation to obtain mod- iﬁed TCKO transformerﬂuid (Menkiti et al., 2017;Agu et al., 2019). This is because in generally, oils with high DS is required for proper in-sulation and cooling in the transformer, since its insulating propertiesare not easily lost with time during transformer usage ( Menkiti et al., 2017;Agu et al., 2019).3.5. Fatty acid composition of TCKOThe fatty acid composition ofTerminalia catappakernel oil (TCKO) is presented inTable 7, while its fatty acid proﬁle is presented inFig. 4.I ti s important to note that one of the most important parameter that affectsthe fatty acid, as well as oil properties is the degree of unsaturation. Theiodine value gives an indication of this degree of unsaturation of oils(Ekpa and Isaac, 2013). Therefore, the iodine value of TCKO sample(seeTable 6), indicated that it is semi-drying oil. This was attributedto its iodine value that falls within the range of 90 to 130 g/I2/100g oil, required for semi-drying oils (Ekpa and Isaac, 2013;Guner et al., 2006). From the results inTable 7, TCKO had over 80% of its compositionas unsaturated fatty acid, with only about 17.60% as the saturated fattyacid. The saturated and unsaturated fatty acid compositions of TCKOwere 17.60% and 81.40%, respectively. This is an indication that the oilsample was highly unsaturated. Hence, the implication of this is thatthe oil sample cannot be used in its present state as an industrial ﬂuid, especially as transformer oil. This is attributed to their high level ofunsaturation. From the fatty acid proﬁle, it was found that TCKO is com- posed of six (6) fatty acids. These fatty acids are myristic, palmitic,hexadecadienoic, marganic, oliec and arachidic acids. Oleic acid wasthe predominant unsaturated fatty acid with 81.40% of the total unsatu-rated fatty acid composition. This high level of unsaturated fatty acid inthe TCKO is an indication of its high oxidation tendency ( Menkiti et al., 2015). There is therefore need to improve on its percentage saturatedfatty acid composition using chemical modi ﬁcation methods. This is to ensure that more stable oil is obtained for industrial purposes(Menkiti et al., 2017;Agu et al., 2019). On the other hand, myristic, palmitic, marganic and arachidic acids are the saturated fatty acid pres-ent in TCKO. From available information in literature, TCKO is highlycomposed of unsaturated fatty acids, with Oleic acid always present inhigh concentration. For instance,Iha et al. (2014),Dos Santos et al. (2008),Janporn et al. (2014),Adepoju et al. (2014)andMonnet et al. (2012), reported the that saturated and unsaturated fatty acid composi-tion ofTerminalia catappakernel oil, were (34% and 64.5%), (40% and60%), (40.08% and 54.75%), (39.82% and 60.18%) and (40.22% and60.14), respectively. The difference in the fatty acid composition ofTCKO in this work, and those of the previous works, could be attributedto factors, like geographical location and variety ( Menkiti et al., 2017; Ejikeme et al., 2010). Therefore, there is the need for the modi ﬁcation of the TCKO, in other to improve on its saturation level, prior to its pos-sible industrial application as transformer ﬂuid (Menkiti et al., 2017; Agu et al., 2019).3.6.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of Terminalia catappa L. kernel (TCK)and its residueX-ray diffractometry is widely used to reveal the characteristics ofthe crystalline structure of substances, such as, starch granules, milledseeds and nuts samples (Kaptso et al., 2014). The X-ray diffraction spec- tra from milledTerminalia catappaL. kernel (TCK) sample obtained bothbefore and after extraction are presented in Fig. 6. The XRD patterns suggest the crystalline nature of the samples with diffracting peaks atdifferent degrees and intensity. For the TCK sample, the XRD spectraof both milled and residue after extraction, indicated prominent peaksappearing at almost the same 2θangle (positions), but at different in-tensities. This indicates slight difference in the degrees of the crystallin-ity of the samples, both before and after extraction. Similar observationswere noticed byAdama et al. (2014)andGonçalves et al. (2014),i nt h e crystalline nature of different starches obtained from different sources.FromFig. 6, spectra A and B represent the XRD pattern of milled TCK, be-fore and after extraction, respectively. In the XRD pattern, the TCK sam-ples before (spectrum A) and after (spectrum B) extractions, both havetwo major characteristics peaks. For the spectrum A, the peaks at 2 θ= 19.66° and 40.57°, have intensities of 1353 and 717, respectively. On theother hand, spectrum B has peaks at 2θ= 21.00° and 41.01°, with cor- responding intensities of 1110 and 754, respectively. The difference inboth the peaks and the corresponding intensities for the TCK samples,before (spectrum A) and after (spectrum B) extraction, could be attrib-uted to the damage caused by the solvent effect on the TCK samplestructure (spectrum A). Thus, destroys the order (crystalline areas) inthe TCK sample (spectrum A) structure, giving rise to spectrum B(after extraction), hence, the change in crystallinity ( Agu, 2019).4. ConclusionsIt could be concluded from this study that the RSM and ANN were ef-ﬁcient tool for the modeling and optimization of TCK oil extraction. TCKoil extraction was successfully optimized using RSM and ANN with oilyield of approximately 60.45%. However, ANN was a better and more ef-fective optimization tool than RSM, due to its higher R2and lower RMS values. The physicochemical properties of TCKO indicated its potentialfor industrial application, especially as transformer ﬂuid. The fatty acid composition indicated that TCKO was highly unsaturated. Furthermore,the presence of O–H, N–H, and C–O functional groups, in the FTIR re-sults, are indications of oxygen containing compounds, hence, wouldenhance TCKO biodegradability. Finally, the XRD results of TCK samplesobtained both before and after extraction, showed difference in theirpeaks and corresponding intensities, due to the damage effect ofsolvent.CRediT authorship contribution statementChinedu Matthew AguWriting - review & editing.Matthew Chukwudi MenkitiWriting - review & editing.Ekwe Bassey Ekwe Writing - review & editing.Albert Chibuzor AgulannaWriting - review & editing.AbbreviationsANN artiﬁcial neural networkANNs artiﬁcial neural networksANOVA analysis of varianceAOAC Association of Ofﬁcial Analytical ChemistsCCD central composite designDS dielectric strengthFTIR Fourier Transform InfraredGC gas chromatographyIBP Incremental Back PropagationMFFF Multilayer Full FeedforwardMNFF Multilayer Normal FeedforwardRSM root mean squareRSM response surface methodologyTCKTerminalia catappakernelTCKOTerminalia catappakernel oilXRD X-ray diffraction0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80200400600800100012001400
