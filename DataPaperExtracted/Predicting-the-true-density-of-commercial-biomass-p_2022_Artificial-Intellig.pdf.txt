Article history:Received 25 July 2022Received in revised form 14 November 2022Accepted 15 November 2022Available online 17 November 2022The use of biomass is increasing because it is a form of renewable energy that provides high heating value. Rapidmeasurements could be used to check the quality of biomass pellets during production. This research aims toapply a near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging system for the evaluation of the true density of individual bio-mass pellets during the production process. Real-time measurement of the true density could be bene ﬁcial for the operation settings, such as the ratio of the binding agent to the raw material, the temperature of operation, theproduction rate, and the mixing ratio. The true density could also be used for rough measurement of the bulkdensity, which is a necessary parameter in commercial production. Therefore, knowledge of the true density isrequired during production in order to maintain the pellet quality as well as operation conditions. A predictionmodel was developed using partial least squares (PLS) regression across different wavelengths selected usingdifferent spectral pre-treatment methods and variable selection methods. After model development, the perfor-mance of the models was compared. The best model for predicting the true density of individual pellets wasdeveloped withﬁrst-derivative spectra (D1) and variables selected by the genetic algorithm (GA) method, andthe number of variables was reduced from 256 to 53 wavelengths. The model gave R
2cal,R2val, SEC, SEP, and RPD values of 0.88, 0.89, 0.08 g/cm
3, 0.07 g/cm3, and 3.04, respectively. The optimal prediction model was applied to construct distribution maps of the true density of individual biomass pellets, with the level of the predictedvalues displayed in colour bars. This imaging technique could be used to check visually the true density ofbiomass pellets during the production process for warnings to quality control equipment.© 2021 The Authors.

1. IntroductionThe use of biomass is increasing because it is a form of renewable en-ergy that is broadly accepted as a substitute for fossil fuels ( Saosee et al., 2020). Biomass is organic material used to generate heat energy. Bio-mass, such as wood chips, sawdust, and agricultural residues such asrice husks, rice straw, bagasse, sugarcane leaves, palm kernel shells,and coconut shells, is waste from agro-industrial factories. Thesewaste products are processed into biomass pellets in order to increasetheir value. Nowadays, biomass in pellet form is favoured because itprovides a low moisture content, high density, and consistent size. Bio-mass pellets are also more convenient to store, and they are easy tomanage, move, and transport due to their grain-like ﬂow characteristics (Zafar, 2022).Forecasts of future global wood pellet demand predict a signi ﬁcant increase of up to 54 million tonnes in 2024 (40% demand for the heatingpellet market and 60% demand for the industrial pellet market)(Strauss, 2020). Hence, a technology that helps to develop the produc-tion process to ensure its efﬁciency is required. In a commercial context,biomass pellets must meet the standard quality speci ﬁcations. The heating value, ash, moisture content (MC), bulk density, and so onmust meet the criteria of the standard quality speci ﬁcations in order to trade the biomass pellets (García-Maraver et al., 2011). The quality of the biomass pellets is also an important factor in the combustionprocess for the industrial sector (Department of Alternative EnergyDevelopment and Efﬁciency, 2012). In general, the quality of biomasspellets is determined in the laboratory by using the standard ASTME871–872 method (ASTM International, 1982). To satisfy the just- in-time production system, the quality of the biomass needs to bemeasured rapidly or in parallel during production. Therefore, real-time/in-line/at-line and rapid measurement of biomass pellet qualityis necessary in the industry.Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 6 (2022) 266 –275

journal homepage:http://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/artificial-intelligence-in-agriculture/According to previous studies related to the inspection of biomasspellets, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy techniques have been usedfor rapid and non-destructive testing. Posom and Sirisomboon (2015) predicted the MC and heating value of Jatropha curcaskernels using Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy (wavenumberrange of 1,250,000–400,000 m
−1)( R2and RMSEP are 0.97 and 4.0%, re- spectively, for moisture content prediction; R
2and RMSEP are 0.86 and 360 J/g, respectively, for heating value prediction). Posom and Sirisomboon (2017)estimated C, H, N, O, and S and the lower heatingvalue of bamboo using FT-NIR spectrometry (12,500 –3600 cm
−1)a n d reported RMSEP values of 0.532%, 0.0427%, 0.0276%, 1.110%, 0.00761%,and 0.119 MJ/kg, respectively.Gillespie et al. (2015)evaluated the MC, C, ash content, and gross caloriﬁc value of biomass pellets using NIRspectroscopy (880–1720 nm),ﬁnding RMSEP values of 0.503%, 0.089%,0.837%, and 0.912 MJ/kg, respectively. Pitak et al. (2021a)applied NIR hyperspectral imaging of biomass pellets for the prediction of the fuelratio (FR), volatile matter (VM),ﬁxed carbon (FC), and ash content(A), as well as C, H, N, and S (Pitak et al., 2021b). Likewise,Feng et al. (2018)used this method to predict the moisture content (MC), ash con-tent (A), volatile matter (VM),ﬁxed carbon (FC), and caloriﬁcv a l u e (CV). As in previous works, they reported that NIR spectroscopy had ahigh potential for in-line measurement of biomass qualities.Important parameters of biomass pellets are their bulk density andtrue density. Bulk density is deﬁned as the mass of the total number ofparticles of the material divided by the total volume they occupy,while the true density of solids is the ratio of the mass of the solid tothe volume occupied by that solid body ( García-Maraver et al., 2011). Although the true density is not a quality criterion for biomass pellets,it can be checked rapidly and monitored during the production processto conﬁrm the optimal ratio of the binding agent to the raw material, theinitial moisture content used, the temperature of operation, the produc-tion rate, or operation conditions (da Silva et al., 2020). Moreover, the true density can be used to make a rough estimate of the bulk density(da Silva et al., 2020). The true density values of biomass pellets are al-ways higher than the bulk density values because the volume of voids isexcluded from the calculation, and bulk density has a correlation withthe true density (Theerarattananoon et al., 2011). Therefore, real-time measurement of the true density might be aninnovative method for controlling biomass pellet production in thefuture. If the quality of the biomass pellets can be checked quickly andaccurately, this will allow better quality control and make it easier toplan the production to keep up with the demands of the market.NIR hyperspectral imaging has a high potential to be used forreal-time measurement, and its main advantage is that it facilitatesthe visualization of the distribution of different chemical componentsin a sample (Manley, 2014).However, too large data sets of hyperspectral images can be a barrierto analysis and in-line application. Therefore, reduction of the data set isnecessary. Wavelength selection was therefore used to reduce the num-ber of wavelengths. Using a few signiﬁcant wavelengths in developing the calibration model may be at least as accurate as using a full rangeof wavelengths, and using just a handful of wavelengths is simple andcost-effective (Liu et al., 2014). Appropriate chemometric methodsplay an important role in the successful prediction of the density of in-dividual pellets by NIR hyperspectral imaging. Therefore, we decidedto use wavelength selection methods combined with a multivariatetechnique for developing the calibration model. Thus, this researchaims 1) to investigate a suitable model for predicting the true densityof individual biomass pellets using the NIR hyperspectral imagingtechnique, including the effect of variable selection and spectralpre-treatment, and 2) to create distribution maps of a pellet samplefor in-line applications.2. Materials and methods2.1. SampleA total of 140 biomass pellets were used in the experiment, obtainedfrom 11 agricultural waste materials:ﬁlter cake (11 pellets),Leucaena leucocephala(9 pellets), bamboo (9 pellets), cassava rhizome (15pellets), bagasse (14 pellets), sugarcane leaves (15 pellets), straw (15pellets), rice husk (14 pellets), eucalyptus bark (11 pellets), Napier grass (13 pellets), and corn cob (14 pellets). All these agriculturalwaste materials were transformed into pellets using a palletizationmachine (KN-D-200, Tianjin Zhengyao Machinery, China). All the sam-ples were then sealed in bags and stored at room temperature of about25 ± 2 °C. Because the aim of this study was to estimate the true densityof biomass pellets produced from the production process, standardizedbiomass pellet samples, with standardized parameters such as moisturecontent≤10% and a pellet diameter of 6 mm, were used in the experi-ments to predict the true density. This condition facilitates the measure-ment of NIR hyperspectral imaging and sample collection.2.2. NIR hyperspectral imagingThe NIR hyperspectral imaging system includes a hyperspectralcamera (Imspector N17E, Specim, Finland), a CCD camera (Xeva 992,Xenics Infrared Solutions, Belgium), two 500 W tungsten halogen lightsources (Lowel Light Inc., NY, USA), and control software (Specim'sLUMO Software Suite, Spectral Imaging Ltd., Oulu, Finland), with 320pixels (with a spatial resolution of 30 μm per pixel) in the x-direction and 497 pixels in the y-direction. The NIR hyperspectral imaging pro-vided a wavelength range between 900 and 1700 nm, and the resolu-tion was 3.2 nm. Approximately 11 pellets were placed on a sampleholder made of acrylic sheets and placed on a conveyor belt, whosespeed was 10 mm/s, for scanning. Before scanning, the camera was cal-ibrated by 1) setting the frame rate (25 Hz) and exposure time (8 ms) ofthe camera and 2) calibrating the NIR hyperspectral camera by scanningdark and white reference, and then scanning pellet sample, respectively.After scanning, the relative reﬂectance (R) values were calculated fromEq.(1):R¼

was collected when the light source unit was turned off, and the R white
was obtained by scanning a Teﬂon whiteboard. R was used to create aprediction model in the next step.2.3. Reference methodsAfter scanning, the true density was determined using the standardASTM E 873 method (ASTM International, 2013). The length of the bio- mass pellets was measured using a vernier caliper (Eagle One) of size0–150 mm with a resolution of 0.05 mm, and then the pellets wereweighed with digital scales (OHAUS PR224/E, maximum capacity120 g, readability 0.1 mg). The true density was calculated usingEq.(2)(ASTM International, 2013):true density

267After that, the moisture content was determined using oven drying,with samples dried at 105 °C until they reached a constant weight.2.4. Model developmentFig. 1shows theﬂow diagram for the process of model development.After scanning, the three-dimensional (3D) images of pellet sampleswere obtained. They were converted to relative re ﬂectance data. The re- gion of interest (ROI) of the 3D NIR image was extracted using principalcomponent analysis (PCA). This process was carried out to distinguishbetween biomass pellet pixels and the background pixels. After that,the values of the background pixels were changed to zero, and the ROIpixels of each pellet were averaged to one spectrum. The averaged re-ﬂectance of each pellet was thus the representative spectrum and wasapplied for model development.The optimal model for predicting the true density was investigated.The model was developed using different spectral pre-treatments, andthe variables (relative reﬂectance value at its corresponding wave-lengths) selected using different methods were compared. Beforemodel creation, either the raw spectra or the pre-treated spectra(including theﬁrst derivative [D1], second derivative [D2], and standardnormal variate [SNV]) were used for model development ( L i ue ta l . , 2014). The model was optimized using selected wavelengths obtainedfrom the correlation method (CM), variance method (VM), co-variance method (COVM), and successive projections algorithm (SPA)and genetic algorithm (GA) methods ( Sratthaphut and Ruangwises, 2012;Fei and Yong, 2009). After that, their performance was compared.The variable selection was investigated, including CM, VM, COVM,SPA, and GA. For variable selection by CM, the correlation (r) betweenX (spectral data) and Y (true density) was determined. The absolutevalues of r were determined, and its corresponding wavelengths were

268arranged in descending order. Then, the X data were arranged, with thewavelength having the highest |r| in the ﬁrst column and the wave- length having a lower |r| in the next column. For VM, for every wave-length of X, the variance (var(X)) was determined. The X data werearranged in descending order according to the variance values of X,from the highest to the lowest value. Then, the arranged X data werecollected. For COVM, the co-variances between Y and X
1,X2,X3,…X n
were computed, where n is the number of wavelengths. The X datawere arranged in descending order according to the co-variance valuesof X and Y, from the highest to the lowest value, and then the arranged Xdata were obtained (Edelmann et al., 2021). The SPA method starts with one wavelength and then sequentially selects a new wavelength withthe maximum projection value on the orthogonal subspace of the previ-ously selected wavelength (Wang et al., 2016). The projections were carried out on the X matrix in order to display the least collinearitywith the previous ones (Galvão et al., 2007). GAs are a type of mathe- matical model inspired by Charles Darwin's idea of natural selection,and they are another class of techniques used for wavelength selectionin chemometrics. A GA allows a population composed of many individ-uals to evolve under speciﬁed selection rules to a state that maximizesthe‘ﬁtness’(Sratthaphut and Ruangwises, 2012). A combination of GA and partial least squares (PLS) regression has the advantages of bothGAs (maximumﬁtness) and PLS regression (maximum covariance be-tween the absorbance value and measured value) ( Sratthaphut and Ruangwises, 2012).Pitak et al. (2021b)reported that the model for ele- mental prediction (C, H, N, and S) developed using the GA wavelengthand PLS regression provided a higher accuracy than the model devel-oped using the full wavelength range.For the variable selection method, the most important wavelengthsare arranged in theﬁrst column, and the next most signiﬁcant wave- lengths are arranged in the next column, up to the last wavelength.For model development, the total data were divided into two sets: thecalibration set and the validation set. The data were analysed usingthe MATLAB program (R2019b, USA). The calibration model consistsof matrices X (m × n) and Y (m × 1). Matrix X consists of the relative re-ﬂectance (R) of the pellets of the m samples recorded at n wavelengths.Matrix Y contains the reference data determined using the referencemethod (true density). The models were generated using Y and X

After that, the number ofwavelengths and the corresponding spectral pre-treatment methodproviding the lowest standard error of cross-validation (SECV) were se-lected to test the validation set; this procedure yields the optimal model.The performance of the models was calculated based on statisticalterms i.e. the coefﬁcient of determination (R

Visualization of the true density in the distribution mapThe optimal model was obtained, including the optimal PLS factors,spectral pre-treatment method, and selected wavelength. These wereapplied to predict the true density and then used to create the spatialprediction map, which was the visualization of the individual truedensity.

Ypre was represented as atwo-dimensional (2D) array of pixels. The predicted density wasrepresented using a colour level on a 2D distribution map ( Su, 2020), which showed the spatial variations in the true density. Thetrue density of each pellet was assessed from the distribution map,Table 1Statistical data of moisture content (%) and true density (SD, g/cm

Results and discussion3.1. NIR spectra of different biomass pelletsFig. 2a and b show the averaged raw spectra and D2 spectra of the 11biomass pellet types, respectively. The spectral pro ﬁle of each biomass pellet is similar, but the relative reﬂectance values differ. While relativereﬂectance ofﬁtter cake had a quite different compared to other bio-mass. It can be seen that low true density had also low re ﬂectance value, while high true density had higher re ﬂectance value. Solid den- sity is the ratio of the measured mass to the measured volume. Low den-sity had more air gaps in the material, which air can absorb light morethan organic matter. It causes a pellet with a low density had a lower re-ﬂectance value. The obvious negative reﬂectance values of the biomass pellets of the D2 spectra were at the wavelengths of 940 nm, 1230 nm(vibrational band of C\\H( 3ν) in hydrocarbon), 1326 nm, 1360 nm(C\\H combination in hydrocarbon), 1390 nm (C\\H methyl in hydro- carbon) and1450 nm (O\\H( 2ν), .O-H in starch) (Williams, 2007; Burns and Ciurczak, 1992).Yang et al. (2016)reported similar results. For wood pellets, therewere many absorbance bands in the wavelength range of 1100 –2500 nm, with the highest reﬂectance at the wavelengths of 1473, 1925,2092, 2267, and 2328 nm.Gillespie et al. (2015)reported the wave- lengths that impacted the prediction of MC, with an absorbance at thewavelengths of 1384 nm (1st overtone of the O\\H bond structure) and 915 nm (3rd overtone of the C\\H bond structure).Pitak et al. (2021b)reported a high reﬂectance value at the wavelengths of 938,1121, 1248, 1323, 1384, and 1440 nm of the second derivative (D2)spectra.3.2. Reference valueTable 1presents the statistical properties of the true density (SD,g/cm
3) and moisture content (MC, %) of the 11 biomass pellet typesusing the ASTM E 873 method, with SD values in the range of0.53–1.48 g/cm
3and MC in the range of 2.36–10.04%. In the EN 14961–2 and ISO 17225-2 standards, the MC of wood pellets is <10%(ASTM International, 2013;Gemco Energy Machinery Co., Ltd., 2022 ), which corresponds to the scope of this research's aim to use pelletswith standardized parameters, such as moisture content≤10%. Fig. 3a and b show the standard deviation values of the 11 types ofbiomass pellets. The true density is in the range of 0.04 –0.09 g/cm
3, and the standard deviation values of the moisture content are between0.5% and 1.9%.This result is consistent withFeng et al. (2018), who reported that the wood pellet moisture content ranged from 5.96% to 13.34%. In 2012,

3). The moisture value was in the range of8–14%, and the total density in the range of 500 –750 kg/m

Results of the model development and the test-set methodTable 2shows the results for predicting the true density of variousbiomass pellets developed from different spectral pre-treatments anddifferent numbers of wavelengths from the respective variable selectionmethods, demonstrating the selection of the variables N, R2cal,S E C ,R2val, SEP, RSEP, RPD, and bias. The prediction results depended on the devel-opment methods, spectral pre-treatment, and the number of wave-lengths. Overall, the models with different variable selection methodsgave the same performance, but the number of wavelengths differed.The models developed with the full range of wavelengths (256wavelengths)-raw spectra, VM (110 wavelengths)-D1 spectra, COVM(100 wavelengths)-D1 spectra, and GA (100 wavelengths)-raw spectragave similar results, and the best accuracy for R
2and SEP was 0.90 and 0.07 g/cm
3, respectively.The method that had the fewest possible wavelengths, a low SEC,and a low SEP was the best method and could be selected as the predic-tion model. Hence, we recommend that the model developed with theD1 spectra and 53 wavelengths selected by the GA method was the op-timal model, since R
2val, SEP, RSEP, RPD, and bias were 0.89, 0.07 g/cm3, 6.40%, 3.04, and 0.00 g/cm
3, respectively. The criterion for model selec-tion was that if the performance was similar, the model developed withfewer wavelengths should be selected. This model indicates an excellentprediction model, could be used for quality control ( Zornoza et al., 2008). Our result was more accurate than that of other NIR researchstudies.Sanseechan et al. (2018)used a portable NIR spectrometer forrapid screening of the true density of sugarcane stalk, and the bestmodel in their study was developed with the pre-processing methodof smoothing the moving average, and R
2,r2, SEC, SEP, bias, and RSEP were 0.65, 0.67, 23.740 kg/m
3, 22.131 kg/m3,−1.142 kg/m3,a n d 2.000%, respectively.Li et al. (2022)investigated appropriate pre- processing, variable selection, and multivariate calibration techniques

272to improve the density prediction accuracy of Chinese white poplar(Populus tomentosaCarrière) wood. The results showed that the bestprediction was obtained by generalized regression neural network(GRNN) models combined with the lifting wavelet transform (LWT)and the competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) method(R
2p = 0.870, RMSEP = 13 kg/m3, RPDp = 2.774).Table 3shows the result of the model for predicting the true densityof the various biomass pellets in the validation set based on different ef-fects. There are fewer samples in the moisture content range of 0 –5% than in the range of 5–10%. For the prediction of the true density inthe moisture content range of 5–10%, the SEP and bias were 0.074 and0.003 g/cm
3, respectively. The variety effect found that the SEPand bias of rice husk were the lowest, with an SEP and bias of 0.007and−0.004 g/cm
3, respectively.Therefore, this model was excellent and could be used for qualitymeasurement. The RSEP (relative standard deviation of prediction),which is the relative ratio of the absolute error of prediction to a refer-ence value, showed that every predicted value gave an error of approx-imately 6.40% of the reference value ( John et al., 2007). Fig. 4shows SEC/SECV versus the number of wavelengths developedwith the GA-D1 method. The 53-wavelength model was selected be-cause the SEC and SECV remained constant and because increasing thenumber of wavelengths did not increase the accuracy.Fig. 5shows spectra and coefﬁcients on model prediction.Fig. 5ai l - lustrates the values obtained by the multiplication of regression coef ﬁ- cient values (seeFig. 5b) and the average spectra of D1 derivativesspectra selected by the GA method (see Fig. 5c) as a function of wave- length. The predicted true density value was calculated with the sumof the multiplication of regression coefﬁcient values and the average D1 spectra. Hence high-intensity peaks at any wavelength mean thatthose wavelengths inFig. 5a strongly affect the model prediction.According to the peaks inFig. 5a, some obvious peaks with highvalues were at approximately 887, 939, 948, 1134, 1398 and 1433 nm,means that these wavelengths inﬂuence the prediction.Fig. 6a and b also show the results of the predicted and measuredvalues of the calibration set and validation set, considering two differentmoisture ranges: 0–5% and 5–10%. The result shows that the differentMC ranges do not affect the prediction. Fig. 6c and d show the scatter plots of the measured and predicted values of the calibration set, andthe validation set for the true density is affected by the different biomasspellet types, which do not affect the accuracy.3.4.

273biomass pellet types predicted by the D1 spectra coupled with 53 wave-lengths from the variable selection method of the GA model. The pre-dicted value of each pixel was then converted into a different colourscale. The predictive distribution maps were converted into 2D NIR im-ages of the true density. The highest pellet density values are shown inred, medium values are shown in green, and the lowest value is shownin blue. Other colour of predictive image in the linear colour scalechanged according to the level of predicted true density. The predictedimage demonstrated irregular colors in each pixel of each pellet becausetrue density in each pixel of each pellet was non-homogeneous. Othercauses, the spectrum in each pixel obtained from different angles ofincidence and reﬂection were different value. Even though the samepellet, the reﬂectance values in each pixel were not equal. However,overall colors of the pellet images from different true density wereclearly different. Therefore, the true density of pellet could be predictedby observing the colors of the images. The higher true density containedmore red while the lower true density contained more blue. Displayingcolour images of the properties of biomass pellets may be convenientand easy to apply online in the industry.4. ConclusionsThe NIR hyperspectral imaging technique is proposed for rapid mea-surement of true density of biomass pellets. The prediction model weredeveloped using the full wavelength range, CM, VM, COVM, SPA, and GA coupled with four pre-treatment methods including raw spectra, D1,D2, and SNV. Then, their performances were compared. The result dem-onstrated that true density model was excellent and could be used forquality control. The most appropriate method predicts the true densityof GA biomass pellets and spectral conditioning with D1 by using 53wavelengths. Then, a distribution map can show the speci ﬁc properties of the biomass pellets, in a form that can be easily viewed and used invarious procedures in the industrial sector, such as quality control inthe production process and quality selection before the product issold. The model can also be developed for other materials and applica-tions in the future. The appropriate model and important wavelengthcould be used for creating a low-cost camera for real time measuringof true density upon conveyor belt for further.CRediT authorship contribution statementLakkana Pitak:Data curation, Writing–original draft, Conceptuali- zation, Methodology, Software.Khwantri Saengprachatanarug:Vali- dation.Kittipong Laloon:Validation.Jetsada Posom:Supervision, Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing –review & editing, Validation, Funding acquisition, Project administration.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in ﬂu- ence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgementsThis research project is supported by Research and Graduate Studies,Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.References
