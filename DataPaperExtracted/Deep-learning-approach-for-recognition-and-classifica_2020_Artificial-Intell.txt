Keywords:Paddy cropBiotic and abiotic stressCNNVGG-16On-time recognition and early control of the stresses in the paddy crops at the booting growth stage is the key toprevent qualitative and quantitative loss of agricultural yield. The conventional paddy crop stress recognition andclassiﬁcation activities invariably rely on human experts identifying visual symptoms as a means of categoriza-tion. This process is admittedly subjective and error-prone, which in turn can lead to incorrect actions beingtaken in stress management decisions. The work presented in this paper aims to design a deep convolutionalneural network (DCNN) framework for automatic recognition and classi ﬁcation of various biotic and abiotic paddy crop stresses using theﬁeld images. The work has adopted the pre-trained VGG-16 CNN model for the au-tomatic classiﬁcation of stressed paddy crop images captured during the booting growth stage. The trainedmodels achieve an average accuracy of 92.89% on the held-out dataset, demonstrating the technical feasibilityof using the deep learning approach utilizing 30,000 ﬁeld images of 5 different paddy crop varieties with 12 dif- ferent stress categories (including healthy/normal). The proposed work ﬁnds applications in developing the de- cision support systems and mobile applications for automating the ﬁeld crop and resource management practices.© 2020 The Authors.

1. IntroductionThe paddy crop cultivation is an integral part of Indian agriculturaleconomy rankingﬁrst in the area of cultivation with 43.92 million hect-ares with the production of 111.50 million tons ( Anonymous, 2018). Al- though the overall numbers are impressive, the rice production hascome under increased pressure in Asia due to population growth andchanging socio-economic factors. The major paddy producing belts inAsia regions achieves only 40% of total production ef ﬁciency due to damage caused by drought, diseases, and pests. A more integrated ap-proach involving optimum crop improvement and resource manage-ment practices such as nutrient management, irrigation regime, andother agronomic management factors for paddy crop with the existingfarmers' practices is a potential option for minimizing the crop yieldgap (Nutan et al., 2020;Alam et al., 2013).The paddy crops are exposed to various types of stresses, both bioticand abiotic as they grow in a wide range of environments characterizedby different temperatures, climates, and soil-water conditions, whosecombined effect can adversely affect crop performance and survival. Itis generally believed that the stresses are considered as a serious threatto sustainable paddy production. Among these stresses, pathogen,drought, over-irrigation or submergence, nutrient de ﬁciency, toxicity due to over-feeding of fertilizers, and high salinity stress factors have ahuge impact on the world agriculture and they reduce average yieldby more than 50%. The plans have evolved and developed speci ﬁc mechanisms to respond to complex stress conditions. The plant re-sponses to the individual stress vary depending on the nature and se-verity of the stress involved, the age of the plant at which the stress isencountered, and inherent stress tolerant nature of the plants. The on-time monitoring and recognition of these stresses, the supply of ade-quate farm inputs and rapid morphological diagnoses can reduce theadverse effects of stresses on the crops. The paddy crops under stressshow obvious symptoms in the color, shape and texture of the leaves(Mew et al., 2018). It is difﬁcult to capture and quantify these micro-symptoms using manual visual observation. The sample ﬁeld images of normal and stressed paddy crops are shown in Fig. 1.Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 12 –20

journal homepage:http://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/artificial-intelligence-in-agriculture/The leaf injury and leaf color variation are the two visual scoringsymptoms used in the classiﬁcation and determination of the stress cat-egories. The trained personnel visually observe these symptoms as aqualitative assessment to determine the stress types. This visual inspec-tion of an individual leaf is subjective, time-consuming, destructivesometimes, and tedious by nature. For identi ﬁcation of plant Nitrogen (N) nutrient deﬁciency, two easy decision instruments, namely LeafColor Chart (LCC) and Chlorophyll Meter (SPAD) are used ( Ali et al., 2017). As a plant N status indicator, the LCC measures the greennessof the paddy crop leaf. In LCC, the accuracy is not guaranteed, especiallyfor different lighting conditions as the approach is based on visual in-spection of leaf color.Fig. 2shows the determination of paddy plant Ni-trogen (N) demand using the chlorophyll meter (SPAD) and Leaf ColorChart (LCC). An objective and rapid stress identi ﬁcation system would be beneﬁcial to the potential farmers and researchers for timely inter-vention and mitigation of the problems by applying the proper cropmanagement strategies that can effectively boost the crop yields. Sev-eral research works have proposed to detect and classify plant stressesusing image processing and machine learning techniques ( Sun et al., 2018;Latte et al., 2017;Yuan et al., 2016;Mohan et al., 2016;Yang et al., 2015;Chen et al., 2014;Phadikar et al., 2012;Pugoy and Mariano, 2011;Bock et al., 2010;Sanyal et al., 2007). These approaches have attempted to build image classiﬁers using the handcrafted shape, color, and texture features extracted from the individual crop leafimages and the classiﬁer dependency on the handcrafted featurescauses lack of automation. In recent years, the deep convolutional neu-ral networks (DCNN) have shown the impressive results in many imageclassiﬁcation tasks without using an expert designed or handcraftedfeatures (Singh et al., 2018;Mohanty et al., 2016). This brings the desire of adopting deep learning in computer vision to develop a comprehen-sive paddy plant stress recognition system which could be used as an ef-fective tool in constructing crop management strategies. To know thestate-of-the-art in automation of paddy and allied crop stress recogni-tion and classiﬁcation using a deep learning approach, a survey ismade and the gist of a survey is given as under.2. Literature surveySambuddha et al. (2018)have proposed a deep machine vision-based approach for identiﬁcation, classiﬁcation, and quantiﬁcation of eight soybean plant stresses, including both biotic and abiotic using25,000 images of stressed and healthy lea ﬂets in theﬁelds. The overall classiﬁcation accuracy of 94.13% is achieved by the developed deepCNN model.
Konstantinos (2018)has developedﬁve different deep CNN models which include AlexNet, AlexNetOWTBn, GoogLeNet,Overfeat and VGG for the identiﬁcation of plant disease combinationsusing the simple leaves images of healthy and diseased plants. Theimage dataset comprises 87,848 individual leaf images from 58 different

Anami et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 12 –20classes of plant-disease combinations of 25 different plant species. Thehighest classiﬁcation accuracy of 99.53% is achieved using the VGG-CNN model. JiangLu et al. (2017)have developed an in-ﬁeld automatic wheat disease diagnosis system using the supervised deep learningframework. The image dataset comprises 50,000 labeled images ofhealthy and infected leaves of wheat crops. In the work, four differentCNN models have been developed to perform the recognition of 7wheat disease classes and the VGG-16 model with fully connectedlayers has given the maximum average recognition accuracy of97.95%. YangLu et al. (2017)have presented a paddy crop disease iden-tiﬁcation method using deep learning techniques. The image datasetcomprises 500 images of healthy and diseased rice leaves and stems.The developed CNN model is inspired by LeNet-5 and AlexNet CNN ar-chitectures. The work has considered 10 common paddy crop diseasesand an average recognition accuracy of 95.48% is obtained using thetrained CNN model. The work has also shown that the stochastic poolingenhances the generalization ability of the CNN model and preventsover-ﬁtting.The literature survey has revealed that the researchers have exten-sively used the deep learning techniques for plant or crop disease recog-nition and classiﬁcation. In all the works, individual plant leaf imageshave been used for the disease or stress recognition and classi ﬁcation. But, the diseases or stresses can occur in all parts of the plants apartfrom the leaves. Moreover, there has not been any comprehensivestudy and referable results on recognition and classi ﬁcation of paddy crop biotic and abiotic stresses usingﬁeld images yet. It is also under- stood from theﬁeld experts and the survey that the paddy crops aremore susceptible to different stresses during the booting growth stageand the severe stress at this growth stage can cause irrecoverable dam-age to the plants resulting in reduced yield. This brings the desire of de-veloping a sophisticated deep learning framework for paddy plantstress recognition and classiﬁcation system which could be used as aneffective tool in implementing crop management strategies.In consultation with the agricultural experts and plant pathologists,the present work considers 11 different types of stresses (includingboth biotic and abiotic stresses) in paddy crops, namely, bacterial blight,fungal blast, drought, submerged, Nitrogen de ﬁciency, Phosphorusdeﬁciency, Potassium deﬁciency, Boron deﬁciency, Zinc deﬁciency, Iron deﬁciency, and chemical injury. The stress classi ﬁcation tree is shown inFig. 3.3. Proposed methodologyTo deal with the stated challenges, a deep learning-based approachhas been introduced to recognize and classify the paddy crop stresses.The proposed methodology consists of two main stages, namely,image dataset preparation and deep learning-based classi ﬁcation. The block diagram illustrating the stages involved in the proposed method-ology is shown inFig. 4.3.1. Study area and site descriptionThe experimental paddyﬁelds are situated at All India Co-ordinateRice Improvement Project (AICRIP), Mugad, University of AgriculturalSciences, Dharwad, India. The study area is categorized as the dry zonewith the annual rainfall ranges between 464.5 and 785.7 mm. The soilis medium to deep black clay in larger areas and sandy loam in a smallportion with high organic matter content. Sixty experimental farmlandswere considered for the individual paddy crop stress analysis.3.2. Crop sample preparation
In consultation with the University of Agricultural Sciences,Dharwad, Karnataka State, India,ﬁve certiﬁed and popular paddy varie- ties, namely, Jaya, Abhilasha, Mugad Suganda, Mugad 101 and MugadSiri are selected as experimental grain samples. The grain samples arehaving 100% physical and genetic purity. The collected paddy grainswere sown separately in a raised bed nursery (direct seeding) as perthe standard guidelines. All the necessary precautions were taken tomaintain a uniform plant population of each variety and the plantswere grown under controlled nutrient conditions. These paddy crop va-rieties were challenged by all the considered 11 stress types and the ob-servations were carried out under conditions favoring normal growthand expression of all the crop stress symptoms to ful ﬁll the objectives

Image acquisitionThe study considers the impact of 11 different stress classes on the 5different selected paddy crop varieties. From each of the paddy crop va-rieties, a total of 6000 images, considering 500 images per stress classare acquired. A total of 500 healthyﬁeld images per paddy crop variety along with the stressed paddyﬁeld images have been included in thedataset. The stress identities were con ﬁrmed by the experts. The stresses such as bacterial blight and fungal blast were present at lowto a medium severity. Each image in this dataset is associated with anexpert marked label indicating a stress class. The images were capturedin theﬁeld under natural light condition near solar noon which is theperiod with the most stable illumination at the top of the atmosphereusing a Nikon D3300 Digital SLR camera having a resolution of 24megapixels. The camera parameters, such as the ISO, shutter speed,and aperture were set to 400, 1/500, and f/32, respectively. In order toprovide a rigid and stable support and easy movement, the camerawas mounted on a tripod stand. The angle between the camera lensand the object axis was maintained at approximately 45°. The imageswere taken keeping the object distance of 2.5 m from the imagedcrops. A white foam board was used as a re ﬂector to bounce and inten- sify natural light in the opposite direction to ﬁll the shadows. Over 30,000 labeled images are collected to create the experimentaldataset of paddyﬁeld images from healthy crops and the cropsexhibiting different stresses. As a part of the dataset preparation, the ac-quired images of size 1920 × 1080 pixels are manually cropped to aﬁxed size of 150 × 150 pixels with the assistance of agricultural expertsand rice scientists. The sampleﬁeld images of Jaya paddy crop undervarious stress conditions are shown in Fig. 5.3.4. CNN model conﬁguration and architectureThe proposed work has employed the pre-trained VGG-16 CNNmodel for the classiﬁcation of normal and stressed paddy crop im-ages because of its state-of-the-art performance in the image classi-ﬁcation tasks (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015,Wang et al., 2017, Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018 ). The model is an extremely ho- mogeneous architecture that only performs 3 × 3 convolutions and2 × 2 pooling from the beginning to the end. The model is imple-mented using a higher level Python library Keras which runs overan open source deep learning framework TensorFlow as a backendto classify the stressed paddy cropﬁeld images. The image dimen- sion is set to 150 × 150 pixels with depth 3 (RGB channels) and theimages are passed through the stack of convolutional layers withthe convolutionﬁlter size 3 × 3 and convolution strides in x and y di-rections (1,1) pixels. The spatial size is preserved after convolutionusing hyper parameter padding 1. The spatial pooling is carried outby usingﬁve max pooling layers with the pooling size 2 × 2 pixels.The activation function ‘ReLu’has been considered in all the hiddenlayers and the‘softmax’function is applied to theﬁnal layer to en- sure the predicted probability output values are in the range of 0a n d1 .T h en e t w o r ku s e s2 0e p o c h sa n dab a t c hs i z eo f1 2 .T h en e t -work has been optimized using the gradient descent optimization al-gorithm with categorical cross entropy logarithmic loss function.The model receives the paddy crop images of size 150 × 150 pixels asinput. Then it has a sequence of two convolutional and pooling layers as
feature extractors, followed by a fully connected layer to interpret thefeatures and an output layer. The output layer has 12 neurons, whichcorrespond to the number of stress classes in which the input imageneed to be classiﬁed. The schematic structure of the network modellayers is shown inFig. 6.4. Experimental results and discussionThe experimental classiﬁcation model consists ofﬁve separate VGG- 16 CNN models, considering one for each of the paddy crop varieties asshown inFig. 6.8. In each paddy crop variety, there have been twelveclasses to distinguish. In order to improve the performance of the CNNmodels, the originalﬁeld image dataset with 12,000 images has beenenhanced to 30,000 labeled images (considering 6000 images perpaddy crop variety) using various image augmentation techniquessuch as random rescaling, perturbations to brightness, shear transform,verticalﬂip, horizontalﬂip, and skewing. All the augmented imagesshow remarkable variation with the original images. The enhancedimage set has been split into 60% training (3600 images per paddycrop variety) and 40% testing (2400 images per paddy crop variety) toevaluate the accuracy of the individual CNN model. The 10% of the testdataset has been used as the validation set.The models have been executed on a desktop computer con ﬁgured with an Intel Core i5-4210U processor, 8 GB of RAM and one GeForceNVIDIA 1070 GPU. The models have been trained and tested using therespective paddy crop variety images by considering the pre-trainedweights provided by the Oxford group in all the layers until conver-gence. The confusion matrices are generated from all the individualmodels to reveal the erroneous predictions and they are shown inFig. 7. The performance measures, namely, precision, recall, and meanclassiﬁcation accuracy of each stress class are computed from the confu-sion matrices and they are listed inTable 1. The graphical representation of the average stress classiﬁcation accuracy results for each paddy cropvariety is shown inFig. 8. From Fig. 8, the maximum and minimum

Anami et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 12 –20average stress classiﬁcation accuracies of 95.08% and 90.75% are ob-tained for the paddy crop varieties Mugad 101 and Jaya, respectively.The trained models achieve an average stress classi ﬁcation accuracy of 92.89% on the held-out dataset, demonstrating the technical feasibilityof using the deep learning approach utilizing 30,000 ﬁeld images of ﬁve different paddy crop varieties with twelve different stress catego-ries (including healthy/normal).4.1. Comparison of BPNN and VGG-16 CNN classi ﬁcation resultsThe classiﬁcation results of the present VGG-16 CNN modelare corroborated with the developed Backpropagation NeuralNetwork (BPNN) classiﬁcation model (Anami et al., 2019). The BPNN classiﬁer is trained with three lower order color statistics,namely mean, variance and skew, and two color descriptors de-ﬁned by the MPEG-7 standard, namely Dominant Color Descriptor(DCD) and Color Layout Descriptor (CLD) to express the colordistribution and variations in theﬁeld images of paddy crops under various stresses.Table 2d e p i c t st h ea v e r a g es t r e s sc l a s s iﬁ- cation comparison results between VGG-16 CNN and BPNN classi-ﬁcation models across twelve stress classes from ﬁve paddy crop varieties considered. FromTable 2, it is observed that the perfor- mance of VGG-16 CNN model is slightly better than the BPNNclassiﬁer.

Anami et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 12 –205. Conclusion and future scopeIn the present work, an attempt has been made to automate the rec-ognition and classiﬁcation of paddy crop stresses using the on ﬁeld im- ages and it has been successfully demonstrated by employing the deeplearning techniques. The approach presented is applicable to 11 classesof biotic and abiotic stresses from 5 different paddy crop varieties. Thebest performing pre-trained deep learning model VGG-16 has beenused in the classiﬁcation task. The maximum average stress classi ﬁca- tion accuracy of 95.08% has been achieved using the VGG-16 by learningover 6000 images of Mugad 101 paddy crop variety. The resultsobtained are encouraging as the work considers more number ofpaddy crop stress classes and the varieties than in the reported works.But still, there is a scope for improvement. The stress classi ﬁcation per- formance of the VGG-16 model will be compared with the similar state-of-the-art models such as ResNet, GoogLeNet, Inception-v3, and LeNetas a future scope. The work carried out is challenging in terms of high ir-regularity in an outdoor environment. The generality of the proposedapproach can make it applicable to a wide range of ﬁeld crops, such as wheat, maize, barley, soybean etc. The effects of environmental condi-tions such as extreme temperatures and soil factors, the presence ofcombinatorial stresses, the quantiﬁcation of stresses, and the predictionTable 1Paddy crop stress classiﬁcation results.Sl. no.
