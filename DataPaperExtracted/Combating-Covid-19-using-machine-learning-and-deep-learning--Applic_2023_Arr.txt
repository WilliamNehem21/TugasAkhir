COVID-19 ABSTRACT  
COVID-19, a worldwide pandemic that has affected many people and thousands of individuals have died due to 
COVID-19, during the last two years. Due to the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in X-ray image interpre -
tation, sound analysis, diagnosis, patient monitoring, and CT image identification, it has been further researched 
in the area of medical science during the period of COVID-19. This study has assessed the performance and 
investigated different machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and combinations of various ML, DL, and AI 
approaches that have been employed in recent studies with diverse data formats to combat the problems that 
have arisen due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, this study shows the comparison among the stand-alone ML 
and DL-based research works regarding the COVID-19 issues with the combinations of ML, DL, and AI-based 
research works. After in-depth analysis and comparison, this study responds to the proposed research ques-
tions and presents the future research directions in this context. This review work will guide different research 
groups to develop viable applications based on ML, DL, and AI models, and will also guide healthcare institutes, 
researchers, and governments by showing them how these techniques can ease the process of tackling the COVID- 
19.   
1.Introduction 
COVID-19, a new coronavirus, emerged in December 2019 as a 
cluster of deadly serious illnesses in Wuhan, China, and rapidly 
expanded as an outbreak [1]. The illness is driven by the virus 
SARS-CoV-2, referred to as COVID-19. WHO labeled COVID-19 a 
worldwide epidemic on March 11th, 2020 [2]. Therefore, as an outcome 
of this pandemic, more than six million people have died throughout the 
world [3]. The COVID-19 pandemic spread worldwide, infecting mil-
lions of people. Fig. 1 depicts a worldwide heat map of COVID-19 
epidemic deaths. 
The most typical signs of the COVID-19 infection include terrible 
cough, failure of flavor and aroma, migraine, exhaustion, and lung ail-
ments such as breathing problems [5,6]. However, medical images such 
as Chest X-ray (CXR), ultrasonography, computerized tomography (CT), 
and other imaging techniques have become significant options for 
diagnosing COVID-19 infection. Because of the extreme contagiousness of this virus, a rapid and precise diagnosis approach is unquestionably 
essential for combating this pandemic. Many coronavirus diseases like 
SARS and MERS can persist in a host species without any symptoms. 
Contagiousness of this virus, a rapid and precise diagnosis approach is 
unquestionably essential for combating this pandemic. Sometimes these 
diseases create extremely weak and non-characteristic signs in the 
infected individuals. Fig. 2 shows the growth pattern of the COVID-19 
spread. It can be found that the growth is exponential. Therefore, it 
may be possible to predict the upcoming COVID-19 wave and be pre-
pared early for it, saving thousands of lives, making prompt detection 
and treatment of these infections[ 7]. 
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, governments of different 
countries have implemented strict lockdowns in large cities and urban 
areas to avoid large gatherings of people and reduce the infection ’s 
impact. COVID-19 has various clinical signs in its early stages, including 
malaise, migraine, headache, difficulty in breathing, muscle pain, dry 
mouth, backache, vomiting, and stomach cramps [8,9]. The most

2prevalent signs for COVID-19 are lack of flavor and aroma [10]. Gov-
ernments and regulatory organizations throughout the world have 
implemented a no-compromise lockdown to preserve social isolation 
and so limit the epidemic as daily notifications of new breakouts have 
been flooding in at an unprecedented rate. The most impacted nations 
have closed their borders to transit and travel to stop the spread of 
COVID-19. In this global health emergency, the health sector is actively 
searching for new technology and strategies to monitor and manage the 
spread of the coronavirus epidemic. AI is currently one of the most 
effective technology since it can monitor the spread of the Coronavirus, 
assess its danger and severity, and measure its development rate. 
AI is a vast field with several sub-fields that may be used to address 
difficult issues in our daily lives. Learning, planning, representing in-
formation, and seeking are some of these sub-areas. The RT-PCR is 
currently most widely utilized approaches for COVID-19 detection. 
Using various data types with different AI-based methods, multiple ap-
plications have been developed that can now be used as a replacement 
for traditional RT-PCR tests. Utilizing different AI-based applications, 
patient management is becoming more effective, as these applications 
can efficiently predict patients ’ conditions and needs for hospitalization. 
The identifying and detecting COVID-19 by AI using CXR can early 
detect the disease and can be automated as a replacement for RT-PCR. AI 
has been used in forecasting the upcoming waves of the COVID-19 
outbreak. By employing different ML, DL, and AI-based models, senti-
ment analysis of the public opinions regarding the pandemic has been 
performed. Also, these models have been used to identify hoax or fake 
information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Which eventually hel-
ped to raise public awareness against the pandemic. The ML, DL, and AI- 
based classification and screening techniques have been used to fine- 
tune and explore new methods that can more adequately classify and 
improve the accuracy of detecting the COVID-19 disease. Thus these techniques can be helpful for COVID-19 management. The widespread 
use of various techniques of AI for different purposes is driving the way 
to manage and combat of COVID-19 more efficiently. 
Therefore, we have taken the initiative to analyze and explore 
studies that utilized various techniques in the field of AI to combat 
COVID-19-related challenges. The following are some of the contribu -
tions of our review study:  
≡Various techniques currently utilized in the field of AI have been 
explored, and the optimal and most utilized techniques with respect 
to various data types have been filtered.  
≡This study outlines future research directions and challenges to the 
researchers who wants to pursue study in the related field.  
≡The proposed six state-of-the-art questionnaires that tend to uncover 
issues, future perspectives, and analysis of the current studies to 
manage COVID-19 have been addressed. 
The organization of the remaining sections is as follows: the review 
methodology used to conduct the study is discussed in section 2. Section 
3 of this study presents the analysis and findings. Section 4 of this study 
presents finding and analysis of the proposed research questions. Section 
5 discusses the challenges and the potential scopes for future research to 
combat COVID-19. Finally, the study is concluded in section 6. 
2.Review methodology 
As shown by Brereton et al. [11], a review of studies is a technique of 
discovering, analyzing, and interpreting every accessible material on a 
particular study topic or topic of attention. 
In this study, a comprehensive literature search has been carried out 
in response to a collection of research queries. Besides, a safe, robust,

3and quantifiable procedure has been utilized to provide the answer to 
those concerns. 
2.1. Search strategy 
Multiple online academic search engines such as Scopus, Web of 
Science, ERIC, PubMed, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, DOAJ, and Google 
Scholar were utilized to obtain related studies. Table 1 summarizes the 
keywords that have been applied to extract the relevant works. Relevant 
studies were mostly chosen by manually using these keywords in various 
combinations. Some samples of the combinations are (‘COVID-19∕or 
’coronavirus ’ or ‘CoV2∕and ‘machine learning ’), (‘coronavirus ’ or 
‘CoV2∕or ‘COVID-19∕and ‘deep learning ’), (‘COVID-19∕or ’coronavirus ’ 
or ‘CoV2∕, ‘machine learning ’, and ‘prediction ’), etc. 
2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
In this study, only the relevant works published in the English lan-
guage have been considered. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for 
considering the related works are as followings: 
Inclusion criteria:  
(a) Papers that propose at least one ML, DL, or combinations of ML/ 
DL/AI models.  
(b) Studies that discuss at least one of the COVID-19 issues.  
(c) Studies performing experimental works on different datasets 
related to COVID-19. 
Exclusion criteria:  
(a) Research works published before 2020.  
(b) AI, ML, and DL-based techniques mentioned in research articles 
which are not associated with the COVID-19 epidemic.  
(c) COVID-19 issues mentioned in a research work that does not 
employ ML, DL, or combinations of ML/DL/AI approaches. 
(d)Theoretical research with no practical applicability, survey pa-
pers, and review papers. 
2.3. Selection of the study 
The process of study selection based on the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria is presented in Fig. 3 
In this step, the primary relevant works were selected based on the 
search strategy discussed earlier. By applying the aforementioned search 
strategy, 600 studies were identified and selected initially. The duplicate 
records or studies were then removed in the next phase. After removing 
the duplicate studies, a total of 512 works remained. 382 studies were excluded during the screening process. Abstract analysis, dataset anal-
ysis, and inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to filter the studies. 
A total of 130 research works became eligible for full-text analysis 
through the screening process. Later, these 130 research works were 
reviewed, and 26 of them were eliminated. In the last stage, a total of 
104 studies remained to be checked for their methodological qualities. 
Among those studies, a total of 16 studies were then excluded based on 
the methodological quality. After completing all these procedures, only 
88 studies remained for the systematic review. Among the selected 
studies, 29 studies are from the Elsevier journals, 16 studies are from the 
Springer journals, 11 studies are from the MDPI journals, 10 studies are 
from various journals referred to as "Others Journal", and 6 studies are 
from the Nature journals. On the other hand, equal numbers of studies 
have been collected from the Hindawi and the Wiley journals. From each 
of these two publishers, 3 studies have been considered. The least 
number of studies have been collected from the IOP science journals. 
Only 2 studies have been considered from the journals of this publisher. 
The remaining 8 studies are conference papers. 
2.4. Extraction of the data 
After selecting the studies, data extraction is very much important to 
analyze and interpret the studies properly. A general structure is 
required for the extraction of data from studies to obtain meaningful 
findings. As a response, tables with some preset attributes were devel -
oped, and various data from the studies were added to the tables. The 
first attribute of the tables, “References and Year, ” contains the authors ’ 
name and the publication year. The second attribute defines the pur-
poses of the studies. The third and the fourth attributes describe the data 
types used in the studies and the sample size of the studies, respectively. 
The fifth attribute specifies the major techniques applied in the studies. 
Finally, the last attribute mentions the best performing model with its 
performance. 
2.5. Research questions (RQs) 
This comprehensive and in-depth review mainly focuses on summing 
up, evaluating, and synthesizing different research works where several 
ML, DL, and combinations of ML, DL, and AI-based techniques have been 
considered. The primary goal of this study is to acquire the answers to 
the subsequent six research questions and to have a profound as well as a 
comprehensive understanding of the responses to these questions. 
RQ 1.What ML, DL, and combinations of ML, DL, and AI-based 
mechanisms are widely used in the studies related to COVID-19? 
RQ 2.Until now, are there any standard datasets that are publicly 
available and may be used to analyze different ML, DL, and

RQ 3.Are there any End-to-End Solutions (E2ES) available for COVID- 
19 diagnosis? 
RQ 4.Which countries performed the most research relating COVID- 
19 by involving ML, DL, and combinations of ML, DL, and AI-based 
techniques? 
RQ 5.What are the most widely utilized criteria for assessing various 
works already in existence related to COVID-19 using ML, DL, or com-
binations of ML, DL, and AI-based techniques? Are those criteria enough 
that have been employed in most of these studies? 
RQ 6.What are the biggest challenges for the researchers who are 
currently planning to do research on COVID-19 using ML, DL, or com-
binations of ML, DL, and AI-based techniques? 
3.Analysis and findings 
Multiple studies have analyzed the application of ML, DL, and AI 
methods in COVID-19-related studies. Dogan et al. [12] have analyzed and reviewed the studies related to the uses of AI and ML mechanisms in 
the context of various COVID-19-related tasks. In that review study, 
various studies related to COVID-19 transmission prediction, diagnosis, 
and detection, and drug/vaccine development have been analyzed, and 
six predefined questions have been explored. However, the entire 
context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the application of DL techniques 
have not been explored in the study. 
In another study, Islam et al. [13] reviewed various studies that have 
employed various AI and ML mechanisms in the process of fighting 
against the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the objectives, the studies 
have been categorized into four groups such as disease detection, 
epidemic forecasting, sustainable development, and disease diagnosis.

5The application of various models has been reviewed and summarized. 
Furthermore, six research opportunities have been identified and sum-
marized in the study. However, other objectives (sentiment analysis, 
vaccine development, etc.) and the application of DL techniques have 
not been explored. 
A comprehensive review of the role of AI, drones, blockchain, and 5G 
to manage the COVID-19 pandemic has been performed by Chamola 
et al. [14]. The study explored the use of current technologies to combat 
the epidemic as well as its effect on the global economy. The role of 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), blockchain, AI, and 5G, among 
others, in mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak has been 
explored and discussed in the studies. 
Alballa et al. [15] reviewed recent reports on ML algorithms used in 
relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the study, the applications of ML 
for diagnosis and predicting patient mortality risk and severity were 
analyzed. The review includes studies published between January 2020 
and January 2021. By assessing the studies, a small number of real-time 
E2E systems and a selection bias due to imbalanced data were identified. 
Despite analyzing the ML models for diagnosis and prediction, other 
COVID-19-related objectives such as detection, epidemic forecasting, 
etc. have not been considered. 
Alafif et al. [16] review the studies conducted on the uses of ML and 
DL towards COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment. The review study pro-
vides a summary of the AI-based ML and DL procedures, the available 
datasets, performance, and currently available tools. By performing a 
comprehensive analysis of the current ML and DL approaches used to 
diagnose COVID-19, obstacles to conducting the studies have been 
highlighted. In addition, the study made some directions for future 
work. Although the study analyzed the uses of ML and DL approaches 
only for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, other perspectives on 
the probable combination of ML, DL, and the COVID-19 pandemic were 
not covered. 
Although various studies have been conducted to review the works 
related to the use of ML, DL, and AI-based techniques for COVID-19 
management. Very few studies have explored the uses of the possible 
combination of ML, DL, and AI mechanisms. Moreover, this study 
explored diverse perspectives on the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing a 
variety of data types and combinations of data types. In addition, most 
recent studies conducted on ML, DL, and the combination of ML, DL, and 
AI-based mechanisms have been included, as well as some earlier rele-
vant studies. 
3.1. Distribution and context of the study 
Among all the considered works, 92% of studies have been collected 
from different journals, and 8% of studies have been collected from 
different conferences. From Fig. 4, it can be found that 96% of studies 
using ML models have been published in different journals, while the 
rest 4% of studies have been published in different conferences. The 
percentages of studies employing DL techniques published in journals and conferences are 80% and 20%, respectively. In terms of applying the 
combination of ML, DL, and AI-based techniques, 97% of the considered 
studies are journal papers. The remaining 3% of studies are conference 
papers. 
Among the studies collected from the journals, 36% of the studies are 
from Elsevier, 20% are from Springer, 14% are from MDPI, 7% are from 
Nature, 4% are from Hindawi, 4% are from Wiley, 3% are from IOP 
Science, and 12% are from other journals according to Fig. 5. 
The yearly distribution of the studies that were chosen for analysis is 
shown in Fig. 6. In terms of the publication year, a total of 41 studies 
were published in 2022. On the other hand, 39 studies were included 
from 2021. Only 8 studies were included from 2020. In 2022, the studies 
using the combination of ML, DL, and AI-based models have the highest 
frequency. The majority of the included studies applying ML techniques 
were published in 2021. Only a limited numbers of studies employing 
ML and DL techniques were performed in 2020. Furthermore, no studies 
applying the combination of ML, DL, and AI-based techniques were 
included from 2020. 
Fig. 7 shows the types of data that were used in various studies. The 
majority of the studies utilized datasets in image formats. Studies 
employing datasets in image formats used mainly MRI, CT, CXR, ECG, 
and X-ray images. The studies that used non-image datasets had mainly 
worked with different clinical, time-series, textual, and audio data. 54%

Array 17 (2023) 100271
6of the total studies employed datasets of image format, the rest 46% 
studies used non-image datasets. 
Among the image data types, CXR has the most significant percent -
age, with a percentage of 57%, followed by CT images with a percentage 
of 28%. X-rays and other images make up the remaining 15% of the data 
types. 
Among the non-image data types, clinical data is the most frequently 
utilized data format, representing 41% of all the non-image data, fol-
lowed by laboratory data, which represents 12% of all the non-image 
data. 11% data of the non-image data are in time series format. On 
the other hand, 9% data of the non-image data are in text format. 
Furthermore, the percentages of audio-sound data, blood test data, and 
RT-PCR data are 8%, 5%, and 3%, respectively. 11% of the non-image 
data are of other different data formats. 
3.2. Applications of machine learning to combat COVID-19 
ML is the area of AI that mainly focuses on building systems that are 
capable of learning without explicit programming to do so. At the 
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, ML algorithms were primarily 
utilized. Initially, these algorithms were utilized exclusively for 
geographical and area-wise COVID-19 spread analysis. These algorithms 
are now being used for various purposes in combating COVID-19. 
Currently, ML approaches not only can predict COVID-19 by using 
clinical and laboratory data but also can be used to derive much more 
complicated aspects of COVID-19. ML approaches show significant 
performance in the diagnostic process of COVID-19 by utilizing diverse 
data such as blood images, X-rays, ECG, CT scans, etc. Due to the usage 
of ML methods for extracting features from images, signals, and audio 
data, COVID-19 ’s classification is improving day by day. As ML models 
achieve more desirable outcomes, they are increasingly being combined 
with other approaches. The use of several ML methods to address 
different COVID-19-related problems has been reviewed and presented 
in this section. Table 2 shows the summary of various studies employing 
ML models to combat COVID-19. 
Fig. 8 shows the frequency of different ML models that have been used in the considered studies. The most frequently used ML model is RF 
in the considered works. The SVM model has achieved the second- 
highest position, followed by the LR model with the third-highest po-
sition. Models like NB, DT, XGB, KNN, and NN have also been used 
frequently on the other hand. 
Fig. 9 shows the percentage of studies by different countries 
employing ML models to combat COVID-19. The majority of the studies 
come from the United States. 20% of the studies were conducted in the 
United States. Each of the countries such as Bangladesh, Iran, and Italy 
contributed 8% of the studies. However, the remaining 14 countries 
provided significantly fewer studies using ML models to work on COVID- 
19-related issues. 
From Table 2, it is observed that, various types of data have been 
used to perform the various studies. According to our in-depth analysis 
and observations, in the majority of studies for classification purposes, 
the RF and XGB classification models performed most optimally with the 
clinical data type. Moreover, regardless of data type or study objective, 
XGB, RF, and NN models consistently outperform other machine 
learning algorithms. 
3.3. Applications of deep learning to combat COVID-19 
DL is a branch of ML that utilizes representation learning to tackle 
complicated problems. DL-based models, such as CNN, proposed Custom 
CNN, DCNN, and other methods have lately been used for COVID-19 
classification, diagnostics, and detection, by researchers to combat the 
COVID-19 outbreak. This study has reviewed the application of various 
DL approaches for combating the COVID-19 epidemic as well as per-
formed comparisons between them. Table 3 shows the summary of the 
studies employing DL techniques relating to COVID-19 issues. 
Fig. 10 represents the applied DL models. Among different DL 
models, the custom models have the highest frequency of 14, followed 
by the RESNET50 with the count of 12. Various versions of EFFI-
CIENTNET, which are referred to as EFFICIENTNET(X) algorithms, have 
achieved the third highest position with a number of 11. Among the 
next-most used DL models, VGG-16 and VGG-19 have been applied in 10 
Fig. 7.Different types of data used in various studies.  S.G. Paul et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Array 17 (2023) 100271
7and 9 studies, respectively. Other models that consist of various DL 
models such as (NASNET, COVIDNet, INCEPTIONREST, LSTM, 
SQUEEZENET, etc.) have achieved the next position with a frequency of 
8, followed by MOBILENET(X) with count of 7. Xception, InceptionV3, and DENSENET(X) have achieved the next position. Each of these 
models have been used in 5 research works. Besides, various versions of 
RESNET, referred to as RESNET(X) have been used in studies with a 
count of 4. Table 2

8From Table 3, it is observed that despite extensive uses of transfer- 
learning-based models, in the majority of the studies, custom models 
have outperformed the transfer-learning-based model. From our anal-
ysis and observation, for COVID-19 detection-based works with CXR 
data type, proposed custom CNN models have outperformed the 
transfer-learning-based CNN models. However, irrespective of the 
study ’s purpose and utilized data type in the uses of transfer-learning- 
based models, RESNET and DENSENET architecture-based models 
consisting of various versions have performed best in the majority of the 
studies. However, regardless of the type of image data used in deep 
learning-based research work, the usage of custom models may improve 
performance. 
The country-wise percentage of the studies employing DL models is 
shown in Fig. 11. In terms of using DL models to combat COVID-19, the 
majority of the research works were performed in India with a per-
centage of 44%. 8% of the research works were conducted in each of the 
following countries: Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, 
countries such as Algeria, Australia, Turkey, Switzerland, and all other 
countries have ranked in third place in terms of the number of research 
works employing DL methods. 
3.4. Application of combination of ML/DL/AI to combat COVID-19 
The combinations of ML, DL, and AI-based techniques are crucial in 
better understanding and dealing with the COVID-19 situation. The 
combinations of these methods are rapidly being used since these ap-
proaches can open up new avenues for various forms of diagnosis, 
sentiment analysis, public surveillance, and illness prevention. Several 
COVID-19 diagnostic approaches based on images aided by DL and AI- 
based techniques have been developed, and their association with RT- 
PCR has been evaluated. Image and non-image types of data are inte-
grated by the combination of ML, DL, and AI-based methods to inves -
tigate several new alternatives to combat COVID-19. 
The study demonstrates the combination of ML, DL, and AI meth -
odologies and applications for combating COVID-19. Table 4 shows the 
summary of the combination of ML, DL, and AI-based techniques to 
combat COVID-19. 
Fig. 12 shows that among the ML techniques, SVM has been the most 
frequently used model in the studies that utilized the combination of ML, 
DL, and AI-based and it has been used in twenty-three studies. Other ML 
models like ARIMA, LRG, GB, Total Boost, etc., models have been used in 
15 studies. Among the other ML models, RF, DT, KNN, LR, NB, and XGB 
models have been used in 13, 12, 10, 9, 8 and 7 studies, respectively. The 
ADB model has been used less frequently among the ML techniques. 
Various AI techniques have been used most frequently in the studies. 
In Fig. 12, for AI technique, we have counted only the numbers of 
different AI technique instead of showing the number of studies that 
have employed these techniques. Different DL models such as ATTENTION RESNET-50, DBN, IPCNN, DECNN, DEEPLABV3, SGAN, 
etc., models have appeared in 19 different studies in total. CNN has been 
used in 14 studies. Various versions of RESNET, referred to as RESNET 
(X) has been used in 12 studies. Furthermore, LSTM is the next most 
frequently used model, followed by various versions of DENSENET and 
INCEPTION, which have been referred to as DENSENET(X) and 
INCEPTION(X). 
From Fig. 12, it is observed that there is a trend to use custom models 
among the studies, which outperformed other DL models in terms of 
usage in different studies. However, various transfer learning DL models 
have been used frequently. 
From Table 4, it is observed that there are diverse patterns or com-
binations of mechanisms that have been used to perform the studies. In 
studies using ML in combination with other techniques, the SVM (ML 
model) has been utilized and tends to perform better compared to other 
ML models. Therefore, to construct mechanisms combining the ML 
model with other techniques, researchers might consider using the SVM 
model. Furthermore, to perform the study on the amalgam of the various 
data types, it is important to combine techniques from various domains 
and examine the performance. 
Fig. 13 Depicts the country-wise percentages of the studies employ -
ing the combination of ML, DL, and AI models. In India, 18% of the 
studies were conducted. Saudi Arabia carried out 13% of the studies. 
China, Bangladesh, and Turkey each conducted 11% of the studies. 8% 
of the studies conducted in the United States, whereas 5% were per-
formed in Iran. The remaining 3% of the studies were conducted in other 
regions of the world. 
3.5. Evaluation procedure for different study 
Evaluation is studying a system, an initiative to determine how 
effectively a system fulfills its objectives. Evaluations assist in deter -
mining what works effectively and where improvements can be made in 
a program. 
According to Fig. 14, accuracy is the most used evaluation metric, 
followed by sensitivity/recall and AUC. Other metrics have been 
employed in a limited number of studies. Accuracy has been applied 
most frequently in the combination of ML, DL, and AI-based studies, 
while in ML and DL studies, accuracy metrics have been used equally. 
The sensitivity/recall metric has been mostly used in the studies 
employing the combination of ML, DL, and AI-based techniques fol-
lowed by DL and ML-models-based studies. AUC metric has been used in 
all these three types of studies. 
Specificity and R-Square have been only used in ML models-based 
and combinations of ML, DL, and AI models-based studies. ML-based 
studies haven ’t used the Dice scores. F1 score, precision, MAPE, and 
RMSE have been only employed in the combination of ML, DL, and AI 
models-based studies. 
Fig. 9.Country-wise percentage of studies using ML Techniques.  S.G. Paul et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Array 17 (2023) 100271
9From Fig. 14 it is obvious that all three approaches use accuracy as 
the primary evaluation metric. Despite sensitivity/Recall being the 
second most utilized metric, ML and DL-based studies have used this 
metric less frequently compared to accuracy. As misclassification of the 
COVID-19 disease can threaten the patient and their family ’s lives in 
addition to complicating COVID-19 ’s spread control. Therefore, it is 
necessary to emphasize the sensitivity/recall metric more for evaluating 
the model ’s performance. 4.Finding and analysis of proposed research questions 
In this section, the predefined research questions have been dis-
cussed. For each of the research questions, we have discussed the sig-
nificance of the question as well as the findings based on the question 
that has been explored via the analysis of the studies. In addition, we 
have provided directions and some precautions for the researchers who 
aspire to conduct COVID-19 pandemic-related studies. Table 3

10RQ 1: In the domain of AI, there are different types of algorithms, 
each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Many factors 
influence the model ’s performance in a positive or negative manner, 
resulting in less optimum performance and complicating the task of 
finding ways to combat COVID-19. As a result, it is necessary to identify 
widely used specific ML, DL, and AI mechanisms so that model selection 
for a certain purpose becomes simple and effective. 
Various models have been applied in the application of the ML model 
in COVID-19-related tasks. The majority of the studies employed mul-
tiple ML models and compared the results. Therefore, the finding of 
some top-utilized models can be very beneficial. RF, SVM, LR, NB, XGB, 
and KNN are some of the most frequently used models. In addition to the 
use of specific ML models, various diversified but not widely used 
models have also been applied. 
Analyzing the studies, it can be observed that XGB has performed as 
the best model among utilized ML mechanisms, followed by RF and NN. 
Therefore, while using the ML model for prediction, classification, 
detection, and diagnosis, XGB, RF, and NN models can be considered, 
which may aid in achieving the best possible result. 
Many studies have developed custom models and compared them to 
other existing mechanisms in the use of DL relevant to the COVID-19 
study. In the use of specific DL models, RESTNET50, EFFICIENTNET, 
VGG-16, VGG-19, and MOBIELNET have been the most widely applied 
models. Analyzing the studies, it can be shown that custom models 
performed the best among the used DL mechanisms, followed by ResNet- 
(X) referring to various versions of ResNet particularly ResNet-50. 
In the application of the combination of ML, DL, and AI techniques 
related to the COVID-19 study, many studies applied the combination of 
diverse mechanisms and analyzed the performance, limitations, and potentiality of those mechanisms. Among the mechanisms, various AI 
techniques, SVM (ML model), custom models, diverse but not widely 
used DL models, CNN (DL model), and RF (ML model) are some of the 
widely applied mechanisms in the studies. Analyzing the studies and the 
best model, it can be found that the majority of the studies employed Al 
methods with ML or DL models and emphasize increasing the 
performance. 
By analyzing the studies, we have observed that there is a significant 
association between model ’s performance and the pattern of data used 
in the studies. This is discovered by analyzing and observing the results 
of studies with a similar type of data that applied a variety of techniques. 
As a result, it is essential for the researcher to choose standard dataset 
and select the suitable model according to the data type. To perform a 
study with the usage of ML models in COVID-19-related work, the 
researcher might consider XGB, RF, and NN models since they have 
outperformed other models and are widely used too. For performing a 
DL-based study, researchers should concentrate on constructing custom 
CNN models since they outperform transfer-learning-based DL algo-
rithms most of the time. However, in the uses of the combination of ML, 
DL, and AI-based techniques, various studies have been used a diverse 
amalgam of techniques. Therefore, while conducting a study based on a 
combination of several techniques, it is essential to select and analyze 
possible combinations of techniques by reviewing previously conducted 
related work. 
RQ 2: A dataset is one of the main defining parts of any study. 
Therefore, the dataset used in the studies needs to be trustworthy and 
standard. As the COVID-19 virus can mutate quickly, collecting virus- 
specific data is very challenging. To stop the spread and identify any 
mutated COVID-19, data should be collected in a short span of time. For

12this reason, sometimes there could be some lagging in the data collection 
procedure, which can create imbalanced and nonstandard data. There -
fore, creating a standard dataset is important. Comparing the study re-
sults with the standard dataset is also important. 
As COVID-19 is a global pandemic, many governments and NGOs 
have released open-access COVID-19 datasets, which mostly involve 
vaccination-related and spread-related datasets. But to identify the 
COVID-19 virus in the human body, an image type dataset is needed. 
Due to various constraints, there is a shortage of publicly available 
image datasets at the beginning of the period. Now there are some in-
dividual studies that have given open access to their dataset. But most of 
the individual datasets have some limitations, such as being imbalanced, lacking representative data samples, biased, and so on. Due to the data 
sample size quantity, some balanced datasets can’t be categorized as 
standard datasets. Therefore, there is still storage of the global standard 
dataset, which can be used to reevaluate studies applying model per-
formance. Furthermore, there is a lack of standard datasets related to 
sound and audio types of data for the COVID-19 disease. Also, there are 
very limited open-access sound-related standard datasets. 
As there are shortages and limitations of data regarding COVID-19, 
the researchers have to check the quality and limitations of the data-
set before conducting the research work. In addition, the collection 
procedure for research datasets should be standard, and the privacy of 
volunteers should be protected. Table 4 (continued )

13RQ 3: RT-PCR is the traditional method used to detect COVID-19 
disease in the human body. Patients must physically visit a hospital to 
give samples for testing the suspected COVID-19 present in their bodies 
while using the traditional testing method. However, between the waves 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, visiting the hospital is a risky step. Because 
visiting the hospital in the middle of the COVID-19 wave can affect 
healthy people, who can further act as hosts and further spread the 
disease. Therefore, it is important to find some End-to-End solution 
based on AI, which can remotely and effectively diagnose COVID-19 in a 
suspected person. 
But most of the studies have not emphasized building an End to End 
solution for diagnosis. Despite that, many studies have been conducted 
in order to develop an application for an End-to-End diagnosis solution 
[61,81]. Most studies consider image data types such as X-ray, CT, MRI, 
etc. to build COVID-19 diagnosis E2ES. As a result, using those appli -
cations, the patient ’s standard form of X-ray, CT, and MRI data sample is 
needed, which must be primarily obtained from the clinic or hospital. 
Therefore, the E2ES hardly solves the problem of remote E2ES systems. 
Some studies have considered using sound and audio data to build E2ES 
for the COVID-19 diagnosis system, which can diagnose COVID-19 
remotely. However, low sound-quality recording devices and environ -
mental noise can downgrade the quality of captured audio and sound 
data, which may affect the performance of the application. Furthermore, 
these studies and applications have some certain circumscribed. 
Therefore, there is still a lack of standard and reliable E2ES for the 
diagnosis of COVID-19. 
As there is a lack of E2E systems regarding various COVID-19-related 
work. The researchers should more focus on the issue and develop more 
E2E systems. Furthermore, the researcher should concentrate on removing the issues that users encounter when using the E2E system and 
improve quality (noise reduction, low-quality images handling). The 
system should be available and compatible with the maximum possible 
number of devices and platforms. In addition, researchers must promote 
campaign of the E2E system so that the wider populace can utilize the 
resource. 
RQ 4: As COVID-19 spread as a global pandemic, the virus ’s devas -
tation was felt throughout the country and regions. Therefore, the ma-
jority of the country ’s governmental and non-governmental 
organizations and NGOs have taken COVID-19-fighting measures, such 
as allocating funds, encouraging researchers, providing data, applaud -
ing researchers, and so on. These steps and opportunities have aided in 
the local and global combat of the COVID-19 pandemic by encouraging 
researchers to work on the issue of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, 
determining which country contributes the most to combating COVID- 
19 by conducting more research is a useful step toward appreciating 
their contribution. Furthermore, identifying countries with less signifi -
cant contributions to research work is important so that those countries 
can be encouraged and financially aided so that as human civilizations, 
we can advance equally. Identifying the countries contributing to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, on the other hand, is a broad perfective work that 
requires dedicated research work, which may include research type, the 
technology used, and the discovery of performed studies. 
Analyzing the studies considered in this research work reveals that 
India has conducted the most studies using ML, DL, and combinations of 
ML, DL, and AI-based techniques, followed by Saudi Arabia and the USA. 
Other developed countries as well as developing countries have 
contributed less in conducting research work regarding combating the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

Paul et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Array 17 (2023) 100271
14RQ 5: For combating the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have 
been conducted for various purposes and using various mechanisms. 
Various domains of AI have been used with diverse modifications and 
combinations. Furthermore, various types of data and a mixture of data 
types have been used to perform studies. Therefore, there is a need to 
evaluate the studies with a standard form of evaluationmetrics. Addi-
tionally, there is a need to identify the criteria that have been used in 
those studies to evaluate the trustworthiness of the studies. Most of the 
studies have used some of the evaluation metrics such as accuracy, 
sensitivity/recall, precision, F1 score, AUC-ROC curve, etc. From 
analyzing the studies’ utilized metrics, the accuracy metric has been 
used in most of the studies, followed by sensitivity and recall. Other 
evaluation metrics have been used less frequently in the related studies. 
However, the researchers should focus on the True Positive Rate instead 
of accuracy. 
As COVID-19 is a pandemic and can transmit from person to person 
very rapidly, the top priority is to stop the spread. Therefore, it is crucial 
not to misidentify an infected person rather than misidentify a healthy 
person. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize the True Positive 
Rate or recall value rather than accuracy, as recall value focuses on 
capturing all true positives, even if it increases false positive rate. 
RQ 6: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been instanced 
number of research works conducted to manage and to combat the 
pandemic by the use of ML, DL, and combinations of ML, DL, and AI- 
based techniques. Those research works have been analyzed and iden-
tified various factors and purposes associated with COVID-19 using ML, 
DL, and combinations of ML, DL, and AI-based techniques. However, 
from those studies, some common challenges and limitations can be 
outlined. Identifying those challenges can be beneficial for the re-
searchers who are planning to do research by applying the ML, DL, and 
AI methods as they can study those challenges to overcome in their study 
or can make their study particularly based on finding the solution to 
those challenges. 
Selection of an effective model from the variety of models available 
from various domains of ML, DL, and AI is a challenging and time- 
consuming task. Some traditional ML, DL, and AI methods have 
already been extensively researched. However, there is still scope for 
improvements, but it will be challenging. Additionally, finding an 
effective combination of ML, DL, and AI is a challenging task that re-
quires a significant amount of time and expertise. The scarcity of stan-
dards and enough sample data is one of the fundamental challenges 
when it comes to working with COVID-19. These are the two most 
fundamental challenges for researchers who intend to conduct research 
using ML, DL, or combinations of ML, DL, and AI-based techniques. 
5.Challenges and future research opportunities 
Many ML, DL, and other AI approaches depend on massive training 
data, such as clinical data, medical images, and other types of medical 
data. Large-scale training data is scarce and unavailable. It should be 
noted that determining the best models for COVID-19 diagnosis is 
challenging because of the scarcity of data. Further research is required 
to solve this issue. Moreover, a benchmark dataset is required for 
diagnosing COVID-19. 
Since the COVID-19 virus’s arrival, various variants have appeared 
due to mutations. Gathering data for different variants in a short period 
is complex, and there is always a shortage of COVID-19-related updated 
datasets. A combined and effective data gathering strategy is required to 
address this issue. Furthermore, a change in the variant might alter the 
performance of a model, which has been trained by a different variant 
previously. Hence, more research works are needed to investigate the 
performance of the previous studies on the new variants of COVID-19. 
COVID-19 samples have a low count of CT, MRI, and X-ray images 
compared to pneumonia infection and healthy human case samples. 
Data argumentation tries to generate new image sample from the 
existing samples by flipping, rotating, zooming, adding random noise in the existing images. Further studies are needed to measure the perfor -
mance of this strategy and its limitations. 
Using imbalanced datasets is an obvious shortcoming of recent 
studies. Data balancing is required for handling imbalanced datasets. 
The performances of the different models before and after balancing the 
datasets need to be compared. 
Similarly, there are many potential combinations of various sorts of 
data type, namely demographics, MRI, X-ray and CT images, sound/ 
audio data, and clinical, laboratory, and blood test data. However, 
combining multiple types of datasets (organized and unstructured) for 
various purposes of COVID-19 is needed for additional investigation. 
Furthermore, some factors in COVID-19 research impede AI-based 
ML and DL applications. Some of these factors are as follows.  
● Slow Legislation process  
● Security equipment and resource  
● Lack of large-scale data.  
● Vast rumors and noisy data. 
●The researchers have limited expertise at the intersection of com-
puter science and medical science.  
● Data security and privacy issues in collecting data. 
For tackling COVID-19, one of the necessary steps is to coordinate the 
participation of specialists who belong to other sectors and to include 
data from several studies. Most researchers’ backgrounds are in com-
puter science. However, a strong specialty in bioinformatics and various 
other relevant domains is needed for applying ML and DL to include 
additional knowledge of medical science in the COVID-19-related 
studies. 
In the middle of a pandemic wave, using the traditional diagnosis 
method to identify COVID-19 is a dangerous process. Because visiting a 
hospital for a COVID-19 test can spread the virus to others who haven’t 
already been exposed to the virus. Therefore, a remote COVID-19 End-to 
End diagnosis solution must be established in order to resolve the 
problem. In the future, it will be necessary to examine the problem by 
overcoming constraints and developing reliable and accurate End-to- 
End diagnosis solutions. 
Remote video diagnostics and consultations are available nowadays 
in different clinics and hospitals. In the future, by combining AI and 
NLP-based technologies, remote video diagnostic programs can be 
developed to replace the COVID-19 patients’ primary visits to the 
hospital. 
In ML, DL, and AI-based systems, various simulations may be utilized 
to examine how different social approaches affect the spread of disease. 
Furthermore, this technique may be applied to verify the trustworthi -
ness and explore scientific methods for the control and prevention of 
disease among citizens. 
AI-powered ML, DL, and other systems can create social networks 
and knowledge graphs to keep an eye on and follow the traits of in-
dividuals living next to COVID-19-affected patients, precisely antici -
pating and monitoring the disease’s spread. 
Intelligent robots can be utilized in initiatives such as, product dis-
tribution programs and medical treatment where human resources can 
be replaced. Taking those initiatives may halt the propagation of the 
COVID-19 epidemic. 
6.Conclusion 
This study focuses on ML, DL, and combinations of ML, DL, and AI- 
based studies that may help fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The pri-
mary objective of this study is to outline prior research works and how 
these works have been used to fight COVID-19. For that purpose, mul-
tiple academic search engines have been searched by using various 
keywords to find relevant studies. Those studies are filtered by using the 
defined criteria. Based on the abstract analysis, dataset analysis, inclu -
sion and exclusion criteria, and methodological quality, a final selection S.G. Paul et al.

15of 88 studies has been made. Among these studies, 25 studies employed 
ML techniques, 25 studies employed DL techniques, and the rest 38 
studies utilized the combination of ML, DL, and AI-based methods. This 
study has analyzed the prior research works by summarizing the applied 
methods in those works, comparing the performance of different models 
used and identifying the purpose of those works. 
92% of these studies are from different journals, and the rest 8% of 
these studies are conference papers. Most of the studies analyzed in this 
work are from 2022. USA conducted the maximum number of research 
works employing ML methods. On the other hand, the maximum num-
ber of works utilizing DL methods and the combination of ML, DL, and 
AI-based methods have been performed in India. RF model has been 
used most frequently in studies employing ML models, whereas different 
custom models have the highest frequency in DL-based studies. A variety 
of AI-based techniques have the highest frequency in the studies utiliz -
ing the combination of ML, Dl, and AI-based methods. In the evaluation 
process, most studies have emphasized accuracy to evaluate the per-
formance of the proposed models. 
The significant information discovered, investigated, and reported in 
this study are contemporary and up-to-date regarding COVID-19. For 
the appropriate content, we utilized precise keywords. These search 
terms yielded valuable results to achieve the aim of this study, though 
there is a chance we may have missed significant resources that are not 
shown by these terms. Some data might have been missed during the 
extraction of data from the selected studies. 
Various ML, DL, and combinations of ML, DL, and AI-based methods 
have emerged in recent years. In future, more combinations of different 
methods and complicated approaches can be analyzed for fighting 
against COVID-19. Future research works can consider combining a 
variety of data formats to precisely identify COVID-19.
