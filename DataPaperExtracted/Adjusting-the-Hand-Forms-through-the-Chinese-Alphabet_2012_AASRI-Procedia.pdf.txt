Abstract 
The Chinese Alphabet consists of 33 letters and 4 phonetic sy mbols, the Chinese Alphabet has 10 combined rules, these Chinese Alphabetic passwords can be combined into 1383 kinds of hand forms. People adjust the hand forms through the Chinese Alphabet, look for the consciousness passwords through the hand forms, it is likely for us to locate the consciousness passwords in the fingers. 1383 kinds of hand forms will again present in the form of patent.

1. Introduction The Chinese Alphabet consists of 33 letters and 4 phonetic symbols [1], these  Chinese Alphabetic passwords can be combined into 1383 kinds of hand forms. 7 vowels [2]: y˄i˅, w(u) , e, 
w, , o, v. 4 pure-vowels: , o, 
w, e. These vowels can be only identified by the phonetic symbols. 3 semi-vowels: y˄i˅, w(u) , v. These vowels can be not only identified by the phonetic symbols, but also be used as the consonants. 26 consonants [3,4]: z, c, s, j, p, , k, h, t, l, q, r, zh, ch, sh, x, z, c, s,∫, d, b, m, n, ŋ, f.

 23 pure-vowels: z, c, s, j, p, , k, h, t, l, q,  zh, ch, sh, x, z, c, s,∫, d, b, m,  f. They obey the running rules of consonants, and can not combine with the vowels into the vowels group. 3 semi-vowels: r, n, ŋ . They obey the running rules of consonants, and can combine with the vowels into the vowels group. People adjust the hand forms through the Chinese Al phabet, look for the consciousness passwords through the hand forms. How to adjust 1383 kinds of hand forms through the Chinese Alphabet? The basic structure of Chinese Alphabet: A Chinese word=a consonant+ a main vowel, the complete structure: A Chinese word= a consonant/semi-vowel + a semi-vowel+ a main vowel +a semi-vowel/semi-consonant. 2. Combination of Chinese Alphabet The action that the middle section of thumb’s anterior dactylopod wipes the following parts indicates the phonetic symbol . ―——the anterior dactylopod of forefinger. ⁄——the anterior dactylopod of medius. Ģ——the anterior dactylopod of leech-finger. ι——the anterior dactylopod of littlefinger. We will make a summarization of Chinese Alphabetic combined rules on the previous study. The action that the middle section of thumb’s anterior knuckle wipes the other four fingers indicates the Letters, the combined rules of Letters and Phonetic Symbols were shown as follows: (1)An anterior dactylopod of finger corresponds to a Phonetic Symbol, the vowel marked with the Phonetic Symbol is the main vowel. (2)The Phonetic Symbol ―,Ģ denote the forward direction; The Phonetic Symbol ⁄,ι denote the opposite direction. (3)Each Letter Password consists of two sections: one dactylopod (or knuckle) of upper finger + one dactylopod (or knuckle) of below finger, and the below finger is the main finger. (4)The knuckle of below finger indicates the Phonetic Symbol “―”: The same properties repeal each other [out], the opposite properties attract each other [in] ; the dactylopod of below finger indicates the Phonetic Symbol “―”: The same properties attract each other [in], the opposite properties repeal each other [out]. (5) The two parts of Letter Password need exchange their positions when the two parallel. (6) The path of combined Chinese Alphabet is a series  of smoothly arc line, the path of arc line depends on the moving direction of main vowel. (7) The Chinese Alphabet arranges for the Letter order, the both sections of main vowel clip the Phonetic Symbol together, the Phonetic Symbol of non-main vowel is arranged outside the Letter Password. (8) The direction of word path (in or out) depends on the final Letter. (9) The Letter Passwords in the same word obey the same Phonetic symbol instruction, we get rid of the Phonetic symbol of non-vowel Password and the rule does not make a detour. (10) The direction of softly Chinese Alphabet (no the Phonetic Symbol) chooses the opposite direction of Phonetic Symbol “―”. We can derive 1383 kinds of hand forms from th e above 10 rules. We should discuss the Chinese Alphabetic combination following these 4 steps: (1) the consonant/semi-vowel + the main vowel; (2)the consonant/semi-vowel + the main vowel + the semi-vowel/ semi-consonant; (3) the consonant/semi-vowel + the semi-vowel + the main vowel; (4) the consonant/semi-vowel + the semi-vowel + the main vowel + the semi-vowel/ semi-consonant. Due to the limitation of paper, we only select the first two steps to discuss.  334   Yunfeng Zhu and Huanchang Qin   /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  332 – 338

3. Conclusion By now, the Chinese Alphabetic passwords and its combined laws have been introduced. We adjust the hand forms through the Chinese Alphabet, look for the consciousness passwords through the hand forms. The consciousness passwords are more instructive than the Chinese Alphabetic passwords, we try to illustrate the significance by examples. We grab a stick with a hand, the side which con tact with the stick is the inner side, represents a subjective verb; the other side is the outside, represents an objective verb. The objective verb——tuō, its Chinese Alphabetic Figure(Fig 21), its Consciousness Figure(Fig 22): The anterior dactylopod’s outside of forefinger→ the anterior dactylopod’s outside of little-finger. In like manner we illustrate some conscious passwords as follows: The action that the anterior dactylopod’s outside of thumb wipes the following parts represents the consciousness passwords of objective verbs:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       tuō                           ch~ŋ                                                  tuō                              tuō                                    bvu                             bō

tuō——the anterior dactylopod’s outside of forefinger→the anterior dactylopod’s outside of little-finger. For example, tuō——take off one's clothes (out)[Fig 23]. bvu——the anterior knuckle’s outside of forefinger→the anterior dactylopod’s outside of little-finger. For example, bāu——shuck peanuts (out)[ Fig 23]. ch~ŋ——the anterior dactylopod’s outside of little -finger→the anterior dactylopod’s outside of little- finger. For example, ch~ŋ——open clothes to let the enemy searched(in)[Fig 24]. bō——the anterior dactylopod’s outside of little-finger→the anterior knuckle’s outside of forefinger. For example, bō——wushu master peels the bark. (in)[Fig 24]. 338   Yunfeng Zhu and Huanchang Qin   /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  332 – 338 
 It is likely for us to locate the consciousness passwo rds in the fingers through the hand forms. These 1383 kinds of hand forms on the Chinese Alphabet will present again in the form of patent.
