Active learning  has been widely used in drug discovery  and design in recent years. In this viewpoint,  we will 
brieﬂy summarize  applications  of AL for drug discovery  and propose two potential  limitations  of research  in this 
ﬁeld. 
Main text 
In most drug discovery  projects,  the scarcity  of data sometimes  hin- 
ders the application  of deep learning  models,  which rely heavily  on the 
quantity  and quality of training  data [1] . Moreover,  generating  training  
data by human selection  requires  a lot of resources  and even leads to 
waste. For example,  the newly “labeled  ”(i.e., designed  and synthesized)  
compounds  may not provide  novel insights  into the structure–activity  
relationship  compared  to the original  training  data. Therefore,  a ratio- 
nal and objective  sample selection  method  for deciding  which samples  
should be labeled  is essential.  Active learning  [ 2 , 3 ] (AL) has been pro- 
posed to play such a role. 
AL is a subdiscipline  in machine  learning  (ML) where the algorithm  
iteratively  selects the most useful samples  from the unlabeled  dataset 
and queries  the expert (or some other information  source)  to label them, 
so as to reduce the cost of labeling  while improving  model performance.  
To our knowledge,  the application  of AL algorithm  to drug discovery  
starts with the pioneering  work of Warmuth  et al [4] . Their work high- 
lighted the ﬁtness of AL to process  labeling  tasks in pharmaceutical  
research  and development.  Recently,  the topic has gained momentum,  
driven by the improved  accuracy  of ML prediction  models [5] . Several  
promising  studies have been reported  for diﬀerent  drug development  
projects  in the last two decades  such as focused  library design [6] , ra- 
tional de novo design [7] , and drug combination  [8] . Given the long- 
standing  practical  veriﬁcation  of its eﬀectiveness,  AL has shown poten- 
tial to be an easily deployable  technology  to assist researchers  in their 
molecular  reasoning  and experimental  design. 
In this viewpoint  we summarize  the promising  applications  of AL 
and review brieﬂy some of the limitations  to be addressed  in the future.

E-mail address: myzheng@simm.ac.cn  (M. Zheng). A majority  of the previously  published  studies focused  on the ability 
of AL algorithm  to identify  desirable  samples  and enhance  ML models 
through  additional  training  data [9–11] . This ability makes it a well- 
suited choice for guiding  labeling  tasks. According  to the needs of dif- 
ferent applications,  the preference  of AL can be adjusted  ﬂexibly  by 
deﬁning  diﬀerent  query strategies  (selection  functions).  For example,  
some exploration-oriented  query strategies  quantify  the uncertainty  of 
models’  predictions,  and tend to select samples  with novel structures  
to enlarge  the applicability  domain  of models [10] . On the other hand, 
exploitation-oriented  query strategies  aim to select the samples  with the 
highest  property,  such as compound  binding  aﬃnities  against  a certain 
target, and the models based on such a query strategy  often show en- 
hanced  hit rates [12] . 
In addition  to the application  of prospectively  guiding  labeling  tasks, 
retrospective  applications  of AL on data sets with known labels have 
also been explored  by researchers.  First, deploying  AL on labeled  data 
sets can rapidly  compare  diﬀerent  model architectures  and query strate- 
gies to obtain the best AL workﬂows  before applying  them in costly 
prospective  studies [ 10 , 13 ]. Secondly,  AL can serve as a data ﬁltering  
tool [10] to remove  redundant  data that have already  been understood  
by the ML model based on previous  training  data and thereby  cannot 
oﬀer any further knowledge.  Finally,  some studies reported  that the sub- 
sample of training  data chosen by AL are always balanced,  even when 
the original  dataset is highly imbalanced.  It suggests  that AL algorithm  
may also contribute  as a data balancing  technique  [14] . 
The AL concept  has been successfully  applied  to drug discovery  for 
its promising  applications  mentioned  above. However,  some limitations  
are still present  in AL algorithm.  Some of the studies have reported  that 
the improved  hit rate triggered  by the deploying  of AL is closely linked

to the performance  of the ML model [5] . Moreover,  the ability of mod- 
els to pick balanced  training  data is tightly-bound  to the complexity  
of the employed  model architecture  and its predictive  capability  [14] . 
Thus, the power of AL is heavily  dependent  on the model architecture.  
Recently,  Transformer  model and its derivatives  have led to promis-  
ing performance  for property  prediction  and molecular  representation  
[15] . However,  they require  a large number  of parameters  and expensive  
training  process,  which makes them unsuitable  for AL that needs con- 
stant iteration.  As a result, how to combine  AL with powerful  models 
like Transformer  in a more economical  way is a problem  to be resolved  
in the future. 
Uncertainty  sampling  is the most commonly  implemented  and best 
understood  AL query strategy  [ 5 , 10 ], and entropy  sampling  is one of the 
most widely used uncertainty-based  query strategies  due to its model- 
agnostic  nature and ease of implementation.  However,  entropy  sampling  
only captures  the aleatoric  uncertainty  [16] , and neglects  the epistemic  
uncertainty  [16] . It means that the entropy  sampling,  as an uncertainty  
quantiﬁcation  method,  may be over-optimistic  in some scenarios  [17] . 
To address  this problem,  the epistemic  uncertainty  must be taken into 
consideration  in the process  of uncertainty  quantiﬁcation.  Currently  
ensemble-based  approaches  [18] are still accepted  as state of the art 
for epistemic  uncertainty  quantiﬁcation  [19] . But they usually  require  
extensive  computational  costs and runtimes,  which poses a major chal- 
lenge to deploying  them in iterative  AL procedures.  Therefore,  to quan- 
tify the epistemic  uncertainty  in a fast, calibrated,  and scalable  way is 
also an urgent need. Although  a few methods  have been proposed  to 
solve this problem,  their eﬀectiveness  needs to be veriﬁed  in the future 
[17] . 
Conclusion  
In this viewpoint,  we ﬁrst introduce  the promising  and widely used 
applications  of AL in drug design, including  guiding  experimental  design 
and helping  to remove  of redundant  information.  It should be noted that 
currently  there are multiple  software  applications,  such as Active Learn- 
ing Glide and Active Learning  FEP + available  in the Schrödinger  Suite, 
which utilize AL to accelerate  the drug discovery  process.  As claimed,  an 
AL-based  protocol  successfully  recovered  more than 80% of the experi- 
mentally  conﬁrmed  hits with a 14-fold  reduction  in compute  cost [20] . 
It shows the high status of AL in alleviating  the intractable  computa-  
tional cost of virtual screening  of today’s ultra-large  chemical  libraries.  
This viewpoint  is also devoted  to pointing  out main limitations  of AL al- 
gorithm.  Because  of its iterative  nature, AL algorithm  is not suitable  for 
complex  model architectures  and ensemble-based  epistemic  uncertainty  
quantiﬁcation  methods,  which may limit the applications  of AL. Solving  
these problems  is important  for the development  of AL and needs the 
joint participation  and eﬀorts of researchers  of diﬀerent  ﬁelds. Declaration  of Competing  Interest
