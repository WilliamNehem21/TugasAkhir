This study proposes a method for developing equipment lifespan estimators that combine physical information
and numerical data, both of which may be incomplete. Physical information may not have a uniform fit to all
experimental data, and health information may only be available at the initial and final periods. To address
these issues, a procedure is defined to adjust the model to different subsets of available data, constrained
by feasible trajectories in the health status space. Additionally, a new health model for rechargeable lithium
batteries is proposed, and a use case is presented to demonstrate its efficacy. The optimistic (max–max) strategy
is found to be the most suitable for diagnosing battery lifetime, based on the results.
1. Introduction
Obtaining labelled data for predicting the State of Health (SoH)
and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a system is challenging because
it is not always feasible to measure the system’s health using non-
destructive procedures. Generally, RUL prediction models are trained
using data from systems that have already failed, resulting in training
sets that only contain data from deteriorated systems. Consequently,
the labels are incomplete, with health information available only at the
initial instant (when the system is undamaged) and at the final instant
(when it has reached the end of its life). Although partial information
is available during the intermediate periods (because health is known
to evolve monotonically), conventional supervised learning is not pos-
sible. This has led to three groups of approaches to address the issue, as
reviewed in [ 1]: discrete-state and steady-state deterioration models for
systems with observable state [ 2], proportional hazard models (PHM)
for dynamic environments [ 3], and discrete-space methods associated
with Markov processes [ 4].
Steady-state models aim to predict the probability distribution of
lifetime based on the system’s past state variables, often using stochas-
tic processes such as Brownian motion [ 5], Gamma processes [ 6], or
Inverse Gaussian [ 7]. However, the use of steady-state models may
be limited by real-world constraints, such as an imperfect fit of the
theoretical model or time-varying environments. To overcome these
limitations, researchers have studied combining stochastic methods
with machine learning techniques using pre-existing run-to-failure data,

discussed in [ 8,9], and [ 10].
In this study we propose a procedure for learning RUL from partially
unlabelled datasets by introducing constraints based on the system’s
causes of deterioration. This results in a family of probability distribu-
tions of equipment health, sharing properties with certain maximum
likelihood inference procedures for incomplete data. In previous re-
search [ 11], an informed learning algorithm was proposed that incor-
porates physical knowledge (a set of imprecise differential equations)
into a possibility distribution of the system’s health state over time. The
current work presents a variation of that approach, where imprecision
in the physical knowledge is resolved by discarding the inconsistent
portion of the training set. A set of models will be defined, each adapted
to a family of subsets of the training set. The same max–max, max–min,
and min–max-regret strategies presented in [ 12] will be extended to
this problem.
The procedure being developed will be customised to determine the
health status of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which is crucial for
economic and safety reasons. For instance, in medical applications such
as pacemakers or implanted defibrillators, anticipating deterioration
that could jeopardise the equipment’s operation is critical. In transport,
preventing degradations that limit electric vehicle autonomy or affect
passenger safety is necessary. Additionally, battery failures in consumer
electronics can impact equipment performance and result in fires or

accidents [13]. From an economic perspective, repairing batteries for
some portable devices can be more expensive than replacing the entire
equipment. In other cases, such as electric vehicles, batteries account
for a significant portion of equipment costs.
Current research is focused on developing condition-based predic-
tive maintenance procedures that can anticipate battery degradation
before failure [14]. Steady-state models, like the one proposed in this
study, are effective in estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of
batteries [15]. Specifically, this study builds upon a previous publica-
tion [16] that introduced a similar procedure based on empirical risk
minimisation.
1.1. Novelty and contribution
This study is an extended version of the Ref. [16], where a specific
procedure for battery health diagnosis was defined. This version pro-
vides a theoretical basis to extend this procedure to a broader category
of problems, keeping the application to batteries as an example of
application. In particular, the novelties of this paper with respect to
the previous version are:
•A methodology for learning health models from both data and
physical information about the system, which effectively handles
uncertainty in both types of information.
•The implementation of max–max, max–min, and min–max-regret
criteria for selecting a consistent subset of training data in lifetime
estimation problems.
•A new health model definition for lithium-ion batteries with a
negative electrode consisting of graphite and silicon.
1.2. Overview
The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the
theoretical problem, defines the health model and particularises the
strategies for choosing parameters in the face of incomplete informa-
tion. In Section 3 the problem is particularised to the study of battery
deterioration. A simplified electrochemical model is proposed and the
alternatives introduced in the previous section are implemented. Sec-
tion 4 develops an empirical study with real and simulated batteries.
The conclusions of the study are presented in Section 5. Appendix
includes additional details on the degradation mechanisms of batteries
of the type used in the empirical study.
2. RUL learning from positive and weakly labelled examples
This section proposes a method for estimating the lifetime of a
system from a physical model and from measured data on a system
that has developed a failure. The physical model consists of a set of
differential equations and depends on hidden variables that can only
be known indirectly.
2.1. Notation
Let𝐮𝑡be the vector of inputs to the system at time 𝑡,𝐲𝑡the vector
of outputs and 𝐱𝑡the vector of hidden (not directly observable) state
variables. The physical model of the system consists of a pair of time-
varying, non-linear differential equations defined by two functions 𝑓(⋅)
and𝑔(⋅), belonging to a given parametric family:
̇𝐱𝑡=𝑓(𝐱𝑡,𝐮𝑡,𝜃𝑡) (1)
̂𝐲𝑡=𝑔(𝐱𝑡,𝐮𝑡,𝜃𝑡) (2)
A training set is available, which is a sequence of the observable inputs
and outputs 𝐃= [𝐮𝑡,𝐲𝑡]𝑇
𝑡=1of the system at a set of time instants
𝑡= 1,…,𝑇. The true SoH of the system cannot be observed but in thefirst (𝑡= 1) and last (𝑡=𝑇) time periods. The SoH model is a function
of the same parameter 𝜃𝑡:
̂SoH(𝜃𝑡) ∈ [0,1] (3)
The SoH takes the value 1 when the system has no deterioration and 0
when it has reached its end of life. In this study it is understood that
the SoH is the quotient between the life expectancy at instant 𝑡and the
expected life at 𝑡= 1, thus
RUL(𝑡) =RUL(1)⋅SoH(𝜃𝑡). (4)
We will use the notation 𝜃= (𝜃1,…,𝜃𝑇)to refer to the set of parameters
that define 𝑓and𝑔over time. It will be considered that by ‘‘model
learning’’ we mean estimating, according to criteria to be discussed
later, a parameter ̂𝜃from the training set 𝐃. Finally, by ‘‘learning
algorithm’’ we mean a function that produces an estimate ̂𝜃from
𝐃:
̂𝜃=(𝐃) (5)
2.2. Dealing with uncertainty in data and model
In general, the ̂𝐲𝑡predictions of the model will not correspond
exactly to the 𝐲𝑡measurements of the training set for a number of
reasons. On the one hand, it will be assumed that there are inputs to the
system that are not being modelled. The influence of these unmodelled
inputs on the output will be treated as random noise. On the other
hand, a second type of uncertainty, of an epistemic nature, will also
be considered. This uncertainty arises when the available physical
information about the system (the Eqs. (1) and (2) mentioned above) is
approximate and therefore a perfect fit of the model parameters to all
training data is not possible, even if these data were not contaminated
with noise.
In fully data-driven (or ‘‘black box’’) models, a differentiated treat-
ment of epistemic uncertainty is usually not necessary, as it can be
reduced by increasing the complexity of the model. However, when
physical knowledge and data are integrated, it cannot be ruled out
that the a priori knowledge is inaccurate, so that a non-stochastic
uncertainty is being introduced into the problem. In this study, as
in other work on Physically Informed Learning (PIL) [17], physical
knowledge will be incorporated by introducing constraints on the ob-
jective function of the learning problem in order to reduce the solution
space [18]. If an incorrect constraint were introduced, it would be
possible for the solution of the problem to fall outside the feasible area;
this is a problem that has only recently begun to be studied [19].
In particular, as will be seen in the next sections, we will assume
that the degradation of the system is defined by a matrix with the
deterioration rate of each component of the system at each instant
of time. Each element of this matrix depends on the same vector of
parameters 𝜃𝑡as the equations that define the physical knowledge
about the problem (see Eqs. (1), (2) and (3)). These equations are
simplifications of reality and therefore a perfect fit to the data cannot be
expected; alternatively, parameter values may be found for which the
model correctly explains one part of the data and does not fit others.
Reciprocally, if we list all the subsets of the data that can be explained
by some parameter value, we end up with a set of parameters, which
contains all those values that explain at least part of the training set.
This set-valued estimate of 𝜃𝑡will, in turn, give rise to a set-valued
estimate of the health of the system at each instant in time. This
treatment has precedents in some methods used to select consistent
subsets of data in inverse problems [20]. The aim is to identify the
minimum area region in the parameter space that explains the entire
training data set. Finally, as mentioned above, we will employ proce-
dures similar to those developed for maximum likelihood estimation
from imprecise data [12] to estimate the health of the system and its
remaining lifetime.Array 20 (2023) 100321

2.3. State of health model
We will call 𝑃𝑦the joint probability of the output of the system and
the model. The empirical likelihood function is denoted as
𝓁1(𝜃,𝐃) =𝑇∏
𝑡=1𝑃𝑦(̂ 𝑦𝑡,𝑦𝑡∣𝜃) (6)
and we will denote 1the learning algorithm that returns the value of
the parameter that maximises this empirical likelihood
𝓁1(1(𝐃),𝐃) = arg max
𝜃𝓁1(𝜃,𝐃). (7)
As in Ref. [11], we will assume that the system is subject to different
types of deterioration at the same time. We will denote 𝐶the set of
deterioration types and call SoH𝑐(𝜃𝑡)the health of the system relative
to the deterioration of type 𝑐∈𝐶. The relative healths are related to
the health of the whole system as follows:
̂SoH(𝜃𝑡) = min
𝑐∈𝐶̂SoH𝑐(𝜃𝑡). (8)
On the other hand, the SoH will also be considered to be maintained
or decreased over time. The 1algorithm does not guarantee this
condition, so several restrictions must be added to it.
On the one hand, the periods between the first and the penultimate
are not labelled. Our knowledge is limited to
SoH(𝜃1) = 1 (9)
SoH(𝜃𝑇) = 0 (10)
SoH(𝜃𝑡)≤SoH(𝜃𝑡−1) (11)
For this reason, we can define a rate of deterioration 𝛿𝑐
𝑡∈ [0,1]as
𝛿𝑐
𝑡=̂SoH𝑐(𝜃𝑡)
̂SoH𝑐(𝜃𝑡−1)(12)
and establish that the feasible region 𝛤of the parameter set is com-
posed of the values of 𝜃that can be expressed by means of any suitable
matrix [𝛿𝑐
𝑡], with𝑇rows and #𝐶columns, where
𝜃∈𝛤⟺∃[𝛿𝑐
𝑡] ∈ [0,1](#𝐶×𝑇)
with𝛿1
𝑐= 1 ∀𝑐∈𝐶,

𝑐>0for𝑡= 2,…,𝑇− 1,
s.t.̂SoH(𝜃𝑡) = min
𝑐∈𝐶𝑡∏
𝜏=1𝛿𝑐
𝜏∀𝑡= 1,…,𝑇(13)
On the other hand, each matrix [𝛿𝑐
𝑡]can be associated with a subset
of the feasible space 𝛩([𝛿𝑐
𝑡])⊂ 𝛤, whose associated models have an
evolution in SoH compatible with that deterioration matrix:
𝛩([𝛿𝑐
𝑡]) = {𝜃∈𝛤∶̂SoH(𝜃𝑡) = min
𝑐∈𝐶𝑡∏
𝜏=1𝛿𝑐
𝜏,for𝑡= 1,…,𝑇} (14)
so that the likelihood of this deterioration rate matrix can be defined
as
𝓁2([𝛿𝑐
𝑡],𝐃) ={
sup{𝓁1(𝜃,𝐃) ∶𝜃∈𝛩([𝛿𝑐
𝑡])}if𝛩([𝛿𝑐
𝑡])≠∅
0 else(15)
Lastly, we will denote the mapping
[̂𝛿𝑐
𝑡] =(𝐃) (16)
that returns the deterioration matrix that maximises the empirical
likelihood of the deterioration rate
𝓁2((𝐃),𝐃) = max
𝑀𝓁1(𝑀,𝐃)with𝑀∈ [0,1](#𝐶×𝑇). (17)
and a learning algorithm 2that returns the parameter of the most
likely model whose SoH is feasible
𝓁1(2(𝐃),𝐃) = max
𝜃∈𝛩((𝐃))𝓁1(𝜃,𝐃) (18)2.4. Implementation of max–max, min–max and min–max-regret strategies
In different practical cases (including the problem related to battery
deterioration discussed below) models based on differential equations
are a simplification of reality. This means that the model will not
have a homogeneous fit at all points in the sample. This is a common
problem in supervised learning (think, for example, of the treatment of
outliers in regression problems) but in this context it is not immediately
obvious which parts of the dataset 𝐃should be discarded so that the
maximum likelihood estimate of the model deterioration rates is the
model that most closely describes the actual evolution of the health
state. Moreover, as will be seen below, there are practical problems
where the subset of 𝐃to be discarded depends on the deterioration
mode, so it is not possible to perform instance selection and discard
inconsistent values before model fitting.
Let us suppose that the indices of the most informative elements in
𝐃belong to an unknown set 𝐒⊂{1,…,𝑇}, and let 𝐒𝑡=𝐒∩ {1,…,𝑡}.
First, we define the incremental datasets
𝐃𝑡(𝐒) = [𝐮𝜏,𝐲𝜏]𝜏∈𝐒𝑡(19)
with the values of the observed variables in the system at the instants
in𝐒𝑡. Let𝑀𝑡(𝐒)be a submatrix of the deterioration rates, 𝑀𝑡= [𝛿𝑐
𝜏]
with𝜏∈𝐒𝑡,𝑐∈𝐶. The sequence of likelihoods of the models obtained
by applying the 2algorithm to the successive sets 𝐃𝑡are
𝐿([𝛿𝑐
𝑡],𝐒) = [𝓁2(𝑀1(𝐒),𝐃1(𝐒)),…,𝓁2(𝑀𝑇(𝐒),𝐃𝑇(𝐒))] (20)
If the set 𝐒is not known, but a family S⊃𝐒of alternatives is available,
a sequence of sets of likelihood values will be available
𝐿([𝛿𝑐
𝑡],S) = [𝓁2(𝑀𝑡(𝐒),𝐃𝑡(𝐒)) ∶𝐒∈S]𝑇
𝑡=1(21)
and the value of the parameter [𝛿𝑐
𝑡]can be chosen with different
strategies. In the specialised literature, the following three options have
been studied the most:
1. max–max strategy: This consists of choosing the parameter that
maximises the product of the likelihoods at each time instant. In
the case where {1,…,𝑇} ∈S, this strategy coincides with the 2
algorithm.
2. Min–max strategy: This consists of choosing the best parameter
in the worst case. In this context, to each deterioration matrix
[𝛿𝑐
𝑡], the smallest component of 𝐿([𝛿𝑐
𝑡],S)would be assigned,
and the deterioration matrix that maximises that value would
be sought.
3. Min–max-regret strategy: The regret of choosing a deterioration
different from the most likely one is minimised at each time
instant. The regret value of choosing a set of indices 𝐑at time𝑡
is
regret( 𝐑,𝑡) =𝓁2(𝑀𝑡(𝐑),𝐃𝑡(𝐑))
max𝐒∈S𝓁2(𝑀𝑡(𝐒),𝐃𝑡(𝐒))(22)
Each deterioration matrix is assigned the maximum regret value,
and the matrix that minimises this maximum is chosen.
3. Particularisation to battery deterioration
The method defined in the previous section is particularised for
the estimation of the SoH of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries in this
section. In order to define the knowledge-based criteria for determining
whether or not the battery health is compatible with the history of the
system variables, a brief description of the battery parts that are subject
to deterioration, and to the latent and observable variables of this type
of systems, is first provided.Array 20 (2023) 100321

3.1. Electrochemical battery model
The battery terminal voltage is the difference between the positive
and negative electrode potentials. Each electrode has a resting potential
that depends on its degree of lithiation, which is the ratio of the
number of moles of lithium ion intercalated in the active material to its
capacity. The electrode potential increases when current flows through
it [21], non-linearly with the value of the current.
In this study we will analyse a recent type of high-capacity batteries
in which the negative electrode is composed of a mixture of materials:
graphite and silicon [22]. We will refer to the moles of lithium ion at
the positive electrode as 𝑙PE, to the capacity of the positive electrode
as𝑐PEand to the potential of the positive electrode as 𝑉PE. Similarly,
at the negative electrodes of graphite and silicon the moles of lithium
ion are called 𝑙Grand𝑙Si, the potentials are called 𝑉Grand𝑉Siand the
capacities are 𝑐Grand𝑐Si.
When a positive electric current 𝐼(𝑡)(discharge current) flows
through the battery, lithium ions are displaced from the positive to the
negative electrode, and when the current is negative, lithium ions are
displaced from the negative to the positive electrode. For low currents,
it can be assumed without excessive error that the electrodes are in
equilibrium at any instant of time. This equilibrium is described by the
following equations:
𝑉Gr(𝑙Gr(𝑡)∕𝑐Gr(𝑡),𝐼Gr(𝑡)) =𝑉Si(𝑙Si(𝑡)∕𝑐Si(𝑡),𝐼Si(𝑡))
𝐼Gr(𝑡) +𝐼Si(𝑡) =𝐼(𝑡)(23)
The voltage at the battery terminals is
𝑉BAT(𝑡) =𝑉PE(𝑙PE(𝑡)∕𝑐PE(𝑡),𝐼(𝑡)) −𝑉Gr(𝑙Gr(𝑡)∕𝑐Gr(𝑡),𝐼Gr(𝑡)). (24)
For low currents, assuming that all electrochemical processes are in
equilibrium, the terminal voltage of the battery therefore depends on
the following:
•The initial lithiation states of electrodes
•The capacities of each electrode
•The battery charge
•The charging or discharging current
This dependency is expressed as follows:
𝑉BAT(𝑡) =𝑉PE((𝑙PE(0) −𝑄(𝑡))∕𝑐PE(𝑡),𝐼(𝑡))−
𝑉Gr((𝑙Gr(0) +𝑄Gr(𝑡))∕𝑐Gr(𝑡),𝐼Gr(𝑡))(25)
where
𝐼(𝜏) =𝑑𝑄
𝑑𝑡||||𝜏(26)
𝐼(𝑡) =𝐼Gr(𝑡) +𝐼Si(𝑡) (27)
𝑄(𝑡) =𝑄Gr(𝑡) +𝑄Si(𝑡) −𝑄Gr(0) −𝑄Si(0) (28)
𝑉Gr((𝑙Gr(0)+𝑄Gr(𝑡))∕𝑐Gr(𝑡),𝐼Gr(𝑡))=
𝑉Si((𝑙Si(0) +𝑄Si(𝑡))∕𝑐Si(𝑡),𝐼Si(𝑡))(29)
Using the notation of the previous section, the input variable is the
current, the output is the battery terminal voltage and the state vari-
ables are the amount of lithium in each electrode and their capacities:
𝐱(𝑡) = (𝑙Gr,𝑙Si,𝑙PE,𝑐Gr,𝑐Si,𝑐PE) (30)
𝐲(𝑡) =𝑉BAT (31)
𝐮(𝑡) =𝐼(𝑡) (32)
3.2. Observable and latent variables
During battery use, certain phenomena occur that reduce the capac-
ities of the electrodes or the mobility of the lithium. These degradation
processes reduce the battery’s capacity to store an electrical charge, and
thus the battery’s service life.
For the purposes of this study, the SoH of a battery depends on five
latent (i.e. not directly observable) variables. Assuming the battery is
discharged at time 𝑡0, the values of these variables at time 𝑡≥𝑡0are:1.𝑧1: The capacity of the positive electrode, 𝑐PE(𝑡).
2.𝑧2: The capacity of the graphite in the negative electrode, 𝑐Gr(𝑡).
3.𝑧3: The capacity of the silicon in the negative electrode, 𝑐Si(𝑡).
4.𝑧4: The amount of lithium in the positive electrode when the
battery was discharged, 𝑙PE(𝑡0).
5.𝑧5: The amount of lithium in the negative electrode when the
battery was discharged, 𝑙Gr(𝑡0) +𝑙Si(𝑡0).
The charge capacity CAP of the battery is limited by the amount of
lithium in the negative electrode that can be transported to the positive
electrode (the ‘‘lithium inventory’’) but also by the free space in the
positive electrode that receives it (both measured when the battery was
discharged, at time 𝑡0). The capacities of the electrodes can also shrink
in time, thus at time 𝑡
CAP(𝑡) = min(𝑙Gr(𝑡0) +𝑙Si(𝑡0),𝑐PE(𝑡) −𝑙PE(𝑡0),𝑐Gr(𝑡) +𝑐Si(𝑡)) (33)
= min(𝑧5(𝑡0),𝑧1(𝑡) −𝑧4(𝑡0),𝑧2(𝑡) +𝑧3(𝑡0)) (34)
Let the vector of latent variables at time 𝑡be
𝐳(𝑡) = (𝑧1(𝑡),…,𝑧5(𝑡)) (35)
and let
𝐙(𝑡) = [𝐳(𝑡0),…,𝐳(𝑡)] (36)
be the matrix containing the history of the values of the latent variables
since𝑡=𝑡0, when the battery was discharged. We define three
deterioration modes:
SoH1(𝐙) =𝑧5(𝑡)∕CAP(0) (37)
SoH2(𝐙) = (𝑧1(𝑡) −𝑧4(𝑡0))∕CAP(0) (38)
SoH3(𝐙) = (𝑧2(𝑡) +𝑧3(𝑡))∕CAP(0) (39)
and the SoH of the battery is
SoH(𝐙) = min( SoH1(𝐙),SoH2(𝐙),SoH3(𝐙)) (40)
Finally, we would like to point out that not all deterioration modes
affect battery capacity instantaneously. Health is the minimum of three
values (recall Eq. (8)), and the evolution of one of the modes may
not reduce the capacity until it becomes the main deterioration mode.
The RUL estimator takes these hidden evolutions into account, as
extrapolation of charge capacity over time can have abrupt changes
in slope when one of the non-visible modes becomes the predominant
mode. A high proportion of works applying machine learning to predict
health evolution do not take into account this [23], so incorporating
physical knowledge into learning allows for better results than merely
modelling the evolution of observable variables.
3.3. Implementation of maximum likelihood strategies
Fig. 1 shows the battery terminal voltage, positive and negative
electrode voltages and model predictions during a low-current charge/
discharge cycle of a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. Fig. 2 shows the
evolution of these curves during normal battery ageing. Please note
that the electrode potentials, namely 𝑉PE,𝑉Gr, and𝑉Si, depend on the
sign of the charging current. However, we have excluded this hysteresis
effect from the model discussed in the previous section to keep the
explanation simple.
It is worth noting that the potential curve of the positive electrode
experiences an abrupt variation when the battery is completely dis-
charged. However, this variation does not affect the voltage observed at
the battery terminals in most cases, except when the positive electrode
is severely degraded. On the other hand, the negative electrode’s poten-
tial curve also exhibits a similar abrupt variation, but this variation can
significantly impact the battery voltage. Therefore, at states of charge
lower than 5%, even a slight inaccuracy in determining the internal
state can result in a significant change in the model’s prediction. ToArray 20 (2023) 100321

avoid this issue, it is common practice in the specialised literature to
disregard periods of the training set where the charge is very low [15].
The same reasoning can be applied to very high states of charge
(greater than 95%). On the other hand, not all battery deteriorations
(as detailed in the Appendix) can be detected in the same way during
both the charge and discharge half cycles. In case the model is trained
using only one charge cycle or one discharge cycle, the diagnosis of
the battery’s health will differ from when the model is trained on the
entire battery dataset. This difference can be observed clearly in the
incremental capacity curves (ICA curves [24]), which are commonly
used for health diagnostic tasks and represent the charge derivative
versus voltage curve [25] (see Fig. 3).
4. Empirical study
To facilitate benchmarking of results by battery experts, in addition
to making RUL and health predictions, the mechanisms of battery
deterioration will be analysed by means of some metrics commonly
used in the literature [26]. These metrics are described in the Appendix
for the convenience of the reader.
Experiments are divided into three parts. In the first part, the
proposed algorithm is applied to Li-Ion batteries simulated using theALAWA tool [27]. The reason for using simulated batteries is to validate
the deterioration learning algorithm in problems with known outcome,
to assess the degree of fit of the proposed alternative and to compare
it with other uninformed learning techniques. In the second and third
parts, the method is applied to real batteries. First, the deterioration
of a battery is analysed numerically, showing the difference between
different types of diagnosis. Finally, the deterioration diagnosis of four
cells, two of them with normal ageing and two with accelerated ageing,
is shown, showing the influence of the subset of the training dataset on
the diagnostic conclusions.
4.1. Simulated batteries
A realistic synthetic 5 Ah battery has been simulated. The positive
electrode is NMC (Nickel, Manganese and Cobalt) and the negative
electrode consists of a combination of graphite and silicon [28]. The
capacity of the positive electrode is 5.55 Ah. The capacities of the
graphite and silicon in the negative electrode are 4.5 Ah and 0.5 Ah,
respectively. The positive electrode is 90% lithiated at the beginning of
the charge and is completely de-lithiated at the end of the charge. The
negative electrode of the non-deteriorated battery is fully delithiated atArray 20 (2023) 100321

inventory was used as a metric for the model fit.
The family of subsets used in this part of the experimentation has
the following elements: S= {𝐒1,𝐒2,𝐒3}:
𝐒1= {𝑡∶𝐼(𝑡)>0,𝑄(𝑡)≥0.05⋅CAP(𝑡),𝑄(𝑡)≤0.95⋅CAP(𝑡)} (41)
𝐒2= {𝑡∶𝐼(𝑡)<0,𝑄(𝑡)≥0.05⋅CAP(𝑡),𝑄(𝑡)≤0.95⋅CAP(𝑡)} (42)
𝐒3= {𝑡∶𝑄(𝑡)≥0.05⋅CAP(𝑡),𝑄(𝑡)≤0.95⋅CAP(𝑡)} (43)
Table 1 shows the errors obtained by the unconstrained algorithms
(learning algorithm 1) and those of the models proposed in this
study. The 2(𝐃)column contains the results of the empirical likelihood
minimisation over the full charge and discharge cycle. The 2(S)-MM
column is the max–max strategy. The 2(S)-Mm column is the maximin
strategy. The 2(S)-mMR column is the min–max-regret strategy.
The mean error is better in models with informed learning, the
version that offers the best results is the minimin/optimistic alterna-
tive. This is an expected result, as the optimistic version is robust to
coarsening processes [29]. The pessimistic or minimin-regret versions
try to minimise the wrong risk in those phases of the cycle where
deteriorations do not manifest themselves.Table 2

4.1.1. Regularised learning
The experiments have been repeated by adding a regularisation
term to all optimisation problems where the modulus of the matrix [𝛿𝑐
𝑡]
is penalised. Table 2 shows the errors of the regularised versions, which
support the same conclusions drawn from Table 1. In this case, the
use of regularisation of type 𝐿1, which leads to a sparse deterioration
vector, improves the results because each battery has undergone a
single deterioration process in the validation data (i.e., the optimal
solution of each problem is a vector in which all components are
zero except one; the regularisation penalises solutions with more than
one concurrent deterioration and is therefore expected to improve the
results of this method for this particular validation set.)
4.2. Actual batteries (I)
The results obtained in synthetic batteries show that the informed
strategy, in its optimistic version, has the best accuracy in estimating
the type and intensity of deteriorations. It has also been shown that
the addition of a regularisation term is beneficial, provided that the
assumption that the number of concurrent deterioration types is low is
accepted.
In simulated batteries the model prediction error is close to zero.
It is worth asking whether the model approximation error in a real
battery will cancel out the differences between the techniques studied
or whether, on the contrary, the improvement in the accuracy of
the weak supervision estimation will be relevant in real problems.
To study this case we have used a Samsung-SDI INR18650-35E cell,
with a standard discharge capacity of 3350 mAh, which was subjectedArray 20 (2023) 100321

to a standard set of tests [ 28]. A multichannel, high-precision series
Arbin LBT was used to perform the tests and record the voltage and
current values. The cell was placed at constant 23◦C in a Memmert
environmental chamber.
The deterioration predictions produced by the minimum risk models
on the full dataset and with the 2(S)-MM learning algorithm are
shown in Table 3. In this table, we have grouped the LAM degradation
modes into three categories: LAMPE (loss of capacitance of the positive
electrode), LAMGr (loss of capacitance of the graphite component of
the negative electrode), and LAMSi (loss of capacitance of the silicon
component of the negative electrode). The differences between the
lithium inventory estimates are low ( ≈1%) and the same can be said
for the differences in the positive electrode capacity, but the active
graphite estimates are much different. The estimate with weak supervi-
sion detects deterioration of constant magnitude over the entire battery
life, whereas the ordinary estimate indicates that no active graphite is
lost from cycle 700 onwards, showing that weakly supervised learning
techniques can alter the diagnosis that would be obtained by supervised
learning in real problems.4.3. Actual batteries (II)
Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate the application of the ageing model to
four Samsung-SDI INR18650-35E batteries, which are similar to those
used in the previous experiment. Specifically, cells C1 and C2 ( Fig. 4)
underwent normal deterioration over 1700 cycles, while cells C4 and
C5 (Fig. 5) reached their end of life after 400 cycles due to a problem
in the temperature controlled chamber.
Both figures display similar battery deterioration patterns to demon-
strate the variability of the model fits to the data. In the upper left part
of Fig. 4, the positive electrode capacity gradually decreases, and the
proposed model fit (min-min strategy) does not alter the uninformed
model prediction. On the right-hand side, the uninformed algorithm
converges to solutions starting at cycle 800, where the electrode capac-
ity increases, which is physically impossible. The proposed algorithm
corrects this error. The same circumstance occurs in the evolution of the
graphite capacity in cell C1 (left column, middle row) and the silicon
capacity in cell C2 (right column, bottom row). The densities shown in
the figures represent the conditional probabilities of the model response
with respect to reality and are represented by a kernel estimation of
the model output density for each of the cycles for the analysed familyArray 20 (2023) 100321

5. Concluding remarks and future work
The literature on the use of machine learning for non-destructive
diagnosis of battery conditions is extensive, with numerous published
algorithms that extract information from current, voltage, and tem-
perature measurements made under different assumptions. This paper
proposes a new model for the health status of a battery that relies
on both data and physical knowledge. The novelty of this approach
is that both types of information are assumed to be imprecise, and
the model cannot be uniformly fitted to all available data. Fitting the
model to different subsets of the training set produces varying results.
Various methods implicitly select instances and use only discharge
data, while others select voltage and current values within a specific
range of states of charge, disregarding model errors when the batteryArray 20 (2023) 100321
9L. Sánchez et al.
is almost charged or discharged. Nonetheless, we claim that the most
appropriate subset must be chosen depending on the parameter to be
estimated, making it a crucial part of the learning algorithm. Three
different types of solutions have been proposed, which return subsets
where the fit is maximal (optimistic criterion) or where the fit is best
at the worst time instant (pessimistic criteria), and it has been found
that in health diagnosis problems, the optimistic criterion is preferable
since the subset where the fit is best also includes the best information
about the defect.
In future work, we will investigate the extension of the reported
procedure to ohmic and faradaic deteriorations. We will validate our
results with simulations that include several concurrent faults and study
regularisation techniques other than the 𝐿1criterion analysed in this
contribution.

Appendix. Battery degradation mechanisms
Positive electrode and negative electrodes are collectively referred
to as the ‘‘active material’’. The capacity of a battery to store electrical
energy is determined by the amount of lithium ions that can be stored
in these electrodes. When a battery is fully charged, lithium ions
accumulate in the positive electrode, and as the battery discharges,
they move from the positive electrode to the negative electrode. The
charging process reverses the direction of the lithium ions. The state
of health (SoH) of a battery depends on its ability to store and release
lithium ions during the charging and discharging process. A battery’s
end-of-life is typically reached when it can no longer retain a sufficient
fraction of its initial capacity. The battery capacity is determined by
the amount of lithium that can be moved from one electrode to the
other. This amount of lithium is commonly referred to as the ‘‘lithium
inventory’’.
The most common ageing mode associated to battery degradation
is the loss of lithium inventory (LLI), which is related to lithium
consumption by parasitic reactions (e.g., electrolyte decomposition,
solid electrolyte interface growth, etc.) [30]. The second ageing mode
is the loss of active material (LAM), which commonly results from par-
ticle cracking and loss of electrical contact, among other causes [31].
The LAM can be further classified into four types, depending on the
electrode (positive and negative) and the degree of lithiation (predom-
inantly lithiated or delithiated state) [27]. These ageing modes (i.e., LLI
and LAM) can lead to both to capacity and power fade.Table A.4
Degradation mechanisms considered in this study and their influence in the latent
variables.

LAMlGr Gr electrode capacity 𝑧2is reduced, initial lithiation levels
𝑧4,𝑧5of the electrodes are altered
LAMlSi Si electrode capacity 𝑧3is reduced, initial lithiation levels
𝑧4,𝑧5of the electrodes are altered
In batteries with a negative electrode composed of a blended mix
of graphite and silicon, such as those used in this study [28], we
can distinguish six types of loss of active material: loss of capacity
of the delithiated (LAMdPE) or lithiated (LAMlPE) positive electrode
and loss of capacity in the graphite and silicon fractions of the neg-
ative electrode (LAMlGr, LAMdGr, LAMlSi, LAMdSi). In addition to
the deteriorations related to the amount of energy that can be stored
in a cell, there are other effects that limit the power that the cell
can provide [27]. In the ohmic resistance increase the electrodes offer
more resistance to the passage of current, which increases heat losses
and reduces charging efficiency. In the faradaic rate degradation, the
reaction rate between the electrode and the lithium ions is reduced,
which prevents the energy from being extracted from the battery as
quickly as necessary.
In summary, seven types of degradation mechanisms can be consid-
ered, shown in Table A.4 along with their relation with the values of
the latent variables.
There are four types of degradation that influence only one of the
latent variables:
LLI(𝐳(𝑡),𝛼) = (𝑧1(𝑡),𝑧2(𝑡),𝑧3(𝑡),𝑧4(𝑡),𝑧5(𝑡) +𝛼) (44)
LAMdPE( 𝐳(𝑡),𝛼) = (𝑧1(𝑡) −𝛼,𝑧2(𝑡),𝑧3(𝑡),𝑧4(𝑡),𝑧5(𝑡)) (45)
LAMdGr( 𝐳(𝑡),𝛼) = (𝑧1(𝑡),𝑧2(𝑡) −𝛼,𝑧3(𝑡),𝑧4(𝑡),𝑧5(𝑡)) (46)
LAMdSi( 𝐳(𝑡),𝛼) = (𝑧1(𝑡),𝑧2(𝑡),𝑧3(𝑡) −𝛼,𝑧4(𝑡),𝑧5(𝑡)) (47)
and three additional types whose influence on the latent variables
cannot be distinguished from a combination of two of the previous
types (even though their electrochemical causes may be different)
LAMlPE( 𝐳(𝑡),𝛼) = LLI(LAMdPE( 𝐳(𝑡),𝛼),𝛼) (48)
LAMlGr( 𝐳(𝑡),𝛼) = LLI(LAMdGr( 𝐳(𝑡),𝛼),𝛼) (49)
LAMlSi( 𝐳(𝑡),𝛼) = LLI(LAMdSi( 𝐳(𝑡),𝛼),𝛼). (50)
𝛼is the severity of the deterioration, measured in charge units. Given
two vectors of latent variables, determining the severities of the se-
quence of degradations that transforms one value into the other is an
underdetermined numerical optimisation problem.
