The aim of the current work is to compare susceptibility maps of landslides produced using machine learningtechniques i.e. multilayer perception neural nets (MLP), kernel logistic regression (KLR), random forest (RF), andmultivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS); novel ensemble approaches i.e. MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, RF-Bagging and MARS-Bagging in the Kurseong-Himalayan region. For the ensemble models the RF, KLR, MLP andMARS were used as base classiﬁers, and Bagging was used as meta classi ﬁer. Another objective of the current work is to introduce and evaluate the effectiveness of the novel KLR-Bagging and MARS-Bagging ensembles insusceptibility to landslide. Compiling 303 landslide locations to calibrate and test the models, an inventory mapwas created. Eighteen LCFs were chosen using the Relief-F and multi-collinearity tests for mapping the landslidesusceptibility. Applying receiver operating characteristic (ROC), precision, accuracy, incorrectly categorizedproportion, mean-absolute-error (MAE), and root-mean-square-error (RMSE), the LSMs were subsequently veri-ﬁed. The different validation results showed RF-Bagging (AUC training 88.69% &testing 92.28%) with ensemble Meta classiﬁer gives better performance than the MLP, KLR, RF, MARS, MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, and MARS-Bagging based LSMs. RF model showed that the slope, altitude, rainfall, and geomorphology played the most vitalrole in landslide occurrence comparing the other LCFs. These results will help to reduce the losses caused by thelandslides in the Kurseong and in other areas where geo-environmental and geological conditions more or lesssimilar.
1. IntroductionLandslides are more destructive yet frequent natural hazards in theHimalayan region, causing remarkable harm to buildings, property, andthe human lives (Chawla et al., 2018). In India, mountainous regions such as Jammu&Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, the northernportion of West Bengal, Sikkim, and the northeastern states are heavilythreatened by landslides. According to Froude's work (2018), 75%ofglobal semi-seismic landslides from 2004 to 2016 were recorded in sevensouth-east developing countries (they are India, China, Laos, Bangladesh,Myanmar, Philippines, and Indonesia) ( Chauhan et al., 2018;Aristiz/C19abal and S/C19anchez, 2020). It is believed that around 500 lives and aroundRs.300 Corers (approx. US$ 3 billion) worth of properties have beendamaged annually due to landslides ( Koley et al., 2019;Khamkar and Mhaske, 2019). India's most landslide prone areas has found in Hima-layan mountain region (Saha and Saha, 2020a).There is a huge number of techniques and simulations applied forformulating the reduction or mitigation plans for landslide damage(Khamkar and Mhaske, 2019;Liao and Liao, 2020;Saha et al., 2020). Managing the landslide hazard zones (LHZs) needs concerted efforts,while, landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is a prevailing tool andmost useful technique for reducing the effects of landslides ( Pecoraro et al., 2019). Those mappings assist in the visualization and regionalprediction of landslide hazards in a particular province ( Chawla et al., 2018). LSM is predicated on the presumption that future landslideswould occur under similar conditions to those that produced priorlandslides (Pham et al., 2016;Hirota et al., 2019). Only the LSM shows the geographical position of landslide threats in a particular mountainousarea that are generated by their local climate and in ﬂuencing factors (Pham et al., 2016). A number of parameters including location, climaticconditions, landslide types and geo-environment need to be evaluated formonitoring of landslide sensitivity region ( Mahdadi et al., 2018).

Prepa- ration of LSM and selection of landslide conditioning factors using MLmethod can enhance the effectiveness of landslide risk reductionengineering procedure.Wang et al. (2019)applied a insensitive set hy- pothesis to less signiﬁcant landslide factors.Saha et al. (2022)utilized a chi-square-based factor selection technique to screen key factors.Mapping and identifying the high-risk zone of landslide is a scien-tiﬁcally accepted practice that aim to provide the scienti ﬁc basement for planning and enhancement of the area ( Koley et al., 2019;Juliev et al., 2019). Modeling with the simulation of landslide susceptibility haseffectively allowed in the last few years to reduce the damages ( Juliev

15et al., 2019). Researchers have developed many statistical methods tosolve landslide problem (Chawla et al., 2018). Semi-quantitative tech- niques are depended on weighting and rating of the factors for exampleAnalytical hierarchy process, combined landslide Frequency ratio, In-formation value, Weight of evidence, Fuzzy logic approach and weightedlinear combination process (Chen et al., 2016;Mahdadi et al., 2018;Saha and Saha, 2020a). In recent decades, researchers applied machinelearning techniques (MLT) to identify the LHZs in landslide prone regionin all over the world (Sevgenet al., 2019; Saha et al., 2021) including Support vector machine (Meng et al., 2016;Saha and Saha, 2020c), Decision trees (Khosravi et al., 2018;KutlugSahin and Colkesen, 2019); Kernel logistic regression (Chen and Chen, 2021) Random forest (Kor- nejady et al., 2019;Saha et al., 2020), Multivariate adaptive regression splines (Liao and Liao, 2020) and Artiﬁcial neural network (Srivastava et al., 2019;Saha et al., 2020). The MLT have been given better accuracythan previous probabilistic models ( Mahdadi et al., 2018;Saha et al., 2022). In the case of landslide study, different MLT play different accu-racy in different place.LSM is the main purpose of this research for Kurseong area ofDarjeeling Himalaya, applying the MLP, KLR, RF, MARS, MLP-Bagging,KRL-Bagging, RF-Bagging and MARS-Bagging models. Ensemble hybridmachine learning is rare, especially in the Indian Darjeeling Himalayanregion, MLP-Bagging was used in land subsidence susceptibility in Iran(Arabameri et al., 2020); RF-Bagging was applied inﬂood susceptibility modeling in Bangladesh (Talukdar et al., 2020) and KLR-Bagging& MARS-Bagging are novel ensembles and still not used in landslidemodelling. In this research an ensemble was made between bagging metaclassiﬁer and all the used models (MLP, KLR, RF and MARS) for modelinglandslide susceptibility due to exceptional performance of ensembles ofMeta classiﬁer and AI model. For comparing and evaluating the outcomesof these models, receiver operating characteristics (ROCs), precision,accuracy, Kappa coefﬁcient, RMSE, MAE techniques, and seed cell areaindex (SCAI) were employed. In the main purpose of the work was toshow whether the accuracy level of benchmark models i.e.MLP, KLR, RF,and MARS increases or decrease after combining with the hybrid metaclassiﬁer (bagging). Additionally, there is an involvement in checkinghow these models in realistic conditions ﬂuctuate in their predictive effectiveness. A signiﬁcant deluge is observed in the Kurseong range ofDarjeeling Himalayan during the period of the research, where hundredsof large and minor landslides were recorded. The landslides linked to the

/C14C, mean moisture ranges from 68 to 92%, and 323.5 cm is the annual average precipitation(Municipal weather database from 1982 to 2017) of the study area. Theclimate in the region is associated with the CWA (Monsoon-in ﬂuenced subtropical humid climate) group of Koppen. About 85% of the yearlyprecipitation takes place between2nd of June to end of august. The slopeis very steep (40
/C14to 69/C14) and the mean slope for the whole area is 23.76/C14. The region is characterized by the sculptured degraded landscape in itsyoung stage of morphology down-cutting by the stream ﬂows and riverstogether with pre-existing deformities in a geological system includingrocks of Darjeeling gneiss and Daling sequence of Archaean, Gondwanarocks of Permian, Siwalik rocks and Pleistocene elevated terrace (GSI, theyear 2005-06). Nearly 93% of the total area (355.79 km2) is mountainous underneath the Himalayan and 50.43% is covered by intense forest andopen forest. The landslide frequently affects the area of the study anddoes enormous damage to infrastructure and agriculture ( Fig. 2). This area needs immediate deployment of landslide mitigation planning. Forsuch management strategies, landslide susceptibility mapping is impor-tant for identifying the area most prone to landslides.3. Materials and methodsThe study's methodology comprises main six phases: (1) Preliminar-ily, the previous pieces of literature were studied to select some landslideconditioning parameters and collect various data from a different source;(2) The data were obtained through a series of ﬁeld investigation with the help of handheld GPS after the collection of landslide condition

17factors (LCFs); (3)Afterward, these LCFs were tested by the multi-collinearity analysis and relief-F. In the third step, the thematic layersof LCFs were prepared; (4) The benchmark models i.e. MLP, KLR, RF, andMARS simulations were used for the modeling of landslide susceptibility;(5) hybrid MLT (Bagging) was an ensemble with MLP, KLR, RF and MARS(Fig. 2); (6) In the next step the produced models were tested applyingAUC-ROC values, MAE, RMSE, proportion incorrectly classi ﬁed, preci- sion and accuracy validation methods. After validation, the LSMs werejudged with the deluge of September 2020.3.1. Landslide inventory map of KurseongFor any type of landslide modeling, the relationship between LCFsand the distribution of earlier landslides must be assessed ( Chen et al., 2016;Saha et al., 2022). So the inventory map with 303 previouslandslides was used in this study. Via ﬁeld surveys with a global positioning system (GPS) from April 2016 to February, 2020, suchlandslide locations were veriﬁed (Fig. 3). In addition, previous infor- mation on landslides and disaster reports from the National DisasterManagement Authority (NDMA) and the Darjeeling District Of ﬁces were gathered. The inventory map and LCFs were created at a standardscale of 30 m *30 m. After collecting the landslide data 70% oflandslides (212 points) were used to run the models and 30%wereused for testing the methods (equivalent to 91 landslide points). TheGeo-statistical analysis feature of ArcGIS version 10.3 was used toﬁgure out the training and testing sites (Fig: 1C).3.2. Factors selection for LSMs modelingThe choice of LCFs among the various factors used by the differentresearchers is a challenging process since there are no standardizedcriteria.Tien Bui et al. (2019)andSaha and Saha (2020a)used mathe- matical methods to choose the important LCFs. In all areas, the sameenvironmental, geological and hydrological variables are not applicableand cannot be used for mapping all hazards ( Arabameri et al., 2020). To recognize certain geo-environmental factors, Saha et al. (2020)used the Relief F-test. Different analysis techniques can be used for evaluatingparameters such as correlations, relief-f, IGF, probabilistic techniques,and machine learning algorithms. The multi-collinearity (MC) test andrelief-F are being used to identify the LCFs.3.2.1. Testing multi-collinearity (MC) problemThe MC technique is a procedure for assessing the variables. Due tohigher associations between LCFs, the estimation of land susceptibilityarea may be inaccurate (Dang et al., 2020;Saha and Saha, 2020c). MC decides the independence of the LCFs. Pearson coef ﬁcients of correlation, percentages of variances, variance inﬂation factors (VIF) with condi- tional index, and tolerance levels can be utilized to measure the MC(Cama et al., 2016;Sameen et al., 2020). The VIF and tolerance processes were applied to estimate MC in this region. The VIF and TOL (tolerance)threshold values considered to measure the MC are VIF /C205 and tolerance /C210.2 (Bui et al., 2016;Saha et al., 2022).3.2.2. Relief-F methodThe Relief-F technique was used as another factor-selection method.This method synthesizes weights according to factor ability. Assume that‘S’is a randomly chosen sample. Next, the Relief-F weight RWifor thei-th
feature is measured by equation(1). One random point could determinethe two closest neighboring points (one of them being of the same class;another of various classes).RWi←Wiþ/C12/C12S

Experimentalﬁndings have also shown that Relief-F works equivalent to the initialRelief (Wang et al., 2016).3.3. Landslide conditioning factors (LCFs)The different type of landslide (LS) happens due to an imbalance inthe local factor's resistance and mechanisms ( Pisano et al., 2017). In this research, some speciﬁed geo-environmental LCFs were selected forrecognizing LS hazard zone and mapping. The most important selectedfactors for this study are presented below.SRTM DEM of 30*30 m resolution was used for evaluating the LSsusceptibility. It was collected from the USGS ( www.usgs.org). Four LCFs (Fig. 4A; 4 B; 4C; and 4D) were obtained from the DEM, including alti-tude, slope, aspect, and curvature.For the annual precipitation map (Fig. 4E) 35 years (1982–2017) of monthly average rainfall data were arranged from the Indian MetrologicalDepartment (https://mausam.imd.gov.in/imd_latest ). Generally, in landslide vulnerability analysis, rainfall in the mountainous areas isregarded as a signiﬁcant triggering factor for landslide hazards (Lin et al.,2012). The drainage structures are a natural consequence of the long-standing slope, geographical features, landscape, and landform in-teractions. Drainage density was measured by calculating the wholelength of the drainage by the study's total area ( Fig. 4F). Similarly, the lineament density was calculated and classi ﬁed into 5 divisions (Fig. 4G). The highways, developed on a very steep slope, undermine the landprotection above them. The risk of topographical loss increases as theslope of the region increases. This research divides the distance from theroads intoﬁve groups (Fig. 5H). The soil properties are a very powerfulconditioning element for measuring the vulnerability of landslides(Ozioko and Igwe, 2020). In this area of study, four forms of soil, i.e.WOO2 (Loamy skeletal, Typic Udorthents, Loamy skeletal, Typic Dys-trochrepts), WOO4 (Loamy-skeletal, Typic Udorthents, Loamy skeletal,Typic Haplumbbrepts) and WOO6 (Course loamy, Umbria Dystrochrets)were founded, depending on the taxonomy. Two factors related to soilnamely, soil types (Fig. 4I) (Table 5) and soil depth (Fig 4L)were pre- pared. Soil category datasets were obtained from the NBSS &LUP. Aﬁeld study was done to produce the soil depth map (Fig 4L). The presentgeological map (1: 50,000) was resampled to the resolution of 30 m.From the Survey of India research area's geological map was obtained.Gneiss, Slate&Schist, Damuda, Limestone, and Alluvial are thegeological segments found in this study area ( Fig. 4I). The research re- gion's geomorphological map (Fig. 4J) is extracted from Bhuvan (http:// bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in) produced by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organi-zation) and the Ministry of Mines together with 15 collaborator in-stitutions. The studyﬁeld is divided into various moderate and narrowspurs; ridges, deep valleys formed by ‘V', and other degradation features.LS frequency also revealed a connection with seismic activity, faultdip-ﬂow, and mountain slope orientation. The Medvedev –- Sponheuer–Karnik method is the macro-seismic strength measure,popularly known as the MSK scale. It is implemented for an assessment ofthe severity of the Earthquake, focusing on the impact of the incident onthe province. In 2011 to 2018ﬁve earthqueake happed in this region andit trigged 13 landslides and among them Tista lineament seismic wavecaused more damage (Table 1). Using the supervised classiﬁcation method the LULC map was prepared. Eight classes of the LULC werefound. These classes are settlement (7.82%), plantation farming(17.13%), open forest (26.84%),agricultural land (12.83%), fellow land(4.10%), sandbar (2.86%)and water body (4.02%), respectively.The stream power index (SPI) (Fig. 4N), sediment transport index(STI) (Fig. 4O), and the topographic wetness index (TWI) (Fig. 4P) wereregarded as signiﬁcant conditioning factors for the preparation of LSMs(Nsengiyumva et al., 2019). These maps were built from the DEM inArcGIS.A. Saha, S. Saha Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 14 –27

193.4. Machine learning methods3.4.1. Multilayer perception (MLP)Users, commonly used for grouping, are familiar with multi-layerperception (MLP) as ANNs (Haykin, 2009). The training sets are not dependent on the hypothesis of the statistic distribution of the inputvariables, the relative signiﬁcance of those input variables is not deﬁned, and the factors are chosen based on their weights throughout the testprocedure (Gardner and Dorling, 1998). Input, hidden, and output layers constitute and construct the MLP. The geo-environmental LCFs are theinput layers and LS or non-LS are the output layers. The hidden layers areclassiﬁed and helped to transfer data into output. MLP development isdivided into two stages (Tien Bui et al., 2019;Zhou et al., 2018;Pham et al., 2016): 1) The performance values are transmitted from the hiddenlayers and the result values are then incorporated with the precedingvalues for the differentiation and 2) the correlation weight is associatedto produce the best results at the lowest distance. where X¼X

Inour study, to prevent overﬁtting, 1 hidden layer, 500 epochs, and 20validation thresholds obtained by trial-and-error were ﬁtted with an MLP.3.4.2. Kernel logistic regression (KLR)KLR is an efﬁcient and scalable discriminative approach that can havegood class prediction (Sugiyama and Simm, 2010). Mercer kernel sug- gested a traditional logistic regression model built-in high-dimensionalfeature space (Mercer, 1909). Given the labeled training information,need to do the following:D¼fðx

ω:cÞ.3.4.3. Random forest (RF)The RF is an essential machine learning process that produces accu-rate predictions without the curse of dimensionality ( Shahbazi et al., 2017). RF model works on the concept of classiﬁcation trees. RF reliably compares, tests, and deals with inconsistency and imprecision in diversedata sets (Lin et al., 2015). RF models create a range of decision treeswith a mean decrease in the Gini index ( Cutler et al., 2007). At each branching node, RF models take into consideration a random subset ofthe input data and allow the tree to grow without limiting the tree'smaximum size (Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2012). RF begins with the bagging process in which sub-samples of bootstrap are randomly chosento be checked and the unused sub-samples for assessment of ‘Out of Bag’ or OOB are taken into consideration. The utility of each OOB erroradjustment pattern is measuredﬁrst. Stability is considered to be conﬁrmed by the randomized bagging process ( Breiman, 1996). BT A log (N), which includes the number of training samples (training group LSoccurrences), trees, and nodes, respectively, in each division representedby B, T, and A (Chan and Paelinckx, 2008).Chen et al. (2016)identiﬁed the advantages of using ‘OOB’error and assessment process: no over-ﬁtting errors, low bias and variance, a limited association between in-dividual trees, rigorous estimates of error, and excellent predictionperformance.Afanador et al. (2016)also prepared functional algorithmsfor the RF model. In this analysis, RF modeling was conducted using the‘random Forest’package of R studio (Genuer et al., 2010). BTAlogðNÞ (6)3.4.4. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)Friedman and Roosen (1995) were theﬁrst to introduce MARS. In a similar way to least-squares regression, It investigates the connectionbetween both the variables of the study ( Wang et al., 2021). MARS0
beneﬁts include its numerical effectiveness, ability to producesimple-to-understand models, and ability to measure the contribution ofpredictor variables. However, one of the most notable disadvantages is itsinability to forecast accurately (Nguyen et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2021). Toﬁx this issue, bagging was applied to MARS, resulting in MARS-Bag,which increased classiﬁcation accuracy.3.4.5. Ensemble of MLP, KLR, RF, and MARS with BaggingBagging, introduced byBreiman (1996), was assigned to forecast LS sensitivity, one of the appropriate and efﬁcient-ensemble techniques. To direct individual classiﬁers, the Bagging process utilizes bootstrap sam-ples. New subsets of MLP, KLR, RF, and MARStraining data werecollected by randomly sampling the training sets with replacements. Asthe training base-classiﬁer, certain sub-training sets were included. Toincorporate the result of the base classiﬁer, plurality voting was used (Breiman 1996). As the base classiﬁer of the Bagging ensemble meta classiﬁer, MLP, KLR, RF, and MARS MLT was used to compare the resultswith the individual MLP and RF models.3.5. Validation computed processValidation is important if model reliability is to be calculated(Groesser and Schwaninger, 2012;Saha et al., 2020). Two statistical approaches (MAE and RMSE) and three threshold-dependent statistics(area under of ROC curve, proportion incorrectly classi ﬁed, accuracy, and precision) were used to determine the reliability of the models in thisanalysis.3.5.1. Threshold dependent method ROCThe techniques used to assess the zones of susceptibility need to bechecked (Meng et al., 2016). Here more than one validation process wasapplied for judging the prediction capability and it is more acceptable toall for supporting the models. The pieces of literature ensured that theAUC of ROC is a useful method for model validation and comparison(Marjanovi/C19c, 2013;Gayen et al., 2019). The AUC was calculated applying equation(7).AUC¼

On the other side, lowervalues proportion incorrectly classiﬁed suggest greater precision.3.5.2. Statistical techniques MAE&RMSEMAE and RMSE in this analysis were used to test the models. Some ofthe discrepancies between predicted and actual values are called MAE.MAE's square root is expressed by RMSE. For the MAE and RMSE esti-mates, equations(7) and (8) were used:MAE¼

Results of multi-collinearity testThe TOL and VIF indicate that there is no multicollinearity dif ﬁculty amongst LS conditioning variables ( Sameen and Pradhan, 2019;Saha and Saha, 2020c). According to the multi-collinearity test ( Table 2), the lowest TOL is 0.318 for rainfall. Besides that, the maximum TOL for soiltype is 0.914. The lowest and highest VIF values in this research are0.982 and 2.869, respectively (Table 2). It is proved that the chosen eighteen LS conditioning factors in this study ﬁeld are ideal for modeling the LS susceptibility.4.2. Analyzing the Relief-FIt is necessary to select appropriate LCFs for better performance andaccurate project susceptibility. Relief-F (RelF) method is acknowledgedas a proﬁcient attribute selection technique (KutlugSahin and Colkesen, 2019;Saha et al., 2020). RelF was used to calculate the average merit(AM) of different factors. LS affecting factor with positive higher AM ismore important for LS susceptibility modeling. Factors with “0”or negative AM are less important for LS susceptibility modeling. Accordingto AM, all the selected factors have a good capability of inducing thelandslide in the study area (Table 3).4.3. Landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs)The eight LSMs were created considering 70% of total landslidesdatasets using MLP, KLR, RF, MARS, MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, RF-Bagging and MARS bagging models in GIS environment ( Fig. 5). The areal distributions of different models are given in Table 4. According to the outcomes of the models revealed that the areas of very low LS sus-ceptibility class in MLP, KLR, RF, MARS, MLP-Bagging, KRL-bagging, RF-Bagging and MARS-Bagging models are 76.64 sq.km (20.05%), 84.31sq.km (22.05%) 99.70 sq.km (26.08%), 103.54 sq.km (27.08%),99.71sq.km (26.06%), 84.31sq.km (22.05%), 115.12 sq.km (30.11%), and99.94 sq.km (26.14%) and moderate LS suspect susceptibility class are75.74 sq.km (19.81%); 85.91 sq.km (22.47%); 73.91 sq.km (19.33%);79.93 sq.km (18.83%); 66.95sq.km (17.51%); 91.46 sq.km (23.92%);73.91 sq.km (19.33%) and 71.99 sq.km (18.83%) respectively.Comparatively high LS susceptibility zone covers 49.90 sq.km (13.05%)in KLR, 46.87 sq.km (12.26%) in MARS-Bagging; 45.57 (11.92%) in RFand 37.77 sq.km (10.14%) in RF-Bagging respectively ( Fig. 5). According to the landslide susceptibility models developed, the centre and westernsections of the research area are very susceptible to landslides.4.4. Models performance validation with ROC curveIt is critical to evaluate the legitimacy of the models used for zoninglandslide susceptibility since they have no consequences without vali-dation (Arabameri et al., 2020);Saha and Saha, 2020a). The ROC, ac- curacy, precision, proportion incorrectly classify and SCAI index wasused to evaluate the LS susceptible mapping of the Kurseong area.The outputs of the four MLTapplied for landslide susceptibility wereveriﬁed for this study, incorporating data sets collected from the

22ﬁeldwork as indicated above. In addition, the AUC was determined tocompare the effects of models (Fig. 6). Theﬁndings of the ROC curve showed that all the models have great potential for predicting suscepti-bility to landslides. The AUC-ROC values of the MLP, MLP-Bagging, KLR,KLR-Bagging, RF, RF-Bagging, MARS and MARS-Bagging models are84.57%, 90.37%, 83.76%, 88.05%, 88.10%, 92.28% and 84.17% & 88.46%for validation dataset and for training dataset AUC-ROC valuesare 82.95%, 88.75%, 81.98%, 85.53%, 87.89%, 90.85%, and 82.78%, & 86.66% respectively (Table 5). As a consequence, theﬁndings showed that the performance of the MLP, KLR, FR, and MARS models afterensemble with bagging was enhanced by about 2 –3% for mapping landslide susceptibility in the Kurseong-Himalayan range. ( Fig. 6). The RF-Bagging method achieved the highest accuracy followed by MLP-Bagging, RF, and MLP respectively ( Table 5). Contrarily, the RF- Bagging model achieved the lowest proportion of incorrectly classi ﬁed, MAE and RMSE values followed by the MLP-Bagging, RF, and MLPrespectively. In comparison to other models for landslide susceptibilitymodeling with potential confounders, the RF Bagging technique provedto be the highest.4.5. Models performance validation by SCAIAnother method applied for the validation of models is SCAI. TheSCAI validation method was implemented in LS modeling precisioncalculation in some current LS research ( Khari et al., 2019;Saha and Saha, 2020c). Suzen and Doyuran created this process in 2004. In Table 6 the SCAI values of MLP, MLP-Bagging, RF, and RF-Bagging models aregiven. From extremely low to very high class, the SCAI value for a suit-able model increases. So, SCAI values also proved that the MLP-Baggingmodel is better than the MLP model and the RF-Bagging better than theRF model. It also proved that all models have very good capability to mapthe LS susceptibility in this study area.5. Discussion5.1. Comparison of models ’predictive performanceSeveral methods were used for determining risks to the environment.Modeling mechanisms and methodology, however, are diverse and haveprovided speciﬁc outcomes and predictive output. GIS-based geographicforecasts using various methods are essential instruments for environ-mental and spatial-environmental studies which can aid in managingenvironmental problems (Nasiri et al., 2014;Lombardo et al., 2020). Accessibility to the range of solutions has considerably improveddecision-makers willingness to ensure continuity in environmental devel-opment (Liu et al., 2008).Saupe et al. (2012)cautioned that the application of modeling methods would produce quite different outcomes and verydifferent outputs in many other domains or with other applications. For thispurpose, simulation results evaluations are critical for model ef ﬁciency and accuracy assessments (Briand et al., 2000;Stoyanov et al., 2013). The predictive efﬁciency of the models for predicting LS susceptibilitywas compared in this analysis using AUC-ROC, precision, accuracy,proportion incorrectly identiﬁed, MAE, RMSE, and SCAI. The eightmodels (MLP, KLR, RF, MARS, MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, RF-Bagging,and MARS-Bagging) have varying performance. All models showedincredible performance well and the RF-Bagging ensemble model wasproven to be the suitable method for prediction. Pham et al. (2016)also used MLP as a basis classi
ﬁer for the LSM ensemble in the Garhwal Hi-malayan of India.Azhari et al. (2020)used a bagging-based ANN model in the astrophysical area.Salam and Islam (2020)used RF-bagging to calculate evapotranspiration prediction study in Bangladesh. Speci ﬁc dependent variables were used to forecast LS susceptibility involvingtopography (slope, elevation, shape, and curvature), geomorphology(drainage density, SPI, TWI), soil (type and depth), landform, andanthropogenic behavior (LULC, road distance). The main indicator of theLSMs in this analysis is the slope, rainfall, geomorphology, and elevation.Table 4Areal distribution of MLP, KLR, RF, MARS, MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, RF-Bagging and MARS-Bagging model for landslide susceptibility classes.

23Ensemble meta-classiﬁers enhanced a single benchmark model's(MLP, KLR, RF, and MARS) prediction capability. Ensemble MLTs ef ﬁ- ciently boost base classiﬁer performance (Roy and Saha, 2021;Pham et al., 2016;Saha and Saha, 2020c). This whole study provided outstanding performance by bagging the ensemble with RF, KLR, MLP,and MARS relative to the individual models ( Table 5). Bagging ensembles signiﬁcantly reduced both ambiguity and biases most ef ﬁciently relative to other ensembles. The tree-based approach to arti ﬁcial intelligence can effectively address those bias issues ( Silva et al., 2015). More precisely, the study found, despite the complete lack of proper statistical testing forML models may restrict probabilistic testing of the proposition, that theRF-bagging model is in a position to classify the complex or non-linearrelationships between LS and non-LS. Recent studies have proposedthat ML algorithms are more appropriate for LS research than statisticalapproaches (Duro et al., 2012;Saha and Saha, 2020a; Azharietal., 2020; Saha and Saha, 2020c).AUC-ROC values>0.8, in particular, suggest outstanding results aswell. The areal distribution of the four benchmark models (MLP, KLR,RF,&MARS) and four novel hybrid models (MLP-Bagging, KLR-bagging,RF-Bagging, and MARS-Bagging) is not the same ( Fig. 6). For this study weﬁnd that RF-Bagging (testing AUC¼92.28%; training AUC¼90.85%) output is outstanding while the selected benchmark model KLR (AUCtraining¼81.98%; testing¼83.76%), MARS (AUC training¼82.78%; testing¼84.17%), and MLP (AUC training¼82.95%; testing¼84.57%) model's consistency is just quiteﬁne. The other methods of validation(precision, accuracy, MAE, and RMSE) and SCAI give a related perfor-mance. Across all efﬁciency measures, the RF-Bagging had the best andKLR alone the lowest precision (Table 6). Previous research (Dunne et al., 2020;Rahmati et al., 2019) deduced that the LS forecasting of ML modelswould enhance in comparison with traditional methods. After all, resultsmay be different depending on the region where and the variables utilized.5.2.

24that a quantitative evaluation of the correlations between LCFs and LSenable planner and stakeholders to predict the impacts of LCFs. Theconditioning variables which work well in one simulation can thereforebe negligible in other simulations. For this research work, the signi ﬁcant contribution of LCFs in numerous previous studies was assessed using anRF model (Rahmati et al., 2019). Theﬁndings of the RF model revealed that slope had the largest weight and soil depth had the least weight(Table 7). Other high weights were produced by geomorphology,elevation, the density of runoff, rainfall, and road density.6. ConclusionsThe natural hazards damage the infrastructural facilities and humanlives, however, among these LS is more destructive. Benchmark models(i.e. MLP, KLR, RF, and MARS) and novel hybrid ensembles (i.e. MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, RF-Bagging, and MARS-Bagging) models wereapplied in this study to evaluate susceptibility to LS in Kurseong region ofDarjeeling Himalaya. The LS inventory map was partitioned into training(70%) and testing (30%) samples. In this analysis, we implemented fourindividual and four ensemble ML approaches (MLP, KLR, RF, MARS,MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, RF-Bagging, and MARS-Bagging). MLmethods were established based on prior LS cases (303) and the modelswere trained. These techniques achieved quite better precision, althoughthe ensemble ML algorithm MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, RF-Bagging, andMARS-bagging provided much more accurate results. The fallow terrain,the forest plantations, roadside places, higly sloppy area and naturaldenudation mountain regions, are more susceptible to landslides incomparison with the rest of the Kurseong-Himalayan region. Descriptivedata of LS susceptibility maps can also identify places with the highestvulnerability, and sites needing more intense attention and study. Thesusceptibility maps will signiﬁcantly beneﬁtial to the local people and government in managing and reducing the losses caused by thelandslides.Table 6Seed cell area index (SCAI) of different landslide susceptibility maps.
