Foreword
Dear Colleagues,Applied Computing and Informatics (ACI) was established asSaudi Computer Society’s ofﬁcial journal over 13 years ago.Throughout its journey, the journal has seen ups and downs.Nevertheless, it’s still standing as the only ofﬁcial journal of theSaudi Computer Society (SCS). Being so means a great responsi-bility to strive for quality, integrity, publishing ethics anduniversality.Since I accepted the responsibility as EiC of the ACI journaltwo years ago, we have received 292 Manuscripts from 39Countries. With Elsevier as our publisher, and King SaudUniversity as our main support, the Journal is picking up moremomentum and gaining reputation. Reviewers remain an integralpart of processing and publishing articles for ACI. We received the support of 632 reviewers from66 countries to provide us valued comments and suggestions and hence keeping the quality of themanuscripts.Our future challenges include:•Finding sponsoring organizations to support this and other journals to come from the SaudiComputer Society.•Sustaining quality to achieve further desired outcomes such as international and academicindexing.•Encouraging international researchers, editors, advisors, and authors to utilize ACI as a plat-form to propagate innovation and creativity. Incentives such as a best paper award can helpachieve this.With the newly elected Saudi Computer Society (SCS) council members, I have great hopes thatthe only direction for our journal is up.
