Abstract 
Distributed generation (DG) systems are considered an integral part in future distribution power system. The reactive power injections from DG units, are seen as a cost-effective solution for distribution system voltage support, energy saving, and reliability improvement. This paper proposes a coordinating control method of reactive power optimization in distribution power system with distributed wind energy. The reactive capability limits of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) are included in the optimization model. The problem of reactive power output/absorb of adjustable compensating capacitor and wind turbine (WT) is formulated as constrained conditions; differ ential evolution algorithm (DE) integrating depth-first search is developed to effectively obtain optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm is applied to a practical test s
 ystem and results are compared and presented.

Adequate voltage stability margin needs to be obtained through the appropriate scheduling of the reactive power resources 
[1].Asynchronous wind turbines have simple structure and easy interconnection, but need to absorb reactive power from
 system in running state, there is no excitation device and capability of voltage regulation
[2]. Currently, the most common technology used is the 
 doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), which is able to provide reactive power support. A large variety of control strategies can be used in the operation of DFIG The author in [3] has proposed a wind turbine control strategy in which the converters of grid side and rotor side are reserves of each other. In [4], a method to calculate the reactive power limit of system with DFIG considering grid-side converter reactive power limit is proposed, and the DFIG wind farm are used for reactive power compensation. [5] focused on including the reactive power capability of the DFIG turbines directly in the optimization formulation, and proposed a multiobjective reactive power planning strategy for WF and transmission system devices. In this paper, we focus on the reactive power optimi zation of distributed system with distributed wind power, asynchronous wind turbines, adjustable compensating capacitor and DFIG technology is considered, and the reactive power capability of converter also taking into consideration.

2. Mathematic model of wind turbine generator 2.1 Mathematic model of Variable Speed Constant Frequency Wind Turbine Generator The DFIG has two set of windings including rotor winding and stator winding. The stator winding is connected directly to the grid through grid-side converter, GSC. The DC side voltage is controlled by GSC, and the power factor is adjusted according to the demand of grid.  The value is set to positive when rotor and stator generating active power and inductive reactive power into grid. Then the power injected to the system by DFIG can be written as: 
es rPPP                                                                             (1) 
es rQQ Q                                                                         (2) There are two main operating mode for DFIG: Constant power factor and constant voltage. Where 
rQ can be neglected, then we have
esQQ . When the stator side voltage of wind turbine is constant, its reactive power adjustment range is influenced by the thermal limit current of stator winding and rotor winding, and the maximum current of converter. The maximum current of converter is the main impact factor. The rotor 40   Qingfeng Tang et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   7  ( 2014 )  38 â€“ 44 
current range is determined by the converter current range. Let the maximum converter current be maxrI, which is usually 150% of the rated current
[6], then we have:

  the unique characteristics of a controlled current source, it can run in four quadrant. The GSC usually run in unit power factor condition, if 
cP and cQ are active power and reactive power of GSC input from system, then 0cQ , capacity selection of GSC only need to consider the maximum slip-active power of DFIG. According to the wind power system with the maximum slip-active power to design power size of GSC, line loss and breaker loss are taking into consideration. If 
maxcP is the maximum active power of GSC, the reactive power of it emits or absorbs calculate as equation (5)-(6):

3. The reactive power optimization model of power distribution system with distributed wind turbines 
3.1 Mathematical model The objective of reactive power optimization model is to reduce the loss of system, reactive power optimization is defined as the minimization of reactive power losses by controlling a number of control variables:

h is equality constraint, namely power flow equation, gis inequality constraints, including the branch power restriction, the node voltage constraints and upper and lower limits of control variables; 
uand

In this paper, choose the voltage deviation as the termination condition of power flow calculation:

H is constant, H=10-5. Then compute injection current of non-end nodes piecewise according to the level attribute, more details in [7]. Nodal attributes including:

i is node number, ip is nodal active power, iq is nodal reactive power, l is hierarchy number, 
maxl is the maximum hierarchy number, a is node type. 3.3 Solution procedure based on differential evolution algorithm Classic differential evolution involves two stages: initialization and evolution. Initialization generates an initial population
0P. Then 0P evolves to 1P,1P evolves to 2P, â€¦ ,until the termination conditions are fulfilled. While evolving from 
nP to 1nP, the three evolutionary operations, namely, differential mutation, crossover and selection are executed in sequence.

Termination conditions: when lossQ less than the threshold, algorithm terminates. The whole solution procedure is given in Fig.1. The threshold of reactive power loss employ the average reactive power loss of network without WT, and considering the termination condition can not be satisfied, set the maximum number of iterations to avoid endless loop, maximum number is 500. 42   Qingfeng Tang et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   7  ( 2014 )  38 â€“ 44
