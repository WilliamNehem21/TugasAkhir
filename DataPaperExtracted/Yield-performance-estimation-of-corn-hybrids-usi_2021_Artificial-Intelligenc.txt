Keywords:Yield predictionData analysisCorn hybridsMachine learningAgricultural dataEstimation of yield performance for crop products is a topic of interest in agriculture. In breeding programs, wecannot test all possible hybrids created by crossing two parents (inbred and tester) since it would be too timeconsuming and costly. In this paper, we exploit different machine learning algorithms including decision tree,gradient boosting machine, random forest, adaptive boosting, XGBoost and neural network to predict the yieldof corn hybrids using data provided in the 2020 Syngenta Crop Challenge. The participants were asked to predictthe yield of missing hybrids which were not tested before. Our results show that the prediction obtained byXGBoost is more accurate than other models with a root mean square error equal to 0.0524. Therefore, we useXGBoost model to estimate the yield performance for untested combinations of inbreds and testers. Using thisapproach, we identify hybrids with high predicted yield that can be bred to increase corn production.© 2021 The Authors.

1. IntroductionContinuous increase in the world population together with the sub-stantial environmental issues, namely undesirable weather conditionscaused by climate change, have led to a global concern to secure food re-sources such as crops (Godfray et al., 2010). The prediction of crop yield has a direct impact on national and international economies and plays acrucial role in food management all around the world. Therefore, it isvery important to assist farmers and food industries with accuratemodels to predict crop productivity. This will help them to assess theircurrent situation in terms of productivity and ef ﬁciency, and identify possible enhancements such as improving soil quality or choosinghigh-performance crop breeds. Furthermore, managers can utilizesuch prediction models in their decision making process related toagronomy and crop choice policies to minimize losses when undesir-able environmental conditions like drought and pest problems occur(Aubry et al., 1998).Withadvancementsincomputationaltechnologyanddatacollection,an essential need of developing novel models for yield prediction hasemerged. To this end, researchers have presented various yield predic-tionmodelsincludingtraditionalmachinelearningalgorithms,datamin-ing methods and deep neural network models ( Liakos et al., 2018; Chlingaryan et al., 2018;Vlontzos and Pardalos, 2017;Mucherino et al., 2009;Papajorgji et al., 2006). In recent years, deep-learning basedmodels have been widely usedin crop yield prediction. These techniquescan model complex inputs with complicated interactions. You et al. (2017)introduced a deep Gaussian process framework to predict cropyield based on remote sensing data. In this study, relevant featuresfromrawdatawereeffectivelyextractedusinganoveldimensionalityre-duction method.Elavarasan and Vincent (2020)proposed a recurrent neural network deep learning algorithm over the Q-learning reinforce-ment learning algorithm to predict yield. Based on their experiments,this approach can predict yield with an accuracy of 93.7% using environ-mental, soil, water and crop parameters. In another study, a deepconvolutional neural network model was developed to extract key fea-tures from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and RGBdata to predict yield (Nevavuori et al., 2019). Corn hybrids and their performance evaluation have also been atopic of interest in thisﬁeld. During the last few decades corn (alsocalled maize) has become an important product among crops(Burchﬁeld and Schumacher, 2020). Besides the diverse usage of cornin the food industry, it is also used for making animal food, bio-fueland other industrial products (Chavas and Mitchell, 2018). Due to the increasing demand of corn, farmers are seeking new ways to improvetheir productivity. Hybrids are new seeds created by crossing two par-ents together in order to obtain a potentially stronger and more produc-tive seed (Crow, 1998) which might lead to higher corn yield. They areshown to incorporate favorable qualitative traits and be adapted to dif-ferent conditions. An important feature of hybrids is their higher toler-ance to drought compared to natural breeds ( Crow, 1998). Identifying the hybrids with maximum predicted yield has always been a challeng-ing problem in agriculture. Several empirical breeding programs weredeveloped to explore the impact of the breeding on crop yield andArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 82 –89

In these programs, outstanding hybridsfrom inbred lines are selected. Results obtained from breeding programscan provide farmers and managers options to manage crops and pickthe best strategy for planting schedules ( Cooper et al., 2014). In breed- ing programs, hybrid performance is evaluated from extensive yield tri-als that are costly and time consuming ( Lanza et al., 1997). While this process traditionally used to be done only by trial and error, breedersare now exploiting data analysis techniques to predict hybrids yield ac-curately prior toﬁeld evaluation. Therefore, there is a remarkable de-mand for new approaches to predict the performance of hybrids.There are various models in the literature which tackled hybrid per-formance prediction problem. They have utilized different methods de-pending on their objectives and data.Bernardo (1996)proposed to use best linear unbiased prediction model to identify high-yielding single-cross corn hybrids. This method and its extensions were also appliedto other crops such as soybean and wheat ( Panter and Allen, 1995; Arruda et al., 2015). In another study researchers identiﬁed corn hybrids tolerant to drought and heat using an unsupervised approach based on astress metrics obtained from a deep learning model ( Khaki et al., 2019). With recent progress in genome sequencing, phenotypic and DNAmarker characterizations provide helpful information to determine thebest parents with expected traits in different corn uses like food indus-try (Somerville and Somerville, 1999).Riedelsheimer et al. (2012)have shown that they can achieve a reliable accuracy in predicting biomassand bioenergy-related traits in inbred and testers crosses using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and metabolites. They used ridgeregressionâ€“best linear unbiased prediction model to predict poly-genic traits in corn hybrids. In another study, researchers compared per-formance of three models including multi layer perceptron (MLP),support vector machine (SVM) and Bayesian threshold genomic bestlinear unbiased prediction (TGBLUP) models in predicting ordinal traitsin plant breeding (Montesinos-López et al., 2019).Khaki et al. (2020)in- troduced an ensemble of matrix factorization and neural networkmodels to predict corn hybrid performance. Their proposed modeloutperformed deep factorization machines, least absolute shrinkageand selection operator (LASSO), and random forest.In this paper, we aim to utilize machine learning algorithms to pre-dict crop yield for new corn hybrids using the data provided by 2020 Syngenta crop challenge. In this challenge, participants were provided adataset containing the yield for 199,476 combinations of inbred and tes-ters which are grown in 280 different locations within years 2016 to2018. Weﬁrst perform a data processing on the provided dataset todo feature selection. We then apply different algorithms including deci- sion tree(Safavian and Landgrebe, 1991),gradient boosting machine (GBM) (Friedman, 2002),random forest(Svetnik et al., 2003;Breiman, 2001),adaptive boosting(Adaboost) (Freund and Schapire, 1997), extreme gradient boosting(XGBoost) (Chen and Guestrin, 2016)a n d neural network(
Liu et al., 2017;Sze et al., 2017) on the data and evaluate their performance. We select the best model among them and utilize itto predict yield for new combinations.2. Materials & methods2.1. Data source & summaryThis study was performed as a part of the 2020 Syngenta Crop Chal-lenge, which focuses on estimating yield performance of the cross be-tween inbred and tester combinations to identify the best parentcombinations. The participants were given a dataset containing the ob-served yield for 199,476 corn hybrids tested across 280 environmentsbetween 2016 and 2018. These hybrids are created through crossingof 593 unique inbreds and 496 unique testers.Due to conﬁdentiality concerns, the yield values are scaled to an in-ternal benchmark to make the average and standard deviation of yields1.0017 and 0.1047, respectively. These hybrids were tested in 280unique locations. On average in each location 712 hybrids have beentested during the study period. 21% of the observations were collectedin 2016 (with average yield 1.0082 and standard deviation 0.1060),42% in 2017 (with average yield 0.9990 and standard deviation0.0980), and 37% in 2018 (with average yield 1.0003 and standard devi-ation 0.1110).With 593 inbreds and 496 testers, there are 294,128 possible hy-brids, among which only 10,919 (4%) hybrids have been tested. Thismeans around 96% of the hybrids are missing and we need to developa model to predict yield for these missing combinations.The inbreds and testers are clustered based on an internal analysisperformed by the problem owner. Inbreds and testers are not treatedany differently when clustering. Therefore, same cluster number indi-cates genetic similarity regardless of whether a parent is de ﬁned as an inbred or a tester. Therefore, Inbreds and testers with same cluster IDare considered independent. The inbreds and testers were clusteredinto 14 and 13 groups, respectively. 47.8% of the crossing inbred and tes-ter clusters were not tested in this study ( Fig. 1). In the given dataset, 95 unique combinations of inbred and tester clusters are provided for theperformance analysis. These clusters were tested on average 2100times in different locations during three years.2.2. Input variables and outcomeIn the given dataset, each observation consists of six input variablesincluding location, year, inbred, inbred cluster, tester and tester cluster,and an outcome variable. The outcome is de ﬁned as the ratio of the hy- brid yield to the benchmark in that environment.2.3. Analytics workﬂowTo check whether the outcome depends on all the given input vari-ables, we ran a GBM model (with 100 trees and shrinkage rate equal to0.001) on the dataset. This variable selection helps to reduce over ﬁtting. In GBM model, we can calculate relative importance for variables whichindicates how signiﬁcant each variable was in the construction of theboosted decision trees within the model. Variables with zero relativeimportance do not have any impact on the outcome. After removingthe insigniﬁcant variables (the variables with zero relative importance),the mean yield of the observations whose independent variables areidentical was calculated to reduce the variability and avoid having mul-tiple records of the same observations because high variability mightmislead the model in predicting yield and affect the performance. Theﬁnal dataset has 10,919 unique hybrids with mean yield calculated foreach hybrid.Fig. 2shows the conceptual diagram of what we havedone in this study.We randomly picked 80% of the data as the training and the left 20%as the testing set. This splitting has been repeated 5 times using 5 differ-ent seeds to avoid overﬁtting. We ran multiple machine learning modelsincluding Adaboost, decision tree, random forest, neural network,XGBoost and GBM on the training set and evaluated the models usingthe testing set. This procedure was performed on 5 different sets oftraining and testing sets randomly chosen using ﬁve different seeds. After preprocessing the data, we encoded all the data to convert thecategorical variables into numbers to have better understanding by ma-chine learning algorithms. In order toﬁnd the best encoding method, we performed three methods on the data including one hot encoding,integer encoding and feature hashing encoding ( Potdar et al., 2017; Fitkov-Norris et al., 2012;Seger, 2018
). In integer encoding, we convertthe categorical data into integers. Data encoded using one hot encodinghas a binary variable for each category and in feature hashing encoding,F. Babaie Sarijaloo, M. Porta, B. Taslimi et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 82 –89
83Fig. 1.Missing and present hybrids in the provided dataset created through crossing inbred and tester clusters. Missing rate is 47.8%. The goal is to develop a model using the available tested hybrids and estimate the performance of missing inbreds and testers.

84a hash function is applied on the data to map them into small ﬁnite set of values. The encoding methods were assessed using root mean squareerror (RMSE) obtained in the testing phase. Yield performance isunitless based on its deﬁnition. Therefore, RMSE of the models isunitless, as well. Then, we ran the models on the testing data and pickedthe one that gave us the lowest RMSE. In the training phase, parametersfor the models were tuned to minimize RMSE. The ﬁnal model was picked based on the lowest RMSE obtained in the testing phase.The parameters of the models were tuned as follows:•Adaboost (with maximum depth 3, 1000 estimators, learning rate 1and a linear loss function),•decision tree (with minimum number of samples required to split aninternal node equal to 2 and maximum depth is set as default whichmeans nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leavescontain less than 2 samples),•random forest (with 10 estimators and maximum number of variablesin each split equal to total number of variables)•neural network (epoch 50, batch size 32, and a dropout layer has beenaddedtoeveryhiddenlayer[3layersintotal]withadropoutrateof0.5),•XGBoost (with 1000 estimators, maximum depth 5, α=1 0 ,a n ds u b sample ratio of columns when constructing each tree is 0.5) and,•GBM (with 1000 trees and shrinkage rate equal to 0.05)The analyses were performed using Python 3.7.5.3. Results3.1. Variable selectionTo evaluate the effect of given variables on the yield, we utilized aGBM model. The results indicated that the only variables with nonzerorelative importance were inbred, tester and inbred cluster and testercluster. As shown inFig. 3, variable tester has the highest relative impor-tance (63.5) among all of the variables and, variables year and locationhave appeared in the model with zero relative importance. Therefore,we concluded that the environmental effects across the locations duringthe 3-year time period for all the hybrids does not have a signi ﬁcant im- pact on the crop yield. Thus, we removed these two variables from thedataset. Theﬁnal dataset contains 10,919 unique hybrids (with averageyield 0.9960 and standard deviation 0.0586).3.2. Model development and performance analysisFive different experiments were conducted using different seeds totest the models. The data were encoded using three methods. The bestencoding method was one hot encoding by which we obtained the min-imum RMSE among all the models.Fig. 4demonstrates the performance of the models developed using data encoded with three encodingmethods.

85Table 1displays the performance of the machine learning modelswith 5 different seeds. The data fed into these models was encodedusing one-hot encoding method. As shown in Table 1, XGBoost achieved the minimum RMSE in 3 of the experiments and neural network has aslightly better performance in 2 of them. However, on average XGBoostoutperformed the other machine learning models.The RMSE achieved in the testing phase was 0.0561±0.0043 (aver-age ± 95% conﬁdence interval). Among them XGBoost and neural net-work model had the minimum RMSE. According to the results ( Fig. 4), we decided to encode the data using one hot encoding method and pre-dict the yield for the hybrids using the XGBoost model which providedthe lowest RMSE (0.0524) in the testing phase.3.3. Comparing implemented modelsAs observed inFig. 4andTable 1, XGBoost outperformed all the models due to using advanced regularization in loss function. On thecontrary, decision tree algorithm achieved the worst RMSE among thetested models. This poor performance mostly happens because decisiontree models are week learners and prone to over ﬁtting. The best RMSE in each of the models is obtained when the data is encoded using onehot encoding. The performance of XGBoost algorithm with integerencoding is slightly better than feature hash encoding. The same patternholds true for Adaboost and GBM models. Random forest is observed tohave better performance compared to Adaboost and decision tree usingdata encoded by one hot encoding and feature hashing encodingmethods. Neural network model outperformed Adaboost and randomforest in every encoding methods.3.4. Decision making by predicting yield performance of new hybridsWe applied our selected model on 1200 combinations of inbreds andtesters which were not tested before. The predicted yield performancehad an average equal to 0.9963 with standard deviation 0.0212(Fig. 5). Among these combinations, the maximum and minimumyield performance are 1.0610 and 0.8798, respectively. Moreover, weobserved that 38% of the combinations have a predicted yield perfor-mance higher than 1 which means their predicted yield is higher thanthe benchmark in the corresponding environment. Decision makerscan further use these predictions in their breeding programs to obtaina superior level of yield performance. The combinations were groupedby inbred cluster and tester cluster and the average of predicted yieldswas calculated for each hybrid. The heat map of this data is shown inFig. 6.U s i n gt h i sﬁgure, we can identify the combinations with highperformance.3.5. Determining the role of a cluster in a hybridIn the provided data set, there are 14 clusters de ﬁned by the problem owner. In breeding programs, depending on the role of a parent in a hy-brid, whether it is an inbred or a tester, the same yield performancemight not be obtained.Fig. 7is provided to compare the distributionof hybrids yield performance when we use these clusters in two mainroles, inbred and tester. As depicted in Fig. 7,c l u s t e r s1 ,4 ,5 ,7a n d1 0a p - peared to have yield distributions almost the same when these clusterswere used in a hybrid as inbred or tester. On the contrary, we observe

87that the same cluster would produce higher yield when it is the inbredin a hybrid like clusters 2, 3 and 11 compared to the hybrids where wehave these clusters as tester. Clusters 9 and 14 were only used as inbredsin this dataset. This information can give decision makers a rough ideaon how to maximize yield by choosing which clusters to play the roleof inbred and which cluster to be selected as tester in a hybrid.4. DiscussionIn this study, advanced machine learning techniques were applied tocreate a yield estimation model for corn hybrids. Our proposed ap-proach is unique from other previous prediction models in thatencoding step before training the model. Depending on what encodingmethod is applied, the performance of models can be improved. Asshown in the results section, XGBoost model with one-hot encodeddata outperformed the other models.In our study, XGBoost algorithm has the best performance amongthe tested machine learning models due to the following reasons:1) XGBoost can handle sparsity in the input variables more ef ﬁciently compared to other tested models ( Chen and Guestrin, 2016)a n d , 2) due to the regularization used in XGBoost model, this algorithm cancontrol overﬁtting which leads to higher performance ( Nielsen, 2016). This model has been widely used in different ﬁelds such as agriculture, healthcare andﬁnance (Ogunleye and Wang, 2019;Torlay et al., 2017; Nobre and Neves, 2019). In our study XGBoost has shown to have thebest performance compared to other models. Same result was obtainedin several studies.Qin et al. (2018)proposed an XGBoost model to pre-dict corn economic optimal nitrogen rate and this model outperformedridge regression and LASSO in speciﬁc time windows of their study. Inanother study, XGBoost algorithm exhibited higher accuracy comparedto random forest in predicting soybean yield using data acquired by un-named aircraft system (UAS) (Herrero-Huerta et al., 2020).The proposed model can be used by managers or farmers to maxi-mize yield by selecting the best hybrid. This machine learning tool canbe beneﬁcial to the decision makers in two ways. First, since we onlyused 4% of the possible hybrids to develop the model, it will helpthem to lower cost by decreasing the number of hybrid breeding trials.Second, the whole breeding process is not time-consuming anymorebecause there is no need to wait for the results from ﬁeld trials. This in- formation can be obtained from the model in seconds.For the future work, weﬁrstly suggest to deﬁne a new criterion for inbreds and testers clustering. In the current study, inbreds and testerswere merely clustered based on the genetic features. Thus, further re-search could address novel clustering approaches that might be moreinformative for yield prediction. Secondly, to attain a more accurate pre-diction model, we could include new features in the dataset. Crop pro-duction environment consists of numerous factors such as pests,diseases and human activities which can cause substantial variationsin the crop yield. Although we showed that the variables year and loca-tion do not have any signiﬁcant impact on the yield performance, thisconclusion might have been obtained because of the counteraction be-tween some factors which are not provided in the dataset. Therefore, in-cluding further factors to the study could improve the performance ofthe models.5. ConclusionThis paper presents an application of machine learning algorithms inagricultural data analysis. We implemented various methods on thedataset provided in the 2020 Syngenta crop challenge in order to esti-mate the performance of new corn hybrids using available tested hy-brids. The results in the testing phase implied that XGBoost algorithmhas a superior performance among all implemented techniques. Wenext predicted the yield performance of the new combinations of in-breds and testers using our proposed XGBoost model and presented

88the summary of results. The results demonstrated that more than onethird of the new hybrids had indeed a higher yield performance com-pared to the benchmark in the corresponding environment. These hy-brids are identiﬁed as potentially more productive seeds. Therefor, ourproposed approach can be utilized by decision makers in breeding pro-grams to select outstanding hybrids from inbred lines only by using asample of tested hybrids. Using machine learning tools such as themodel developed in this study can lead to higher yield and lower costin agricultural industry.Conﬂict of interest statementThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absenceof any commercial orﬁnancial relationships that could be construed as apotential conﬂict of interest.Data availability statementThe dataset for this study can be found in the 2020 Syngenta cropchallenge website.
