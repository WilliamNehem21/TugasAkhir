1. Introduction Implementation of a general purpose multiplier in an FIR or IIR structure by means of Very Large Scale 
 
Integration (VLSI) technique is becoming a very complicated and costlier task to be performed. This problem may be solved by considering multiplication operation as repeated addition and hence substituting the filter coefficients as sequence of shifts and additions. These multiplier-less filters are less power hungry and require less hardware blocks for its implementation [1-2]. In connection to this, SPT representation of filter coefficients is very much popular where the effect of multiplier is substituted by means of adders and delay elements only [3-8]. Several algorithms have been proposed so far in the literature where each of which deals with the powers-of-two design of FIR filter. These include traditional techniques like mixed integer linear programming [9], polynomial time algorithm [10], discrete semi-infinite linear programming [11], branch & bound technique [12] and so on. Recently, the domain of circuit and system design has been noticeably influenced by means of a variety of intelligent optimization techniques of current interest like Genetic Algorithm (GA) [13], Orthogonal Genetic Algorithm (OGA) [14], and Diffe rential Evolution (DE) [15-16] and so on. In this communication, we have employed Self-organizing Random Immigrants Genetic Algorithm (SORIGA) for the design of multiplier-less low-pass FIR filters. Designed filter has been implemented on real time hardware and the requirement of resulting hardware blocks like digital gates, latches, buffers and so on has been calculated using XILINX Design Suite 12.3 software.   2. Design Strategy 2.1. Theoretical background of multiplier-less FIR filter System function ܪሺݖሻ and the corresponding transfer function ܪሺ݁
௝ఠሻof any causal FIR filter of length ܮwith im pulse response ݄ሺ݇ሻ can simply be written in accordance with the following equations [1-2]: ܪሺݖሻൌσ݄ሺ݇ሻݖ

The parameter ܾ ௠௞ does not put any overheads as far as the computational or hardware complexity is concerned since, for every ݇ and ݉ ,it keeps the term ʹ
ି௠Ǥݔሺ݊െ݇ሻ intact or make it zero depending upon its assignment over the binary space. The term ʹ
ି௠, when multiplied with ݔሺ݊െ݇ሻ, causes the multiplier to get shifted right by ݉ bits. For an input word length of ܹ ,allowable maximum word length of the product ʹ
ି௠Ǥݔሺ݊െ݇ሻ thus becomes ሺܹ ൅οሻ. As a matter of fact, resulting complexity from the architecture of full-adder is proportionately related toሺܹ ൅οሻ in accordance with equation (5). 2.2. Design of powers-of-two FIR filter using SORIGA SORIGA [17-18] has been judiciously employed in this work for the synthesis of FIR tap coefficients which are encoded in the form of sum of signed powers-of-two. In connection to this, any arbitrary coefficient ݄ሺ݇ሻmay be represented by means of a binary row vector as shown below: ݄ሺ݇ሻൌൣ ܾ
଴ǡ௞ܾଵǡ௞ܾଶǡ௞ܾଷǡ௞ܾସǡ௞ǥǤǤܾሺοିଵሻǡ௞൧݇׊ൌͲǡͳǡʹǡǥǤǤǡܮെͳ                                                    (6) In order to synthesize linear phase low-pass FIR filter, tap coefficients are chosen to be symmetric around its central coefficient. Proposed scheme has accumulated all such ܮہʹΤۂ 
different binary vectors into a single row vector of length ࣦൌܮہʹΤۂǤο 
which has been regarded as a single chromosome ࣜ in the process of evol utionary computation. Being a population-based algorithm, our design strategy generates Զ such chrom
 osomes randomly of length ࣦ which form the pool of potential solution. Based upon the fitness of indivi
dual chromosome, subsequent genetic operations like selection, cross-over and mutation are carried out subsequently in accordance with the steps of SORIGA. This has been symbolically outlined as follows: ࣜ

஼ and Զெidentify the total number of chromosomes allowed to take part in the operation of cross-over and mutation respectively.  Selection of competent chromosomes from the pool of Զ such members is executed on the basis of their indivi
 dual fitness which is considered to be the degree of proximity with the ideal response. Proposed algorithm calculates this fitness as an inverse of the maximum difference between the designed and ideal frequency response of the low-pass filter and makes an attempt to minimize this difference to a significant extent. In this connection, maximum difference over the entire frequency band of interest has been regarded as the cost function of the individual chromosome. 3. Results and Analysis This section demonstrates the outcome of the proposed algorithm analytically. Since the design incorporates evolutionary algorithm, convergence characteristics of our proposition has been depicted in Fig. 1 below which exhibits the variation of averaged cost function with the number of iterations for three different values of cross-over probability. Size of population has been considered as 100 in the entire analysis.  54   Abhijit Chandra et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   9  ( 2014 )  51 – 56

In order to establish the supremacy of the proposed design, frequency response of SORIGA-optimized multiplier-less low-pass FIR filter of order 35 has been compared with few such state-of-the-art filters in Fig. 2 below.                                                
 
Fig. 2: Comparison in terms of frequency response amongst various multiplier-less low-pass FIR filters 
It can be well apprehended from the above comparison that the proposed filter yields more attenuation in transition and stop-band region of frequency characteristics.  As for example, at a frequency of 0.65 rad/pi, SORIGA-optimized filter produces an attenuation of about 193.9 dB while the filters designed in [6], [7], [8] and [15] yields approximately 151.6 dB, 180.3 dB, 157.1 dB and 120.6 dB attenuation respectively. Subsequent part of this section elaborately describes the requirement of different hardware blocks used to realize the powers-of-two filter on an FPGA chip. Quite a few recent algorithms, nurturing the concept of multiplier-less FIR filter design, have also been considered into our analysis and the resulting hardware elements have been listed in Table 1 below. Since the filters designed by means of different algorithms are of

different length; required number of hardware blocks per unit length of the filter has also been included for fair comparison. Word length of input signal ha s been taken as 8 in the entire analysis.

 It can be unambiguously observed from Table 1 that the proposed architecture outperforms most of the state-of-the
-art multiplier-less FIR filters by a large margin in terms of the hardware blocks. However, performance of the proposed SORIGA-optimized filter is slightly inferior to that of [7] in terms of 2-input AND, flip-flop and I/O buffer counts. Architecture of the proposed filter as obtained using XILINX Design Suite 12.3 has been depicted in Fig. 3 below.

4. Conclusion This article deals with design of a multiplier-less low-pass FIR filter has been carried out by means of a recently proposed evolutionary optimization algorithm, called Self-organizing Random Immigrants Genetic Algorithm (SORIGA). Effectiveness of the optimization technique has been evaluated in terms of its convergence speed. Moreover, the supremacy of the proposed design has been established in terms of frequency response of the filter. Furthermore, tap coefficients of the designed filter have been encoded as sums of powers-of-two and implemented on a real ti me hardware chip using XILINX Design Suite 12.3. It

has been observed that the proposed architecture is superior to other existing design methodologies as far as hardware complexity of the design is concerned. Pe rformance of the solution may further be improved by proper modification of the fitness function of the optimization process as a future scope of this work.   References [1] Mitra S. K.
