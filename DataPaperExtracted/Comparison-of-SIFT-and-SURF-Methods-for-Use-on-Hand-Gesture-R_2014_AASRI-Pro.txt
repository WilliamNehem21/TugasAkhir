Abstract 
In this paper a comparison between two popular feature extraction methods is presented. Scale -invariant feature transform (o r SIFT) is the first method. The Speeded up robust features (or SURF) is presented as second. These two methods are tested on set of depth maps. Ten defined gestures of left hand are in these depth maps. The Microsoft Kinect camera is used for capturing the images [1]. The Support vector machine (or SVM) is used as classification method. The results are accu
racy of SVM prediction on selected images.

1. Introduction Gesture recognition is one of the directions in the non verbal machine -human communication. Non verbal co
 mmunication can be useful in many life situations (e.i. in situations where human can’t use speech). Several m
 ethods were publicized on topic of gesture recognition [ 2][3][4]. Many of them focus on feature extraction f
 rom color image of hand and classification as next s tep. For this, it is important to get the most accurate

feature vectors. The most common used local visual descriptors are SIFT and SURF  [5]. The theory about th ese descriptors as well as experiment description is pr esented in first chapter of this paper. The results of this experiment are shown next and conclusion at last.  2. Feature extraction and classification methods  In this experiment the database of depth images is created
 . SIFT and SURF are applied on images of this database. Resulted feature vectors are divided in to train set and test set. For creation of SVM model the train set is u
sed in process called training. Next the test set is used for prediction. Results are prediction accuracies of all tested images for SIFT and SURF. 2.1. SIFT algorithm Scale invariant feature transform is one of the mostly  used
  local visual descriptors. The method works in two steps. Detection of feature point as the first step. F eature description as the second step. At the beginning of procedure the computing of gradient magnitudes and orientations of pixels are computed. This is done in neighborhood of key point by using the scale of the point. This will make choice on what Gaussian kernel will be used for blur the image. Feature vector is combination computed from the orientation of histograms within the sub-regions around the feature point. The feature vector is normalized at least. For more information about SIFT
 see [6]. 2.2. SURF algorithm Speeded up robust features descriptor detects featur e poin
 ts by using determinant of the Hessian matrix H(X, σ) which is defined as follows 
,,,,, xxxyyxyyLX LXHXLX LXVVVVVªº «»¬¼                                                                                            (1)  Where L is the convolution of the Gaussian secon
 d order derivation of image at point X(x,y) in scale σ and si milarly for L
xy and L yy. For the classification the maxim and minim of the function the discriminant value is used. The description starts by constructing the wi ndow around detected feature point. Orientation of the window is same as reproducible orientation. From pixel in  this region the resulted feature vector is calculated. For more information about SURF see [7]. 2.3. SVM Support vector machine as part of the model based clas
 sifiers uses model for prediction. This model is created in procedure called training. Model represents each class as pattern in vector space. Each feature vector is represented as point in feature space. In Fig. 1 only two dimensions are shown for simplicity. Class A is represented as pattern of gray dots in fig and class B as green dots.   21  Peter Sykora et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   9  ( 2014 )  19 – 24 
 
Fig.1. Calculation of best separation. 
Separation line is searched in training process. Th e wider gap between two closes point to line the better train process. It is seen on fig that line p
2 represents better train process as line p 1 because the gap of line p 2 the v
2 is bigger as gap v 1 of line p 1. If two patterns can’t be linearly separated, the kernel method is used. This will transform vector in to higher dimension space in which they are separable. This process will allow classification of multiple classes [mata6]. In this experiment the RBF kernel method is used. For more information about SVM see [8]. 3. Experimental results Used input database of depth images and experimental re s
 ults are described in this chapter. Programming environment Matlab was used to execute this experiment.  3.1. Image database Capturing the color image of hand, its followed segmen tati
 on can take significant calculation time as well as processing power. Some methods for segmentation aim for color of skin, as  to detect the region of hand. Res
 ults of such process can vary by the light condition or color tone of a particular person. Microsoft Kinect camera has the advantage that it uses infrared spectrum of light. As such it is invariant to light conditions and color of skin. Kinect system can track parts of detected human body.   22   Peter Sykora et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   9  ( 2014 )  19 – 24 
 
Fig.2. Representation of gestures from cass 1 to 5 (first row) and from 6 to 10 (second row).  
Tracked body (or Sceleton) has as its part left and right hand. By locating left hand in the image, the region of hand can be created. This region is defined as 150x150 pixels square centered on the position of hand. This acts as simple position segmentation. The resulted depth image (of resolution 150x150 pixels) go throe threshold filter. Here all pixels with value lover than threshold are set to zero. With this procedure 1500 pictures are captured. There are 150 pictures for 10 classes (see Fig. 2). For the SVM method the database is div
 ided in to 100 pictures per class for train set and 50 pictures per class for test set. This gives overall 1000 train
 pictures and 500 test pictures.  3.2. Experimental results Table 1 contains performance matrix for descriptor SIFT
  and Table 2 contains data for descriptor SURF. Each field in this matrix contains the sum of pictures of class represented by its column number, to be recognized as class represented by row number. For example, in Table 1 for row 8, that is for input images of class 8, t
 wo pictures were wrong recognized as 
pictures of class 1 and forty-eight pictures were recognized as pictures of class 8.

From results it is clear that the invariance to rotation of SIFT descriptor is a disadvantage here. Some hand gestures, mainly 1 and 5, wave similar shape and occurs as one , only in different orientation. For human mind it is clear 
 that gesture represented by class 1 has different interpretation tha t of class 5. Another major error occu
 rs for class 7 and 2. On both pictures the shape of hand is not the same but it is very similar shape.  For SURF (table 2) the results are similar to the SIFT method. The error occurs in classes with too similar sh
 ape, such as pictures of class 2 and class 7. Another error occurs for classes with the same shape but with rotation as pictures of class 4 and class 10.  Overall accuracy for SIFT is 81.2% and for SUR
 F it is 82.8%. It is clear, that accuracy can be better if non- invariant to rotation feature extraction method was used.

4. Conclusion In this paper the comparison between two feature ex tract
 ion methods was presented. SIFT as the first method and SURF method as second. They were applied on set of depth map images  of left hand gestures. T
 here were 10 gestures. For capturing these images the Microsoft Kinect camera was used. For image classification the Support vector machine was used. The experimental results are prediction accuracies of SVM method on test set images for each descri ptor. From the obtained experimental results is evident that b
 est result using SURF method with accuracy of 82.8% was achieved. Two images capturing the same hand sh
 ape, but with different orientation can be interpreted as two gestures. These methods, SIFT and SURF are invariant to orientation and thus they are not su ited for recognition system of such gestures. Comparison of others visual descriptors is ess
ential for finding the best candidate for our real -time gesture recog nition system [Sykora2013]. In future work we plan to test these methods on larger test database and m
odified feature extraction methods (SIFT, SURF) so they will be non -invariant to orientation. Acknowledgment This contribution is the result of the project impl e
