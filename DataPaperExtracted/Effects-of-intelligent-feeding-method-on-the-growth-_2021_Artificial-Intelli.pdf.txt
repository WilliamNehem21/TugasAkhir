Keywords:Intelligent feeding methodFish welfareGrowthImmunityStressThe feeding method is of great signiﬁcance for aquaculture production and cost. In recent years, research on in- telligent feeding, a method based onﬁsh appetite, has been trending. Few studies, however, have focused on ﬁsh welfare issues that can result from intelligent feeding. In this study, an adaptive feeder based on a practical intel-ligent feeding method was designed to evaluate whether this intelligent feeding method would impair ﬁsh wel- fare compared to traditional automatic feeding. The results indicated that the amount of residual feed and sizeinhomogeneity in the traditional group was signi ﬁcantly higher than that in the intelligent group. The results of the growth indicator showed that the weight gain rate (WGR) in the intelligent feeding group was signi ﬁcantly higher (30.17%) than in the traditional feeding group. Although no signi ﬁcant differences were observed in the survival rate (SR), the condition factor (CF) and the hepatosomatic index (HSI), the speci ﬁc growth rate (SGR) in the intelligent feeding group was signi ﬁcantly increased by 8.33% while the feed conversion rate (FCR) was re- duced by a remarkable 17.07% compared to the traditional feeding group. Moreover, intelligent feeding signi ﬁ- cantly improved the pepsin activity of the bass. In terms of immunity and antioxidant capacity, however, theﬁsh in the intelligent feeding group had a signi ﬁcantly lower lysozyme (LZM) level than those fed with the tra- ditional method. For superoxide dismutase (SOD), the intelligent group also displayed a lower activity value, al-though it was not signiﬁcant. The intelligent feeding group had 0.14 nmol/mg protein higher malondialdehyde(MDA) activity than the traditional group. Regarding stress, although no statistical signi ﬁcance was observed, the cortisol level in the intelligent group was 1.9 ng/ml higher than in the traditional group. Together, thesedata suggested that the intelligent feeding method can signi ﬁcantly improveﬁsh growth but may also result in stress and suppress innate immunity.© 2021 The Authors.

1. IntroductionFeed management is a non-trivial aspect of ﬁsh aquaculture. The feeding method, to a great extent, determines ﬁsh production (Føre et al., 2011;López-Olmeda et al., 2012;Zhao et al., 2019). Feeding ac- cording toﬁsh requirements is effective and as such is becoming in-creasingly accepted in aquaculture ( Zhou et al., 2018b). Until now, many studies have attempted to establish the endpoint of feedingbased onﬁsh appetite (Zhou et al., 2018b;Li et al., 2020). For example, underwater acoustic technology has long been applied to determine thefeeding endpoint of salmon in sea cages by detecting the residual feeds(Juell, 1991;Juell et al., 1993). Similarly,Atoum et al. (2015)alsoestablished models to determine the feeding endpoint by detectingthe residual feeds using different cameras. Residual feed detection-based feeding depends heavily on high-quality detection instrumentsand the breeding environment. In view of this, novel intelligent feedingmethods that characterize the variation of dissolved oxygen (DO) andtemperature in the water during feeding have been developed ( Wu et al., 2015;Zhao et al., 2019). Although this kind of feeding revealedbetter performance compared to traditional feeding, it does not applyto increasingly industrialized aquaculture (such as recirculating aqua-culture systems (RAS)) to a great extent as the DO and temperatureare stably maintained in this setting.In contrast to the methods above,ﬁsh appetite quantiﬁcation in real production using the characteristics ofﬁsh feeding behavior is more fea- sible. With the rapid development of artiﬁcial intelligence and technol- ogy, feeding according toﬁsh feeding behavior has been a trending areaof research in aquaculture (Sun et al., 2016;Zhou et al., 2017).Chang et al. (2005)constructed a feedback control system, which couldArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 118 –124

(2017, 2018a)measured the de- gree ofﬁsh feeding activity by analyzing the aggregation anddispersion ofﬁsh schools.Liu et al. (2014)quantiﬁed the feeding inten- sity of Atlantic salmon in RAS using inter-frame differential characteris-tics caused byﬁsh feeding behaviors. Similarly,Ye et al. (2016) developed a novel method to assess the feeding activity of tilapia inRAS based on the Lucas-Kanade optical ﬂow algorithm and entropy. Zhou et al. (2019)also graded the feeding activity of tilapia in RASusing a customized convolutional neural network (CNN). The abovemethods depend heavily on the water turbidity and light environment,where the clearer the foreground (location of the ﬁsh school), the better the performance, however, these conditions are dif ﬁcult to achieve in practical production.Zhao et al. (2017)established a model based on the motion characteristics of the reﬂective areas caused byﬁsh feeding behaviors to assess appetite. This method, to a great level, can avoid theabove limitations.The intelligent feeding methods above could improve productionand reduce costs to a large extent ( Zhou et al., 2018a), however, whether these intelligent methods are bene ﬁcial toﬁsh welfare in aqua- culture remains little unknown. Therefore, to understand the effects ofthe intelligent feeding method onﬁsh growth more comprehensively,an adaptive feeder based on a practical and typical intelligent feedingmethod (Zhao et al., 2017) was designed. Fish welfare was evaluatedby measuring the corresponding growth and biochemical and immuneindexes throughout a 47-day production experiment.In this study,Micropterus salmoides,o n eo ft h eﬁve domesticﬁsh in China, was used as the experimental objects as its indispensable statusin the Chinese freshwater aquaculture system. Besides, in view of thetrend of industrial RAS in aquaculture, our study was implemented inthe environment of the industrial RAS.2. Materials and methods2.1. Fish samplesAllMicropterus salmoideswere purchased from theﬁsh hatchery of Suzhou (Jiangsu, China). Before the experiment, the ﬁsh were accli- mated in a laboratory RAS and fed a commercial diet (protein: 42%,lipid: 8%, ash: 13%) daily for 14 days (Zhao et al., 2017). During acclima- tion, theﬁsh were fed 3 times a day (08:30, 16:00, 19:30), and the totalamount of feed did not exceed 5% of the bodyweight per day. After that,384ﬁsh (32 ± 5 g) of a similar size were chosen and randomly andevenly distributed to six cylindrical culture ponds (two groups, eachin triplicate).2.2. Experimental system2.2.1. RAS structureThe experimental system consisted of two independent RAS, whereeach RAS contained three culture ponds (diameter: 1 m, water depth:0.5 m) coupled with a bioﬁ
lter, solid removal, feeder, oxygen supply,light emitting diode (LED), and ultraviolet lamp (UV). The water usedin this experiment was ammonia removal tap water with aeration for>24 h and UV sterilization. The circulating water volume of each pondwas 300 L/h, and the daily water exchange volume was 15% of thetotal. The full spectrum energy-saving lighting lamp was used to simu-late the light period (08:00–20:00 light, 20:00–08:00 dark) during the experiment. The temperature was maintained at 25 ± 0.5 °C, dissolvedoxygen≥5.5 mg/L, pH at 7.2 ± 0.5, nitrate≤0.5 mg/L, and ammonia ni- trogen≤0.8 mg/L for the entirety of the acclimation period andexperiment.2.2.2. FeederFig. 1(a) shows the feeder, which includes the walking system,weight sensor and feeder. The camera used for monitoring the ﬁsh ac- tivity was installed at the bottom of the feeder, facing down the watersurface (1.3 m above the water surface). For the intelligent group, feed-ing was performed using the adaptive feeder, which was controlled bythe adaptive feeding algorithm (see adaptive feeding algorithm belowfor details). For the traditional group, the ﬁsh were fed quantitively (see experimental design and sampling for details). The total feedingamount (TFA) at each time point was divided into 3 parts on average,and then theﬁsh were fed at intervals of approximately 30 s.2.3. Adaptive feeding algorithmThe adaptive feeding system is outlined in Fig. 2. The feeding system proposed in this paper can adjust the feeding amount according to ﬁsh appetite. The appetite of juvenileMicropterus salmoideswas assessed using a modiﬁed kinetic energy model (Zhao et al., 2017). During the feeding (at intervals of approximately 30 s), the appetite assessment(E
k) at each feeding point was compared with a kinetic energy thresholdT
h(set to 140 in this study), which was determined by K-means cluster- ing. The feeding continued untilE
kwas smaller thanT h, and the feeding

WhenX(i) decreased to a certain extent (set to 3% TFA), the min-imum feed amount (i.e., 3% TFA) was implemented.2.4. Experimental design and samplingThe two treatment groups in this experiment were the same exceptfor the feeding method. Theﬁsh were fed 3 times a day (08:30, 16:00,19:30) with the same commercial feed during the experiment andweighed every 15 days. The feeding amount in the traditional groupwas adjusted according to the weight change of the ﬁsh. The uneaten feed remaining on the water surface was collected and weighted15 min after feeding of each group separately to prevent the residualfeed produced in the experiment from contaminating the water.At the end of the experiment, allﬁsh were deprived of food for 24 h.Theﬁsh were then anesthetized (in the whole pond) deeply withMS-222 (120 mg/L) followed by weighing, grading, and sampling. Theﬁsh were divided into 3 levels according to the thickness of the backusing grading sieves with a gap width of 1.2 cm and 1.7 cm, and thenumber ofﬁsh in each level was counted. Theﬁveﬁsh from each level were randomly sampled and stored at−20 °C for whole-body proxi- mate composition analysis (allﬁsh at this level would be sampled iftheﬁsh less than 5). The length and weight were measured from anadditionalﬁveﬁsh randomly selected from each level. In addition, thelivers were also removed and individually weighed to determine thehepatosomatic index. Then, a blood sample was immediately collectedfor centrifugation to separate the serum, and serum samples were fro-zen and stored at−40 °C for subsequent analysis. In addition to theblood samples, livers were also sampled. After the rinse in normal salinesolution, the sampled livers were then stored at −40 °C for the analysis of antioxidant enzyme activities and immune-related parameters (ana-lyzed by Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).2.5. Growth performance evaluationThe long-term growth performance of the feeding methods wasassessed using theﬁsh survival rate (SR), the weight gain rate (WGR),theﬁsh speciﬁc growth rate (SGR), the feed conversion rate (FCR), thecondition factor (CF), and the hepatosomatic index (HSI). These param-eters are deﬁned in Eqs.(2)–(7), respectively.SR¼N2

1203. Results and discussion3.1. Growth performance3.1.1. Daily feed intake and size homogeneityIn order to explore the relationship between feed intake and resi-dues in different feeding methods, the daily feed intakes, and residuesof theMicropterus salmoideswere recorded and shown inFig. 3.D u r i n g the experiment, the total feeding amount in the intelligent group was11,077 g, and the feed residue accounted for 0.39%. Whereas in the tra-ditional group, the total feeding amount and the feed residue proportionwere 11,700 g, and 8.84%, respectively. Although no signi ﬁcant differ- ence was observed in the total feed amount of the two groups, theamount of residual feed in the traditional group was signi ﬁcantly higher than that in the intelligent group, which indicated that the intelligentfeeding method could better meet the food requirement of juvenileMicropterus salmoidesand might be more conducive toﬁsh growth. In real production, the homogeneity ofﬁsh size is being emphasized due to its indispensable role in quality and yield to aquatic products. Inorder to study the inﬂuence of different feeding methods on size homo-geneity, theﬁsh in theﬁsh in the two groups were graded into threelevels (level 1: smaller than 1.2 cm; level 2: between 1.2 cm and 1.7cm; level 3: bigger than 1.7 cm) according to their body thickness atthe end of the experiment.Fig. 4shows the grading result of theﬁsh, where the horizontal axis is the value of the grading level, and thevertical axis denotes the number ofﬁsh. It can be seen fromFig. 4 (a) and (b) thatﬁsh in the intelligent group have a better size homoge-neity compared to the traditional group. In other words, the intelligentfeeding method can weaken the size differentiation of ﬁsh in aquacul- ture to some extent.3.1.2. Growth indicatorTo evaluate the performance of the intelligent feeding and tradi-tional feeding methods, theﬁsh growth parameters (SR, WGR, FCR,HIS, CF, and SGR) were measured and illustrated in Table 1. Generally, the feeding method had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence (p> 0.05) on SR, HIS, and CF, however, signiﬁcant differences (p< 0.05) were observed in0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 455060708090100

121WGR, SGR, and FCR. Speciﬁcally, WGR in the intelligent group was30.17% higher than in the traditional group. In addition, the intelligentfeeding group displayed an FCR decrease of 17.07% compared to the tra-ditional group.As shown above,ﬁsh fed with the adaptive feeder showed a higherWGR and SGR. The higher FCR in the traditional group may be due to in-sufﬁcient feeding, which would decrease the proportion of food energyused for growth. In addition, food wastage during a lower appetite pe-riod could also increase FCR (Juell et al., 1993). In other words, the lower FCR of the intelligent group indicates that the intelligent feedingmethod can effectively reduce the cost of feed and improve feed ef ﬁ- ciency. Therefore, the intelligent feeding method showed bene ﬁts, such that allﬁsh growth parameters (especially the FCR) in the intelli-gent group were improved to a certain extent compared to the tradi-tional group.3.1.3. Digestive enzyme activityFish digestive enzyme activity is closely related to ﬁsh growth (Guerrera et al., 2015;Nofouzi et al., 2019;Thongprajukaew et al., 2011). No signiﬁcant difference in amylase and lipase activity was ob-served between the two feeding methods ( Table 2). Pepsin activity in the intelligent feeding group was signiﬁcantly higher than the tradi- tional group. These results indicate that ﬁsh fed with the intelligent feeding method had better protein digestion. This feature is critical tothe digestion and absorption of protein in the feed and promotes therapid growth ofﬁsh.3.2. Biochemical and immunological indicatorsFor a comprehensive evaluation of feeding methods in aquaculture,ﬁsh welfare must also be assessed (Santurtun et al., 2018). Previous studies have demonstrated biochemical parameters and immunologicalindicators are closely related to the health and welfare of ﬁsh (Sankian et al., 2018;Shi et al., 2019;Yildiz and Altunay, 2011). To evaluate the effects of different feeding methods onﬁsh welfare, both the biochem- ical and immunological indicators were measured here ( Table 3). Al- though no signiﬁcant differences in the cortisol level or superoxidedismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) activities were detectedbetween the two groups (p> 0.05), the cortisol level and MDA activityin the intelligent group increased by 9.45% and 19.44%, respectively, andthe SOD activity declined by 6.25%. The traditional group had a signi ﬁ- cantly higher level of lysozyme (LZM) compared to the intelligentgroup (p< 0.05).Cortisol, extracted from the adrenal cortex, is an adrenocortical hor-mone that plays a key role in carbohydrate metabolism and is usuallyused to assess theﬁsh stress response (Brijs et al., 2018
;Ellis et al., 2012;Fevolden et al., 1994;Hoseini et al., 2020;Santurtun et al., 2018). A short-term increase in the cortisol level can promote thebreakdown of body proteins while accelerating sugar synthesis and fatoxidation and enhancing non-speciﬁc immunity (Demers and Bayne, 1997), however, if the cortisol level remains high, it will result in re-duced fat synthesis, bodyweight loss, growth stagnation and innate im-munosuppression (Demers and Bayne, 1997;Gregory and Wood,1999). Previous studies suggested that frequent feeding stimulationwould cause continuous excitement and alertness of the ﬁsh, which would increase the cortisol level and affect normal growth and ﬁsh wel- fare (Huntingford et al., 2012). In the current aquaculture, most breed-ing objects, especially theMicropterus salmoides, tend to eat non- stationary feed. Thus, many feeding methods, including intelligent feed-ing, are based on the feeding strategy of repeated feeding in an event.This feeding strategy can not only make feed loss easy to be observedand determine when to stop feeding, but also leave enough time forthe intelligent feeding algorithm to calculate. Few studies, however,have focused onﬁsh welfare that can result from intelligent feeding.In this study, the intelligent feeding method stimulates the ﬁsh many times during feeding, which may increase the cortisol level. Further-more, the feeding strategy (continuous feeding of a low amount pertime) in the intelligent group may lead to individuals with a higher so-cial hierarchy occupying the feeding area and prevent others from ap-proaching this area. Theﬁsh in a lower social hierarchy may then becontinually excited and alert, which would increase the cortisol levelin the intelligent group. Although the cortisol level may gradually returnto normal when the feeding isﬁnished, the cortisol in the intelligentgroup would eventually accumulate and be higher than compared tothe traditional group. In this study, the lack of a signi ﬁcant difference in the cortisol level may be due to the relatively short breeding time.Nonetheless, the cortisol level is still an effective parameter that re ﬂects ﬁsh welfare.Lysozyme, an alkaline enzyme that can hydrolyze mucopolysaccha-rides of pathogenic bacteria, has anti-inﬂammatory, antibacterial and antiviral effects on the body (Rauta et al., 2012). In the intelligent group, multiple feeding stimulations resulted in depressed lysozymelevels, however, previous studies have shown that cortisol plays a medi-ating role in the process of environmental impact on immune organs.Demers and Bayne (1997)also emphasized that lysozyme may be arather small component of innate resistance, whereas cortisol mayhave rather widespread negative effects on resistance mechanisms.For the intelligent group, the phenomenon of higher cortisol but lowerlysozyme levels indicates that a higher susceptibility to pathogens canlead to a negative effect on the health and welfare of the ﬁsh. The antioxidant capacity of the immune system is also closely re-lated toﬁsh health (Dawood et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2020). The SOD and MDA activities can indirectly reﬂect theﬁ
sh antioxidant capacity (Viarengo et al., 1995). In this study, the SOD activity in the intelligentgroup was lower than the traditional group, but the MDA activity inthe intelligent group was higher than in the traditional group. The intel-ligent group, which was subjected to multiple stimulations during thefeeding process, may have an increased consumption of metabolismand energy. This phenomenon, to a certain extent, would promote thegeneration of oxygen free radicals and increase the MDA activity inthe intelligent group. Although no signiﬁcant differences in the SOD and MDA activities were observed, the generation of oxygen free radi-cals slightly increased the MDA activity in the intelligent groupcompared to the traditional group. The intelligent group, however,demonstrated lower SOD activity.How to realize intelligent feeding for the cultured ﬁsh in the RAS, is not only the challenge in production management but the key scienti ﬁc problem in welfare farming. Different from the traditional feeding

122method, intelligent feeding can greatly weaken the size differentiationofﬁsh school and improveﬁsh growth but may also result in stressand suppress innate immunity. At present, although intelligent feedinghas been an active area in aquaculture research, few studies have fo-cused on how to combine the appropriate feeding strategy with an in-telligent feeding algorithm. This deﬁciency may underlie the stress and innate immune suppression observed during intelligent feeding.Moreover,ﬁsh feeding and appetite vary from species to species andare susceptible to a variety of external factors, including the environ-ment and management practices. Therefore, intelligent feeding in thefuture should target speciﬁc breeds, not only combining feeding strate-gies but also adapting to changes in the environment.3.3. Proximate compositionEnergy intake plays an important role in determining the primaryproximate composition in growingﬁsh (Cardinal et al., 2011). To study the effects of the two feeding methods on the proximate compo-sition ofﬁshﬂesh, the moisture, ash, crude protein, and crude lipidlevels were measured as shown inTable 4. No signiﬁcant differences in moisture, ash, or crude lipid (p> 0.05) were observed between thetwo groups, however, the traditional group had a signi ﬁcantly higher level of crude protein (3.99%) compared to the intelligent group ( p< 0.05).In theory, theﬁsh in the intelligent group can acquire suf ﬁcient en- ergy intake, which would promote a more preferable body proximatecomposition versus the traditional group, but the opposite result wasobtained. In this study, theﬁsh in the intelligent feeding group werestimulated many times during a feeding, resulting in relatively acceler-ated metabolism and consequently higher energy consumption. Hence,juvenileMicropterus salmoidesmay consume body proteinﬁrst, which would result in signiﬁcantly lower crude protein levels observed inthe intelligent group.4. ConclusionsTo explore whether the intelligent feeding methods that have beenproposed so far would impairﬁsh welfare in real production, an adap-tive feeder based on a practical intelligent feeding method was de-signed. In contrast to traditional feeding, the intelligent feedingmethod was more conducive to improving ﬁsh growth performance and reducing feed cost in aquaculture, however, intelligent feedingwould eventually result in a higher cortisol level and lower lysozymelevel, which is harmful to theﬁsh immune system and general welfare.In the future, with the development of multi-functional, high-precisionsensors, the improved or potential methods will be proposed to providemore and more intelligent solutions to address as many feeding prob-lems as possible, and these methods could potentially improve breedingefﬁciency andﬁsh welfare.Declaration of competing interestWe conﬁrm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhereand is not under consideration by another journal.
