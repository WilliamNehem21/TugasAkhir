In this article, we present a new data collection that combines information about earthquake damage with seismicshaking. Starting from the Da.D.O. database, which provides information on the damage of individual buildingssubjected to sequences of past earthquakes in Italy, we have generated ShakeMaps for all the events withmagnitude greater than 5.0 that have contributed to these sequences. The sequences under examination are thoseof Irpinia 1980, Umbria Marche 1997, Pollino 1998, Molise 2002, L ’Aquila 2009 and Emilia 2012. In this way, we were able to combine, for a total of the 117,695 buildings, the engineering parameters included in Da.D.O., butrevised and reprocessed in this application, and the ground shaking data for six different variables (namely, in-tensity in MCS scale, PGA, PGV, SA at 0.3s, 1.0s and 3.0s). The potential applications of this data collection areinnumerable: from recalibrating fragility curves to training machine learning models to quantifying earthquakedamage. This data collection will be made available within Da.D.O., a platform of the Italian Department of CivilProtection, developed by EUCENTRE.
1. IntroductionThis article describes the procedure implemented for the creation of ajoint data collection of information on building damage and associatedground shaking (referred to herein as ShakeDaDO) for Italy. The maincomponents used to develop this data collection are Da.D.O. (the Data-base of Observed Damage,Dolce et al., 2019) compiled by the Italian Civil Protection using damage assessment forms from sequences of pastItalian earthquakes
1and the ground shaking provided by the newimplementation of ShakeMap at INGV ( Michelini et al., 2020). The data collection was developed in three consecutive steps. The ﬁrst step involved the reﬁnement of the information on buildings present inDa.D.O.. In the second step, we have recovered from the literature (oraccessible web-services) the seismological information of the earth-quakes within Da.D.O. to calculate maps of ground shaking with thehighest level of accuracy that is currently possible. The latest version ofShakeMap (version 4.0), which implements updated ground motionmodels and maps of local site corrections, was used for this purpose.Finally, each point of Da.D.O. was paired with the Mercal-li–Cancani–Sieberg intensity scale (MCS hereinafter), the ground shakingparameters, the distance between the point under examination and theearthquake source, and the magnitude of the earthquake. The groundmotion parameters of interest are: MCS intensity, peak ground acceler-ation, peak ground velocity, spectral acceleration at 0.3s, 1.0s and 3.0s,and their relative uncertainties. These six parameters are calculated byShakeMap and were chosen because they give a comprehensive overviewof shaking. In particular, these three spectral acceleration are chosen todisplay the amount of shaking experienced by structures sensitive to lowperiods, intermediate periods, and long periods.The publication of the Da.D.O. database ( Dolce et al., 2019) has made available a large amount of information on damage data of individualbuildings from ten strong sequences of earthquakes that affected Italysince 1980. Around the same time,Michelini et al. (2020)published a new release of ShakeMap for the Italian territory. This implementation isbased on the updated ShakeMap code architecture, which implements anew and more sophisticated strategy for the integration of real groundmotion data and ground motion models ( Worden et al., 2020). In addi- tion, it uses the latest ground motion models and an updated site effectsmap.Michelini et al. (2020)describe the new approach, quantify theconsistency between recorded data and the resulting maps and compare

(2008). In light of these developments, we have created a single data collec-tion that merges information about the damage and the characteristics ofthe individual buildings, with the associated ground shaking parametersinferred at the individual points provided by Da.D.O.. Combining thesedata and applications has allowed the construction of an extensive datacollection, theﬁrst of its kind for Italy. Its application allows the impactof earthquakes to be addressed through new strategies, such as throughthe training of machine learning models.The paper is divided into the following sections:/C15reﬁnement of the Da.D.O. database;/C15creation of the ShakeMaps for allM/C215:0 earthquakes belonging to each sequence under examination;/C15assemblage of the ShakeDaDO data collection.In the following, we describe the steps and reasoning that led to thecreation of the joint damage/ShakeMap data collection. We also presentall of the maps that have been generated and a ﬁrst statistical analysis of the data distribution.2. Reﬁnement of the Da.D.O. DatabaseThe damage data in the Da.D.O. database, described in Dolce et al. (2019), required additional processing since it does not include all of theundamaged buildings (except for the Irpinia event which included all thebuildings in the affected region). The Italian National Institute of Sta-tistics (ISTAT) census data from either the 1991, 2001 or 2011 census hasbeen used to obtain an estimate of the total number of reinforced con-crete and masonry buildings in each municipality at the time of eachevent. Subsequently, the number of damaged buildings from Da.D.O. hasbeen removed from the total number of buildings to provide an estimateof the number of undamaged buildings. It has not been possible to obtainTable 1Number and properties of original and added (simulated) buildings in the Da.D.O. database.

37census data representing the building/dwelling statistics at the time ofthe Friuli 1976 and Abruzzo 1984 events, and so in these cases it has notbeen possible to estimate the undamaged buildings and they were thusexcluded from further study. For the remaining eight sequences, onlythose municipalities where the inspection forms made up at least 80% ofthe estimated total number of buildings in the municipality have beenconsidered in the calculations herein (as it cannot necessarily be assumedthat municipalities with few damage forms had few damaged buildings).Due to a lack of municipalities that met this criterion, Emilia 2003 wasalso excluded from this study. As for the Garfagnana-Lunigiana 2013earthquake, this earthquake was only recently included in Da.D.O.database. Six historical sequences of events in Italy have thus beenanalysed herein: Irpinia 1980, Umbria-Marche 1997, Pollino 1998,Molise 2002, L’Aquila 2009 and Emilia 2012. The following ﬁelds were extracted from the Da.D.O. database:/C15location (latitude and longitude of the building);/C15number ofﬂoors/storeys;/C15age of construction;/C15structure (masonry or reinforced concrete);/C15damage (where the original damage descriptions in Da.D.O. wereconverted to DS0 to DS5 using the approach proposed by Dolce et al. (2019), and where grade DS0 is for no damage; grade DS1 refers toslight damage (e.g., hair-line cracks in few walls); grade DS2 refers tomoderate damage (e.g., fall of large pieces of plaster); grade DS3 re-fers to heavy damage (e.g., large and extensive cracks in walls); gradeDS4 refers to very heavy damage (e.g., serious failure of walls) andgrade DS5 refers to destruction, the total collapse).We also added an additional attribute representing the year in whichthe municipalityﬁrst entered the seismic zonation classiﬁcation. How- ever, it is noted that the calculation of undamaged buildings using Censusdata, as described above, adds a signiﬁcant number of buildings for the DS0 class which are missing data on the location, number of ﬂoors, and age of construction. It was also found that there were also a few damagedbuildings from the Da.D.O. database which lacked these attributes. To beable to complete these attributes for these buildings, we adopt thefollowing strategy to generate the missing data: number of storeys andthe age of construction are sampled on the basis of the frequency from thesame municipality, as available in Da.D.O. database; the location israndomly sampled from the normalised density of population as avail-able inLandScan (2015). In the following the details of the pointsgenerated for each historical sequence is given, while in Table 1a sum- mary is provided.2.1. Irpinia 1980The Da.D.O. database information on buildings for this earthquakebelongs to 41 municipalities. Contrary to what happens for the data of theother sequences, for Irpinia the locations of all the buildings withinDa.D.O. are placed at the coordinate of the town hall of the municipalityof reference, since more detailed geographical information is not avail-able. To overcome this limitation, we have randomly distributed thebuildings within the municipality using the same method describedabove for the buildings that were lacking location data. As before, thedistribution was made on a probabilistic basis, using the populationdensity available inLandScan (2015). For what concerns the buildings with missing data, these are all buildings with damage grade DS0 andthey belong to 11 different municipalities; a total of 211 coordinates forthese buildings have been simulated. Table S1in the supplementary material summarises the information on all the buildings for which wehave added missing attributes. Theﬁnal database for Irpinia 1980 is composed of 38,095 data points.2.2. Umbria–Marche 1997The Da.D.O. database data for this earthquake belong to 12 munici-palities. For the buildings with missing attributes, these belong to 12

38different municipalities, and 1661 coordinates have been simulated.Table S2in the supplementary material summarises the information onall the buildings for which we have added missing attributes. For thisevent there are some municipalities for which buildings with damagegrades other than DS0 have also been generated, such as Fiastra, MonteCavallo and Pieve Torina; the type of structure of the simulated buildingsare mainly reinforced concrete for damage grade DS0, and masonry forthe other damage states. Theﬁnal database for Umbria-Marche 1997 iscomposed of 6980 data points.2.3. Pollino 1998The Da.D.O. database data for this earthquake belong to 6 munici-palities. The buildings with missing attributes belong to 6 different mu-nicipalities, and 330 coordinates have been randomly simulated.Table S3in the supplementary material summarises the information onall the buildings for which we have added missing attributes, which aremainly masonry buildings with damage grade DS0. The ﬁnal database for Pollino 1998 is composed of 3966 data points.2.4. Molise 2002The Da.D.O. database data for this earthquake belong to 16 munici-palities. The buildings whose attributes have been simulated belong to 13different municipalities, and a total of 903 coordinates have beensimulated.Table S4in the supplementary material summarises the in-formation on all the buildings for which we have added missing attri-butes. As for Pollino 1998, the majority of simulated buildings aremasonry with no damage (DS0). Theﬁnal database for Molise 2002 is composed of 14,111 data points.2.5. L’Aquila 2009The Da.D.O. database data for this earthquake belong to 38 munici-palities. The buildings with missing attributes belong to 32 differentmunicipalities, and a total of 1597 coordinates have been simulated.Table S5in the supplementary material summarises the information onall the buildings for which we have added missing attributes. As forUmbria–Marche 1997, for this earthquake, the simulation of buildingsnot only includes those belonging to the DS0 class but also some of theother categories. The municipalities of Castel del Mare, Pietracamela andCalascio showed this behaviour. In the regional capital, L ’Aquila, the damage grade with by far the largest number of buildings to simulate isDS0, with a reinforced concrete structure type. Contrary to other earth-quakes, several points belonging to class DS1 have also been simulated.Theﬁnal database for L’Aquila 2009 is composed of 52,679 data points.

The buildings with missing attributes belong to both mu-nicipalities, and 335 coordinates have been randomly simulated.Table S6in the supplementary material summarises the information onall the buildings for which we have added missing attributes. The maindamage grade of buildings with missing attributes is DS0, in equal part ofstructure type masonry and reinforced concrete; only a very limitednumber of buildings in other damage grade is simulated. The ﬁnal database for Emilia 2012 is composed of 1866 data points.3. ShakeMapsThis section describes the generation of the ground shaking maps tobe associated with the historical sequences in the Da.D.O. database. Someof the sequences that are of interest for this study are complex, consistingof several earthquakes with comparable magnitudes, and which arespatially very extended. This characteristic could in ﬂuence the shaking suffered by the different zones where buildings are located. We havetherefore calculated all the ShakeMaps related to events with magnitudeM/C215:0, which occurred during the whole sequence, and not just thoseassociated to the mainshock. For the seismological information, we usedthe Engineering Strong-Motion (ESM) database ( Luzi et al., 2016). The ESM website gives the possibility to download through a web service thepeak values of the ground motion parameters in a format suitable forShakeMap. The ground motion variables we considered are macroseismicintensity in MCS scale, PGA, PGV, SA 0.3s, SA 1.0s and SA 3.0s. More-over, ESM gives the possibility to download the extended fault if it is

In ShakeMap appli-cations, the extended fault has an impact on the magnitude and shape ofshaking, especially in the nearﬁeld. This work has decided to select theinput data for the ShakeMap calculation from a single database (ESM). Inthis way, we have aligned ourselves with the choice made in ESM for theextended fault associated with the earthquake.

S30for the site effects. The software implemented isthe ShakeMap version 4.0 (Worden et al., 2020). Below we describe the main features of the earthquakes we have considered and show the mostrelevant ShakeMaps that have been calculated.3.1. ShakeMaps for Irpinia 1980There are 3 earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 5.0 for thissequence, as shown inTable 2, with information on location, magnitude,fault and number of stations available. Only for the ﬁrst earthquake, the one with the larger magnitude, the extended fault model is available.Also, for this earthquake, 21 stations have recorded the ground motion,while for the other two earthquakes only few stations recorded the event.Logically, the considerable difference in magnitude between the ﬁrst earthquake and the other two implies that the main earthquake withmagnitude M 6.9 is responsible for the damage reported in the Da.D.O.database.Fig. 1instead shows the distribution of the Da.D.O. points onpanela, while in panelbthe ShakeMaps in MCS intensity of the mainearthquake.Figure S1in the supplementary material shows the Shake-Maps for all the ground motion values. The 1980 Irpinia earthquake wasundoubtedly the most devastating earthquake in Italy since the SecondWorld War. According to the most reliable estimates, it caused about280,000 displaced people, about 9000 injured and 3000 dead. Theearthquake affected three regions, Campania, Basilicata and Puglia, withan area aligned along fault strike longer than 60 km featuring MCS in-tensity higher than IX.3.2. ShakeMaps for Umbria–Marche 1997The seismic sequence of Umbria –Marche 1997, which affected parts of the two regions of central Italy, began in September 1997 and ended inMarch 1998. On September 26 in the night, there was the ﬁrst of the three main earthquakes (M 5.7), while in the late morning of the sameday there was the second earthquake (M 6.0). This second event wasresponsible for the fall of the Giotto and Cimabue vault in the Basilica ofSt. Francis in Assisi, which killed four people. The third main event (M5.6) on October 14 caused the lantern in the Town Hall of Foligno tocollapse. Overall, there are 8 earthquakes with magnitude greater than5.0 that have occurred in the time span September 1997 to April 1998, asshown inTable 3.A fault model is available for the three larger earthquakes. Thenumber of stations that have recorded the earthquakes changes consid-erably during the sequence. In fact, after the September 26, several otherstations belonging to temporary networks were installed, which allowedfor a good coverage of the nearﬁeld for the 1 October 14 earthquake.Fig. 2, panela, shows the spatial distribution of earthquakes and thepoints of the Da.D.O. database. As can be seen from the ﬁgure, the points of the Da.D.O. database fall all in the Marche region. An important thingto observe in theﬁgure is that there are some points in the database thatare very close to the third largest event of the sequence (M 5.6 occurredon October 14, 1997, pink star inFig. 2, panela) to the south, whereas other Da.D.O. points are affected by the earthquakes of September 26,1997, M 6.0 and M 5.7, dark green and violet stars in Fig. 2, panela. Fig. 2, panelsb,c,d, shows the ShakeMap for the 3 mainshocks of thesequence, in MCS intensity scale.Figures S2, S3, S4in the supplementary material show the ShakeMaps for all the ground motion values. From thethreeﬁgures, it is possible to notice that the second earthquake onSeptember 26 (M6.0) caused the most damage in area located northernrespect to the epicentres, with values of macroseismic intensity in theepicentral zone corresponding to grade IX of the MCS scale. The area inwhich the effects of the earthquake equal to grade VIII-IX is 20 km long,along the north-west direction of the fault. The third earthquake (M 5.6)which occurred further south, on the other hand, shows an extended areaof several km where the macroseismic intensity reaches grade VIII. Thesame area in previous earthquakes had shown macroseismic intensityequal to degree VI-VII on the MCS scale.3.3. ShakeMaps for Pollino 1998The sequence relating to the earthquake that struck Calabria in 1998has only one earthquake with a magnitude greater than 5.0. Table 4 summarises the characteristics of this earthquake. No extended faultmodel is available for this earthquake of moderate size; it was onlyregistered by 5 stations.Fig. 3instead shows the distribution of the Da.D.O. points on panel a, while on panelbthe ShakeMap in MCS intensity.Figure S5in the sup- plementary material shows the ShakeMaps for all the ground motionvalues. The area of Pollino, in Calabria, has already been the scene ofsigniﬁcant earthquakes in the past. The epicentre is located between theTable 7List of the earthquakes withM/C215.0 for the Emilia 2012 sequence.

ShakeMaps for Molise 2002The earthquakes with magnitude greater than 5.0 that occurredduring the seismic sequence of 2002 in Molise are two they are close bothspatially and temporally and also have the same magnitude. Table 5 summarises the characteristics of these earthquakes. Also in this case, aswith the 1998 Pollino earthquake, not many stations recorded theearthquakes. The faults are available for both earthquakes and come fromtheDISS (2010)and 10 stations recorded the events, but in both cases,they are located far from the epicenters. The earthquake of Molise in2002 is composed of two earthquakes of the same size that occurredbetween October 31 and November 1, 2002, with the epicentre located inthe province of Campobasso, between the towns of San Giuliano diPuglia, Colletorto, Santa Croce di Magliano, Bonefro, Castellino delBiferno and Provvidenti.Fig. 4instead shows the distribution of the Da.D.O. points on panel a, while the ShakeMap related to these earthquakes in MCS intensity scaleare presented on panelsbandc.Figures S6 and S7in the supplementary material show the ShakeMaps for all the ground motion values for thesetwo earthquakes. In theﬁrst event, the effects of the earthquake reacheda value equal to grade VIII on the MCS scale, while they were slightlylower for the second event.3.5. ShakeMaps for L’Aquila 2009There are 8 earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 5.0 that haveoccurred during this sequence, and they all occurred in the time spanfrom April 6 to April 13, 2009.Table 6shows the main data underlying ShakeMap. Comparing the number of recorded data with those of theprevious events, it is clear that the number of stations has increased. Aftertheﬁrst earthquake, as happens when a damaging earthquake occurs,INGV and other research institutes and universities have installed manystations in the epicentre area. In this way, we can generate more con-strained ShakeMaps in the epicentral area. It should be noted that thehigher number of stations in theﬁrst earthquake depends on the fact thatthe ShakeMap for earthquakes with magnitude greater than 6 is morespatially extended than the others.The main shock, which occurred on April 6, 2009, was felt throughoutcentral-southern Italy. This event is currently the most severe earth-quake, in terms of the number of victims and damage, of the 21st centuryin Italy. Also, in the city of L’Aquila, several strategic buildings, such asthe Prefect’sO fﬁce, the Regional Hospital, the headquarters of the Uni-versity, the Police Headquarters and the Student House suffered severedamage. The city of L’Aquila and the entire basin of L ’Aquila, since the fourteenth century, has always been subject to earthquakes of severe ormedium intensity. Three other signiﬁcant earthquakes struck the area, all with a macroseismic intensity value equal to the grade IX of the MCSscale.Fig. 5panela, shows the distribution of the different earthquakeswith respect to the points of the Da.D.O. database. The important thing to

43note in theﬁgure is that there are several earthquakes north of L ’Aquila, near the Campotosto, with a maximum magnitude of M 5.4 that couldaffect the damage to the buildings located in the northern area. We showas an example the maps for 3 earthquakes in the sequence. The ﬁrst one is for the mainshock M 6.1 of April 6, 2009 ( Fig. 5, panelb). The maximum macroseismic intensity reaches the values of IX of MCS scale, in the di-rection south-east for the city of L ’Aquila. The village of Onna, located inthis area, was destroyed. The second one shows the shaking related to theearthquake M 5.5 of April 7, which affected the southernmost part of theaftershock area (Fig. 5, panelc), with a maximum of macroseismic in-tensity equal to VIII of MCS intensity. Finally, the ShakeMap of theearthquake with M 5.4 of April 9, 2009 is presented, which occurred inthe northernmost part of the area affected by the sequence ( Fig. 5, panel d). The epicentral area of this earthquake suffers a macroseismic intensityequals to grade VIII of MCS scale. Figures S8, S9, S10in the supple- mentary material show the ShakeMaps for all the ground motion values.3.6. ShakeMaps for Emilia 2012The sequence that hit the Emilia region in 2012 had two main shocksof comparable magnitude but quite distant spatially, and several otherearthquakes with magnitude greater than 5.0 (see Fig. 6, panela). The seismic sequence has affected the Po Valley region, an area where strongearthquakes occur at medium-low frequency. But historical informationhas shown that already in the past earthquakes had happened in the area,as in 1579 (M 5.4) with a maximum macroseismic intensity equal tograde VIII and 1639 (M 5.3) with a maximum intensity equal to gradeVII-VIII of the MCS scale.Table 7andFig. 6show an overview of the data used to calculate theShakeMap and the spatial distribution of the epicentres of the earth-quakes with respect to points in the Da.D.O. database. For this sequence,we use the extended source for four out of six earthquakes. The numberof stations we have at our disposal is signi ﬁcantly higher than those of earthquakes that occurred several years ago. Moreover, after the ﬁrst earthquake of the sequence, we notice an improvement in the stationcoverage in the epicentral area, allowing a better constraint of theshaking. The earthquakes caused massive damage to rural and industrialbuildings, water pipelines, historical buildings and monuments and oldstone buildings. The most damaged provinces are those of Modena andFerrara, where the territory affected has an area of about 1800 squarekilometres. We show as an example the maps in MCS intensity scale for 2earthquakes in the sequence, related to the strongest earthquakes in thesequence (Fig. 6panelsbandc), whileFigures S11 and S12in the sup- plementary material show the ShakeMaps for all the ground motionvalues.4. Preparation of the damage and ground motion data collectionThe last step in developing ShakeDaDO data collection consists ofassociating the building damage to the level of the ground shakingexperienced at the same location, deﬁned by the coordinates in the processed version of the Da.D.O. database described in Section 2,t o produce the ShakeDaDO data collection. To this end, we have imple-mented the following strategy. For each point of the Da.D.O. database,we have associated the maximum shaking that occurred during the wholesequence as determined by the calculated ShakeMaps, as described in
Fig. 8.Association of the Da.D.O. points to the earthquakes ground shaking for the Molise 2002. Stars: earthquakes (coloured according to the legend in pane la), dots: points in Da.D.O. database.

Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Geosciences 1 (2020) 36 –51
44Section3. In this way, we have tried to take into account the occurrenceof several earthquakes in close time and space. The six variables quan-tifying the ground shaking are treated separately and independently ofeach other. This choice implies that, for example, the same Da.D.O. pointmay have the maximum shaking for the PGA ground value that is asso-ciated with an earthquake from the sequence that is different to theearthquake leading to the maximum PGV. Each ground motion variableis associated with the epicentral distance and the magnitude. It is to benoted that the new ShakeMap conﬁguration (Worden et al., 2020) allows for the calculation of the ground motion values directly at the soughttarget point. The shaking value is also associated with the uncertainty, asspeciﬁed inWorden et al. (2018). Finally, each building contained in theDa.D.O. database is associated with the damage grade description, asavailable in Da.D.O. database (Dolce et al., 2019) and described in sec- tion2, and the maximum ground shaking values of the six shaking pa-rameters as derived from the largest events of the sequence. Whilst itwould have been very useful to use the date of damage evaluation in theShakeDaDo data collection (to ensure that all of the main events pre-ceding the damage were included), this data is not publicly availablewithin Da.D.O.. Typically, damage surveys for large numbers of buildingscan take weeks to complete, and so it was felt to be appropriate to includeall the ground shaking from the potentially damaging aftershocks in thedays following the main event. The only event for which a wider range oftime has been considered is the Umbria-Marche sequence, whichoccurred over a period of 6 months. The damage data is likely to havebeen collected following each of the large events in this sequence, but asmentioned previously, the actual damage survey date for each building inthe Da.D.O. database is not available.Table 8provides theﬁnal list of parameters in the ShakeDaDO datacollection, where for reasons of privacy the actual location in terms oflatitude and longitude is not provided.It is noted that for the Irpinia 1980 and Pollino 1998 earthquakesthere is only one earthquake responsible for the damage. For thesequence relating to Emilia 2012, the earthquake with magnitude 6.1 onMay 20 is too far from the points in the Da.D.O. database compared to theother strong earthquake in the sequence, which occurred on May 29 (seeFig. 6). This spatial distribution implies that the Da.D.O. points, for all theground motion variables, are associated with the May 29 earthquake. Forthe other four sequences the situation is not linear, and is described inmore detail in the following sections.4.1. Umbria–Marche 1977 data collectionThe sequence under examination consists of several earthquakes.Fig. 7shows which earthquakes the different points of the Da.D.O.database are associated with, for the 6 ground shaking variables.The MCS parameter (panelainFig. 7) shows that the Da.D.O. points to the north are associated with the shaking caused by the earthquakewith largest magnitude (M 6.0 of September 26, 1997), the dark greenpoints in the Figure. In purple there are highlighted the Da.D.O. pointsassociated with theﬁrst earthquake with M 5.7 that also occurred onSeptember 26, 1997. While the pink points further south are associatedwith the October 14, 1997, M 5.6 shock. The association of the Da.D.O.points concerning the different earthquakes in the sequence is substan-tially the same for the other ground motion variables, with the exceptionof SA 3.0s. In this case, the earthquake of October 14, 1997 M 5.6 has

45greater values, as can be seen fromFig. 7(panelf) where the contribution of this shock (highlighted with pink dots) also extends in the north-eastern direction. Probably, for this earthquake, the source mechanismenhanced these longer periods.4.2. Molise 2002 data collectionThe sequence under examination consists of 2 earthquakes close inspace and with the same magnitude. Fig. 8shows which earthquakes the different points of the Da.D.O. database are associated with, for the 6ground shaking variables.From the MCS map (panelainFig. 8), we can see that the earthquake of October 31, 2002 has higher shaking values than the one that occurredthe daylater, on November 1, 2002. Consequently, all the buildingssurveyed by Da.D.O. that are to the east and north of the two earthquakesare associated with the maximum shaking of the ﬁrst earthquake. The association of the Da.D.O. points with respect to the two earthquakes inthe sequence is substantially the same for the other ground motionvariables.4.3. L’Aquila 2009 data collectionThe sequence under examination consists of several earthquakes.Fig. 9shows which earthquakes the different points of the Da.D.O.database are associated with, for the 6 shaking parameters.The points in the Da.D.O. database relating to the L ’Aquila 2009 earthquake are associated mainly with the mainshock, M 6.1 of April 6,2009. Only a few points to the north are, for the PGA and SA 0.3s maps,

46associated with earthquakes of magnitude M 5.2 and M 5.4 that occurredfurther north than the main event.5. Final data collectionThis data collection is one of theﬁrst attempt to combine engineering information collected and harmonized in Da.D.O. Dolce et al. (2019)with ground shaking data. The University of Cambridge has recently developed aplatform (Spence et al., 2011) with similar purposes as ShakeDaDO. Themain difference, however, is that ShakeDaDO provides data with a higherlevel of detail and completely disaggregated. There are six ground shakingvariables: MCS scale intensity, PGA, PGV and SA at 0.3s, 1.0s and 3.0s. Asnoted above, the shaking was calculated using the new version of Shake-Map, with the latest seismological data and information. Each shaking valueis associated with its uncertainty. Theﬁnal assembled data collection con- sists of 117,695 data points; of the resulting table each row is associatedwith a building. For each building, the information available is the type ofstructure, the number of storeys, the age of construction, and the class ofdamage. The year in which the municipality was classi ﬁed as a seismic zone, as well as the value of Vs,30, that can be useful to get an idea of the type ofsoil on which the building is built, are also available in the database. Wenote, however, that the Vs,30 data is extracted from the Vs,30 grid used inShakeMap, and it is not provided from direct measurements.Figs. 10 and 11summarises the data collection according to thebuilding characteristics. Three-quarters of the available data come fromthe sum of the information of the earthquakes of Irpinia 1980 andL’Aquila 2009, while few data come from the earthquakes of Emilia 2012and Pollino 1998 (seeFig. 10, panela).

47Concerning the type of structures, here divided only in masonry(denoted asmuin Figure) and reinforced concrete (denoted as cain Figure), weﬁnd that three-quarters of the buildings surveyed in Da.D.O.database are of the masonry type, while only a quarter is in reinforcedconcrete (panelcofFig. 10). The damage grades are also not equallypopulated. DS0 is by far the most populated, while few buildings havesuffered damage falling within the DS4 and DS5 categories (panel bof Fig. 10). A signiﬁcant portion of the buildings have just a few ﬂoors, with a considerable peak for the two or three-storey buildings (the sum of whichreaches three-quarters of the total dataset). Very tall buildings, on theother hand, are not numerically relevant (panel aofFig. 11). More than a third of the buildings were built before 1910, while there are about 6%constructed after 1990 (panelbofFig. 11). The panelcinFig. 11shows the year of seismic classiﬁcation of the municipalities. Slightly less than half ofthe buildings belong to cities that have been classi ﬁed since 1915. A sec- ond big slice of buildings (about 30%) belongs to municipalities that havebeen classiﬁed after 1984. About 12% of the buildings belong to the citiesthat have been classiﬁed after 2004. The combination of information onthe age of construction and the year of seismic classi ﬁcation has deﬁned the parameter“Classiﬁcation Age”(in paneldinFig. 10). 61% of the buildings were built before the municipality entered seismic classi ﬁcation, against 27% of buildings constructed afterwards.Going a little more into the details of the data collection elements,Figs. 12 and 13show how the different features are distributed in the sixdifferent seismic sequences.Fig. 12, in panela, shows the damage distribution. DS05 and DS04 arenumerically relevant for the earthquakes of Irpinia 1980, Umbria Marche1997, Molise 2002 and L’Aquila 2009, while it is nearly absent in the

48earthquakes of Pollino 1998 and Emilia 2012. The DS0 and DS1 gradesare the most represented for all earthquakes. At the same time, class DS03is more populated then class DS02 for the earthquakes in Umbria Marche1997, Molise 2002 and Pollino 1998. As far as vertical structures areconcerned, in all sequences and in a somewhat similar way, masonrybuildings (deﬁned asmuin Figure) are more abundant than reinforcedconcrete ones (deﬁned asca, panelbinFig. 12). Finally, in panelcof Fig. 12, we see for all earthquakes a very high number of 2- and 3- storeybuildings, while only for L ’Aquila 2009 and Molise 2002, 4-storeybuildings are also numerically relevant. If we analyse the featuresrelated to the age of the buildings, from Fig. 13panela, we can say that there is for the Irpinia 1980 a considerable part of the buildings that hadbeen built before 1900. This earthquake is also the only one in which thenumber of buildings without this information is high. As far as the se-quences of Umbria Marche 1997, Pollino 1998 and Emilia 2012 areconcerned, we observe a relatively pronounced peak of buildings built in1910, and then very few other constructions. A similar situation alsoexists for the earthquakes of Molise 2002 and L ’Aquila 2009. Still, in these cases, especially in the areas affected by the sequence of L ’Aquila 2009, there are a signiﬁcant number of buildings built in other years. Theareas affected by these six sequences have a very different seismic clas-siﬁcation history (Fig. 13panelb). Referring to the area affected by theIrpinia earthquake, many buildings belong to municipalities that enteredthe 1930 and 1984 seismic regulations. The regulations of 1930 sub-stantially affect the Irpinia area, which classi ﬁed a large part of the ter- ritory after the destructive earthquake of July 23, 1930, Mw 6.7. The1984 regulations were theﬁrst to classify a large part of the Italian re-gion, as reﬂected inFig. 13, panelb, where all areas have some munic-ipalities classiﬁed in that year. A particular situation concerns theL’Aquila area. Most of the buildings belong to cities that were classi ﬁed seismically already in 1915, following the devastating earthquake inMarsica on January 13, 1915, Mw 7. Finally, the area affected by theEmilia 2012 only entered into the last seismic regulations, dated 2004.The union of the information of panels aandbofFig. 13, leads us to the deﬁnition of code to understand if a building was built before the seismicregulations (panelc,Fig. 13). As already mentioned in commenting onthe previous two panels inFig. 13, Italy has a fairly old building stock,where except for L’
Aquila 2009, a large proportion of the buildings wasbuilt without the seismic regulations in place.As regards the seismological information, for each of the 6 shakingparameters under examination, in addition to the value of the variableitself and the relative uncertainty, the distance between site andepicenter and the magnitude of the event under examination are alsoprovided. The distance used isRJBwhen theﬁnite source is available, and epicentral distance in other cases.Fig. 14shows the histograms of the ground motion variables includedin the data collection. The intensity values range between a minimum of6.0 and a maximum of 9.0 on the MCS scale. With the exclusion of twoprominent peak at 7.4 and 8.3, the intensities distribute rather homo-geneously for intensities larger than 6.5. Instead, data with MCS less than7.0 are less abundant.Looking at ground motion data, PGA has a predominant peak at 0.3 g,a second smaller peak at 0.2 g, and it ranges between 0.02g and 0.45g.The values of PGV from 5 to 9 cm/s are all equally highly populated. Asecond peak is at 24 cm/s. Values between 10 cm/s and 26 cm/s aredistributed over a plateau of frequencies that are comparable to eachother. At the same time, values from 28 cm/s to 44 cm/s are also spreadover a plateau but with a much lower frequency. SA at 0.3s has a peak at0.7; the values of this variable range between 0.05 g and 1 g, with analmost uniform distribution. SA at 1.0s has a predominant peak at 0.07 gand a smaller peak at 0.3 g. The ranges of values are between 0.03 g and0.6 g. SA at 3.0s has two predominant peaks 0.015g and at 0.05 g, and itranges between 0.003 g and 0.075 g; there are some values of SA 0.3shigher, but their frequency is negligible.Fig. 15shows the scatterplot of the six ground motion values ac-cording to distance, differentiated according to the earthquake identi ﬁer. What we can deduce from theﬁgure is that Pollino 1998 and Emilia2012, which are the two least populated sequences of the data collectionhave a different ground motion distribution. Pollino 1998 has points thatare further away as if the majority of the inhabited centres were not closeto the epicentre. On the contrary, Emilia 2012 has many points very closeto the epicentre, and no point is more than 80 km away. The data for theearthquake in L’Aquila 2009 and Umbria Marche 1997 are those thatshow a greater scatter. In fact, for the same distance, there are shakingvalues that cover a wide range. The data relative to Irpinia 1980 areinstead those with less scatter. The greatest shaking values for all sixvariables are those of Irpinia 1980, followed by Emilia 2012, L ’Aquila 2009 and Umbria Marche 1997.

496. Conclusions and future applicationsThe ShakeDaDO data collection presented in this work combines fortheﬁrst time damage data and peak ground shaking for Italy within asingle structure allowing further research and applications to be under-taken by the community. In particular, the analysis of the relative de-pendencies between parameters or, possibly, deep dependencies betweensets of parameters could lead to fast, euristic determinations of earth-quake impact. Overall, we believe there are multiple possibleapplications. For example, there has been a signi ﬁcant effort since the publication of the Da.D.O. database to produce empirical fragility func-tions for the Italian building stock (e.g. DelGaudio et al., 2017,2018; Rosti et al., 2020a,b). However, these efforts have been limited by a lackof ground shaking data for many of the events in the Da.D.O. database.We thus believe that the ShakeDaDO data collection can help greatlyimprove the research related to the development of empirical fragilityfunctions in Italy. We also expect this database to be useful to test newand benchmark existing applications of new applications of Machine
