The purpose of this work is to assess the soil fertility for Tulaipanji rice cultivation in Kaliyaganj C.D. Block usingthe Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Machine learning algorithms along with the ﬁeld survey data and GIS. A total of 40 soil samples from Tulaipanji rice ﬁelds (from 0 to 40 cm depth) have been randomly collected for the analysis of the soil health condition. For the purpose of assigning ratings to the parameters, ten experts' opinionswere taken into account. Theﬁnal soil fertility map indicates that 18.01% of the land is in excellent health condition to support Tulaipanji cultivation. The arti ﬁcial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and Bagging models-based suitability analysis was also done using geo-spatial and soil data for Tulaipanjicultivation. Nevertheless, the ANN is the more appropriate model for locational analysis of Tulaipanji cultivation.The ANN-basedﬁndings show that areas of 25.8% (77.89 sq. km) are excellent for growing Tulaipanji rice, about22.01% (66.45 sq. km) are highly suitable, 19.84% (59.90 sq. km) are moderately suitable, 21.19% (63.97 sq. km)are low suitable and 11.16% (33.69 sq. km) are not suitable for Tulaipanji rice cultivation. The receiver operatingcharacteristic (ROC) curve depicts that the applied models have a high degree of accuracy. This endeavour willaid much in the soil fertility and site suitability assessment that will aid local government of ﬁcials, academics, and the framers, to utilize the lands in a scienti ﬁc way.
1. IntroductionAccording to FAO's deﬁnition, in agriculture, the fertility of soilrefers to the capacity of a soil to support crop growth by supplyingrequired soil nutrients as well as suitable biochemical, and physicalproperties as a growing environment for plants. The essential macro-nutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), as well asmagnesium (Mg), sulphur (S), and calcium (Ca) are all found in plantsas micronutrients and by consuming these foods, humans ful ﬁll their nutritional demands. Micronutrients are mostly composed of the ele-ments iron (Fe), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), chlorine (Cl), sele-nium (Se), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and boron (B). Water is requiredfor plant growth! Plants comprise roughly 80% –95% water, and they need water for a variety of purposes as they develop, includingphotosynthesis, cooling, and transporting minerals and nutrients fromthe soil into the plant. Soil fertility implications are represented in themajority of the Sustainable Development Goals since they includeeconomic, social, and environmental dimensions. The principal facilitysupplied by soil fertility is agricultural production, which is critical forachieving the FAO's planned goal of zero hunger. Fertile soil produceshealthy crops that meet the human body's nutritional requirements.Whereas a soil deﬁcit in some critical elements would be unable toproduce nutritional foods, ultimately resulting in a nutritional de ﬁ- ciency in the human body. Before the worst-case scenario comes whereall humans are facing nutrition deﬁcit health issues, we should conserveand maintain good soil health by implementing different managementand conservational strategies such as demarcating speci ﬁc crops for speciﬁc land is very essentials.Rice (Oryza sativaL.) is among the most essential cereal crops on theplanet, contributing signiﬁcantly to global food security by providing foodfor more than half of the global population ( Chauhan et al., 2017). Today, around one-third of the world population, while about 1.7 billion people inSouth Asia, including more than 50 million families, subsist entirely on rice(Manzanilla et al., 2011;Nayak et al., 2019). Rice may become extremely

Agriculture contributes nearly 40% of India's Gross National Product(GNP) and ensures subsistence for approximately 70% of its total popu-lation. Almost 67% (two-thirds) of the country's cropland is covered byrain-fed farming (Rath et al., 2018). In India, rice cultivation not onlyfeeds the majority of the people but also helps to ﬂourish associated in- dustries, such as approximately 32% of the country's fertilizer ( FAO, 2005) and 22% of pesticides are used in rice cultivation. The governmentof India in 2016 estimates that around 43.4 million hectares of land andaround 60% of water are used each year to produce rice ( Reddy et al., 2005). In India, especially on the eastern side of the country'sland-intensive used for rice cultivation. Tulaipanji is the indigenous mostﬂavored rice cultivated in the Kaliyaganj block of Uttar Dinajpur District,West Bengal, Eastern India. It is one of the softest rice, which have verymuch popularity in the market for its unique features. Tulaipanji is tasty,bright, non-sticky, and friable aromatic rice. Tulaipanji is mainly culti-vated in the Kharif season. It grows between the months of August toNovember. On October 24, 2017, Tulaipanji gets a Geographical Indi-cation (GI TAG) certiﬁcate from the Department for promotion of In-dustry and Internal Trade, Govt. of India. Its market price is much higherthan the other rice varieties. As this variety returns more pro ﬁts in comparison to the same quantity of other varieties and cultivation of thisrice may have the capacity to improve the economic condition of thefarmers if they get proper help to produce and export this rice variety.The ability to prefer the appropriate areas for farming based on theintended usage and crop practices will help to mitigate adverse naturaleffects while increasing agricultural productivity and ﬁnancial advan- tages (Mahmood and Ahmad, 2001;Ashraf and Normohammadan, 2011). Land suitability assessment, described as an appraisal of the “ef- ﬁciency”of land for speciﬁc land uses and crops (Bagheri Bodaghabadi et al., 2015;Saleh et al., 2015), is a critical phase in sustainable devel-opment and land use management. Not only can land suitability assess-ments aid in the betterment of crop production systems and expansion ofland efﬁciency (Prudat et al., 2018;El Baroudy, 2016), but they can often offer insight into the key contributing factors to crop shortages ( Halder, 2013). To optimize agricultural land management, taking into accountenvironmental factors and comprehending the primary constraintsimposed by local biophysical conditions can aid in crop selection ( Kazemi et al., 2016;Mendas and Delali, 2012).Suitability assessment involves a variety of parameters; thus, expertopinions integrating analytic hierarchy process (AHP), as well as thecollection of numerous criteria, are expected to comprehend crop pro-duction on suitable lands. AHP based on remote sensing and GIS is apopularly adopted tool for geographical decision-making processes.Importantly, the AHP introduced by Saaty (1980)has been combined with GIS (Akinci et al., 2013) as the optimal approach for managingnumerous and diverse entities like soil suitability. AHP is a technique fororganizing various variables into a hierarchy and deciding theirperceived value (Saaty, 2000). This technique has been used in a numberof research for analyzing site suitability (
Mishra et al., 2016;Bozdag et al., 2016;Amini et al., 2020;Ostovari et al., 2019;Pilevar et al., 2020). Additionally, the GIS techniques facilitate an effective way to analyze sitesuitability. Nevertheless, in recent times, different machine learningmodels, such as artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine(SVM), random forest (RF), bagging, and decision tree-based site suit-ability analysis have gained signiﬁcant importance. Nowadays, re- searchers frequently use different machine learning techniques for sitesuitability analysis (Sarmadian et al., 2014;Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2015;Mishra et al., 2016;Hengl et al., 2017;Senagi et al., 2017a,b; Thanh Noi and Kappas, 2018;Mekonnen et al., 2019;Mohsenzadeh Karimi et al., 2020;Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi et al., 2020;Moller et al., 2021).Numerous scientists worldwide have applied remote sensing (RS) andGIS-based strategies for assessing site suitability for rice production aswell as for other crops (Gumma et al., 2009;Samanta et al., 2011;Kuria et al., 2011;Kihoro et al., 2013;Dengiz, 2013). RS and Geographical information systems (GIS) are well-deﬁned, precise, and adaptable methodologies for investigating spatial information in land suitabilityassessment (Mokarram et al., 2011;Mendas and Delali, 2012). Satellite-based digital information has arisen as a critical resource forproducing physical and biological details (e.g., topography and slope)that aid in the evolution of a region's optimum land use strategy forsustainable growth. Thus, the use of RS and GIS for land suitabilityanalysis for rice cultivation seems very compelling. Additionally, over thelast quarter-century, remote sensing and GIS techniques have grown inpopularity for a wide range of uses, which include land capabilityassessment (Hamzeh et al., 2014;El Baroudy and Moghanm, 2014; El-Zeiny and Effat, 2019). RS and GIS assessment at a lower cost facilitatea large spatial extent and the outcome is more reliable than conventionalanalysis (Zhou et al., 2017;Demarez et al., 2019). For analyzing land suitability, high-resolution satellite images such as LISS-III, Sentinel-2,Landsat-8, and Gaofeng-1 are far more acceptable data sources thanothers (Dong et al., 2015;Kussul et al., 2016). A multi-criteria deci- sion-making (MCDM) framework along with GIS is used to evaluatedifferent conditioning factors and make appropriate land-use decisions(Malczewski, 2006;Cengiz and Akbulak, 2009;Mendas and Delali, 2012). Land Use/Land Cover is a broad term that describes the classi ﬁ- cation natural features and human activities on the landscape across timeusing recognised statistical and scientiﬁc techniques. The main objective of the present study is to assess the site suitability for Tulaipanji ricecultivation by combining AHP, machine learning ANN, SVM, andBagging models and GIS techniques for the Kaliyaganj block of UttarDinajpur district, Eastern India. In theﬁrst section, the AHP method was used to measure the soil health condition of the study area. In the secondphase, soil properties and other physio-climatic variables were used toassess suitable sites for Tulaipanji rice cultivation.1.1. Description of the study areaThe present research was conducted at Kaliyaganj block ( Fig. 1), situated on the south-eastern side of North Dinajpur in West Bengal,India, with an area of 301.90 sq. km. This region is under fertile matureﬂat land topography with gentle sloping toward the south. The selectedstudy area comes under the subtropical humid region where the averagehighest temperature is recorded in June and a minimum temperature of15
/C14C is recorded in January (Fig. 2). The average annual rainfall in thestudy area is 1540.2 mm and the highest rainfall occurred in July fol-lowed by August. During theﬁeld survey, the calculated average hu-midity, 2 m from the soil surface, was 58.59%. The land use land coverscenario depicts intensive farming with 50% of total LULC coming underagricultural land and farming serves as a major source of income in thestudy block. The loamy-dominated soil with the existing climatic con-ditions created an ideal environment for rice cultivation. Farmers pre-dominantly cultivated a wide variety of rice such as miniket, fourty-ninety four, sorno, joyonti, ranjit, IR-8, tulaipanji, etc. in the studyarea. Based on the climatic conditions, the soil in this area keeps enoughmoisture to support plant growth under controlled conditions. Growersmostly use electric and diesel-based pumping machines to extractgroundwater to irrigate agricultural crops. River Srimati is an abundantchannel of the Tangan riverﬂowing north to east and divides this blockinto two halves. This river is ephemeral in nature and remains dry formost of the year, which facilities framers for intensive indigenous riceproduction in the river bed along with other crops, though this leads to aneconomic debate about whether this practice is appropriate for riverecosystem sustainability or not. The produced aromatic rice is exportedall over the country. Farmers' responses reveal that though they face avariety of problems producing these speciﬁc types of indigenous rice, the ﬁnished product gives a good return in comparison to the other culti-vated crops.D.

1802. Database and adopted methods2.1. Data sources2.1.1. Soil sample collection and laboratory testingA total of 40 soil samples were collected from different study sitesusing hand-held GPS and thermometer instruments in the month ofNovember to December 2020 and from May to June 2021. Firstly, weidentiﬁed the Tulaipanji riceﬁeld in the study area during a pre-ﬁeld survey considering the local people's perceptions. To collect soil sam-ples, we selected 5 soil sampling sites from 8-g panchayats using astratiﬁed random sampling method. The soil samples were collected at a40 cm zig-zag depth from the surface. At each soil sample site, ﬁve soil samples, with an average distance of 20 m, of about 500 gm werecollected and mixed for laboratory analysis. After collecting the soilsamples, the soil is dried up and made into a ﬁne grain size for laboratory purposes. All the soil samples are then tested by the authors with a properlaboratory assistant in the soil laboratory at Raiganj. Some of theglimpses of soil sample collection to laboratory analysis are given inFig. 3. To analyze the different soil properties such as Nitrogen (N), Po-tassium (K), Phosphate (PO

The method of assigning ratings to soil fertility analysis parameters2.2.1. Multi criteria decision making method: Analytic hierarchy method(AHP)The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process introduced by Saaty (1980).I nt h es t u d ya r e a , this AHP model is used for assessing soil fertility status that could help indecision making in Tulaipanji cultivation. Saaty developed a nine-pointscale using a pair-wise comparison matrix that can assist in extractingthe relative weights of the individual inﬂuencing parameters (Table 3) (Saaty, 1980). The fundamental pair-wise matrix categorization (Eq. (1)) in AHP is premised on a 1 to 9 reciprocal pertinence rating, with 1 denoting‘equally important and 9 denoting ‘very important. In an appropriatenessassessment, variables were given relative importance based on theirrespective inﬂuence capacity in the decision-making process.x1¼ða

a1=2a1=4a1Þ (1)Akinci et al. (2013)mentioned reciprocity as a feature of matricesthat is formally stated as contrast is implemented for n components inpairwise comparison. After the pairwise comparison matrix table is built,the eigenvectors and relative weights of the parameters are estimated. Inthis AHP model (Saaty, 1980), the incongruities and errors of the modelbuilder are also taken into consideration, which is also one of thestrengths of this adopted model. Equation (3)shows the Consistency ratio(CR) which is used to deﬁne the effectiveness requirements for theanalytical hierarchy process.CI¼λmax/C0nn/C01 (2)Equation(2)is used to calculate the consistency index. Whereλ

CIRI (3)The consistency index (CI) and random index (RI) are used tocalculate the CR value. CR is the quantiﬁcation of the policy or decision builder's mistakes or an indication of the magnitude of coherence and orirregularity (Sarkar and Pal, 2018). It represents the probability that thepair-wise matric evaluations were formed arbitrarily. If the calculated CRvalue is 10% or more, then we need to reconsider the parameters' relativeimportance judgments to reconstruct the pairwise matrix, but if thecalculated CR value is below 10%, then the decision makers accuratelyjudge the importance of the variables towards acceptable results withhigh precision.2.3. Machine learning algorithms and applied methodsFor the present study, three machine learning models, namely, arti-ﬁcial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and Baggingwere employed to construct theﬁnal Tulaipanji farming suitability mapsusing data mining software namely WEKA. This software is a NewZealand-based Javascript using software developed by Waikato Univer-sity. The produced information is then imported into the Arc GIS plat-form for spatial mapping. The Arc GIS environment offers a wide range ofclassiﬁer techniques, such as manual, equal interval, de ﬁned interval, quantile, natural breaks (Jenks), geometrical interval, standard devia-tion, etc. to classify the produced Tulaipanji farming suitability maps.The natural break is a widely used and accepted method for classifyingsuitability zones (Sarkar and Mondal, 2020;Saha et al., 2021).

1822.4. Multilayer Perceptron-ANN modelA neural network (ANN) is a numerical model of human perception(Kim et al., 2014) that may be taught to perform a speciﬁc task (Chak- raborty et al., 1992), based on the data set that is currently available(Valencia Ortiz and Martínez-Gra ~na, 2018). The three-layer ANN approach (input, hidden, and output layers) was established and suc-cessfully (Zhao et al., 2020) used for suitability modelling. In the outputlayer, however, a node was employed that was coded as 1 for cultivatedand 0 for non-cultivated regions. The discrepancy between the computedand observed values is characterized as an error. To examine it, a varietyof error measuring techniques have been utilized ( Falah et al., 2019). The customization of initial weights is carried out using a generalized deltarule to disperse the entire error across the network's neurons ( Kazmier- kowski 2002).2.5. Support vector machine (SVM) modelA common machine learning model is the SVM, which uses a set oflinear indicator functions. This was introduced by Vapnik (2013)and has been used in the determination of function concerns. The optimum linearhyper-plane has been selected to separate the actual output space. Thearray was also divided into two categories, such as the area of suitableTulaipanji cultivation and the region not suitable for Tulaipanji cultiva-tion {1, 0}. Because of the radial basis kernel's ﬂexibility in dealing with different dataset dimensionalities and its high generalization ability, ithas mostly been used to simulateﬂood susceptibility (Yang et al., 2019). One of the most fundamental disadvantages of modelling using SVM isthe difﬁculty of acquiring important characteristics ( Choubin et al., 2019).2.6. Bagging modelOne of the simplest yet efﬁcient machine learning ensemble ap-proaches is Bootstrap Aggregation (also known as bagging) ( Prasad et al., 2006). Bootstrap Aggregation is a fundamental technique that may beused to decrease variance in algorithms that have a high number of it-erations (Breiman 1996). The goal of bagging is to decrease variancewhile retaining the bias of a decision tree and avoiding over ﬁtting (Shahabi et al., 2020). The Bagging Tree generates several sets of inputdata at random by replacing training samples ( Maclin and Opitz 1997). The chosen subset of data was analyzed to train the assigned trees andgenerate models. The average of all forecasts from these trees is then usedto create theﬁnal conclusion, which is more resilient. Using severalreplicas of the trained data subset improves the precision of a single tree(Talukdar and Pal, 2019).2.7. Constructing suitability maps2.7.1. Weighted linear combination method (WLCM)A wide variety of MCDM techniques have been used by researchersfor allocating weights and integrating inﬂuencing variables of a speciﬁc event towards decision making. Several prominent approaches in thisrespect include AHP, Weighted linear combination method ( Eastman, 1997), weighting and integrating parameters based on a correlationmatrix (Khatun and Pal, 2016), etc. The GIS environment provides afascinating environment where we can successfully achieve the requiredoutcomes. For soil fertility status analysis of the study block, the WLCmethod has been used (Eq.(6)).WLC¼X

Machine learning algorithmsThe soil properties, and climatic information related to Tulaipanji aretaken into consideration to perform theﬁnal site suitability maps for Tulaipanji rice cultivation. In this process, machine learning algorithmssuch as artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM),and Bagging models come into play. The descriptions of these threemethods were previously discussed. The detailed procedure adopted forpreparingﬁnal site suitability maps for the study area is given in Fig. 5.3. Results and analysisA number ofﬁfteen variables were analyzed using various statisticaltechniques. Boron (B), Zinc (Zn), Nitrogen (N), Phosphate, Potassium,and Manganese (Mn) are the major variables that are considered as primevariables. The standard deviation (SD) of the dataset represents theaverage level of variability. It informs users how far each score deviatesfrom the mean on average. The SD of N is 70.931, followed by K(36.289), and PO
4(35.415) (Table 2). The kurtosis is a measure of heaviness or the density of distribution tails, whereas skewness is ameasure of symmetry in distribution. The skewness of P
H,K ,P O 4, Zn, Fe, SS, CEC indicates the highly skewed distribution in the soil sample data.The Kurtosis of MI (/C00.625), Fe (/C00.216), Cu (/C00.844), OC (/C01.057), B (/C00.297), K (/C00.738), N (/C00.908) represents a negative which indicatesthe Platykurtic kurtosis. The negative kurtosis depicts the lower numberof outliers in the distribution.Table 1Sleeted variables and their measurement.

1833.1. Soil fertility mapping (SFM) using AHP and WLCTable 3AHP rating Scale and Random Index (RI) to the formation ofthe Pair-wise comparison matrix.From the AHP estimation (Tables 3 and 4,Fig. 6) it is found that the Boron (Br) is the most prominent variable with a 9.19 per cent rating inSoil Fertility Mapping followed by Zinc (Zn) with 8.81 per cent, Potas-sium with 8.39 per cent respectively. A soluble salt is a least in ﬂuencing variable with a 3.79 per cent of AHP rating.It is considered that not all the selected parameters have the sameinﬂuence on soil fertility. As a result, the MCDM-AHP based weightingprocedure is used to determine the weights of the selected variables.FromFig. 7, out of the total spatial extension of the study area, 54.38 sq.km of the land seemed to have very high soil fertility for agriculturalfarming, primarily covering the NE and SW parts of the block. Accordingto the produced SFM, about 41.04 sq. km. (13.60%) is highly fertile and86.96 sq. km. (28.80%) comes under the moderately fertile zone of thetotal respectively. About 52.98 sq. km. of the total area, mainly in theSouth, South-west, and Northern parts of the block, appeared as unsuit-able sites as the soil fertility is very poor ( Table 5). Equation(7) demonstrated the performed WLC for soil fertility mapping.FSM

Site suitability mapping using machines learning techniquesIn this present study, the ANN, SVM and Bagging method was used toconstruct site suitability map for Tulaipanji rice cultivation and classifythe produced maps intoﬁve categories, such as very high, high, moder-ate, low, and least suitable (Fig. 8). The ANN, SVM, and Bagging-basedsite suitability models haveﬁve suitability categories that are repre-sented inFig. 8. Theﬁndings reveal that 77.89 sq. km (ANN model),52.62 sq. km (SVM model), and 80.97 sq. km (Bagging model) areas arethe most favorable for Tulaipanji rice cultivation. In the case of ANNsuitability analysis, the percentages are 25.8, 22.01, 19.84, 21.84, and11.16 for very high, high, moderate, low, and least suitable zonesrespectively. Whereas about 17.43%, 27.91%, 22.06%, 22.25%, and10.35% of the total area is very high, high, moderate, low, and leastsuitable zone respectively, in the case of the SVM model. The Baggingestimation shows that only 26.82% of the area is most suitable, followedby 21.39% of high suitable, 22.65% of moderate suitable, 19.41% of lowsuitable, and 9.73% of least suitable respectively ( Table 6). It is observed from the models that the very high and high suitability zones weremainly located in the S, W, SE, and NE parts of the block. The leastsuitable sites for Tulaipanji rice cultivation are found in the N and SWsegments of the study region.3.3.

The AUC can be categorized intoexcellent (0.9–1), very good (0.8–0.9), good (0.7–0.8), average (0.6–0.7), and poor (0.5–0.6). The ROC curve of the training datasets indicates anAUC of 0.936 for ANN, 0.918 for SVM, and an AUC of 0.895 for theBagging model. The ROC curve indicates the high precision of the pro-duction models. The ANN is the best suitable model for locational anal-ysis of Tulaipanji rice cultivation in the study region.4. Discussion of the resultAccording to the SFM, approximately 41.04 sq. km. (13.60 percent) ofthe total is highly fertile, while 86.96 sq. km. (28.80 percent) ismoderately fertile. Because the soil fertility is quite low, around 52.98 sq.km. of the total area looked to be inappropriate sites, notably in theblock's south, south-west, and northern regions. Based on the ﬁndings, the areas with the best potential for Tulaipanji rice farming are 77.89 sq.km (ANN model), 52.62 sq. km (SVM model), and 80.97 sq. km (Baggingmodel). North-eastern part of Dhankoil G.P., North-western of AnantapurG.P., Southern portion of Radhikapur G.P., Maximum portion of MostafaNagar G.P. are has high potentiality to Tulaipanji farming. Least part ofthe study area experienced a very low to moderate potentiality toTulaipanji cultivation.People who live in alkaline soils are more likely to have zinc shortagesbecause of the inverse pH of the soil available. Some other things thataffect soil fertility are how much sulphur there is in it. Crops that growquickly can take in a lot of sulphur. Potassium treatments to rice ﬁeld soils keep the redox potential of the soil from dropping. They also lowerthe levels of active reducing chemicals and Fe2 þin the soil. Phosphorus (P) is a big problem for tropical rice production because it's hard to ﬁnd.

185Soil PH has a huge effect on the soil and its biological, chemical, andphysical properties. Because of the amount of Organic Carbon (SOC) in the soil, these properties, as well as many others, can be affected. Rice Ntook up more space in the soil when N energy (fertiliser) was injected at a

186depth of 45 cm, which made it more clear (on average 74 per cent).Having too little iron (Fe) makes it hard for plants to do their job ofphotosynthesis, which lowers the amount of dry matter they make. Riceplants' metabolic processes, such as photosynthesis and respiration, areaffected by a lack of copper (Cu). There are 132 crops that can't be grownbecause of a lack of boron in more than 80 countries. The “Bulk Density” of soil is a good way to tell if the soil has been compacted. The bulkdensity of any soil is affected by its texture and the amount of SOC it has

187in it. Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) controls how much nutrients thesoil can hold, as well as how often nitrogen (N) and potassium fertilisersare applied. In a satellite image, the Normalized Difference Water Index(NDWI) is used to emphasise open water features, enabling them to“stand out”against the land and vegetation. The NDWI is quick enough toget information on soil moisture in any area, and it has a reliable methodfor mapping dry land and water. Elevation is very important to thegrowth of Tulaipanji. For Tulaipanji farming, areas with high elevations(33 m–38 m) are better. The highland crops may not be as affected by theﬂood. The slope of the land is an important part of farming. It's best tohave a slope of 3/C14for Tulaipanji farming. When Tulaipanji was grownafter the Monsoon season, it was done. When there is too much rain,Tulaipanji can't grow.Monoculture and short rotations increase crop species-speci fic weed, pest, and disease pressure, increasing the need for synthetic chemicalpesticides, pesticide residues in crops. Consumers believe organicfarming is more sustainable, and that it bene ﬁts the environment, biodiversity, and food quality and safety. The combined application offertilisers and growth regulators can provide another option for miti-gating the negative effects of water logging in crops, with the fertilisersacting as a nutrient supply and the PGRs assisting with physiologicalinjury repair. Increased speciﬁcity of interactions between differentmanagement strategies and the environment (soil types, intensity ofwater logging, etc.) as well as between management practises. In general,all kharif crops in India are cultivated in rainfed circumstances with littleirrigation. To sustain Tulaipanji farming, irrigation systems need beinstalled in the Study area.Table 3AHP rating Scale and Random Index (RI) to formation of the Pair-wise com-parison matrix.

1885. ConclusionPopulation growth is exponential, yet land is a limited and preciousresource on our blue planet. Thus, it is critical to utilize that ﬁxed resource sustainably in order to meet rising food demand withoutdamaging the land with improper land practices. To reduce the unde-sirable impact of environmental features on agricultural productivity andon land, land suitability analysis is theﬁrst and foremost step for envi- ronmental management and sustainable agriculture. Land suitability as-sessments not only aid in increasing crop yields but also in maintaininghealthy soil conditions for bountiful output. The present study employsAHP, GIS, and machine learning approaches to determine the soil fertilityand suitability of land for Tulaipanji rice cultivation in eastern India'ssemi-humid climatic zone. According to the ﬁnal soil fertility map, 18.01% of the land is in excellent condition for agricultural production.The generated models were validated using the receiver operatingcharacteristic (ROC) curve. Although the AUC values for the ANN(0.936), SVM (0.918), and Bagging (0.895) models are satisfactory, theANN model is regarded as the bestﬁt for mapping site suitability for Tulaipanji rice cultivation in the research region. The results of the landcapability assessment using the machine learning SVM model indicatedthat 17.43% (52.62 sq. km) of this block is quite excellent for Tulaipanjicultivation. About 26.82% area is in excellent condition for Tulaipanjicultivation as per the Bagging model. The ANN-based ﬁndings indicate that areas with a proportion of 25.8% (77.89 sq. km) are highly suitable,those with a proportion of 19.84 (59.90 sq. km) are moderately suitable,and those with a proportion of 11.16% (33.69 sq. km) are least or notsuitable for Tulaipanji rice farming. The study results may add knowl-edge to our current understanding and provide light on scienti ﬁc land use for sustainable agriculture and environmental management.Compliance with ethical standardsThe authors hereby declare that there is no con ﬂict of interest and no human or animal involved or harmed in any way during this researchwork.
