Abstract 
The appropriate estimation method plays a significant role in different kinds of teaching process. In order to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional teaching estimation methods, an integrative evaluating model, which is based on the fuzzy logic, is proposed to deal with the evaluating process with multiple variables in this paper. The design process of constructing the model based on the fuzzy logic is discussed in detail. A satisfactory estimating result has been obtained on the basis of the practical data. The evaluating effect shows that the fuzzy estimating model is effective in processing the multi-variable plant.

1. Introduction The teaching quality is very important for different levels and different kinds of teaching process, including both fulltime and extracurricular ones. A proper evaluating method of the teaching quality is quite significative for improving the teachers’ teaching and students’ learning enthusiasm. Nevertheless, there are no appropriate, objective, and comprehensive estimati ng methods in practice. In essence, there exists an

urgent requirement of setting up an effective estimating model for a specific teaching process. In this paper, we will make our efforts to provide a satisfactory solution.  There are plenty of estimating models of teaching quality at present, still there are some disadvantages in the practical application. From this point of view, we make a tr y to construct a practical evaluating model of the teaching quality so as to estimate the multi-variable process by means of the comprehensive evaluating method based on the fuzzy reasoning. 2. Fundamentals of Fuzzy Reasoning Fuzzy logic was first proposed by Prof. L. A. Zadeh of the University of California at Berkeley in 1965. After that, the fuzzy controller was first implemented by Mamd ani on a steam engine in 1974 [1, 2]. In the following years, fuzzy logic has come into wide uses in many successful applications and has obtained significant achievements. Fuzzy Reasoning (FR) uses linguistic information to denote and process the relevant variables without the requirement for the mathematical model of the object, and it is able to adjust the parameters to adapt to the change of the system in-line, and possesses such advantages as ro bustness, universal approximation theorem, model-free, and rule-based algorithm, etc. Fuzzy logic is able to  process incomplete data and provides approximate solutions to problems [3, 4].  In addition to the automatic control field, research and development is also continuing on fuzzy applications in software design, including fuzzy expert systems and integration of fuzzy logic with neural network [5-7].  Fuzzy set theory defines fuzzy operators on fuzzy sets. Fuzzy logic usually utilizes IF-THEN rules, or constructs that are equivalent, such as fuzzy associative matrices. Fuzzy rules are usually expressed in the form [8]: IF variable IS property THEN action.There are also other operators, called hedges that can be applied. Usually these are such adverbs as very, or somewhat, which modify the meaning of a set using a mathematical formula [9]. 3. Design Process 3.1. Description of Algorithm In constructing the estimating model of the teaching quality, the first thing is to define the estimation index setU, the level set V, and the weights of the estimation index, the membership can be confirmed according to the maximum membership principle in the comprehensive evaluation [10-12]. U = {Teaching attitude, Teaching content, Teaching method, Teaching effect} V = {Very good, Better, ordinary, Worse, Bad} Here we utilize the sum-product method to compute the eigenvector of every evaluation index. The concrete computing procedure is as follow: (1) Normalize the elements in the judgment matrix, and the ordinary element is

So the elements of the weights set can be calculated as follows

And the corresponding weight set is ) 3 . 0 , 1 . 0 , 4 . 0 , 2 . 0 ( R. Below is a questionnaire of 100 students for a specific teacher.

Thus we can get U 1= (0.11, 0.23, 0.36, 0.2, 0.1), U 2= (0.1, 0.4, 0.34, 0.14, 0.2), U 3= (0.01, 0.4, 0.44, 0.12, 0.03), U

So we can obtain the following result according to the weighted mean model:

And the final result is  06 . 0 15 . 0 33 . 0 24 . 0 12 . 0 B . According to the principle of the maximum memb ership, we can see that the ratio of “better” is higher, thus the teaching quality of the teacher is ranked to be a better level.  4. Conclusion The evaluation of the teaching quality is very important for a particular teacher, which is a typical multi-variable process, and there are lots of evaluation me thods in the practical application. In this paper, a fuzzy integrative estimating model is proposed to get a reasonable evaluation result so as to overcome the disadvantages of the common estimating methods. By means of selecting the sum-product method to compute the eigenvector of every evaluation index, a proper estimating result has been obtained according to the fuzzy estimating model and the corresponding standardization procedure, which is on the basis of the practical application data. The overall results show that the fuzzy estimating model is quite effective for the multi-variable process. References [1] L.A. Zadeh. Fuzzy sets, Information and Control 1965; 8(3): 338-353.
