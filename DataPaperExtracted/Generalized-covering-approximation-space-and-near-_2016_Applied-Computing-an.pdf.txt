Rough set theory, a mathematical tool to deal with inexact or uncertain knowledgein information systems, has originally described the indiscernibility of elements byequivalence relations. Covering rough sets[1–9,11,12]is a natural extension of clas- sical rough sets by relaxing the partitions arising from equivalence relations to cov-erings. In our work[6], we have introduced a framework to generalize coveringapproximation space that was introduced by Zhu[11]. In fact, we have introduced the generalized covering approximation spaceG
n–CASas a generalization to rough set theory and covering approximation space. TheG
n–CASis deﬁned by the triple hU;R;C
ni, whereU–;be a ﬁnite set,Rbe a binary relation onUandC nben-cover ofUassociated toR, wheren2fr;lg(for more details see[6]).
The main works in this paper are divided into three parts. In the beginning ofwork, we introduce some new generalized deﬁnitions to rough membership rela-tions (resp. functions) and new types of fuzzy sets inG
n–CAS. Second part aims to introduce one of an important topological concepts which are called ‘‘near con-cepts’’ in rough context (specially, inG
n–CAS). In fact, we apply near concepts inG
n–CASto deﬁne different tools for modifying the original operations. The sug-gested methods in this paper represent easy mathematical tools to approximate therough sets and removing the uncertainty (vagueness) of sets. In addition, compar-isons between the suggested methods are obtained and many examples (resp.counter examples) to illustrate these connections are provided. Hence, we cansay that our approaches are very useful in rough context namely, in informationanalysis and in decision making. Finally, in the end of paper, simple practicalexamples are provided to illustrate the suggested methods and to show the impor-tance of these methods in rough context namely in information system and inmulti-valued information system. In addition, we give some comparisons betweenour approaches and others approaches such as Pawlak and Lin approaches.
2.j-Rough membership relations,j-rough membership functions andj-fuzzy sets
The present section is devoted to introduce new deﬁnitions for rough membershiprelations and functions as easy tools to classify the sets and help for measuringexactness and roughness of sets. These rough membership functions allow us todeﬁne four different fuzzy sets inG
n–CAS. Moreover, the suggested rough mem-bership relations (resp. functions) are more accurate than classical rough member-ship function that was given by Lin[10]and the other types.
Deﬁnition 2.1.LethU;R;C nibe aG n–CAS, andA#U. Then we say that:
(i)xis ‘‘j-surely’’ belongs toA, writtenx 2jA,i fx2 RjAðÞ. (ii)xis ‘‘j-possibly’’ belongs toX, writtenx
/C222jA,i fx2 RjðAÞ.52 M.E. Abd El-Monsef et al.These two rough membership relations are called ‘‘ j-strong’’ and ‘‘j-weak’’ membership relations respectively.

One of the key issues in all fuzzy sets is how to determine fuzzy membershipfunctions. A membership functions provides a measure of the degree of similarityof element to fuzzy set. The following deﬁnition uses the j-rough membership functionsl

3. Near rough concepts in the generalized covering approximation space G nCAS
The main goal of this section is to introduce one of the important topologicalapplications which are named ‘‘near concepts’’ inG
n–CAS. Moreover, we intro- duce the new concepts ‘‘j-near approximations’’ (resp.j-near boundary regions andj-near accuracy measures) to generalize thej-approximations (resp.j- boundary regions andj-accuracy measures). In addition, we introduce near exact-ness and near roughness by applying near concepts to make more accuracy fordeﬁnability of sets inG
n–CAS.
Deﬁnition 3.1.LethU;R;C nibe aG n–CAS, andA#U. Thus we deﬁne ‘‘near rough’’ sets inUas follows: For eachj2r;l;i;ufg
, the subsetAis called

R¼a;a ðÞ;a;b ðÞ;f b;aðÞ;b;b ðÞ;c;a ðÞ;c;b ðÞ;c;c ðÞ;c;d ðÞ;d;d ðÞ g:
We will show the above remark in case ofj¼rand the other cases similarly asfollows:
NraðÞ ¼a;bfg¼N rbðÞ;N rcðÞ ¼U;N rdðÞ ¼dfg :
Thus, we compute thej-near rough sets forj¼ras follows:The family ofr-pre rough sets is:P

Deﬁnition 3.2.LethU;R;C nibe aG n–CAS, andA#U. Then we deﬁne thej-near approximations of any subsetAas follows: For eachj2r;l;i;ufg

Deﬁnition 3.3.LethU;R;C nibe aG n–CAS, andA#U. Then we deﬁne thej-near boundary,j-near positive andj-near negative regions ofAare deﬁned respectively as follows:

Deﬁnition 3.5.LethU;R;C nibe aG n–CAS, andA#U. Then, for each j2r;l;i;ufg

Remark 3.2.In theG n–CAS;hU;R;C ni, we can compute thej-near approxima- tions of any subsetA#U, directly by using thej-approximations, as the followinglemma illustrates.

5. Illustrative examples
The main goal of this section is to introduce two practical examples in order toillustrate the importance of applying near concept in rough context. In the ﬁrstexample we use an equivalence relation that induced from an information systemand hence we compare between our approaches and Pawlak approach. In the sec-ond example, we apply our approaches in a multi-valued information system(MVIS)[14]. This type of information system is generalization to information sys-tem which uses an arbitrary binary relation and thus Pawlak approach does not ﬁtin this type. Lin[10]introduced general rough membership function depending onan arbitrary binary relation, these rough membership function coincide with our j- rough membership function in the case ofj¼ronly. But, the other typesjof ourj- rough membership functions are more accurate than j¼r, so we can see that our approaches are the appropriate tools for these types and very useful in informationanalysis. Finally, in the second example we introduce a comparison between ourapproaches and Lin method.
Example 5.1.Consider the following information system as in Table 5.1that represents the data about 6 students, as shown below.FromTable 5.1, we have.The set of universe:U¼f1;2;3;4;5;6g,Generalized covering approximation space and near concepts 65The set of attributes:AT¼Analysis;Algebra;Statisticsfg¼ C[Decisionfg¼D,The sets of values:V
Analysis ¼fBad;Goodg;V Algebra ¼fBad;Goodg, V
Statistics ¼fBad;Medium;GoodgandV Decision ¼fAccept;Rejectg. But we take the set of condition attributes, C¼Analysis;Algebra;f Statisticsg.Thus we have:U=C¼1fg
;2;5fg ;3fg ;4fg ;6fgfg and the set ofr-pre rough set is
PrUðÞ ¼}U ðÞ ðset of all subsets in UÞ:
Suppose thatXDecision:Accept ðÞ ¼ f1;2;3;6g. Thus we compute the roughmembership function with respect to Pawlak[13,14]and with respect to our approaches as follows:Pawlak Deﬁnition[13,14](rough membership function):
Forx¼1, thenlCX1ðÞ ¼f1g\Xjjf1gjj¼1. Forx¼3, thenlCX3ðÞ ¼f3g\Xjjf3gjj¼1.
Forx¼2, thenlCX2ðÞ ¼f2;5g\Xjjf2;5gjj¼12. Forx¼6, thenlCX6ðÞ ¼f6g\Xjjf6gjj¼1.
Our Deﬁnition (r-pre rough membership function):

Moreover, for some elements that has decision (Reject) such that 5 we get:In Pawlak:l
CX5ðÞ ¼2;5fg \ Xjj2;5fgjj¼12, that is 5 may be belongs to the setXDecision:Accept
ðÞ,X¼f1;2;3;6gand this contradicts toTable 5.1.But in our deﬁnition: we have W

Xð5Þ¼f5g\Ajjf5gjj¼0;f5;6g\Ajjf5;6gjj¼12;...no)lpr
X5ðÞ ¼0.This means that 5 does not belongs to the setXDecision:Accept
ðÞ ¼ f1;2;3;6g which is coincide withTable 5.1. Hence, our approaches are more accurate thanPawlak deﬁnition.
Example 5.2.Consider the following multi-valued information system ( MVIS)a s inTable 5.2. Suppose we are given data about 5 persons, as shown below.WhereR
1¼Languages¼fEnglish;German;Arabicg,R 2¼Sports¼ Handball;Basketball;Tennisfg
andR 3¼Skills¼ fSwimming;Running;Fishinggsuch thatxR

aR1¼a;bfg ;bR 1¼bfg ;cR 1¼b;c;dfg ;dR 1¼dfg ;eR 1¼d;efg ;
aR2¼a;b;cfg ;bR 2¼a;b;cfg ;cR 2¼cfg ;dR 2¼c;dfg ;eR 2¼efg and
aR3¼a;bfg ;bR 3¼a;bfg ;cR 3¼c;dfg ;dR 3¼dfg ;eR 3¼d;efg :
In order to represent the set of all condition attributes, we generate the followingrelation from all above relations as follows:xR¼T3n¼1xR n. Thus we get aR¼a;bfg
;bR¼bfg ;cR¼c;dfg ;dR¼dfg ;eR¼efg . Clearly, this relation is symmetry relation (reﬂexive and symmetric) but is nottransitive and thus it is not equivalence relation. Hence, Pawlak approach does notﬁt in this case, so we use Lin deﬁnition and our approaches as follows:

It is clear that Lin rough membership function is the same as r-rough member- ship function. Moreover, our approachesl-rough (resp.i-rough) membership function is more accurate thanr-rough membership function and Lin rough mem-bership function. Finally, we can also applyj-near rough membership function asinExample 5.1.68 M.E. Abd El-Monsef et al.6. Conclusions and future works
In this work, we introduced one of an important topological application thatnamed ‘‘near concepts’’ in rough context. Accordingly, different types of approx-imations (resp. rough membership relations and functions) were provided to beeasy mathematical tools to classify the sets and help for measuring exactnessand roughness of sets. These tools are more accurate than other types that weredeﬁned by others authors. Consequently, our approaches are very interesting indecision making. We believe that these structures are useful in the applicationsand thus these techniques open the way for more topological applications in roughcontext and help in formalizing many applications from real-life data. In ourfuture works, we will apply the suggested methods in this paper in real life appli-cations and problems.
