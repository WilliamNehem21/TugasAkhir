In this study, a combination of LCA and Data EnvelopmentAnalysis (DEA) was applied in order to improve the energy ef ﬁciency and reduce the environmental burdens of rainbow trout farm in Ardal and Lordegan regions located in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province of Iran. The re-quired data were collected from 60 rainbow trout farms in Ardal region and 38 rainbow trout farms in Lordeganregion through face-to-face questionnaire method. In Ardal region, total energy inputs, rainbow trout yield andEnergy Ratio (ER) were estimated as 60,483.50 MJ ton

−1, 210.50 kg ha−1and 0.33, respectively. The results of LCA revealed that rainbow trout production in Ardal region had lower environmental burdensthan Lordegan region in all impact categories. Accordingly, Environmental Emissions Final Score (EEFS) inArdal and Lordegan regions were 1638.88 and 3484.31 ppt ton

The DEA results showed that in Ardal and Lordegan regions about 29.28% and 9.59% of the total energycan be saved without reducing the yield, respectively. The highest potential for saving energy was related tofeed in both Ardal (24.74%) and Lordegan (9.12%) regions. The results of LCA coupled with DEA also revealedthat there is a higher potential for reduction of environmental impacts in Ardal region compare to Lordegan re-gion. Accordingly, the EEFS value in Ardal and Lordegan regions were reduced by 27.34% and 8.85%, respectively.Generally, rainbow trout production in Ardal region had higher energy ef ﬁciency, lower environmental burdens and also higher potential to improve energy consumption and reduce the environmental impacts compared toLordegan region.Keywords:Life cycle assessmentEnergy ratioData envelopment analysisRainbow trout
1. IntroductionGlobally, aquaculture is an important economic activity which playsa role in improving feeding and economic development in developingcountries such as Iran (Cacho, 1990). Among aquatic animals,ﬁsh pro- vides about 20% of total animal protein and has high quality protein,fat, and high amounts of vitamins and minerals ( Bureau et al., 2002). Ac- cording to reports byFAO (2018),t o t a lﬁsheries and aquaculture pro- duction was about 171 million tons in 2016. The shares of ﬁsheries and aquaculture were about 47% (80 million tons) and 53%(91 million tons), respectively. Additionally, FAO (2018)reported Iran as the largest producer of troutﬁsh species, producing 167,830 tons ofrainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss). In Iran, about 40% of rainbowtroutﬁsh has been produced in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari (22,803tons), Lorestan (22,106 tons) and Kohgiluyeh-o-Boyer-Ahmad (19,500tons) provinces (Anonymous, 2018).Limitations inﬁshing and lack of access to the some potential waterresources resulted in the maximum utilization of available resources inaquaculture (Aubin et al., 2006). However, higher utilization of non-renewable resources could reduce energy ef ﬁciency and lead to further environmental problems. Any measure for managing and reducing en-ergy consumption of inputs such as chemical fertilizers, agricultural ma-chineries, labor, water, electricity and other inputs to improve energyefﬁciency is the energy saving which is one of the easiest and theArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 2 (2019) 13 –27

Also, improve-ment of the energy efﬁciency by energy saving would lead to a reduc-tion in production costs which is very important to consumers. Forthese reasons, improvement of energy ef ﬁciency has been included in the strategy of production (Schnapp, 2012). Increase in energy efﬁciency could be achieved by using methodslike data envelopment analysis (DEA). The ﬁrst DEA model was intro- duced byCharnes et al. (1978). DEA is a nonparametric method and iscommonly used to estimate energy efﬁciency and environmental issues based on decision making units (DMUs) ( Zhou et al., 2008). This method is a data-driven frontier analysis technique that considers apiecewise linear surface to rest on top of the observations as ef ﬁcient frontier (Adler et al., 2002). Unlike the parametric methods, DEA doesnot require a function to relate inputs to outputs ( Seiford and Thrall, 1990). There is difference between DEA and evolutionary algorithmssuch as genetic algorithm. DEA approach is not capable of calculatingglobal optimum values. In DEA approach, the optimum values are deter-mined on the basis of production units under consideration and in thisway global optimum values are not calculated. In the other words, theobjective of a DEA study is to select the DMU which is most ef ﬁcient DMU compared to all DMUs under consideration ( Shamshirband et al., 2015). However, genetic algorithm does not always ensure that alwaysan optimal result.In the other hand, the environmental problems could be assessed byLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. LCA is a standard, organized andcomprehensive method to assess the environmental impacts relatedto a product or process throughout its life cycle ( ISO 14040, 2006; Shahvarooghi Farahani and Asoodar, 2017 ). Recently, LCA has been a common tool to evaluate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a widerange of the environmental impacts of agricultural systems ( Goglio et al., 2015). Therefore, combination of LCA and DEA, known as LCA+ DEA methodology, has been introduced as a valuable method thatavoids concerns related to standard deviation ( Iribarren et al., 2010). In recent years, different researchers have indicated that the LCA+DEA methodology led to optimal use of the inputs in agricultural sys-tems in order to reduce energy consumption and environmental im-pacts without a reduction in output. For instance, Mohseni et al. (2018)conducted a study in Arak county of Iran, in which 58 grape pro-ducers were analyzed by LCA + DEA methodology. They reported that arange of 0.25 to 18% reduction among environmental impact categorieswas observed.Mohammadi et al. (2013)used a combination of LCA and DEA to assess the eco-efﬁciency of 94 soybean producers in Iran. Theirresults indicated that LCA + DEA methodology reduced the averageglobal warming by 11%.Nabavi-Pelesaraei et al. (2017)conducted a study using LCA + DEA methodology to assess the levels of operationalefﬁciency of 240 paddy farms. They indicated that global warming couldbe reduced by 24% only if farmers operate based on the recommended98 efﬁcient frontier values recommended by LCA + DEA. Increasing en-ergy efﬁciency and reducing environmental impacts of production sys-tems in order to achieve sustainable development goals is necessary andthe combined application of LCA and DEA could be a sensible option toassess production systems and provide suggestions to decrease energyconsumption (Khoshnevisan et al., 2015). In the present study, LCA wa
 s used as a tool for analyzing environmental burdens and DEAallowed to optimize the inputs and consequently reduce the environ-mental burdens.Although, there are several studies in the literature which have in-vestigated environmental impacts ofﬁsh farms (Aubin et al. (2006); Bozoglu and Ceyhan (2009);Ayer and Tyedmers (2009);Aubin et al. (2009);Vázquez-Rowe et al. (2011);Samuel-Fitwi et al. (2013);Efole Ewoukem et al. (2012);Chen et al. (2015);Medeiros et al.

The main objectives of this study are asfollows:(1) Energyﬂow analysis of trout production;(2) Assessment and analysis of environmental impacts of trout pro-duction by LCA;(3) Evaluation of energy efﬁciency and identiﬁcation of inefﬁciency reasons of the energy in trout farms by DEA;(4) Provide the improved pattern to reduce energy consumption introut farms based on efﬁcient units which are introduced byDEA;(5) A coupled LCA + DEA approach to reduce environmental bur-dens through the improved energy consumption pattern.2. Materials and methods2.1. Site of study and data collectionArea of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province area has been esti-mated as 16,421 km

This province is2153 m above the sea level located at 31° 9 ′to 32° 38´ North latitude and 49° 30′to 51° 26′East longitude and has the largest share of Iran'swater resources (about 10%) (Fig. 1)(Anonymous, 2016). Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province has 404 trout farms and known as one of themost important region of rainbow trout production in the world.Ardal and Lordegan regions located at Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari prov-ince have 113 and 72 trout farms, respectively, the highest share of theprovince trout farms (45% of total trout breeding of the province)(Anonymous, 2017).Considering the number of trout farms in Ardal and Lordegan re-gions, simple random sampling was used and the size of sample was cal-culated using Cochran's formula (Eq.

Elhami et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 2 (2019) 13 –27According to Cochran's formula, the sample size for Ardal andLordegan regions were calculated as 60 and 38 farms, respectively.Thus, 60 and 38 trout farms were selected randomly from Ardal andLordegan regions, respectively. The required data were collected basedon one ton rainbow trout using face-to-face questionnaire method.This method is conducted by an interviewer asking questions of a re-spondent in person. Also, this tool was found useful to gather contextualinsights, especially when key organization representatives wereinterviewed (e.g. farmers union, local authorities and communitygroups). The required data includes fry, electricity, diesel fuel, naturalgas, water,ﬁsh feed (ﬁsh meal,ﬁsh oil, wheat gluten, corn gluten, rape-seed meal, soybean meal, sweat sorghum and bean powder), labor andtransportation. A brief summary of sample questionnaire is provided inTable 2.2.2. Energy balance evaluationTo analyze energyﬂow and optimize energy consumption in a pro-duction system, it is necessary to calculate the input –output energies in theﬁrst step. Then, energy equivalents are used for transforming allinputs and outputs to their energy equivalent ( Mousavi-Avval et al., 2011a). The average of the consumed inputs (per ton of trout) and theyield for the two studied regions is shown in Table 3. The input andoutput energies were calculated by multiplying the quantities of the in-puts and output by their energy equivalents. According to the input en-ergy, the quantity of the yield and the output energy, the energy indiceswere calculated using the following equations ( Elhami et al., 2016; Fathollahi et al., 2018):Energy Ratio ERðÞ ¼

Therefore, it seems to be nec-essary to use other scientiﬁc methods such as DEA to evaluate the efﬁ- ciency and sustainability of the systems ( Houshyar et al., 2012).2.3. Life cycle assessmentLCA approach follows the instructions provided by ISO 14040 (2006) andISO 14044 (2006). LCA allows identifying all the energy inputs, nat-ural resources and the environmental burdens related to production,transportation, utilization and disposal of a product ( Guinée et al., 2011). A LCA study consists of four main stages including de ﬁnition of goal and scope (system boundaries, functional unit, ﬁnal product and assumptions), inventory analysis, impact assessment and interpretation(Fig. 2). Combination of different stages of LCA and DEA is explained inthe following sections.2.3.1. Goal and scope deﬁnitionGenerally, in a LCA study, explicit expression of study goals repre-sents how a study is carried out. LCA must be de ﬁned based on desired applications (ISO 14040, 2006). The aim of this study is to evaluate theactual and improved environmental impacts of trout farms. In thestudy scope deﬁnition, functional unit (FU) and system boundariesshould be clearly deﬁned. In this study, the FU which is deﬁned as a brief description of the production process ( Rebitzer et al., 2004)c o n - sidered as one ton of produced trout. LCA is a “cradle to the grave”ap- proach but it is possible to deﬁne the system boundaries in a way inwhich only a part of the production system is considered and the resultsare reported based on the system boundaries ( Khoshnevisan et al., 2013). This study focused on the stages from the cradle (production ofthe inputs) to the pond gate (trout production) ( Fig. 3).2.3.2. Life cycle inventory (LCI)The LCI represents a detailed compilation of the inputs (energy andmaterials) and outputs (product and emissions to water, soil and air).Data related to the foreground system (trout farm practices) were col-lected using face-to-face questionnaire ( Table 3) and data from the background system (production of inputs) were taken from theEcoinvent database and the previous studies ( Table 4)(EPA, 1998; Nemecek and Kagi, 2007;Mousavi-Avval et al., 2017;Bureau et al., 2002). To calculate the emissions from the inputs, the quantities of theinputs and outputs were entered into SimaPro software. The Ecoinventdatabase consists of the emissions (into water, air and soil) from differ-ent production stages of different products and is de ﬁned for most countries in the world. This database also could be used for LCA studiesin Iran (Khoshnevisan et al., 2014a;Mousavi-Avval et al., 2017). Elec- tricity was used for water pumps and aeration system. ConsideringthatN98% of electricity in Iran generated by natural gas (94.4%) and hy-d
ropower (4.9%) and other energy resources generate limited and var-iable amounts of electricity (Anonymous, 2012), it was assumed that all amounts of electricity is generated by natural gas and hydropower.Inventory data for the production of electricity from natural gas and hy-dropower at reservoir were taken from Ecoinvent database.

The emission from diesel fuelcombustion, natural gas burning and carbon dioxide emitted duringlabor activities considered as the direct emissions and their emissionscoefﬁcients are shown inTable 4.Emissions from nutrients to local environments associated with ﬁsh growth were estimated by using nutrient-balance modeling ( Cho and Kaushik, 1990). This method has been adapted and validated for model-ing rainbow trout (Bureau et al., 2002), and it has been previously used for establishing an emissions inventory of rainbow trout ( Papatryphon et al., 2004). The N, P and solids emissions was calculated based onthe difference between the amount of nutrients provided to trout andthe amount assimilated asﬁsh weight-gain. Solid and dissolved frac-tions of emitted N and P was calculated based on digestibility of the nu-trients,ﬁsh body-composition, and the non-ingested part of theprovided feed (estimated at 5% based on the expert opinion). The nutri-ents release and theoretical oxygen demand (calculated using thechemical oxygen demand of protein, carbohydrates, lipids, ash andﬁber emitted) per ton of trout is shown in section of the results.2.3.3. Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA)It is impossible to evaluate and compare the emissions from each theinputs without categorizing the emissions. So, the results from LCI werecategorized in the different environmental impact categories ( ISO 14040, 2006). There are different methods to deﬁne the environmental impact categories. In this study, CML2 baseline 2000 was considered forcategorizing. Ten impact categories based on CML2 baseline 2000 in-clude Abiotic Depletion (AD), Acidiﬁcation (AC), Global Warming (GW), Eutrophication (EU), Ozone Layer Depletion (OLD), Human Tox-icity (HT), Freshwater Aquatic Ecotoxicity (FAE), Marine AquaticEcotoxicity (MAE), Terrestrial Ecotoxicity (TE) and Photochemical Oxi-dation (PhO). (Anonymous, 2003). These categories have differentunits and it is impossible to compare them to each other. Therefore, nor-malization was used to make the categories non-dimensional(Mousavi-Avval et al., 2017). For this purpose, SimaPro softwarewhich has the coefﬁcients for normalization was used.2.3.4. Interpretation of the resultsIn interpretation phase, the results obtained from the precedingphases of the LCA are interpreted. Normalization and weighting areoptional steps used to solve the incompatibility of units and to sim-plify the interpretation of the results. Normalization allows to betterunderstanding the contributions of impact categories to the globalenvironmental effects. Therefore, in order to development a rela-tionship between normalization and weighting, EnvironmentalEmissions Final Score (EEFS) was introduced as following eq. 5 (Brentrup et al., 2004):EEFS¼XN
i/C2W i ð5ÞwhereN
istands for the normalized amount of each category and W i
is the weight of the normalized amounts of each category. The coef-ﬁcients for weighting were taken from Simapro software V.8.0.3.2.4. Data envelopment analysisAccording toTable 3, the amounts of inputs and output in troutfarms were different from each other in the both regions and a highstandard deviation was observed. This means that there are high po-tential to improve the inputs, increase the energy ef ﬁciency and re- duce the environmental impacts by using combination of LCA andDEA. Generally, DEA is a data mining method to estimate productiv-ity of the inputs and rank the production units based on their perfor-mance. In DEA, each production unit is known as a decision making

Fig. 4.A scheme of DEA efﬁcient frontier for 2 inputs and 1 output with 6 DMUs.18 B. Elhami et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 2 (2019) 13 –27unit (DMU). The distance between each DMU and the productionfrontier refers to this fact that there is the possibility for improve-ment of energy efﬁciency in that DMU. InFig. 4,A ,B ,a n dCa r e shown as the efﬁcient frontiers, whereas D, E, F and their combina-tions are inefﬁcient (Stokes et al., 2007). In DEA model, an inefﬁcient DMU can become efﬁcient through reducing the quantities of the inputs without a reduction in the out-put (input-based model), or through increase in the quantity of out-put while the quantities of the inputs is kept the same as before(output-based model) (Mousavi-Avval et al., 2011a). Considering that the quantities of the inputs are controlled by trout producersand different factors affecting the output, input-based model was se-lected for this study. DEA based on constant returns to scale (CRS)and variable returns to scale (VRS) models is expressed by technicalefﬁciency (TEf), pure technical efﬁciency (PTE) and scale efﬁciency (SEf).2.4.1. Technical efﬁciencyTechnical efﬁciency (TEf) is deﬁned as the ratio between the sumof weighted outputs to the sum of weighted inputs that is shown inEq.(6). The value of TEf varies between zero and one in which thevalue of one represents that the DMU is a best performer locatedon the production frontier and has no potential for improvement. ATEf value less than one means that DMU is inef ﬁcient (Mousavi- Avval et al., 2011b).TE

The above model is known as the CRSmodel which is a linear programming model. This model assumes thatthere is no signiﬁcant relationship between the scale of productionunits and efﬁciency (Avkiran, 2001). Therefore, the large units are con-sidered as efﬁcient as small ones in converting inputs to output.2.4.2. Pure technical efﬁciencyWhen variable returns to scale (VRS) model introduced by Banker,Charnes & Cooper is used, PTE is considered to score and rank DMUs(Banker et al., 1984). In other words, PTE is TEf which is affected bythe variation in scale efﬁciency. PTE compares efﬁcient and inefﬁcient DMUs in the same environment and geographical conditions and it isits advantage in comparison with TEf (Barnes, 2006 ). This model is cal- culated on the basis of the following equation ( Mohammadi et al., 2013):Max z¼uyj−u j ð9ÞSubject to:vX

CRS model cal- culates TEf and SEf while VRS model only considers PTE. In this study,ﬁrst, the values for TEf and PTE were calculated for CRS and VRS models,respectively. Then, SEf was calculated using the following equation(Chauhan et al., 2006):SEf¼

Elhami et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 2 (2019) 13 –27In order to detect the most efﬁcient DMUs, they should be ranked ac-cording to their importance based on the ef ﬁcient frontier. The bench- mark ranking method as the most common technique in DEA studieswas used in the present study. The number of times each ef ﬁcient DMU is observed in a referent set given by software show how similarthe efﬁcient DMUs are in comparison with inefﬁcient DMUs. Efﬁcient DMUs that appear more frequently in the referent set are considered su-perior and achieve a higher rank (Khoshnevisan et al., 2014b).2.5. LCA+ DEAIn this study, the aim is to improve the inputs to conserve the energyresources and reduce the environmental burdens of trout farms withoutas i g n iﬁcant reduction in the output. To achieve this goal, ﬁrst, the data was stored into Excel spreadsheets. EMS V1.3 software was used tocompute the improvements potential for each input. Hence, the PTEwas calculated for each DMU, and all DMUs were benchmarked basedon the Eq.(9). Then, SimaPro software was used to evaluate the envi-ronmental burdens of the trout farms based on both the actual dataand the data modiﬁed by DEA (According toFig. 2). Finally, efﬁcient and inefﬁcient DMUs were speciﬁed and the quantities of the input en-ergies and the environmental burdens of the two regions were calcu-lated based on both the actual data and the data modi ﬁed by DEA.3. Results and discussions3.1. Input-output energy analysisIt is necessary in trout farms to know about the importance of eachfactor in the production process and their in ﬂuence on the output. Al- though, there are many unpredictable natural and climate factors affect-ing the production process and the output, but, the factors like thequantities of the inputs could be controlled by the producers and theirquantities could be decided based on their in ﬂuence on the performance.The average of the input energies needed for producing one ton oftrout in a 8 to 10 months breeding period are brought in Table 5.I t should be mentioned that the size of the farms was less than a hectareand differences between the farms size seemed to be negligible.Therefore, it was decided to consider a ton as the FU for calculations.According toTable 5, the total energy inputs in Ardal andLordegan regions were obtained as 60,438.50 MJ ton
−1and 77,183.63 MJ ton
−1, respectively. In a previous study,Bozoglu and Ceyhan (2009)reported the total energy use per cubic meter was46.57 MJ in Turkey's trout farms.To compare the two regions from an energy ef ﬁciency point of view, the energy indices were used.

Fig. 6.Distribution of trout farms based on the ef ﬁciency score in Ardal region.20 B. Elhami et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 2 (2019) 13 –27the ER and EPr were obtained as 0.33 and 16.40E-06 ton MJ−1,r e - spectively. These indices showed that the energy consumption inArdal region was more efﬁcient. The SE in Ardal region was50,721.48 MJ ton
−1, while in Lordegan region, the SE was obtainedas 60,749.57 MJ ton
−1. According to the results, it is clear thatLordegan region needs more attention to improve the total energyneeded for trout production. The main reason for difference betweenthe energy consumption results between two studied regions couldbe attributed to the quantities and the shares of feed consumption.To produce 1 ton trout in Ardal and Lordegan regions, 2727 and3560 kg of feed were consumed, respectively.Fig. 5shows the shares of the inputs from the total energy inputs inthe studied regions. The share of feed in both region was about 74% ofthe total energy inputs. In both regions, feed consisted of ﬁsh meal, ﬁsh oil, rapeseed meal, wheat gluten, soybean meal, corn gluten,sweet sorghum and bean powders. Fish meal and ﬁsh oil as animal sources had the highest share among the feed ingredients in both re-gions as 63% for Ardal region and 79% for Lordegan region. Therefore,further researches to materialize the use of alternative sources of pro-tein are necessary to replace the standard ﬁshmeal-based feed. This is in agreement with the results ofBozoglu and Ceyhan (2009)who re- ported that the budget of energy for trout farms strongly depends onthe share of consumed feed. Also, electricity had the secondary shareof the total energy inputs in both regions with about 19%. The highshare of electricity used in trout farms in both regions could be attrib-uted to inefﬁcient aeration systems, worn electro pumps and lack ofthe producers awareness of the required ﬂo wa n dv o l u m eo fw a t e r . So, it is suggested that worn and old aeration systems and electropumps be checked and inspected.3.2. DEA for improving the energy inputsIn DEA, DMU being efﬁcient or inefﬁcient depends on the ratio be- tween the output and the inputs compared to other DMUs. As it isshown inFig. 6, 27 of 60 DMUs in Ardal region were identi ﬁed as efﬁ- cient (PTE value as 1) based on VRS model. Also, based on CRS model,14 of 60 DMUs were recognized as efﬁcient with TEf and SEf as 1. All14 efﬁcient DMUs in CRS model are efﬁcient in VRS model, and that is the reason behind the same number of ef ﬁcient DMUs in TE and SEf. It should be mentioned that 13 DMUs difference between TEf and PTEcould be attributed to inappropriate production scale. Also, it worth tomention that TEf scores of 46 DMUs and PTE scores of 33 DMUs werein the range of 0.4 to 0.99.According toFig. 7,2 8o f3 8D M U si nL o r d e g a nr e g i o nh a dP T Es c o r eas 1, and 12 DMUs had full TEf and SEf scores. 26 and 10 DMUs had ef-ﬁciency scores in the ranges of 0.4 to 0.99 for TEf and PTE, respectively. Itshould be noticed that full PTE score doesn't assure full TEf score.The average and standard deviation of TEf, PTE and SEf of the DMUs(trout farms) in the two regions are shown in Table 6.T h ea v e r a g e scores of PTE, TEf and SEf for DMUs in Ardal regions were 0.86, 0.59and 0.66, respectively. In Lordegan region, the average scores of PTE,TEf and SEf for DMUs were calculated as 0.98, 0.69 and 0.70, respec-tively. As it can be seen fromTable 6, the maximum and minimum scores for TEf, PTE and SEf were calculated. The standard deviation ofTEf is higher than PTE which indicates that trout producers have lessawareness of the appropriate breeding methods and the optimalamounts of the inputs. In other words, it indicated that the breedersused the energy inputs more that the optimal amounts or applied inan improper time. The scores of SEf in Ardal (0.66) and Lordegan(0.70) regions revealed that the inefﬁcient DMUs in Ardal and Lordeganregions could increase their efﬁciency by following the suggestionswhich result in optimal scale efﬁciency, up to 24 and 20%, respectively.Abedi et al. (2011)co
nducted a study to optimize the efﬁciency of trout farms in Fars province, Iran and reported the average of TE, PTE and SEfas 0.93, 0.97 and 0.95, respectively.The required energy inputs in the optimal condition, the percentageof the saved energy for each input, the energy indices in the optimalcondition and the percentage of changes for the energy indices areshown inTable 5. As it can be seen fromTable 4, the total required en- ergy inputs in the optimal condition in Ardal and Lordegan regionswere obtained as 42,769.71 MJ ton
−1(29.28% saved energy) and 69,777.69 MJ ton
−1(9.59% saved energy), respectively. It was revealedthat DMUs in Ardal region had higher potential to save energy com-pared to Lordegan region. In Ardal region, electricity (47.16%) and dieselfuel (43.70%) had highest shares of the saved energy, while in Lordeganregion, diesel fuel (21.25%) and water (19.35%) showed the highest po-tential for saving energy. According to Table 4, the EPr in Ardal region after improving the energy inputs increased from 19.72E-06 to23.38E-06 ton MJ
−1(18.56% increase), while in Lordegan region, theEPr increased from 16.40E-06 to 18.20E-06 ton MJ
−1(10.61% increase). In other studies that DEA used to improve the energy inputs of crops inIran, an increase in the EPr was reported for alfalfa from 120.00E-06 to130.00E-06 (10.6%) (Ghasemi Mobtaker et al., 2012), for kiwi from 800.04E-06 to 920.00E-06 (13.86% increase) ( Mohammadi et al., 2011) and for orange from 970.00E-06 to 1110.00E-06 (14.4% increase)

Elhami et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 2 (2019) 13 –27(Nabavi-Pelesaraei et al., 2014). As it is shown inFig. 8, in both regions, ﬁsh feed had the highest share of the total saved energy with 44.85%(Ardal region) and 42.03% (Lordegan region). The suggestions for im-proving feed were provided in the previous section.As it was discussed in the previous section, benchmark rankingmethod is a valuable method to det ect the most appropriate DMUs in the group. The ranking of the 60 DMUs in Ardal region and 38DMUs in Lordegan region are presented in Table 7andTable 8.A si t is shown inTable 7, the DMU 3 with 19 repetitions (see Table 7;F r e - quency in referent set) was obtained as the top ranking in Ardal re-gion. It means that this unit in addition to being ef ﬁcient, is close to input–output levels of the most inefﬁcient units in the group and it was followed by DMU 41 and DMU 57 with 18 and 14 repetitions, re-spectively. The most important conclusion that can be taken fromthese results is that, inefﬁcient DMUs can improve their energy useefﬁciency by following the best practices of the ef ﬁcient DMUs. Itmeans an inefﬁcient DMU can be efﬁcient by following the some ef-ﬁcient DMUs instead of using a single DMU as a benchmark. For ex-ample, DMU 48 as an inefﬁc i e n tu n i tt h a th a dt h el o w e s tP T Ew i t h0.45 should follow the practices of DMU 15, 21 and 29 as compositeDMU which means that DMU 48 is close to the ef ﬁcient frontier formed by these efﬁcient DMUs.As it is shown inTable 8, the DMU 5 with 6 repetitions was obtainedas the top ranking in Lordegan region. To clarify benchmarking, considerDMU 16 with PTE calculated as 0.935. To improve ef ﬁciency score of DMU 16, it should be changed according to a composite DMU. The com-posite DMU that represents the best practice is formed by the combina-tion of DMU 5, DMU 7 and DMU 20. The number in the parenthesesknown as intensity vector indicate that the inputs and output of inef ﬁ- cient DMU 16 is closer to DMU 7 compared to other two farms (DMU5 and 20). Using intensity vectors and composite DMU, the optimumamount of energy for DMU 16 can be worked out.

So, dissemina-tion of these results would be helpful to improve ef ﬁciency in rainbow trout farms in the surveyed regions. For example, in the last column ofTable 7, the Energy Saving Target Ratio (ESTR) percentage for 33 inef ﬁ- cient farms in Ardal region are presented. As it can be seen, for inef ﬁ- cient DMUs, ESTR was varied in the range between 4.59% (DMU 47) to85.60% (DMU 49), with the average of 44.26% that indicate betweeninefﬁcient DMUs, DMU 47 was the best, and DMU 49 was the most inef-ﬁcient unit.3.3. LCA resultsThe contributions of the inputs to each impact category for trout pro-duction in the regions are shown inFigs. 9 and 10. The emissions from electricity generation in power plants had a contribution of 29% on theMAE in both regions. In Ardal region, the ﬁsh meal had the share of 75%, 72%, 72%, 63% and 42% on the AD, AC, GW, Pho and EP, respectively,while in Lordegan region, theﬁsh meal had the share of 82%, 81%, 78%,44% and 55% on the AD, AC, GW, Pho and EP, respectively.

Elhami et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 2 (2019) 13 –27and OLD, respectively, while in Lordegan region, ﬁsh oil had the share of 80, 73% and 62% on the HT, FAE and OLD, respectively. Also, in Ardal re-gion, wheat gluten and rapeseed meal had the share of 37% and 43% oftotal contribution to TE, respectively, while in Lordegan region, thesetwo inputs had the share of 16% and 36% of total contribution to TE, re-spectively. Finally, In Lordegan region, the direct emissions from feedconsumption, diesel fuel, natural gas and labor had the share of 24% oftotal contribution to PhO.Considering that about 7 million tonsﬁsh meal and 1 million tons ﬁsh oil are produced per year (International ﬁsh meal andﬁsh oil orga- nization (FAO, 2006)), the increase in production of aquaculture prod-ucts makes an important challenge for diversi ﬁcation of protein and lipid sources. Using feeds containing high levels of wild- ﬁsh protein in raising carnivorousﬁsh is greatly under debate in aquaculture, particu-larly when it comes to comparison ofﬁsh farming with commercialﬁsh- ing (Ellingsen and Aanondsen, 2006). In a study conducted in Greece, itwas reported that feed in trout farms had 73% and 68% of total contribu-tion to GW and AC, respectively (Aubin et al., 2009). Researches focused on identifying plant-based alternatives to ﬁsh meal and oil (FAO, 2006), and there is optimistic outlook toﬁnd high-quality inputs to replacethem. The use ofﬁsh by-products as a complementary the nutritionalinputs to plant-based diets seems an interesting way. In this way, de-pendence on the stocks which are needed for producing ﬁsh meal and the environmental burdens associated with the ﬁsh feed can be de- creased (Papatryphon et al., 2004). However, the availability of theseby-products is a problem and they are available only in certain markets,which does not make them a global solution. Considering that most ofelectricity in Iran is generated from fossil fuels and has a signi ﬁcantemissions, it is clear that using more efﬁcient electro pumps and aware- ness about the amount of water needed in the different productionphases would cause a considerable reduction in the environmentalburdens.The values of characterization, normalization and weighting of theimpact categories for a ton produced trout in the regions are shown inTable 9. These values consist of the direct (the emission during troutproduction) and indirect emissions (the inputs production). The GWas the most important category in Ardal and Lordegan region were cal-culated as 617.61 and 1379.89 kg CO
2per ton of trout, respectively. The main reason for this difference is higher direct emissions in Lordegan re-gion. In similar studies, the value of GW per a ton of trout produced inGermany, Greece and Canada were reported as 2239 kg CO
2(Samuel- Fitwi et al., 2013), 2753 kg CO
2(Aubin et al., 2009) and 2073 kg CO 2
(Ayer and Tyedmers, 2009), respectively.Samuel-Fitwi et al. (2013) conducted a LCA study to evaluate different production systems includ-ing extensive, intensive and recirculating aquaculture systems in rain-bow trout production and reported that recirculating aquaculturesystems had the largest impact on GW and AC, while its impact on EPwas the lowest compared to two other systems. Also, the emissionsfrom feed production had the highest contribution to the GW as 96%and 46% in extensive and intensive system, respectively, while, theircontributions to AC were 97% and 73%, respectively. In another studyin Canada, LCA approach was used to quantify and compare the poten-tial environmental impacts of culturing salmonids in a conventional ma-rine net-pen system with those of three reportedly environmentally-friendly alternatives; a marineﬂoating bag system; a land-based saltwa-terﬂow through system; and a land-based freshwater recirculating

Fig. 10.Contribution of the inputs in environmental impact categories of trout farms in Lordegan region.24 B. Elhami et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 2 (2019) 13 –27system. Their results showed that while the use of these closed-containment systems may reduce the local ecological impacts typicallyassociated with net-pen salmon farming, the increase in material andenergy demands may result in a signiﬁcantly increase in several envi- ronmental impacts of global concern, including GW, AD and AC ( Ayer and Tyedmers, 2009).The normalization values were calculated by SimaPro softwarewhich contains the special coefﬁcients for each category. The normaliza-tion values of MAE, AC and FAE were higher than other impact catego-ries. The all normalized impact categories related to Lordegan regionwere higher in comparison with Ardal region ( Fig. 11). More uses of the inputs are the main reason for this difference between the regions.In theﬁnal section of the environmental impacts analysis, EEFS wascalculated by summing up the values of the weighting column. The EEFSvalues for a ton of trout produced in Ardal and Lordegan regions werecalculated as 1683.88 PPt and 3484.31 PPt, respectively. As it was ex-pected,ﬁsh meal had the highest contribution to EEFS in Ardal andLordegan regions with 48% and 57%, respectively.The direct emissions for a ton of trout are presented in Table 10.T h e direct emissions from diesel fuel, natural gas and human labor were cal-culated based onTable 4. The direct emissions from the feed were esti-mated using nutrient-balance modeling ( Cho and Kaushik, 1990). As it can be seen fromTable 10, diesel fuel had the highest contribution tothe direct emissions into air. Fish feed, although, had no direct emissionsinto air but was the only input that had the direct emissions to water.3.4. LCA + DEA resultsBased on the PTE scores for the inefﬁcient DMUs calculated by EMS software, the improved inputs was obtained and new LCA analysis con-ducted with the new modiﬁed LCI. The ten impact categories computedthrough SimaPro software based on the optimal condition and com-pared to the impact categories computed based on the actual data(Table 11). According to the LCA + DEA results, in Ardal region, despitethe lower environmental impacts, there were more potential to reducethe environmental impacts compared to Lordegan region. Also, therewere more potential to reduce the energy inputs in Ardal region com-pared to Lordegan region. The optimal uses of the inputs in Ardal regionhad the highest potential to reduction of AD and TE as 45.47% and44.14%, while in Lordegan region, the results showed that TE had thehighest reduction potential as 38.49%. The LCA + DEA results showedthat improvements ofﬁsh meal and wheat gluten had the highest con-tribution to AD and TE, respectively. Moreover, based on LCA + DEA,GW was reduced as 26.43% (454.36 kg CO
2eq per ton of trout) in Ardal region, while in Lordegan region, the reduction of GW was calcu-lated as 8.78% (1258.65 kg CO
2eq. per ton of trout). Finally, the LCA

Fig. 11.The comparative normalization results of trout farms in the studied regions.25 B. Elhami et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 2 (2019) 13 –27+ DEA results showed that the EEFS value in Ardal and Lordegan re-gions was reduced by 27.34% and 8.85%, respectively. Vázquez-Rowe et al. (2011)coupled LCA with DEA to evaluate the environmental im-pacts of coastalﬁsh production in Spain. Their results showed thatusing LCA coupled with DEA led to a reduction in diesel fuel consump-tion which had the largest contribution to all impact categories. They re-ported that using LCA coupled with DEA resulted in an increase inoperational efﬁciency, reducing input costs and the environmentalburdens.4. ConclusionsThe main aim of this study was to improve the energy ef ﬁciency and consequently reduce the environmental impacts in rainbow trout farmsin Ardal and Lordegan regions located at Chaharmahal and BakhtiariProvince of Iran. For this purpose, the required data were collectedfrom rainbow trout farms in Ardal and Lordegan regions. Based on theDEA results, the total required energy inputs in Ardal and Lordegan re-gions were calculated as 42,769.71 MJ ton
−1(29.28% saved energy) and 69,777.69 MJ ha
−1(9.59% saved energy), respectively. Also, LCA toolwas used to assess the environmental impacts of rainbow trout farms.The LCA results revealed thatﬁsh meal,ﬁsh oil and electricity in produc- tion stage were the major contributors to the impact categories in thestudied regions. Based on LCA + DEA, GW was reduced by 26.43% and8.78% in Ardal and Lordegan regions, respectively.Finally, it can be said that DEA is used to show the hot spots in cropproduction meaning that the producers are informed that for whichinput there is a higher potential for better management in terms of en-ergy and environmental performance. Then they focus on those inputswith higher potential. In other words, we were not meant to practicallyreduce energy consumption but we were aimed at ﬁnding the sources of energy with higher energy saving potential. When a system is opti-mized, we do not force the production system to reduce all applicationrates but we are meant to combine different application of inputs inorder to reduction of production costs as direct (reduction in the costof the inputs) and indirect (reduction in the environmental cost). Con-sidering the high feed costs, government could help trout producersby controlling the feed costs especially through providing alternativesources of protein that are necessary to replace the standard ﬁshmeal- based feed and identiﬁcation of plant-based alternatives toﬁsh meal and oil. Leveling pond bottom and creating a uniform slope could leadto a considerable reduction in water use and electricity. The electricitygeneration in fossil-based power plants has signi ﬁcant environmental problems. Considering solar potential in Iran, it is suggested that somestudy be conducted to evaluate the potentials for developing solarpower plants and generate more environmentally friendly electricity.Moreover, government measures to use clean energies would also en-courage farmers to use more clean energy technologies. Consequently,quantify the environmental impacts associated with the differentproduction phases using LCA method can help to identify potential im-provement options that could signiﬁcantly reduce environmental im- pacts and enhance environmental efﬁciency of a production system or a product. Also, it could help to identify the underlying problems ofthe different impacts which is important in ﬁnding solutions for achiev- ing sustainability in aquaculture.AcknowledgmentThe authors would like to acknowledge from the Agriculture Sci-ences and Natural Resources University of Khuzestan, Mollasani, Iranfor providingﬁnancial support for this research.ReferencesAbedi, M., Mohammadi, H., Ghaffari, M., 2011.
