Keywords:In-ﬁeld path planningFreeform pathﬁttingAgricultural logisticsWithin the context of in-ﬁeld path planning this paper discusses freeform path ﬁtting for the minimisation of the number of transitions between headland path and interior lanes within agricultural ﬁelds. This topic is motivated by two observations. Due to crossings of tyre traces such transitions in practice often cause an increase ofcompacted area. Furthermore, for very tight angles between headland path and interior lanes undesired hairpinturns may become necessary due to the limited agility of in- ﬁeld operating tractors. By minimising the number of interior lanes both detrimental effects can be mitigated. The potential of minimising the number of interior lanesby freeform pathﬁtting is evaluated on 10 non-convex real-world ﬁelds including obstacle areas, and compared to the more common technique ofﬁtting straight interior lanes. © 2021 The Author.

1. IntroductionAccording toAhumada and Villalobos (2009)there are four main functional sectors for the agri-food supply chain: production, harvest-ing, storage and distribution. Optimising logistics and routing play animportant role in all of the four functional areas for improved supplychain efﬁciency. Furthermore, according toSorensen and Bochtis (2010)it can be distinguished between in-ﬁeld, inter-ﬁeld, inter- sector and inter-regional logistics. This paper relates to the ﬁrst func- tional area of the agri-food supply chain, i.e., production, and furtherto in-ﬁeld logistics. The difﬁculty of in-ﬁeld logistics arises from the vast variety ofﬁeld shapes encountered in practice. In this perspectiveOksanen (2013)presented eight indices for measuring the complexityofﬁeld shapes. For an application, seeJanulevicius et al. (2019)who studied the effect of differentﬁeld width-to-length ratios on tractor per-formance measures such as fuel consumption and exhaust emissionswhen ploughing.For in-ﬁeld logistics it can be differentiated between three hierarchi-cal planning layers: (i) theﬁtting of lanes withinﬁeld contours, (ii) route planning for the traversal of these lanes, and (iii) trajectory plan-ning accounting for agility and actuation constraints of the in- ﬁeld oper- ating vehicle to smooth outﬁnal paths. This paper focuses on theﬁrst hierachical layer and, in particular, how freeform path ﬁtting compares to the more common method ofﬁtting straights as interior lanes. Forbackground, the coverage of agriculturalﬁelds growing, e.g., cereals orrapeseed requires lanes to beﬁtted withinﬁeld contours such that in- ﬁeld operating machinery can repeatedly travel along them during thework cycle after seeding and before harvest. These traversals typicallyoccur many times throughout the year for multiple spraying and fertil-izing applications.Oksanen and Visala (2009)presented two greedy algorithms forﬁeld coverage path planning. Theﬁrst algorithm splits a singleﬁeld using a trapezoidal split-and-merge scheme into multiple smaller con-vex or near convex subﬁelds that are then simpler to drive or operateusing the best driving direction and best selection of sub ﬁelds. Straight driving lanes are assumed. In contrast, in the second algorithm the pathis planned on the basis of the machine's current state and the searchover a limited search horizon is on the next lanes instead of the nextsubﬁeld. Lanes are now permitted to be curved. Note that for both algo-rithms multiple different path patterns may result within the same ﬁ
eld. Thus, in general, also multiple new headland paths must be generatedwithin theﬁeld in order to bound the different pattern regions, wherebysegments of headland paths coincide for neighbouring regions. Conse-quently, more transitions between interior lanes and headlands andmore compacted areas result. Thus, while partitioning of a ﬁeld into multiple subﬁelds may be inevitable for strongly non-convex ﬁeld shapes that demand very different driving behaviour, it also comes atac o s t .Hameed et al. (1086)computed optimal driving directions forstraight interior lanes based on the minimization of overlapped areausing a genetic algorithm, before optimal routing is determined basedon the minimization of the non-working distance. Freeform path plan-ning is not discussed. Results are evaluated on two obstacle-free testﬁelds.Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 233 –239

journal homepage:http://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/artificial-intelligence-in-agriculture/Hameed et al. (2010)presented a method for automated generationof guidance lines for operationalﬁeld planning. A geometrical represen-tation of theﬁeld is constructed as a geometrical entity comprising dis-crete geometric primitives such as points, lines, and polygons. For theirgeneration of parallel lanes the concept of “longest edge”of theﬁeld or partitioned subﬁelds is crucial. It is selected to determine the driving di-rection. The curved edge is determined as a collection of sequentialstraight edges satisfying the criterion that the angle between two suc-cessive edges is less than or equal to a threshold. Complex ﬁeld shapes are partitioned into a number of simpler sub ﬁelds, typically convex polygons.Jin and Tang (2011)accounted for 3D terrain topography. Four crit-ical tasks were therefore addressed: terrain modeling and representa-tion, coverage cost analysis, terrain decomposition, and determining asuitable reference path such that by offsetting a lane pattern for fullﬁeld coverage is obtained. Field boundary segments and topographicterrain contour lines were considered as the two categories for refer-ence curve candidates. InGuo (2018)a similar study is discussed, where soil and water conservation is also considered for the design ofreference curves. InSpekken et al. (2016)3D terrain topograpgy is also examined. The objective was soil loss minimisation for sugarcaneproduction. Therefore,“hybrid”curves were proposed as referencepaths. These are generated by continuously offsetting multiple ﬁeld contour segments towards each other until the hybrid curve is formedas their intersection points. While corresponding results were foundto be beneﬁcial, a disadvantage of this method is that the shape of thehybrid curve does not follow any particular segment of the ﬁeld contour such that realisation in practice is difﬁcult due to lack of nature-given vi-sual reference landmarks.Once lanes areﬁtted withinﬁeld contours available methods fromthe literature can be employed for the two other aforementioned hier-archical planning layers (routing algorithms for traversal of lanes andtrajectory planning forﬁnal path smoothing) including, for example,Jensen et al., 2015,Bochtis et al., 2013,Hameed et al., 2016,Yu et al., 2015,Spekken et al., 2015,Seyyedhasani and Dvorak, 2018,Plessen, 2018,Paraforos et al., 2018andBackman et al., 2012. Consider also Plessen, 2019for the coupling of crop assignment and and vehiclerouting.To summarise, given UTM-coordinates of a ﬁeld contour and of all its in-
ﬁeld obstacles, theﬁrst step is toﬁt interior lanes. Because of beingthe primary step laneﬁtting presents the foundation for all upstream lo-gistical optimisation layers on top, including routing, trajectory plan-ning and even multi-robot coordination. This underlines theimportance of laneﬁtting. Furthermore, as satellite pictures show, thevast majority ofﬁelds in practice isﬁtted with straight lanes. Obviously,straights are attractive due to their simplicity and absence of turning. Onthe other hand, almost allﬁelds are irregularly and very often even(strongly) non-convexly shaped. In view of this discrepancy the re-search question arises whether freeform path ﬁtting may yet beunderestimated for improved agricultural in- ﬁeld operations and merit more studying. This argument is supported particularly by thefact that straights can be considered as just a subset of the more generalclass of freeform paths. It is therefore expected that freeform paths canproduce improved or at least equally good solutions for a variety ofoptimisation objectives.Within this context the motivation and contribution of this paper isto discuss the potential of freeform pathﬁtting for the minimisation of the number of transitions between headland path and interior laneswithin agriculturalﬁelds. As a proxy therefore, the number of interiorlanes is minimised. This is achieved by optimised freeform ﬁtting of in- terior lanes to arbitrarily non-convexly shaped ﬁeld areas, that also may include obstacle areas. While freeformﬁtting of interior lanes is not new and sometimes in practice even performed intuitively by farmers,e.g., on wavy or curvedly shapedﬁelds, the outcome of a quantitativecomparison with respect to optimal straights ﬁtting and explicit evalu- ation of the number of interior lanes that can be saved in real-world sce-narios is not obvious.The remaining paper is organised as follows: problem modeling andproposed solution, numerical results and the conclusion are describedin Sections2–4.2. Problem modeling and proposed solutionFigs. 1and2introduce basic terminology. SeeFigs. 3and4for real- world visualisation on satellite images and problem motivation.Problem input are location data of the ﬁeld contourand all available obstacle contours.I naﬁrst step, theﬁeld contour is eroded to generatetheheadland path. Similarly, obstacle contours are dilated to constructobstacle headland paths. In a second step, areference pathis selected as a partial segment of the headland path. In a third step, this referenceis offset to generate a grid ofinterior lanesﬁtted withinﬁeld contours with inter-lane distance selected as the machinery operating width w. In this paper it is iterated over the selection of the reference path ac-cording to the criterion of minimising the total number of interiorlanes denoted byN

Similarly the headlandpath and all obstacle headland paths are constructed, whereby the off-setting distance is herew=2, i.e., half the operating width.An implementation detail is discussed. After ﬁtting of any interior lane its location data points are spatially extended by interpolationsuch that the distance between any 2 consecutive locations describingt h ei n t e r i o rl a n ei sa tm o s to fl e n g t h d> 0.

See alsoFig. 5for visualisation. The fun- damental idea is to work with circle inclusion checks to determine ifa candidate location pointPmaintains with desiredε-conﬁdence (e.g.,ε= 99%) distancew>0 from any piecewise lane segment thatconcatenatedly describe the previous interior lane. With respect toFig. 5, the constrainth>εwcan therefore be formulated. Using elemen-tary geometric arguments this translates to a desired interpolation dis-tance ofd<2wﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ1−ε2p: ð2ÞIn contrast, for the headland and obstacle headland paths it is d<2
w2ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ1−ε2pbecause of their target-distance of half the operating width withrespect to theﬁeld and obstacle contours, respectively. In ﬁnal evalua- tion experiments it is setw¼36m andε= 99%, which implies a spatial interpolation grid of at least 5 m along headland and obstacle headlandpaths and 10m along interior lanes. Note that when collecting ﬁeld and obstacle contour data points from real-world ﬁelds, these typically are already recorded to be sufﬁciently well shape-deﬁning. Therefore, interpolation points along theﬁeld and obstacle contours are hereadded spatially only for improved constraint checking. The ﬁeld and obstacle shape as deﬁned by originally recorded contour data is notaltered.A pruned point does not abort interior lanes construction. It merely ﬁl- ters out some location points. In contrast, any constraint violation resultsin the dismissal of the entire corresponding reference path candidate. Be-fore discussing constraints in detail, two more implementation details aretherefore described. First, the last point of any interior lane is linearly ex-trapolated (leveraging the penultimate point for the direction) to obtainthe intersection with the headland path. Second, after ﬁtting of any inte- rior lane its coordinates are extended by above discussed spatial interpo-lation technique with spacing according to Eq. (2). Constraints are discussed. First, any crossings of any two interiorlanes are prohibited. Second, too tight turns (expressed as the changeof directions between two adjacent lane segments) are not admittedsuch that candidates withjθ

Fig. 3.Visualisation of real-world transitions between headland path and interior lanes. As illustrated, the transitions between headland path and inter ior lanes can be“messy”in the sense that these often cause an increased amount of compacted ﬁeld areas due to crossings of tyre traces. This motivates the minimisation of such transitions, and therefore to minimise the number of interior lanes as a proxy.M. Graf Plessen Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 233 –239

In ex-periments it was setΔk=2 0 .The operating widthwis given by available machinery hardwaresetup. For example, for spraying applications on ﬁelds growing cereals or rapeseed in central Europe it is often w¼36m orw¼24m. To sum up, for the proposed method three hyperparameters occur: ε∈[0, 1], Δθ
max∈[0,π]a n dΔk> 0. For the latter a lower bound can bedetermined asΔk>
wd. Then all three hyperparameters are lowerbounded. The choice ofε= 99% as discussed above is reasonable foran accurate interpolation grid. To account for two operating widthsone may heuristically selectΔk≍⌈
2wd⌉. Then, only one shaping hyperparameter,Δθ
max∈[0,π], remains.As a proxy for the task of minimising the number of transitions be-tween headland path and interior lanes the minimisation of the numberof interior lanes,N
l, is selected as the optimisation criterion. This is validsince for everyﬁeld run every interior lane must typically be coveredexactlyonce, thus requiring exactly one entrance and one exittransition from and to the headland path, respectively.Before discussing data-dependent results for 10 real-world ﬁelds, the comparative method ofﬁttingstraightsas interior lanes is reconsidered.Remark 1.The method ofﬁtting straights as interior lanes can, in gen-eral, be regarded as a special case of freeform path ﬁtting. Instead of selecting a reference path deﬁned by a segment ormultiplesequential location data points along the headland path for the latter scenario, itis deﬁned by onlytwopoints for the former case for the generation ofstraight interior lanes. For rectangularﬁeld shapes this method is opti- mal. However, for the general case of arbitrarily shaped ﬁelds optimality of straight interior lanes is not guaranteed. Since the problem class ofstraightsﬁtting is included as a subset in the problem class of freeformpathﬁtting, the latter will always be at least as good as the former forany objective, including, e.g., minimisation of total accumulated pathlength of interior lanes or total travel time along interior lanes. The crit-ical disadvantage of freeform pathﬁtting is the requirement of at leastone shaping hyperparameter to constrain desired turning or curvaturesof resulting paths. In contrast, for straights ﬁtting no such shaping hyperparameter is required. Instead, it must solely be accounted forthe physical machine operating width.3. Numerical results and discussionThe potential of minimising the number of interior lanes by freeformpathﬁtting is evaluated on a variety of 10 real-world ﬁelds, and com- pared to the more common technique of ﬁtting straight interior lanes. For the latter solution, the orientation of straights is also optimised tominimise the number of interior lanes N
l.
Fig. 4.For very tight angles between headland path and interior lanes undesired hairpin turns may become necessary due to the limited agility of in- ﬁeld operating tractors. The more transitions between headland path and interior lanes the higher also the probability that such turns may occur, in particular, for complex ﬁelds. This provides the second motivation for the minimisation of the number of interior lanes by freeform path ﬁtting.

236Field data was obtained from satellite images in Google Earth(http://earth.google.com) by trackingﬁeld contours and contours of all in-ﬁeld obstacle areas (such as e.g., tree islands), before exportingthose raw location data points as .kml-ﬁles and feeding it to proposed algorithm. Fields were selected to emphasize effects of the comparedpathﬁtting methods on a variety of very differently shaped ﬁelds as well as with and without in-ﬁeld obstacle areas. The latitude andlongitude locations of allﬁelds are summarized inTable 1, which per- mits to replicateﬁeld data. By contacting the author the ,kml-data ﬁles will also be available upon request.Field sizes vary between 10.3 ha and 62.9 ha. Results aresummarised inFig. 6andTable 2. The following observations are made.First, savings range from−1 lane to -9 lanes. Percentage-wise, thisimplies the number of interior lanes could be reduced by −7% to

Optimal solutions ofﬁtting straights and freeform paths for the minimisation of N lare displayed in the left and right subplot for eachﬁeld, respectively. Axes are denominated in meters. Latitude and longitude of all 10 ﬁelds are summarized inTable 1.M. Graf Plessen Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 233 –239
237−67% for freeform pathﬁtting in comparison to optimal straightsﬁtting. Note that for allﬁelds a large operating width ofw¼36 m is con- sidered. For smaller operating widths savings scale linearly.Second, while in some scenarios the optimised freeform path plan-ning is intuitive such as for Field 8, it is surprising in other cases suchas for Field 4. There are also subtle details about the exact optimal lengthof reference paths. In general, it therefore seems to be dif ﬁcult to devise a reliable rule of thumb to select optimal reference paths. Thus, for gen-eralﬁeld shapes it clearly is best to turn to a data-dependent numericaloptimisation method such as the proposed algorithm.Third, the comparative method ofﬁtting straights as interior lanes is discussed in more detail. For implementation simplicity it is in generaldesired to align straights to an approximately straight and typicallyalso the longest segment of theﬁeld contour. For Field 1,Fig. 7illustrates the resulting number of interior lanes N
las a function of the rotation angle of interior lanes, whereby 0
∘implies a vertical or y-axis aligned in-terior lane. The minimising solution is obtained for N
l=1 4a n di s displayed inFig. 6. When straight interior lanes were rotated by anadditional 90
∘to obtain alignment with theﬁeld contour in the north east,N
l= 17 resulted. Then, savings for freeform path ﬁtting would amount to−4 lanes and−24%. This underlines the importance ofcareful selection of the orientation for straight interior lanes. To stressthis more, when performing the grid search for Field 3 a range of N
l∈ [13, 33] resulted, i.e., with possible variation of ±20 interior lanes. Fi-nally, a detail with respect toFig. 7is discussed. The lack of exact sym-metry, for example, visible for rotation angles 40 –120
∘and 220–300∘, is explained by the fact that theﬁrst interior lane is offset by distance wfrom the headland path in the rotated coordinate system. Conse-quently, a residual distance results at the last othogonal interior lanewith respect to the headland path. Since the ﬁeld shape is not perfectly symmetric for Field 1, the resulting function in Fig. 7is also not exactly repeating with a phase-shift of 180
∘.Fourth, as already pointed out inRemark 1, the strength of freeform pathﬁtting is itsﬂexibility in that it may (i) be used as a technique toalso optimisealternativeobjectives besides the number of interiorlanes or to optimise a weighted trade-off among different criteria, and(ii) that solutions can easily be constrained to limit the desired amountof steering and to tailor results to the vehicle's agility capabilities. In par-ticular, forΔθmax= 0 in Eq.(3)the solution ofﬁtting straights as interior lanes, i.e., theleast-steeringsolution, is recovered.Ultimately, after havingﬁtted interior lanes withinﬁeld contours one can on top (i) determineﬁeld coverage path plans, e.g., accordingto the methods inPlessen (2018)andPlessen (2019), before (ii) smoothing out trajectories by accounting for actuation constraints ofthe in-ﬁeld operating vehicle, for example, according to the controlmethods inBackman et al. (2012)orPlessen and Bemporad (2017). The most obvious disadvantage of freeform path ﬁtting is the in- creased amount of steering that is needed along interior lanes. However,this is largely relevant only as long as there is a human vehicle driver.Currrently, such a driver would have to apply signi ﬁcantly increased ef- fort for freeform path tracking. However, for an envisioned future withfully automated roboticﬁeld coverage this disadvantage is dismissed.Because of path-ﬁtting being the foundation for all upstream logisti-cal optimization layers on top (including routing, trajectory planningand even multi-robot coordination) the subject of this research is crucialfor the overall optimization of agricultural in- ﬁeld work.4. ConclusionThis paper contributed to the task of in-ﬁeld path planning within agriculturalﬁelds by proposing a freeform pathﬁtting method for the minimisation of the number of transitions between headland path andinterior lanes. Therefore, as a proxy the minimisation of the number ofinterior lanes was selected as optimisation criterion. Spatial interpola-tion distances for pruning during the generation of interior lanes andconstraints for the shaping of freeform paths were discussed. The poten-tial of minimising the number of interior lanes by freeform path ﬁtting was evaluated on 10 real-worldﬁelds and compared to the more com-mon technique ofﬁtting straight interior lanes. Field sizes varied be-tween 10.3 ha and 62.9 ha with some including in- ﬁeld obstacle areas. For an operating width of 36 m optimal straights ﬁtting resulted in a range of between 9 to 39 interior lanes. In comparison, freeform pathﬁtting resulted in savings in the range of−1l a n et o−9 lanes or, perentage-wise speaking, in a reduction of the number of interiorlanes by−7% to−67%.This paper focused on the very clear to quantify number of interiorlanes as the optimisation criterion, which served as a proxy for theminimisation of the number of transitions between headland path andinterior lanes. For future work an alternative objective such as thetotal accumulated path length along interior lanes may be considered.Then, ideally three consecutive layers are evaluated for determiningthe optimal grid of interior lanesﬁtted withinﬁeld contours. These
three layers represent (i) selecting a reference path candidate as partialsegment of the headland path and generating a corresponding grid ofinterior lanes as discussed in this paper, (ii) determining a routing solu-tion for the coverage of all lane segments, before (iii) generatingsmoothed out trajectories accounting for agility and actuation con-straints of the in-ﬁeld operating vehicle, whereby theﬁnal detailed tra- jectory must also be planned such as to minimise spraying gaps.Similarly to as presented in this paper, it must then be iterated over ref-erence path candidates before the total path length minimising solutionis returned.Declaration of Competing InterestThe author declare no conﬂict of interests.References
