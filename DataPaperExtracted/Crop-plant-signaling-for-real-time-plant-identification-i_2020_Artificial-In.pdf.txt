Keywords:Crop plant signalingRobot-plant interactionFluorescent compoundWeed controlThe continued emergence of herbicide-resistant weeds and the increasing labor costs are threatening the abilityof growers to manage weeds and maintain pro ﬁts. The smart farm with the advantage of non-invasive and high-efﬁciency operation plays an important role in increasing the sustainability of agricultural system as itcan optimize crop inputs such as herbicides while preserving resources including soil and water. An automaticweed control system requires a sensing subsystem capable of detecting and distinguishing crop plants fromweeds. The overlapping plants remain a challenge for successful detection of weeds. Crop plant signaling is anew robot-plant interaction technique that allows the visualization of exogenous ﬂuorescent signals applied to crop plants for crop/weed identiﬁcation. Based on all published articles in the leading edge of knowledge, a com-prehensive review of the mushrooming crop plant signaling for discriminations of weeds and crops ishighlighted. The discussion outlines the signi ﬁcant progress that has been made in developing new and more ro- bust automated systems along with the current challenges and future prospects. This paper details the promise ofcrop plant signaling for accurate and automated plant recognitions in cropping systems. There is no doubt thatthis review is of great signiﬁcance to scholars in related researchﬁeld to study the solutions to real-time weed control.© 2020 The Authors.

31. IntroductionDue to the limited selection of herbicides, the lack of labor, high costsfor manual weeding, and the increasing demand for organic foods, thedevelopment of automated weed control systems to meet the real-time plant care in theﬁeld has received increasing attention(Fennimore and Boyd, 2018;Fennimore and Cutulle, 2019;Fennimore and Tourte, 2019). Herbicides are widely used to control weeds in agri-culture. However, this poses a risk of poisoning to people who operateand use them (Pateiro-Moure et al., 2013). The overuse of herbicides can cause pollution to the air, water, and soil, and their residues maybe present in foods (Hildebrandt et al., 2008). Also, labelling new herbi- cide for each crop group is an onerous process. There is evidence thatthere have been more than 40 years since the last valuable herbicidein crops such as lettuce was made (Fennimore and Tourte, 2019). Her- bicides are strictly regulated by the government and face more publicscrutiny. The vulnerability of liability claims makes the labeling of newherbicides cumbersome. For example, the registrant would be liablefor $1700 ha
−1if the maize in Iowa was damaged by an herbicide andthe yield was lost by 100% (Plastina, 2019). In any case, the use of herbi- cides will inevitably cause certain species to become resistance to theherbicide. With few new herbicides released and more herbicide-resistant weeds, the risk of weed management through herbicides is in-creasing (Davis and Frisvold, 2017). Additionally, labor shortages, inef-ﬁciencies, and rising wages limit manual weeding as a viable optionfor long-term weeding. Large-scale cultivation needs cost-effectiveand labor-saving techniques for rapid and ef ﬁcient removal of various weeds in crops. Automatic weeding is an effective operation to ensurethe sustainability of crop production system. Recently, commercial ma-chines for automatic thinning of lettuce have been developed to thin let-tuce plants to the expectedﬁnal crop density. A small number ofcommercial robotic weed control machines are available to farmersfor purchase (Su et al., 2019a). However, the current state of the art isunable to distinguish between crops and weed plants under conditionssuch as those found in organic production of direct sown crops, wherevisual occlusion from plant leaves can be severe ( Slaughter, 2014). A modern technology called crop plant signaling has been proposedfor crop/weed differentiation. Crop plant signaling is a new concept de-ﬁned as any communication process that governs basic interactions be-tween sensors and exogenousﬂuorescent signals applied to crop plants.This new technology wasﬁrst created byNguyen et al. (2017)in 2017 as a novel solution to automated weed control in vegetable crops. In theirstudy, the crop plants marked at planting in the ﬁeld generated a unique optical signature, which ensured the differentiation task. After, Su et al. (2019b)updated this technology using systemic ﬂuorescent markers that effectively discriminated snap bean plants from different weeds.By applying the systemicﬂuorescent compound to seeds or transplants,Su et al. (2020a)successfully created sensor-readable crop plants with aunique optical appearance for real-time plant care. The ﬂuorescent tracer in plants has signiﬁcantﬂuorescence emission upon excitationlight. This systemic crop signaling technique allows the crop to indicateits presence usingﬂuorescence signals of extraneous substances appliedto plants. In addition, crop signaling methods developed using plant la-bels, topical markers, orﬂuorescent proteins (FPs) were successfullyused for crop/weed detection (Raja et al., 2019). The properties of sig- naling methods for an automatic weeding system has to feature:(i) the signal compound has a uniqueﬂuorescence signal, (ii) the opticalﬁlter combined with the excitation light can ﬁlter out theﬂuorescence signal, (iii) a small amount ofﬂuorescent tracer can produce strong sig-nal, (iv) the signaling compound can be safely used for crop plants, and(v) it is cost-effective to be used. When weed control is needed, ma-chine vision systems will be deployed to detect the unique optical sig-nals produced by crop plants and develop high spatial resolution mapsinvolving crops and weed plants to accurately locate all plants in real-time. The crop/weed map will be used by a high spatial resolutionweed destruction mechanism that selectively takes lethal action againstindividual weed plants without damaging the crop plants. Such a recog-nition system does not require prior knowledge of the plant to identifyhigh-density weeds.The feasibility of crop signaling techniques has been investigated byscientists during past few years. Up to now, no review on crop signalingtechnology has been published for plant identi ﬁcation. This paperﬁrst provides an introduction of the new concept on crop planting signaling.Challenges of existing noncontact methods including spectroscopy andimaging techniques (such as hyperspectral imaging and multispectralimaging) for discriminations of crops and weeds have been presentedinSection 2.I nSection 3, an emphasis has been given to the studies ofrecent years in advanced crop plant signaling using physical, biologicaland chemical markers to simplify and ensure the success of the cropand weed detection. The discussions are given on the advantages, chal-lenges and future prospects of crop planting signaling for real timeapplications.2. Limitations of existing sensing methods for plant detectionAutomatic detections of weeds in agricultural ﬁelds usually involves sensing the weeds against the backgrounds of soil, plant residue, andcrops. Noncontact approaches for weed detection mainly require the ac-quisition of plants involving sensing from satellites or airborne vehicles,and ground-based vehicles or robotics ( Su, 2020). Spectroscopy is a rapid technique commonly used to sense the difference between cropplants and weeds (Jurado-Expósito et al., 2003). Besides their spectral features, the spatial attributes should also be incorporate in analysissince they already are part of the measurement ( Elstone et al., 2020; Su and Sun, 2016). Such methods depend reﬂectance, absorbance, or emission of an inherent signal or feature from a plant to be receivedby non-imaging sensors (Jurado-Expósito et al., 2003) or imaging sen- sors such as color imaging (El-Faki et al., 2000), hyperspectral imaging (Okamoto et al., 2007; Su et al., 2018; Su and Sun, 2016a, 2016b,2016c, 2017a, 2017b), and multispectral imaging (Piron et al., 2009). These sensing techniques coupled with machine learning algorithmssuch as Bayesian classiﬁers and convolutional neural network (CNN)have been widely used for rapid crop/weed discrimination ( Su, 2020). Speciﬁcally, visible/near infrared (VIS/NIR) spectroscopy studies the in-teraction between the object to be measured and radiation intensity as afunction of wavelength (Su et al., 2017a). Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm based on three characteristic variables in the rededge (RD) region achieved a high accuracy of 97% for recognition of sil-ver beet and maize plants (Akbarzadeh et al., 2018).Borregaard et al. (2000)used the spectral reﬂectance of 694 nm and 970 nm to achievean accuracy of up to 90% for classiﬁcation of crops (including sugar beet) and weeds (including black bindweed, fools parsley, andfat-hen). The non-imaging spectroscopy only generates spectral infor-mation from very small points or local parts without providing spatialinformation of the entire object (Su et al., 2019; Su and Sun, 2019). Color imaging can capture whole image data within red, green, andblue wavelength ranges. CNN-based classi ﬁcation systems using RGB data can run easily on mobile hardware with a processing time below30 milliseconds (Santos et al., 2019). The color image-based RF classiﬁer had an overall accuracy rate of about 95% in the classi ﬁcation of early g
 rowing weeds in maizeﬁelds (Gao et al., 2018). Hyperspectral imaging differs from non-imaging spectroscopy andcolor imaging in that it takes numerous narrow-band images from acontinuous spectral region, generating the spectra of all pixels in animage (Su et al., 2017b). Hyperspectral models using the absorbancein the region of 1700 to 2320 nm achieved over 99% classi ﬁcation rates for discriminating nightshade weed from tomato plant(Slaughter et al., 2004). Based on ground-based hyperspectral imaging(400–1000 nm), Bayesian classiﬁers and artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) were examined to discriminate crops such as lettuce, ﬁeld pea,W.-H. Su Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 262 –271
263canola and tomato from different weeds grown under various sunlightintensities with high accuracies (88% to 94%) ( Eddy et al., 2014; Slaughter et al., 2008;Staab et al., 2009). However, it takes a lot of time and effort to effectively remove the large amount of redundant in-formation contained in the full wavelength range to simplify the model(Su et al., 2020) and improve the speed of on-line detection ( Su, 2020; Su et al., 2019, 2020).As a successor of hyperspectral imaging technique, multispectral im-aging only captures images in several discrete spectral bands within thefull wavelength region (Lara et al., 2020; Su and Sun, 2018). The RF algo- rithm based on the selected multi-spectral images obtained an accuracyof more than 93% for the classiﬁcation of weeds in three soybean varie-ties (Fletcher and Reddy, 2016). However, weeds in complex naturalscenarios (e.g. high weed densities) are dif ﬁcult to be distinguished (Westwood et al., 2018). Instead of acquiring reﬂectance or absorbance spectra, chlorophyllﬂuorescence imaging can capture theﬂuorescence emission of plant chlorophyll, but it is hard to classify healthy cropplants from the weeds using this technique, because the ﬂuorescence peaks of chlorophyll of these green plants are identical ( Hilton, 2000). Overall, the widely used sensors are based on plant inherent features(such as chlorophyll and nitrogen) (Clevers and Kooistra, 2011;Ustin et al., 2009). In addition, these methods require sufﬁ cient learning of the characteristics of a large number of weeds or crops to establish a ro-bust machine learning model before performing operations of plantidentiﬁcation (Zhang et al., 2012).3. Crop plant signalingCrop plant signaling is a new robot-plant interaction technique thatallows weed/crop differentiation based on photographing of a machine-readableﬂuorescence signal applied to crop plants rather than the weed(Su et al., 2019b).Fig. 1shows a schematic diagram illustrating the prin-ciple of the crop plant signaling technology. Fluorescent compounds inthe plant at very low doses containﬂuorophores that can generate very strongﬂuorescent emissions when excited by speci ﬁcw a v e - lengths. Theﬂuorescent signals can be then captured by a ﬂuorescence macroscope. According to the attributes of labels, signaling approachescan be divided into three categories: physical markers (such as plant la-bels), biological markers (such as FPs), and chemical markers (such assystemic crop signaling compounds and topical markers). The currentpublished studies of this technology have been summarized in Table 1.The following are the examples of their applications for automatedidentiﬁcation of the location of target plants.3.1. Physical markersPhysical markers refer to the use of inexpensive and biodegradablep
lant labels made from polylactic acid or maize-based plastic. Theplant labels painted with orange, green, or pink ﬂuorescent paints were placed next to seedling stems to provide a unique signal used tolocalize the crop plants. Because of theﬂuorescent signal of the plant label under ultraviolet (UV) excitation light, the crop signaling systemequipped with a camera was able to detect the occluded and non-occluded crops (including tomato and lettuce) with an accuracy of97.8% at travel speeds up to 3.2 km h
−1inﬁelds with a high density of weeds (Raja et al., 2020a). As shown inFig. 2, the system mainly consists of a camera at the top, two sets of three mirrors, two sets of six UV lights,and a pneumatic-powered weed knife. The top view of the target plantalong with mirror images from six view angles allow the location of theplant to be calculated according to the geometric appearance of theplant label (Fig. 3). Based on the position of the plant label, the weedingblade receives commands to perform the weeding operation. The tech-nique allows for universal weed control rather than classi ﬁcation of dif- ferent weeds, because the temporaryﬂuorescent signal is only applied to the crops and not the weeds, allowing it to rapidly distinguish the dif-ferent weeds from the crop plants. Results showed that over 90% weeds(including edroot pigweed, barnyardgrass, yellow nutsedge, prostratepigweed, lambsquarters, black nightshade, and purslane) and 66%weeds (including burning nettle and purslane) were classi ﬁed and re- moved from the tomato and the lettuce without reducing yields(Kennedy et al., 2019). The error was mainly due to the failure of theplant label to adhere to the crop plants. Also, it is dif ﬁcult to avoid re- moval of labels by irrigation. Although this system has potential to con-trol the universal weeds in crops, this crop plant signaling using plantlabels are inefﬁcient as it takes a lot time to mark each vegetable seed-ling manually.3.2. Biological markersBiological markers are widely used as indicators to measure certainbiological conditions. FP is a very efﬁcient genetically encoded biologicalmarker for imaging living cells and tissues ( Dixit et al., 2006;Xian et al.,
Fig. 1.A schematic diagram illustrating the principle of the crop plant signaling technology.W.-H. Su Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 262 –271
2641999). The most common categories are red, green, cyan, yellow, andgreen-to-red FPs (Chudakov et al., 2010;Hao et al., 2007). Monitoring plants based onﬂuorescent markers is not a completely new methodas it has been proposed for detecting transgenic plants ( Stewart Jr, 2005). For instance, theﬂuorescence of green FP was used to indicatethe characterization of protein synthesis in transgenic plants ( Richards et al., 2003). The FP produced speciﬁc colors was used to screen diseasedplants (Wang et al., 2007). Also, FPs expressed in plants can generate aspeciﬁc signal for classiﬁcation of crops from weeds. Results showedthat theﬂuorescence generated from green FP under blue (470 nm) ex-citation light extensively appeared in plant leaves, which helped toidentify crops from weeds (Raja et al., 2019).Rigoulot et al. (2019)de- veloped aﬂuorescence-based platform for imaging of plant canopiesthat expressed multiple FP genes in leaves. The excitation lights forFPs ranged from UV to orange (395 –578 nm) withﬂuorescence emis- sions from blue to red (454 –611 nm). Of the 20ﬂuorescent proteins screened, theﬂuorescence of the four proteins (mEmerald, mTagBFP2,mScarlet-I, and TurboRFP) was clearly detected on the entire leaves ofthe plant (Fig. 4). In the future, the iterative version of the system is ex-pected to be used for automated crop/weed screening.3.3. Chemical markers3.3.1. Systemic crop signaling compoundsSystemic crop signaling compounds are applied to the seedling rootsof transplanted crops or through the seed coat to crop seeds that can besown directly prior to planting, then they are transported systematicallyto the stem or the foliage of a plant for detection ( Su et al., 2020a). Lappartient et al. (1999)found that sulfate can move up into leavesafter being absorbed by plant roots. The lipophile property of a com-pound expressed in terms of the log K
owaffects its mode of action and absorption in plants (Salanenka and Taylor, 2006). Molecules with log K
owbetween 0 and 2 are considered to move more readily in plants(Hsu et al., 1990). Theﬂuorescent tracers mainly originate from chemi-cal families including arylmethane dye, azine dye, coumarins and xan-thenes (Wang et al., 2020). Such markers for agricultural use shouldbe cost effective and safe. As an inexpensive xanthene ﬂuorescent com- pound, the use of Rhodamine B (Rh\ \B) (no more than 60 ppm on the treated seed) does not have a negative impact on the environment orpublic health based on the statement U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) (Su, 2020). Studies have shown that Rh\ \B (LogK

2651.5) was more easily absorbed by broad bean leaves rather than hydro-philic dyes such as Oregon Green 488 ( Liu and Gaskin, 2004). The seed coats of lettuce and tomato are non-permeable to the sys-temic Rh\ \B dye, but the snap bean seed coat is permeable to thismarker (Salanenka and Taylor, 2011). Rh\ \B has been successfully used as a systemic crop signaling compound excited under UV light todistinguish snap bean plants from three weeds including burning nettle,barley and groundsel with 100% accuracy ( Su et al., 2019a). In theirstudy, the Rh\ \B signal in crops was created by soaking the snap beanseeds with Rh\ \B liquid dye for 24 h before sowing. After the seedlingsgrow up, this systemic signaling compound was deposited in the plantstem following the seed pathway (Su et al., 2019b). Besides snap bean, soybean (a large-seeded legume) had the very similar seed coat perme-ability (Taylor and Salanenka, 2012;Yang et al., 2018). After investiga- tion of 32ﬂuorescent tracers, the systemic Rh\ \B wasﬁnally selected as the optimal tracer for systemic soybean seed uptake ( Wang et al., 2020). The Rh\ \B was detected from the roots and hypocotyl, while lim-ited contents were measured from soybean epicotyl and true leaves(Fig. 5). Although the Rh\ \B has less translocation beyond the stem tis-sue and into the leaves, the function of the systemic compound usingseed pathway is equivalent to the plant labels. Previous studies demon-strated that in addition to UV light, green light was also able to excite thesystemic Rh\ \B producing the same emission signal ( Han et al., 2003). For a clearer understanding of concentration effects on seed uptake,Su et al. (2020a)developed a system based on the green light at523 nm to detect snap beans containing various doses of Rh \ \Bt r a c e r using the seed pathway. They found that the seeds with 100 ppm ofRh\ \B presented the highestﬂuorescence intensity (Fig. 6(a, b)). After the signal of the control samples was ﬁltered, it was found that the emission of Rh−B was mainly concentrated in the stem (hypocotyland epicotyl) of the plant (Fig. 6(c, d)).Rh\ \B tracers were easily taken up into bean and celery leaves fol-lowing the root pathway (Su et al., 2020a;Su et al., 2020c).Fi

266shows the distribution of Rh\ \B absorbed by celery roots via plantxylem upward to foliage. Strongerﬂuorescence signal was observed inthe plant stem, followed by the leaf midvein, secondary vein, and apex(Su et al., 2020c). Fluorescent compounds generally undergophotodegradation under the radiation of UV and visible light, and sys-temic Rh\ \B tracers are no exception (Watanabe et al., 1977). Thus, evaluation of the photobleaching of Rh\ \B markers in crops under sun- light is indispensable. Also, the Rh\ \B marker on plant health and vigorshould be assessed due to the cytotoxicity of this ﬂuorescent compound at higher dose (O'brien et al., 2000).Su et al. (2020b)proved that sys- temic Rh\ \B dye in treated celery was photostable for about 4 weeks(Fig. 8) and the celery was tolerant to the 60 ppm Rh\ \B. In addition,the combination of green excitation light and the bandpass emission ﬁl- ter centered at 579 nm showed higher performance than that using theUV light and otherﬁlters for plant identiﬁcations (Su et al., 2020a). Al- though UV inducedﬂuorescence spectroscopy (400 –490 nm) has been utilized to differentiate maize crop from weeds with classi ﬁcation accuracy of over 80% (Panneton et al., 2010;Panneton et al., 2011), such spectroscopic methods using the full wavelength ranges cannot provideimage information of target objects, and was not yet suitable for auto-mated online applications. In addition, it was possible to distinguish dif-ferent plants including barley and peas based on the relative intensitiesat 685 and 735 nm, thisﬂuorescence ratio based on the concentration ofchlorophyll had limited ability for plant discriminations ( Hilton, 2000).

2673.3.2. Topical markersTopical markers (water-based latexﬂuorescent paints) were applied to the plant stems or foliage of crop seedlings by a real-time spray sys-tem during transplanting. The spray system was modi ﬁed from a stan- dard row crop transplanter, which could accurately target the paint toseedlings. Compared with plant labels, topical markers are automati-cally applied to plant seedlings in theﬁeld, making the marking process faster and easier. More information about this spray system can befound elsewhere (Vuong et al., 2017). When the signaling compoundwas excited using UV light 3 weeks after seedling transplanting, its ﬂuo- rescent signal was still machine-readable. The amount of topical markerapplied to the foliage of crop seedling is very limited as an excessiveamount of marker may affect the photosynthesis of the leaves and slow down the growth of plants. Based on topical markers applied toplant stems, this crop signaling system combined with a micro-jetherbicide-spraying device (Fig. 9) achieved an identiﬁcation accuracy

268of more than 99.75% of the lettuce plants and 98.11% of sprayable weedsin an outdoor experiment (Raja et al., 2020b). Based on this technology, manual weeding time per hectare can be reduced by up to 48% for veg-etable crops (Kennedy et al., 2019). Overall, topical markers produced auniqueﬂuorescent signal during theﬁrst few weeks of the critical weeding season, which is enough to distinguish lettuce plants fromweeds. If the marker on the crop stems cannot be detected, it will leadto false identiﬁcations. This error may be caused by the occlusion ofthe leaves, which prevented theﬂuorescence of the paint on the stemfrom being received by the camera.4. Discussions4.1. Advantages of crop plant signalingThe development of advanced technology for universal weeding is adifﬁcult but realistic task. Crop plant signaling technology, which gov-erns the basic interaction between crop plants and sensors, has greatpotential in intelligent crop recognition. The feasibility of the technol-ogy for discriminations of crops and weeds has been illustrated by em-pirical studies. The application of chemical markers was easiercompared to physical labels. The extra workload of using physicalmarker can be compensated for by the advantages of this technology.Systemic crop signaling compounds are not subject to climatic andﬁeld conditions as the markers exist inside the crop plants ( Su et al., 2020c). The function of systemic markers that translocate from theseed coat to the crop stem is the same as physical markers, but thetime and labor needed in the process of seed preparation are very less.Systematic markers based on root treatment can move from the rootinto the stem and leaves, and their function is the same as the FPs andtopical markers used. The signaling methods mentioned in this articleare applicable to transplanted crops, but only systemic compoundsbased on seed treatment are feasible for seeded crops. In addition,crop signaling using systemic markers and FPs requires less labor andis more reliable and feasible. Thus, crop plants marked with systemicsignaling compounds (e.g. Rh\ \B) based on seed or root pathwaywere more effectively identiﬁed than those with physical or otherchemical markers (e.g. plant labels and topical markers) placed on ornear the crops. This indicates that this systemic plant signaling methodis the easiest and most promising technique for real-time weed controlinﬁelds.Sunlight can cause aﬂuorescent signal to gradually weaken withtime until it disappears (Song et al., 1995). For all signaling approaches,theﬂuorescent marker was photostable for several weeks in smallplants, which was signiﬁcant enough for the routine use of the crop sig-naling technique during the critical period (3 to 5 weeks) of weed re-moval. Plant signaling is best suited in an application context withhigh weed densities without having to learn plant characteristics. Anadvantage of this crop plant signaling over conventional sensing tech-niques is that it does not require prior knowledge of the features ofweeds or crops. Also, the poor visual appearance of the plants doesnot compromise system performance. Compared with gene-alteredcrops, consumer acceptance of crop signaling will be stronger sincethe small amount ofﬂuorescent tracer disappeared after a period oftime under sunlight. Also, their applications to plants and seeds areallowed by federal regulatory agencies. The crop signaling materialsproposed are easy to detect, environmentally friendly and cost effectiveas well as simple to apply, which provided a new breakthrough for au-tomatic plant segmentations.4.2. Disadvantages and future potentials of crop plant signaling for on lineapplicationsThe success of crop plant signaling depends on the identi ﬁcation of effective compounds for use on the farm and the development of asafe delivery approach that generates suf ﬁcient signal strength to achieve plant identiﬁcation. Disadvantages to weed/crop differentiationin theﬁeld
include variable lighting conditions, the ability to robustlycontrol the illumination of the scene with pulsed high-intensity lighting,and the need for high speed plant capture and processing capabilities.The robustness, signal strength, and visibility of ﬂuorescent compounds are critical. Crops in theﬁeld are particularly vulnerable to competitionfrom weeds at the seedling stage (about 3 to 5 weeks) ( Su, 2020). The time interval of 3 weeks may be not enough for weeding, but more re-search is needed to investigate the alternative new signaling markerthat has longerﬂuorescent lifetime in the future. In a recent study, itwas found that the signaling compound showed great photostabilityin celery plants for 5 weeks (Su et al., 2020c). After 3 to 5 weeks when the crops have survived and grew large, the weeds will not be a bigproblem. The presence of camera and computer hardware solutions,such as image intensiﬁers and graphics processing units (GPUs), canmitigate some of the potential signal problems. The rapid developmentof advanced GPU and camera will bring new imaging sensors withhigher resolution at lower cost. High-tech companies that develop intel-ligent weeding technologies are relatively small, but they will likely

269become the main source of new weed control technologies instead oftraditional pesticide companies in the future.As a novel technology and concept, although crop plant signaling isnot mature enough, the review on plant identi ﬁcation based on a uniqueﬂuorescent marker summarized the work of many authorsover the span of 4 years. Also, this technology is very promising forreal-time and accurate identiﬁcation of crops inﬁelds. According to the presented literature, crop plant signaling has not yet reached theperformance of vision systems based on RGB (and often NIR) cameras,but has shown the great potential to develop the automatic weeding ro-bots comparable to the human eye in crop/weed identi ﬁcation. This paper will be of great signiﬁcance for the scholars in thisﬁeld to carry out further related research. In the future, an intelligent control systemthat integrates the crop plant signaling technology and the intra-rowcultivators or sprayers is expected to remove most of the weeds incrops. Nevertheless, as the interaction between crop and weed is a com-plex process, more practical research should be carried out in the ﬁeld. Further research is planned to determine whether these markers willcontaminateﬁeld soil or post-harvest agricultural products. Afterassessing the impact of different doses of Rh\ \B on seedling growth, it was found that 60 ppm of Rh\ \B was safe for celery but higher concen-trations of the dye were harmful to plant health ( Su et al., 2020c). Al- though the marking chemicals from the US EPA list are classi ﬁed as having no adverse public health effects, it would be good to investigatethe yield and nutrition value for at least three crop plants with thechemical markers using crop signaling and compare it with the tradi-tional methods in future. Based on the huge progress of arti ﬁcial intelli- gence, it appears that the future of crop plant signaling in automatedweed control will be very promising.5. ConclusionsIn recent years, much attention has been paid to the developmentand application of crop plant signaling technology for robotic weed con-trol. This article has highlighted the current research status and pros-pects of crop plant signaling using different markers applied to cropplants for the automatic differentiation of crops and weeds. The ﬂuores- cence of the markers generated under excitation lights was used to indi-cate the speciﬁc location of the crop in theﬁeld. Three types of signaling methods including physical markers (plant labels), biological markers(FPs), and chemical markers (systemic crop signaling compounds andtopical markers) were investigated and summarized. The approach ofusing physical markers is to place a plant label together with a cropseedling during transplanting. Based on a FP in plants, a characteristicﬂuorescence was generated under excitation light to distinguish thecrops from weeds. Systemic crop signaling is to label the crop plantsby applying a signaling compound to the seeds or the roots of crop seed-lings. Topical marker is a more direct method by applying the com-pound directly to the stems or leaves of crops. The results showed thatthe accuracy of distinguishing weeds/crops using crop plant signalingwas very promising. The intelligent system developed for automaticweed control improved the recognition of crops from weeds. Such ap-plication results demonstrated that crop plant signaling has great po-tential to enable precise weeding on a commercial scale.Declaration of Competing InterestNone.References
