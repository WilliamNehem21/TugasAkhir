Abstract 
Finger vein authentication plays an important role in the field  of vascular certification because of its simplification and high efficiency.  In this paper, a finger vein recognition algorithm based on gradient-correlation is presented.  Firstly, a method based on histogram statistics is given to recognize wh ether finger vein images or not. Secondly, matched filter based on maximum curvature model is adopted to extract the gradient image of finger vein. Finally, cross-correlation between two gradient images is figured out to estimate their similarity. The maximal correlation is used to decide whether matching or not with threshold.  Experimental results show that FAR and FFR are 0.375% and 1.20% respectively. This algorithm is simple, efficient, insensitive to noise,

1. Introduction With the information era’s coming, people pay much more attention on the Information Security. The development of science and technology presents some drawbacks of the traditional identification methods, such as smart cards and passwords. However, finger vein recognition, as one of the biometric technology, has some kind advantages of non-contact, live identification, high security and inner-feature, etc.

 So far, some companies [1, 2] have published products based on finger vein authentication, while some researches 
[3-8] are still in the lab stage with problems exist as followed: 1) Lack of consideration to tell the available input image. 2) Require high image quality. 3) Image preprocessing.  2. System Overview Finger vein authentication system contains four modules as shown in Fig.1.

Fig. 1 Diagram of Finger Vein Authentication System 
Processor DM6437DSP clocked @ 600MHz was implemen ted in the system that consists of image acquisition part and DSP board, is shown in Fig.2 and Fig.3 respectively. The DSP board contains image processing module, storage module and matching module. All the procedures including finger vein registration and authentication are performed on DSP.

3. Image Acquisition Image acquisition part is made up of a CMOS came ra and 6 LEDs that emit ~850nm near-infrared light. Optical filter added to capture a distinct image sized 355x288, 8 bit for each pixel. One original image is shown in Fig.4. Before discrimination, as Sun 
[5], a rotational alignment was done, and the effective area of finger vein was shown as Fig.5.

4. Image Discrimination In a mature authentication product, specific algorithm is terribly needed to tell  the available image. One kind of an algorithm, based on histogram statistics  as shown in Fig. 6, could realize the function. 42   Lin Chunyi et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  40 – 45

The criteria mentioned in the flowchart are result analysis  of many experiments. A finger vein image shall rigorously meet the following criteria. x Probability summation of the first 6 subparagraphs should not be greater than 5%. x From 7
th to 18th ones, 5 adjacent subparagraphs probability summation greater than 40% should be found.  x From 7
th to 22nd ones, the probability summation should be greater than 80%.  x Beyond 25
th ones, the probability of every subparagraph should be less than 1%. 5. Gradient Image Extraction Considering the venous distribution characteristics, image grey distribution corresponds with the maximum curvature model. 12 angle operators in research 
[9] were too many. To raise speed, 4 new angle operators (0e,45e,90e,135e), were raised as follow:

Convolutional filtering was performed through the image using the operators mentioned. After that, 4 images, sized J*K, were obtained with pixel value f0(x, y), f1(x, y), f2(x, y), f3(x, y). Accordingly, the gray value f(x, y) of the gradient image, as shown in Fig.7, was calculated as follow:

6. Matching Algorithm The gradient image could intuitively reflect the difference between vein images. The advantage of maximum cross-correlation is not sensitive to noises. Two steps as Fig.8 & Fig.9 performed the matching.

Experimental Results Experiments show that the accuracy is high and this algorithm could tell the true finger vein image from non-finger vein images like pencil images. Images from  40 different fingers were captured and some fingers out of them were captured for 70 times. Totally 588 images were used to make up the vein library.  44   Lin Chunyi et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  40 – 45

According to table 1 and table 2, threshold is rational to be 0.4, a good recognition rate obtained. On the grounds of FFR and FAR, a testing index of matching algorithm, the Receive Op erating Characteristics Curve shown in Fig.12, demonstrates the relationship be tween FFR and FAR in different thresholds. 
 
Fig.12 Receive Operating Characteristics Curve 
ROC curve is close to the x axis that means the prec ision rate of the algorithm is high. In the same experimental conditions, whichever threshold is used to measure FFR and FAR in research [5], its recognition 45  Lin Chunyi et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  40 – 45 
 rate is worse.  Research [6] FAR is 0.7% that almost twice of the FAR in this work, while its FFR is 1.05% that is approximately equal to this work.  8. Conclusion This work presents an algorithm for finger vein auth entication.  Experimental results show that FFR and FAR are 0.375% and 1.20% respectively. Fewer steps im prove the processing speed, especially suitable for the finger vein authentication system based on DSP. In the later product research and development, we will be dedicated to optimize the pre-processing algorithm, espe cially reduce the noises caused by light source.
