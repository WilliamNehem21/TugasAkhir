Abstract 
The method to produce the hollow micro/nano fibers through the bicomponent spinneret of electrospinning was introduced and the influence of the process parameters on the morphology of the micro/nano fibers was presented in the paper. The result revealed that the PAN fibers with uniform hollow construction could be collected while the feed rate of the inner solution was set at 0.08ml/h (single hollow fibers) or 0.06ml/h (double hollow fibers). Meanwhile, the morphology was in good condition with 15kv voltage and 20cm receiving distance.

1. Introduction The electrospinning is a technology to fabricate continuous  micro/nano fibers, with advantages such as the simple device, the wide range of optional materials, th e controllable morphology and the high specific surface area etc. At the same time, the fibers have potential ap plication in the fields of tissue engineering scaffolds, health care, filter material, electromagnetic shielding materials, etc[
1]. Electrospinning machine is usually composed of sp inneret and solution supply system, fiber collection plate and high voltage power supply. The traditional spinne ret, with a circular cross section, helps to produce the circular solid fibers which possess limited use[
2,3]. At present, the researchers have developed co-axial elecrospinning device which can produce single and hollow micro/nano fibers through electrospinning[

In order to widen their application fields, the spinneret can be revised to produce multi-component fibers and even multi-hollow fibers. Compared with solid structure, hollow structure may possess more advantages such as better mechanic stability, independent addressa ble channels, and larger surfaceto-volume area[
7]. In this paper, the single and double hollow PAN micro/ nano fibers were fabricated. The influence of the process parameters on the morphology of the micro/nano fibers was studied. 2. Experiments 2.1.  Materials and instruments PAN(MW=50000) was provided by Petro-chemicals Ji nshan CO., Ltd; N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30 (PVP) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. A high voltage power supply and a trace syringe pump were used in the experiments, which were purchased from the Kansai Electronics (Su zhou) Co., Ltd, and TECH-Kno wledge International, Inc, respectively. The morphology of the fibers was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (HitachiS-3000N). 2.2.  Solution Preparation PAN powder was dissolved in DMF with magnetic stirring for 6h at 60
. PVP solution was used as inner solution with 30wt% in DMF as well. 2.3.  Fabrication of micro/nanofibers The PAN micro/nano fibers could be fabricated by vertical electrospinning system. The experiment voltage was (10-20)kv, and the distance between spinneret an d collector was(10-20)cm. The aluminium foil was used as the accept device. The PAN hollow fibers were fabricated through the spinnerets (as shown in Fig. 1). Also the number and arrangement of the inner channels in a spinneret could be adjusted according to the practical requirement. At the experimental conditions, the cortex solution dropped do wn by gravity and the inner solution fell down by the force of the trace syringe pump. Eliminating the core layer, the hollow fibers were made with the diameter ranging from nanometer to micrometer. Citing the si ngle hollow and double hollow fibers as examples, the section of the fibers might be changed based on the process parameters. Now the influence of the process parameters on the morphology of the micro/nano fibers was analyzed and the result was shown as follow.

2.4.  Post treatment  Non-woven fabrics were placed in water at ambient te mperature for more than 24 h to remove the core layer, and then dried in 80 
 for six hours to remove moisture. Next the PAN fibers were pre-oxidized to 250
 in the muffle furnace. Finally, the morphology of the fibers could be observed by SEM. 3.  The results and discussion 3.1.  The influence of the feed rate of the inner solution      In conditions of certain spinning voltage (15kv) and receiving distance (20cm), the fibers with different inner diameters were obtained by adjusting the feed rate of the inner solution. For the single hollow fibers, the feed rate was respectively 0.02 ml/h, 0.04 ml/h, 0.06 ml/h  and 0.08ml/h. The SEM photos of the fibers were clearly shown in Fig. 2.
 
 
 (a) 0.02 ml/h, (b) 0.04 ml/h, (c) 0.06 ml/h, (d) 0.08 ml/h 
It could be seen from the Fig. 2 that the inner diameters increased along with the feed rate of the inner solution. When the feed rate of the inner solution wa s less than 0.04 ml/h, the production ratio of the hollow construction was too small to put into practical use. Increasing the feed rate of the inner solution to 0.08ml/h, the ratio of the hollow construction presented a better state . The feed rate could not be too fast, or the core layers were fractured at risk. As for the double hollow fibers, the variation of hollow construction showed the similar trend with the 
 from Fig.2 and Fig. 3. When the feed rates of the inner solution were too small, the fibers of ideal section could not be achieved. Increasing the rate to 0.06 ml/h (As shown in figure 3 (b) shows), 
 of hollow construction were considered in a better condition. Continuing to increase the feed rate, the double hollow would merge and the cortices tended to fracture. As a result, the feed rate should not be too fast when fabricating the double or triplicate hollow fibers. 239  Xiaochao Zhang et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   3  ( 2012 )  236 – 241

It was likely that the inner diameters were liner with the outer diameters as for hollow fibers, so next the paper studied 
 3.2.  The influence of voltage

According to the above research, we adjusted the spinning voltage arranging from 10kv to 20kv to fabricate the hollow fibers when the suitable feed rate of the inne r solution was 0.08ml/h and the receiving distance was 
4. When the voltage was small, the fibers were discontinuous, meanwhile there were beadlik e structures called slub PAN filament yarn. High voltage was the best way to decrease the diameters (t he higher the voltage, the smaller the diameters), but high voltage should be controlled to a certain range. Wh en the voltage kept increasing, the continuity of the fibers became worsen, and the diameter distribution greater. The research found the optimal condition of the voltage would be 15kv. Meanwhile, the diameters of the fibers could be optimized in the process of after-drawing. 240   Xiaochao Zhang et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   3  ( 2012 )  236 – 241 
3.3.  The influence of receiving distance 
 
Fig. 5 The SEM photos of the hollow fibers with the receiving distance: (a) 10cm, (b) 15cm, (c) 20cm, (d) 25cm 
Different diameters fibers were produced by adjusting the receiving distance, at the feed rate of 0.08 ml/h, 
 volatilize completely at the receiving distance of 10cm. Along with increasing the distance, the solvent volatilized fully and the solution solidified well, finally the uniform diameter fibers with smooth surface could be collected in the plate (Fig. 5(b) and (c)). When it reached to 25cm, there was lar ger diameter distribution because of unstable dynamic whip. Judging from these, it was 20cm that was the best receiving distance for collecting the fibers. 
ss section views were shown as Fig. 6 with the feed rate of 0.08ml/h (single hollow fibers) or 0.06ml/h (double hollow fibers) of the inner solution, voltage of 15kv and receiving distance of 20cm. In this condition, the outer diameters of fibers ranged from 800 nm to 1
m with the inner diameters being about 300nm-400nm (single hollow fibers) or 100nm-200nm (double hollow fibers).

Summary With the help of the bicomponent spinneret, sing le hollow fibers and double hollow fibers had been fabricated. This research analyzed the influence of  the process parameters on the morphology of the micro/nano fibers. It revealed that the fibers with uniform hollow construction could be fabricated in the plate while the feed rate of the inner solution was set at 0.08ml/h (single hollow fibers) or 0.06ml/h (double hollow fibers). Meanwhile, the surface morphology was in  good condition with 15kv voltage and 20cm receiving distance. Also the number and arrangement of the inner ch annels in a spinneret could be adjusted according to the practical requirement. Acknowledgement This work was supported by
