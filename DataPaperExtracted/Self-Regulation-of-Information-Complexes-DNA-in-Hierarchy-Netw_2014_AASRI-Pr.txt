Abstract 
Are analyzed varied experimental data on DNA fluorescence inside neutrophils and other aerobic cells in flow cytometry with nanometer spatial resolution, in the large populations of cells. Fluorescence distributions, for histograms various ranks r, define classes of Good and Bad information networks DNA for good and bad health of different people, in a very dense, fractal packing of information and entropy in networks of ‘exponentially small worlds’, at variation types of positive and negative stability for information distributions. In all cells exists invariance (homeostasis) for total Shannon entropy E=lnr in hierarchy networks entropy of any scales, fo r any rank r. Entropy's noises form signals for self-regulation of informational homeostasis. The  main reconstructions of correlations and noises, for homeostasis support, at any states of health, occur in branching distributions of central moments in the most large-scale networks of entropy, for rank r <32.

peripheral blood and for other cells of human and chickens, for different dyes and varied excitations of fluorescence [1-5].  Oxidative activity of DNA is visualized at fluorescence. In each experiment is observed fluorescence of three-dimensional (3D) DNA nanost ructures of all non-coding and coding parts of DNA in full set of chromosomes inside cells. Each cell makes a chaotic Brownian motion at chaotic rotations in the jet of blood, flowing through the laser beam, during measurements. Therefore, each fluorescence histogram defines a representative statistics for various two dime nsional (2D) projections on the photomultiplier all possible detailed spatial images of fluorescing 3D DNA in large populations of cells.  In real life of all DNA in the group of cells cannot select, determine and allocate only a single separate contribution of only non-coding and only coding parts of  separated DNA in combined correlations, synergy of joint actions of full set 46 chromosomes inside cell. Detailed analysis statistical data on 3D DNA fluorescence inside neutrophils [1-4] shows that actual correlations and topology stochastic coils of complex networks DNA for full set of chromosomes in living cells are characterized by non-Gaussian statistics, very high dense packing in networks DNA consisting from a mix of norm al and abnormal fractal structures, changeability and flexibility in self-regulation of information and entropy, which provide high adaptability DNA inside cells for real life. Complexity real life 3D DNA inside living cells  is much higher than statics coding single linear fragment of DNA, their combinations, gene networks or biochemical schemes in textbooks, in standard genomic researches lonely DNA, etc. Here exist many unsolved problems in mathematics, natural science, etc However, there are some overall patterns, universal features and switching in networks DNA which allow classify different types of correlations and informati on networks DNA inside cells for any given donor  in given time [1-4]. New physical and mathematical pattern s for information activity 3D DNA define new opportunities in self-regulation and medical diagnostics of  health and immunity. Recording, transfer and self- regulation of information DNA inside living cells give a good sample for future information engineering, etc. 2. Large-scale distributions, fractals,  networks of Shannon entropy in DNA complex inside living cells Three original histograms are shown in Figs.1 for illustrations fluorescing neutrophils in the blood different healthy and unhealthy men.

In Figs.1 presented normalized distributions for frequency of fluorescence flashes P(I) , of information J(I)=-lnP(I) and information entropy E(J(I))=p(I)J(I), based on normalized distribution of information (see eqns.

Accuracy and reproducibility of experimental results approximately equal to 2% that corresponds to usual levels inevitable errors and fluctuations of physical and biological nature [5]. At the present time we do not know how extract, separate inform ation and interpret immunofluorescence data. Let us consider some fractal peculiarities of fluorescen ce distributions. Many histograms different origin are similar to histograms for fluorescing neutrophils in Figs.1 [7]. Range r or rank r of histogram defines scale of multistage clusters in networks with structure of bronchial tree. Range r coincides with the number of columns in histograms or number measuring channels of fluorescence intensity at given maximal value of dimensionless intensity, i.e. r=Imax. In presented experiments maximal number of channels is r=256. Variations of range r, i.e. rank r of histograms or varia tions the scale r, provide varied changes in irregularity and brokenness of frequency distribution of fluorescen ce for histograms of various ranks r [1, 4, 6]. The quantitative measure of irregularity and brokenness for frequency distribution of flashes for any rank r, in all histograms, may serve a Hurst index H. Hurst exponent H [8] is determine d by means of regression equation

Illustration of definition Hurst index was presented in [1, 4, 6]. Hurst index H for frequency of flashes P(I) corresponds to fractal (Hausdorff) dimension D [8] if

The contin uous lines correspond to the parabolic approximations of probability density distributions. Varied types of concave and convex lines corre spond to changes stability for probabilistic distributions at various states of health, at transcritical bifurcations [6]; initial histo grams see in Figs.1. 
According to Fig.2a all multi-scale networks DNA in cell are characterized by a mix of normal D=2-H<2 and abnormal D>2 fractal dimensions. In the case of H <0 an anomalous fractal dimension D> 2 can serve as a measure of fragmentation for correlations and ensure more dense packing of complex fractal networks [2,6]. Consider an undirected network and let us define d as the mean geodesic (i.e., shortest) distance between pairs of vertex or nodes in a network of fluorescen ce flashes. The certain number N of synchronized nodes- flashes in networks of DNA fluorescence inside cells  are characterized by the intensity I~N , where N defines a common number of correlated nodes in network. The correlation length d depends on the network topology.  Random networks with a given degree distribution ma y be the networks of “small worlds” if d~ lnN [9]. Fractal dimension D for fluorescence networks of “small worlds” is D(N)~lnN/lnlnN [ 9]. In our case reduction of range r=I~N leads to the expression {l nr/D(r)}~{lnlnr}. Detailed analysis [4,6] shows that more suitable, realistic and universal approximations for experi mental data on DNA fluorescence correspond to correlations ln{(lnr)/D(r)}~{lnlnr} in Fig.2b. These netw orks, having very dense packing in twice double logarithmic scale, denser than in ‘small worlds’, were named as networks of ‘exponentially small worlds’ [4]. According to Fig.2b information entropy DNA in real time [1,2,4,6], packed in various and very dense networks of ‘exponentially small worlds’,  which have fractal and structural differences even in twice double logarithmic scale, for one human and different people. These structural variations interconnected with different types of stability in ranged distributions of fluorescence in Fig.2c Change types of smooth approximations for distributions in Fig.2c (concave/convex parabola) corresponds to changes of stability for varied probabilistic distributions in transcritical bifurcations [6,7]. Thus we define General State of Health in the form of answer Yes/No or healthy/sick, as a form of parabolic approximations of ranged fluorescence distributions, as concave/convex parabola, for all people in vivo and at medical treatment [6,7]. Moreover, this answer Yes/No coincides with change of trends, i.e. positive/negative sign, for dependence fractal dimension in networks for DNA activity on scale of networks for all people in real time [1].    Thus packing, switching, stability form the keys for regulation of information activity DNA inside living cells. According illustrations in Figs.1,2 real traffics in DNA networks always are not smooth [4]. Forced smoothing DNA activity inside cells belongs to the games without rules and meaningful, sensible goals. 127  Nikolay E. Galich   /  AASRI Procedia   9  ( 2014 )  123 – 130 
3. Invariance of total Shannon entropy, noises entropy, self-regulation of informational activity  DNA 
Let us consider hierarchy multi-scale distributions of fluorescence, presented in ranged histograms for frequency of entropy E(p(I,r)). Detailed analysis experimental data [ 2, 6] shown that total entropy E(J,r)=<J(p(I,r))>=-<lnp(I,r)> is invariant, identical for given r in all cells [2]. Dependence of E(J,r)) on rank r, as it is illustrated in Fig.3a, is logarithmic

This  empirical invariant defines informational homeostasis of oxidative activity of 3D DNA in full set chromosomes inside living cells [2,6]. Information transforms at DNA activity inside cells, at variations of inner and external conditions, for all cells, ensure stability, adaptability and vitality cell at self-regulation of homeostasis [2,4]. This self-regulation is defined by the local deflections from average homeostatic level of information entropy, i.e. is defined by the local noises or fluctuations near homeostasis of total information entropy

According to Fig.4a local distributions of noises  ) (r el depend on the states of health for given person in real time during regulation of informational homeostasis at mean level 0 ) (! r el .According to Figs.4b-4d main structural reconstructions of chromosomal correlati ons during homeostasis regulation occur in the most large-scale networks of entropy for rank r <32 [1]. This reflects, at least, changing topology of chromosomes in nuclei of cells and fractals in networks information entropy [6]. Statistics of fluctuations entropy is quite non-Gaussian [1-7]. Branching and correlations in Fi gs. 4b, 4d for more high moments, with m=46, are noticeably more contrast than dispersion (m=2) in hierarchy networks of all scales. This is associated with intermittency [4] and with joint actions all DNA in cell, when all 46 chromosomes and their cross-correlations participate in homeostasis regulation.  These are collective, complex statistical interactions in the hierarchy of super dense packing of large-scale networks, in the pre sence of very complicated mix of normal and abnormal fractals, which are changeable in life even for one and the same person [2,4,6]. Traditional methods and approaches of statistical analysis and bioinformatics, etc, can’t  be used for correct description of information activity of DNA and real life DNA in chromosomes inside living cells. Here exist many unsolved problems. The same results are typical for all cells of blood su ch as neutrophils, lymphocytes, all leukocytes of human and chicken erythrocytes for various dyes, co lours and various excitations of fluorescence [2]. Physical mechanism, providing very effective, quick re laxations of all electronic excitations DNA of different origin, for support of homeostasis stabilization c onnected with Förster resonance, etc [2].  Fluctuations in activity  DNA, as and self-regulation of informational homeostasis, are associated with cell life in the body as in the open system, for stability support of vitality co nditions at varied perturbations of different origin. Entropy’s noises
