ABSTRACT
A separator and multiphaseﬂow meters are considered the most accurate tools used to measure the surface oil ﬂow rates. However, these tools are expensive and time consuming. Thus, this study aims to develop a correlation for accurate and quick evaluation of well surface ﬂow rates and consequently the well in ﬂow performance relationship. In order to achieve the abovementioned aim, this study uses arti ﬁcial neural network (ANN) forﬂow rates prediction particularly in arti ﬁcial lifted wells especially in the absence of wellhead pressure data. The ANN model is developed and validated by utilizing 350 data points collected from numerous ﬁelds located in Nile Delta and Western Desert of Egypt with inputs include; wellhead temperature, gas liquid ratio, water cut, surface and bottomhole temperatures, water cut, surface production rates, tubing cross section area, and well depth. The results of this study show that, the collected data are distributed as follows; 60% fo r training, 30% for testing and 10% for the validation processes with R
2of 0.96 and mean square error (MSE) of 0.02. A comparison study is implemented between the new ANN correlation and other published correlations (Gilbert, Ros and Achong correlations) to show the robustness of the developed correlation. The resul ts show that the developed correlation able to predict oil ﬂow rates accurately with the lowest mean square error.
1. IntroductionThe most widely used correlations for wellhead rate estimation arepresented byGilbert (1954);Ros (1960);Achong (1961); andAl-Attar and Abdul-Majeed, (1988)for multiphaseﬂow across wellhead choke and criticalﬂow. Gilbert's correlation is valid only when the upstreampressure greater than downstream pressure by at least 70%. The corre-lation is given by:P

The data include gas-liquid ratio, upstream/-downstream pressures, chock size, production rates and API oil gravity.The author performed a sensitivity analysis to select the best correlationfor rate estimation. The results show that the Gilbert's correlation yieldeda relative accurate prediction of the wellhead rates while Achong's cor-relation underestimated the production rates. Economides et al. (2011) mentioned that the theory of multi-phaseﬂuidﬂow through choke is not clearly described.Ghareeb and Shedid (2007)proposed a study to develop a new correlation for artiﬁcially lifted wells to predict surfaceﬂow rates using the least square method technique. While, Rasoul (2012) proposed mathematical correlation used to calculate wellbore ﬂow temperature.Khorzoughi (2013)presented a multiphaseﬂow chock correlation using non-linear optimization technique and Monto Carlosimulation.Seidi and Sayahi (2015)combined a genetic algorithm withnon-linear regression analysis to predict the sub-critical ﬂow through wellhead chokes.Although the pressure measured at the wellhead is considered one ofthe main parameter that used to predict the wellhead ﬂow rates in several choke correlations, however, this parameter disappears for arti ﬁcially lifted wells. This due to the absence of critical ﬂow condition and choke is either disconnected or fully opened during the oil lifting process.Therefore, the main aim of this study is to develop a correlation thatheavily based on the wellhead temperature ( T
h) to eliminate the effect of unavailable wellhead pressure data. The proposed correlation in thisstudy is function of gas-oil ratio (GOR), surface temperature (Ts), water

The wells are artiﬁcially lifted using gas lift or sucker rod pumps.The artiﬁcial neural network technique (ANN) is used in this study toachieve that goal.2. Artiﬁcial neural networkThe artiﬁcial neural network is widely used in petroleum engineeringapplications includes diagnosis of the drill bit ( Arehart 1989), well test interpretation (Al-Kaabi et al., 1993), spatial property mapping (Veez- hinathan et al., 1992), wireline log analysis (Rogers et al., 1992), and identiﬁcation of well productivity (Garcia et al., 1992). The neural network can be trained by supervised and unsupervised training algo-rithms. Supervised learning algorithm as back propagation ( Rumelhart et al., 1986andLippmann 1987) requires training data with the desiredoutcome for each pattern of input. Unsupervised learning algorithm(Hopﬁeld 1992) is suitable for classiﬁcation problems. A simpleﬂow chart is presented to describe how the supervised learning algorithmworks (seeFig. 1). The neural net consists of three layers include input,hidden and output layers. The number of hidden layers should be apositive number including zero. If none of the hidden layer used in thenetwork, the network calls simple perceptron that suitable for classi ﬁ- cation linearly patterns (Morgan et al., 1989). If the network contains one or more hidden layers, it calls multiple perceptron and can be used fornonlinear separable patterns. Each layer in the neural net contains pro-cessing elements called neurons. Each neuron in the input layer trans-ports into the network the value of one independent variable, and nomathematical operations are performed. Entirely, neurons are connectedtogether with the hidden layer by a simple weighted link. Each link has aweight either positive or negative. Each of the output layer neuronsreceive signals from hidden neurons and provides a similar weightedresponse (seeFig. 2).The tan sigmoid function is the most commonly used in the neuralnetwork to constrain the output values to a range of 0 and 1 ( Mahmoodi et al., 2016). The function is expressed by:fðsÞ¼
11þe
/C0s(4)whereSis expressed as:S¼Xni¼0xiwi (5)where n is the dimensions of the input vector X (x0, x1, …, xn), and W (w0,w1,…,wn) is corresponding weight vector. Note that w
0is the weight for the bias input x0 (which is equal to one).There are two process in the neural net, forward and backwardpropagation steps. In the forward step, signals are sent through neuronsto calculate the output targets while backward step is used to calculatethe error vector between actual and target values. The error value at theoutput neurons for a training pattern can be de ﬁned by a quadratic cost function:E
p¼12Xn21/C0x
p/C0y p/C12(6)where E is the error vector for the training pattern p.In this study, the back propagation algorithm is used. This is due tothe strength shown by the algorithm in learning and generalizing largevariety of relationship embedded in the training data set. The algorithmdoes not require prior mathematical knowledge that maps the inputpatterns to the output patterns. In addition, the ﬂexibility of the back propagation algorithm in choosing number of hidden layers, in-terconnections, neurons, the learning and momentum constants is wide.3. Application of ANN in predicting surface production ratesThe previous researches regarding the application of the ANN inpredicting the wellhead surface rates are presented in Table 1. The conclusion is the literature does not provide a single physical equationthat can be used to predict surface oil rates for speci ﬁcﬁelds using ANN. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the black box concept of the ANN andto present a new correlation to combine wellbore and ﬂuid parameters to predict surface oil rates for wells located in Egypt.Zhong-bao et al., (2011)proposed a neural network model that basedon the back propagation learning algorithm to predict surface oil rates.The neural network consists of one hidden layer and 10 neurons. Theinput neurons include the wells number, the coordinates of the wells, thecumulative production, the derivative of cumulative production, theshut-in time, the average distance to surrounding wells, average cumu-lative production of surrounding wells, and the cumulative productiondays. The output layer contains one neuron representing the cumulativeproduction at time tþ1. The results indicate that the model can predicttheﬂow rate for short term ofﬂow.Elmabrouk et al. (2010)established a neural network model to pre-dict the reservoir average pressure without shut the wells. Elshaﬁei et al. (2011)presented a neural network model to predict the crude oil pro-duction rates from multi stage oil separators. The model is based on in-puts that include initial,ﬁnal temperature for each stage and oilcomposition.4. Data processingAround 350 measured points are collected from numerous ﬁelds in Egypt include: Bakr, Meliha, Lotus, Aman, and Wadi El Sahl ﬁelds. The data include; the gas-oil ratio (GOR), water cut (WC), surface productionrate (Q), bottom hole temperature (Tbh), tubing cross section area (A),and well depth (H). In advance, the data are pre-processed and its qualityhas been tested to avoid peculiar answers. In order to improve the per-formance of the neural network model, the dataset is subdividedrandomly into 60% for training, 30% for testing, while validation datasetis 10% of the total collected data.Table 2shows the statistical analysis of the input data. Numerous scenarios are performed to test the effect ofeach input parameter on the outputs. Therefore, the input parameters areremoved one by one while others are kept constant. The surface

2value to assess the accuracy of each run. The results show that surface measured tem-perature has a signiﬁcant effect on the predicted surfaceﬂow rates. The optimum architecture of the neural network is achieved by trialand error approach, in which the optimum number of the hidden layer isone with 10 neurons. The neurons in the hidden and output layers areactivated with the logistic function and Levenberg Marquardt ( More, 1978) algorithm that provides the back error propagation with the lowestmean square-error (MSE).

35. Results and discussionA total of 350 data points are used in the neural net, in which 60% fortraining, 30% for testing, while validation dataset is 10%. Results in thisstudy show a reasonable match between the predicted and measured dataas shown inFig. 3. This exceptional match based on the back propagationlearning algorithm that used in the ANN model. The back propagationlearning algorithm (BP) is selected in this study with sigmoid functionbased on the comparison performed against scaled conjugate gradient(SCG) and one-step secant (OSS) algorithms. A 500 epches (iterations) isused to get the minimum error which con ﬁrms the effectiveness of convergence technique used with the ANN model. This section will testthe robustness of the designed neural network. Fig. 3shows a comparison between the network surface oil rates versus measured oil rates at thewellhead during the training and testing processes. The results show thatthe network gives R
2of 0.963 with MSE¼0.02 for the training. It can be seen that fromFig. 3that the results are in a close agreement with theactualﬂow rates. In addition, same procedure is followed for testingprocess, the results show that the optimum R
2of 0.94 found with using 10 neurons with MSE¼0.0325.It can be seen form these encouraging outcomes in this study, amathematical correlation can be extracted to calculate the surface oilrates at wellheads as a function of wellbore parameters that has beenmentioned before. The correlation is based on weights and biases andtheir values are given inTable 4.The extracted correlation is given as:Qon¼"XNi¼1w2itansig XJJ¼1w1i;jxjþb 1j!#þb

Validation of the ANN modelTo validate the designed artiﬁcial neural network, a new dataset iscollected from west Bakr reservoir in Egypt. This dataset never usedduring the training and testing of the ANN model. The generated corre-lation in this study (see Eqs(8) and (9)) used to predict the oil rates at the wellhead, and then the results are compared with published correlationsinclude Gilbert, Ros, and Achonhg correlations. Fig. 4shows the recorded wellhead head temperature and GLR versus the well depth for the testedwells. As it can be seen fromFig. 4that the wells exhibit a severeﬂuc- tuation in the measured temperature and GLR. The existing ﬂuctuation scheme complicates the prediction of the oil rates at surface usingtraditional correlations specially with the disappearing of recorded dailywell events.The results show that this study developed a new correlation able topredict the oilﬂow rate with R
2of 0.93 as shown inFig. 5. In addition, Fig. 6shows a comparison between actual and predicted ﬂow rates for the dataset used in validation operation. A good match is achieved atdifferent depths. Statistically, the ANN model presented in this study isreliable based on the calculated MSE between actual and predicted oilrates. Base on the results, ANN correlation gives the lowest MSE with0.02 compared to Gilbert, Ros, and Achonhg correlations as shown inFig. 7.6. Conclusion1. The results of this study shows a robustness of the presented ANNmodel used to predict the oilﬂow rates for artiﬁcially lifted wells based on recorded surface temperature in the absence of wellheadpressures with accuracy exceeds 96% compared to well-known cor-relations (Gilbert, Ros, and Achong correlation with MSE ¼0.02. 2. Based on the outcome of this study, a new correlation is extractedbased on proposed ANN that can be used for wells located in NileDelta and Western Desert parts of Egypt.3. The ANN model in this study use back propagation learning algorithmwhich provides the optimum results in terms of lowest MSE andhighest R2 values.4. A comparison is carried out in this study, shows that the well-knowncorrelations have deﬁciencies in predicting oil rates at the wellhead,those correlations are the most widely used in predicting oil rates.Therefore, this study anticipated a solution for companies in Egypt to
