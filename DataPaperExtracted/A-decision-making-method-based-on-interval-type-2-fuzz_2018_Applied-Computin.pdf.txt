Selecting the best solution to deploy an ambulance in a strategic location is of the important variablesthat need to be accounted for improving the emergency medical services. The selection requires bothquantitative and qualitative evaluation. Fuzzy set based approach is one of the well-known theories thathelp decision makers to handle fuzziness, uncertainty in decision making and vagueness of information.This paper proposes a new decision making method of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Simple Additive Weighting(IT2 FSAW) as to deal with uncertainty and vagueness. The new IT2 FSAW is applied to establish a pref-erence in ambulance location. The decision making framework deﬁnes four criteria and ﬁve alternativesof ambulance location preference. Four experts attached to a Malaysian government hospital and a uni-versity medical center were interviewed to provide linguistic evaluation prior to analyzing with the newIT2 FSAW. Implementation of the proposed method in the case of ambulance location preference suggeststhat the ‘road network’ is the best alternative for ambulance location. The results indicate that the pro-posed method offers a consensus solution for handling the vague and qualitative criteria of ambulancelocation preference./C2112017 The Authors.

1. IntroductionAmbulance services and paramedic are very signiﬁcant in soci-ety as they could save hundreds of lives daily by responding toemergency calls. They operate from stations that normally locatedin diverse areas to a medical center or hospital. With the assistanceof control centers that responded to emergency calls, ambulancesare dispatched when required. Ambulances are not always basedin a building, but often at a very rudimentary location, such asparking lots[1]. More importantly, they are periodically rede-ployed to ensure a better coverage at all times. According to astudy[2], a facility (ambulance) that is near a request point pro-vides a better quality of coverage to that demand point than a facil-ity situated a long way from that request point. Generally,ambulances do not patrol on streets between calls, but once theydispatched to the scene of an incident, they may be diverted to amore important call. Study of ambulance is part of emergencymedical services (EMS). EMS is deﬁned by the National Board ofHealth and Welfare as ‘‘health care provided by healthcare profes-sionals within or adjacent to the ambulance” [3]. EMS is one the essential measures to optimize the safety of patients and also forsustaining human well-being. EMS is known as pre-hospital treat-ment and also known as services provided by hospital for emer-gency services to transport patients with illness and injuries tothe hospital immediately to reduce patients’ mortality, disabilityor suffering[1,4]. Management of the efﬁcient EMS system is verycritical and deserves particular attention by system planners [5]. The availability of an ambulance at a location may inﬂuence achance of survival despite the minute difference of ambulance’sarrival. Ambulance location is in a stochastic environment wherethe request calls arrive at the control center in a random manner.Travel time for a certain journey may contain randomness; the ser-vice time at the request call’s scenes and hospitals is also uncer-tain. The above mentioned typical process of ambulance requestand ambulance fulﬁllment processes as well the uncertain environ-ments complicate the process of determining the strategic locationfor ambulances.Recently, many efforts have been made to strengthen emer-gency management, particularly with respect to the placement ofambulances. A parallel tabu search heuristic [6,7], and stochastic

optimization model[8,9]and local search heuristic[10]are among the methods used in redeployment problem for a ﬂeet of ambu-lances. Recently, a study[11]proposed a dynamic ambulance man-agement model for relocating idle ambulances that incorporatedifferent performance measures related to response times. Study[12]used approximate dynamic programming (ADP) to solveambulance dispatching and relocation problem. The ADP modelhas reduced the response time in the city of Vienna, the capitalof Austria to 12.89%. This improvement is due to the main sourcefor improvement which are the dispatching and relocation deci-sions. Study[13]adapted maximum expected coverage locationproblem model to determine the strategic location for a mobileambulance in Shah Alam Selangor. Study [14]successfully imple- mented maximal covering location problem using local Open-StreetMap geodata together with Dijkstra, Quick Hull and GreedyAdding algorithms to solve the ambulance location selection inJohor Bahru Malaysia. Very recently, [15]analysed relocation strategies of ambulances using Double Standard Model to ensurea fair comparison of their performance. The above review supportsthe assertion that ambulance location management is tantamountto operational research problems. According to [16], emergency management is often conceptualized as a complex multi-objective optimization problem where an emergency situation issolved with limited resources. Therefore, the ambulance locationproblem is indeed a problem where multiple qualitative resourcesneed to be considered concurrently.It is shown that the existing literatures mostly deal with aspeciﬁc operation, including ambulance placement with the aimto make an improvement for EMS. The methods used for theimprovement varied from typical operations research methods tocomputational intelligence methods depending on respectiveresearch frameworks. However, the methods of multi-criteria deci-sion making (MCDM) in the case of ambulance locations are rarelydiscussed despite the multiplicity in ambulance locations andqualitative criteria. Simple additive weighting (SAW) is one ofthe weighted based MCDM methods. This method is also knownas a weighted linear combination or scoring method. One of theadvantages of SAW method is proportional linear transformationof the raw data where the relative order of magnitude of the stan-dardized scores remains equal. This method was used by [17]to accelerate the mechanism through eliminating unnecessarytrade-offs. By using SAW method, a combined consequence ofissues having high variation was obtained. As an extension ofSAW, another weighted based MCDM method is fuzzy simple addi-tive weighting (FSAW). The FSAW method depends on fuzzy num-bers rather than the crisp numbers. It utilizes trapezoidal fuzzynumbers to show any imprecision in scores and weights. The FSAWmethod applies fuzzy weighting to approach experts’ preferences.In literature, the FSAW has been successfully applied in diverseapplications (see, for example,[18–23]. However, in many practi- cal cases, it is pretty challenging for experts to express their pref-erences using one layer fuzzy membership function of type-1fuzzy sets (T1 FS). Most of the existing FSAW methods are builtfrom linguistic terms based on T1 FS. In reality, some decisionmight not be given as an exact relative crisp scale. The linguisticinterval scales are used instead. The authors decide to use intervaltype-2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FS) scale for expressing linguistic evaluationdue to the fact that the IT2 FS provides more ﬂexibility to presentuncertainties than T1 FS. Furthermore, IT2 FS can be used as anindicator of uncertainty where the larger length of the intervalmay capture more room of uncertainty that happened during theprocess of information gathering from the decision makers [24]. In this paper, the authors are motivated with the advantages ofthe FSAW and IT2 FS and desirous of exploring the possible mergerof these two entities in MCDM framework. This proposed methodcan be seen as a FSAW framework where interval type-2 fuzzynumbers are used in linguistic scales. The introduction of IT2 FSin the FSAW gives a new look to the FSAW framework. The pro-posed method of interval type-2 FSAW is an extension of intervalfuzzy additive weighting where T1 FS is substituted with IT2 FS.An IT2 FS is described by the footprint of uncertainty where thisfootprint is bounded by the lower membership function and uppermembership function[25]. This footprint adds a new description ofuncertainty. In addition, rather than the direct computation of typ-ical defuzziﬁcation method, our proposed method applies thefuzzy ranking method as to reduce T2 FS to T1 FS. This proposedapproach allows each decision matrix is made with trapezoidalIT2 FS as a measurement scale instead of using classical trapezoidalfuzzy numbers to represent the judgment scales and the weights ofcriteria. Unlike the FSAW method, we used the fuzzy ranking
method based on IT2 FS as a reduction method. By incorporatingfuzzy ranking method, this method offers a more detailed andcomprehensive procedure. Although we used the IT2 FS linguisticscales and fuzzy ranking method, the proposed method is madewithout loss of generality the FSAW procedure. The proposedmethod could be employed to solve ambulance placement problemwhere limited qualitative resources and stochastic environmentare present. The proposed method also inclusively considersexperts’ ambiguities, uncertainties and vagueness in evaluatingambulance location. Speciﬁcally, this paper aims to develop anew FSAW decision making method based on IT2FS (IT2 FSAW)and its application to a case of ambulance location preference inEMS management. The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-lows. In Section2, we present some basic notations and deﬁnitionsthat are needed in this paper. In Section 3, we present the proce- dures of the proposed method based on fuzzy SAW, IT2 FS andfuzzy ranking method. The proposed method is then applied tothe case study for evaluating ambulance location preference. Theimplementation of this application is presented in Section 4. Sec- tion5concludes.2.

UsPeAUsÞ¼0:5:These preliminaries are being used in the development of thenew proposed IT2 FSAW.3. The proposed methodThe fuzzy simple additive weighting (FSAW) was introduced tohandle uncertainty in linguistic judgment [29–32], where fuzzy numbers are employed instead of the crisp numbers. In evaluationprocesses of decision making, the fuzzy set theory is germane tosubjective judgment and quantitative assessment compared toclassical evaluation method which is applying crisp values[33,34]. The FSAW utilizes trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to showany fuzziness in scores and weights. Unlike FSAW, the intervaltype-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are utilized in the proposedmethod. The proposed method encompasses three stages. In theﬁrst stage, the evaluations of alternatives with respect to criteriaand weights of criteria are expressed in IT2 FS. In the second stage,the weight for each criterion is computed with the aim to constructweighted decision matrices. In the third stage, ranking ofalternatives is determined using the fuzzy ranking method. Thesix-step procedure that considered the three stages is proposedas follows.Step 1:Establish a committee of experts who are familiar andexperienced with an MCDM problem. Identify the criteria tobe used in the MCDM evaluation. Introduce the linguistic vari-ables to access criterion importance or degree of importance forindividual criteria.Step 2:Construct the decision matrixY

Application to ambulance location preferenceA committee of four experts has been identiﬁed and was invitedto provide a qualitative evaluation using linguistic variables per-taining to EMS. The experts were interviewed in four different ses-sions in order to tap their evaluation regarding the preference ofambulance deployment with respect to the criteria in EMS. The lin-guistic evaluation is truly practical, especially in the presence ofqualitative criteria[18]. The experts in this case are a medical ofﬁ-cer at a public university medical center, an emergency depart-ment ofﬁcer and two medical ofﬁcers attached to the emergencydepartment of a government funded hospital in Kuala Terengganu,Malaysia. All the four experts have more than ﬁve years of experi-ence in ambulance management and emergency department. Pro-ﬁles of the experts are presented in Table 1. The experts are required to evaluate the relative measurementof alternatives with respect to criteria using interval type-2 linguis-tic terms. The alternatives of the case are road network ðA

Study[13]used government buildings and petrol sta-tions as their landmarks in order to determine the strategic loca-tion for mobile ambulance. Studies [37,38]investigated the location of the ambulance cases along the highway with the pur-pose to reduce the mean user response time and the inequalityof the ambulance workloads. The hierarchy structure of the deci-sion making problem is depicted in Fig. 3.

(0.3896), represents slightly higher than other alternatives. There-fore, theA
1is the best ambulance location for deployment of anambulance. The order of the rest alternatives is public clinic, parkinglot, petrol station and highway. This preference order is obtainedfrom the implementation of the proposed method with the linguisticdata. It is better to have a comparable analysis as to check theconsistency of the preference order. The similar linguistic data setsare iterated to two other MCDM methods. Speciﬁcally, the proposedmethod is comparable with FSAW and IT2-FTOPSIS. The summary ofthe preference orders of the proposed method against the other twomethods is presented inTable 7.The preference orders of the proposed IT2-FSAW method andthe other two methods are slightly inconsistent. The FSAW utilizedlinguistic terms represented by T1 FS where its membership func-tions are totally crisp thereby, it is weak in handling uncertainty.The limitation of T1 FS saw the preference order obtained usingFSAW method is slightly inconsistent with the result obtainedusing the proposed method. As IT2 FSAW, the IT2-FTOPSIS alsoused the similar IT2 FS, but they differ in weight determinationfor each criterion. This might explain the small inconsistency inpreference orders among the three methods.5. ConclusionsLocating ambulance is one of the most important issues in theemergency management. Due to rapid growth of population, manyresearchers initiate work to identify the most strategic location indeploying ambulances, which in return, can beneﬁt the residents.Hence, ambulance services are urged to seek and recognize the suit-able and strategic location for the beneﬁt of people. At the sametime, the services also may minimize the loss of precious life. A goodambulance location can guarantee the arrival of an ambulance to theemergency call scene within a deﬁned time threshold. Because oftime pressure, lack of experience and personality, experts often eval-uate the criteria and alternatives in the case of ambulance locationusing the linguistic variable. In this paper, we have proposed aninterval type-2 fuzzy simple additive weighting to evaluate ambu-lance location selection. The linguistic scale of interval type-2 fuzzyset was used contrary to crisp numbers and type-1 fuzzy numbers toexpress the experts’ evaluation for alternatives with respect to crite-ria and the weights of each criterion. The use of interval type-2 fuzzysets makes the decision process considerably more practical. Fuzzysimple additive weighting was employed to compute the weightsof criteria and fuzzy ranking method was adopted to rank the alter-natives of strategic ambulance location. The proposed method hasthe ability to capture the vagueness of human thinking style andeffectively solved multi-criteria decision making problems of ambu-lance location selection. Particularly, it provides emergency depart-ments with a ﬂexible manner to evaluate the strategic area forlocating ambulance under fuzzy environments. It was consensualTable 6Final evaluation results.

Perhaps a reliable validating mechanism,such as sensitivity analysis could be introduced to investigate thestability of the suggested method. The implementation of the sug-gested method to other real applications is still open for furtherinvestigation.References
