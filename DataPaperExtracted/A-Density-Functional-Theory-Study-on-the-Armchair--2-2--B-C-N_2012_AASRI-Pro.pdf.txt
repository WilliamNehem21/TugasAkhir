Abstract 
The ultra long tube models of single walled armchair (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes with different ratios of B, C and N atoms were studied with density functional theory of B3LYP/3-21G* and the periodic boundary conditions. The (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes have specially serrated tube structures. The energies were calculated and the band gaps of tubes were within 0.062 eV to 3.874 eV showing metal, semiconductor or insulator conductivity.

1. Introduction The ternary system boron carbide nitride (B-C-N) nanot ubes have attracted extraordinary attention in past ten years in virtue of  potentially interesting properties. The tubes synthesized by CVD experiment were found to be of semiconductor conductivity[1]. Photolumines cence studies revealed that aligned B-C-N nanotubes were also semiconductors exhibiting a band gap of 1.0eV[2]. Additionally, BC
2N nanotubes might act as blue and violet light emitting materials such as an efficient field emitter[3–4].

The thinnest armchair carbon nanotube of (2,2) tubes was supposed in multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) preparation[5] and the cluster models of (2 ,2) tubes was studied by theory method[6]. In present work, the (2,2) B-C-N tubes with different atom ratio or the isomers with different atom arrangement were studied in the ultra long tube models, it was extended the research to their structure and band structure. 2. Calculation method The density functional theory functional (B3LYP 3-21G*) and periodic boundary conditions (PBC) for one-dimensional models were employed by the Gaussian series packages[7] in this paper. All the tube structures, model energies and the band gaps were obtained by the theoretical calculation for optimized models. 3. Result 3.1. Structure parameter For the (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes with different atom ra tios (the C atom ratios of 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4) and  different atom arrangements, eight stable models were found and examined as shown in Figure 1(a) to (h). The tube structure parameters optimized with B3LYP/3-21G* were listed in Table 1.

As shown in figure 1, the (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes ha ve serrated tubular structures as the pristine (2,2) carbon nanotube(CNT)[8]. It was found that there were two different kinds of chemical bond, which were the perpendicular (circumferential) bond lengths L
1(the subscript 1 denotes the bond being perpendicular to the tube axis) and the oblique(axial) bond L
2(the subscript 2 denotes the bond being oblique with respect to the tube axis), respectively. For most of (2,2) B-C-N models, L
1were larger than that of the pristine (2,2) CNT where L
1=0.1373 nm but  L 2 were smaller than that  of the (2,2) CNT where L 2=0.1512 nm[8]. The cross sections of (2,2) B-C-N tubes were distorted. Tube larger diameter (D
L) or smaller diameter (D S) of tube models denoted the largest or shortest distance  of two atoms in a same cross section. The slightly distorted models were with the values of D
L/DS being 1.070 for the models BC 6N(II) but larger values of D
L/DS being 1.212 for the models B 4C2N2(II).  The Mülliken atomic charges were obtained. The doped atom B were found to be positive values (about 0.66~0.85e) and those of the N atom were negative value (about -0.82~-0.59e), respectively. The Mülliken charge was negative value for C atom adjacent to B atom but positive value for them adjacent to N atom. The results were in accordance with the electrone-gativities of B, C and N atoms (respectively being 2.04, 2.55 and 3.04 on the Pauling scale) [9]. 359  Yanli Wang et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   3  ( 2012 )  357 – 361

3.2. Energy The doping energy (
Ed) as shown in Eq.  (1) denoted the energy change between the doped and the pure cells averaged for each atom in the gas phase. 
Ed = [E d,BxCyNz-NT  – E CNT + (n atom-y)E C atom  – (x E B atom +zE N atom )] / n atom                              (1) in which, E
d, Ed,BxCyNz-NT  and E CNT denoted the energies of the unit cell model of the respective the (2,2) B-C-N nanotube and the pristine CNT; E
C atom , EN atom  and E C atom  denoted the energies of the single atom B, N and C; n
atom(i.e., n atom =x+y+z =8 for (2,2) tube) was the number of the total atoms in a unit model. The doping energies 
Ed for the (2,2) B-C-N nanotube models obtained by Eq.(1) were detailed in Table 2.  It was obvious that the model (I) where the C atom ratio being  3/4 (i.e., BC
6N(I) and BC 6N(II)) were the more stable conformation due to the lower doping energies 
Ed. For the same atom ratio models, Ed of (I) was lower than (II) and (III), representing that the model (I) was the most stable conformation.

3.3. Energy gap The one-dimensional  band structures of armchair (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes in the Brillouin zone for different models were shown in Figure 2. The energies of the high occupied crystal orbits (HOCO) ( E
HOCO), the low unoccupied crystal orbits (LUCO) (E
LUCO) and the band gap (E g= E LUCO - E HOCO) were detailed in Table 3. The default k point of wave vector was adopted in this work. 
 point was the centre of the first Brillouin zone and 
 point to X point was a half of Brillouin zone. It was found the models of B 2C4N2(I), B 4C2N2, B
3C2N3(I) and B 3C2N3 (III) have direct band gaps where the maximum of valence bands (occupied bands described by solids curves) and the minimum of conduction bands (unoccupied bands described by dashed curves) being in a same k point. For the rest models, the band gaps show indirect gaps where the maximum of valence band and the minimum of conduction band being in different k point. The maximum of direct band gaps for the most of models were at X point besides of the models of B
2C4N2 and C 2B3N3(II).
