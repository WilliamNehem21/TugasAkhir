transmission charges. The main transmission pricin g methodologies are embedded cost and incremental pricing methodology. Countries like Colombia, UK and Brazil, have used long run marginal cost (LRMC) methodology due to its easy implementation. On the other hand countries like Argentina, Chile and Panama adopting marginal participation method. Power flow tracing provide us a complete view of usage allocation problem which is very important for transmission cost allocation. When usage allocation is known it is straightforward to allocate the transmission cost  to generators and loads.  The first attempt to trace power flows was done by Bialek et al. when Topological Generati on Distribution factors based Power flow tracing were proposed in March 1996 [2] which explained the method for tracing generator's output. They introduce a simple topological method of tracing the flow of real and reactive power in transmission networks. In Feb 1997,
 Kirschen et al. [3] explained a power flow tracing method based on the proportional sharing assumption which introduces the concept of domains, commons, and links. In Nov 2000, Gubina et al. [4] described the method to determine the generatorsтАЩ contribution to a part icular load by using the nodal generation distribution factors. In Aug 2000, Wu et al. [5] explained the use of graph theory to calculate the contributions of individual generators and loads to line flows and th e real power transfer between individual generators and loads. In 2009 Xie et al.[6] proposed and explained the power flow tracing algorithms founded in the extended incidence matrix considering loop flows.  Similarly many different loss allocation schemes have  been proposed for transmission loss allocation. The existing transmission loss allocation methods may be cl assified into prorata method, marginal methods, power flow tracing-based methods, and circuit theory based methods [1]. A usage based transmission loss allocation method is proposed in [7]. In [8] method based on ci rcuit theory and the concept of orthogonal projection for pool based electricity market is proposed. Due to deregulation, the number of interaction entitles on the electric grid increases dramatically. At the same time capacity margin reduced. Hence this rapid growth threatened reliability of transmission network greatly. ThatтАЩs why transmission reliability margin allocation should be addressed in a fair way. Many researchers proposed methodology which incorporate reliability cost element in total transmission cost. For this first usage and TRM allocation is done. In [9] Silva et al. considered the transmission network operation under normal as well as contingency condition for allo cation reliability cost to users. In [10-11] D. Hur et al. proposed various variants of procedures to allocate reliability contribution to market participants. This paper presents a model of usage, loss and transmission reliability margin allocation based on the concept of the matrices methodology. In the proposed method modified Kirchhoff matrix is developed for usage allocation. After that loss allocation matrix is formed for transmission loss allocation to loads and generators. Further by incorporation (n-1) reliability criteria, maximum flow of transmission lines is calculated. After that the TRM of every transmission line is allocated to generators by using modified Kirchhoff matrix. 2.

In this paper authors adopt the tracing procedure which is proposed in [6]. But authors modified this tracing algorithm for transmission loss allocation.3.1 Model for Power Flow Tracing The procedure for power flow tracing is same as preaented in [6]. Power flow allocated to ge
 nerators from the lines flow as shown in Eq. (5). It is assumed that a ╚╜
рне╟г╚╜рм╡ (23:77) split in the transmission usage occurs between generators and demand. For example the generator sha re situated as bus s to the line s-t is given by 
рнз╒Ырн▒рм┐рн▓р╡М┬Црнзрн▒рн▒рн▓┬Грне                                                                       (5) 
Hence eq. (5) gives the generators share in lines flows. Similarly, the usage allocated to a load for the use of all lines can be defined by using ╚╜
рм╡ instead of╚╜ рне. For calculating the loads shares in line flows and generated power same procedure is followed.      P
L=PLL(рнлрм┐рм╡сИ╗рнЛ                                                                    (6) 
Where the diagonal matrix P LL= diag (P L1, PL2, тАж., P Ld)  and R= R=P LL (рнлрм┐рм╡сИ╗7is the extraction factor matrix of loads from generators [6]. By using an ex traction factor matrix, loads share in generating power and line flows is calculated. 3.2 Model for Transmission Loss Allocation For transmission loss allocations to generator con sider Eq. (5). In this equation line flows P
st is replaced by the transmission Loss in lines which is coming from the elements of the Kirchhoff loss matrix. Hence transmission losses of line s-t allocated to generator located at bus i is given by:       
рнз╒Ьрн▒рм┐рн▓рнзр╡М┬Црнзрн▒                                                                       (7) 
Similarly transmission losses of line s-t allocated to load situated at bus j is given by:                                                                         
рни╒Ьрн▒рм┐рн▓рнзр╡М┬Фрнирн▒                                                                         (8) From  the equations (18) and (19) losses are allocated to  generators and loads respectively. This method of loss allocation is said to be direct because all the calculation is already done for usage allocation.      3.3 Model for TRM Allocation For transmission reliability margin allocation to generator and load, considered eq. 5,  TRM = maximum capacity of the line in p.u. тАУ usage of the line in p.u. 
ij ij TRM = 1- pf                                                                              (9) Where for a particular line the calculation of TRM has considered Maximum capacity of the all line is 1 p.u. In this equation line flows is replaced by the transmission reliability margins in lines which is coming from the elements of TRMij. Hence transmission reliability margin of line s-b allocated to generator located at bus i is given by: 

4. Result and DiscussionThe proposed matrices methodology is applied to the sample 6 and IEEE 14 bus power system to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the methodology. A computer program coded in MATLAB is developed. 98   Baseem Khan et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   7  ( 2014 )  94 тАУ 100 
4.1Sample 6 Bus System4.1.1 Transmission Usage Allocation The sample 6 bus power system is used to illustrate the proposed methodology. The summation of powers extracted by the load buses from all the generators equals the total load demand similarly the addition of powers contributed by the generator buses to all th e demands equals the total generation power. Table 1 gives the generators contributions to losses and line flows.Total system losses occurred in the system is 0.084697 pu from which 23% is allocated to generators and 77% is allocated to demands.

4.1.2Transmission Reliability Margin  Allocation From the equations (10) and (11) TRM are allo cated to generators and loads respectively. From the table 2 it is observed that the generators which contribute more power to line flows, have more TRM allocated. Also table 3 provides a comparison between TRM allocat ed by proposed method and method presented in [11].

4.2 IEEE 14 Bus System 4.2.1Transmission Usage Allocation The proposed method is also applied on IEEE 14 bus system [12]. Authors assume that cost of the line is proportional to the length of the line. After this the share of each generator (load) in load (generator) and line flows is calculated. Fig 2 gives generators shares to various line flows respectively. Y axis shows the usage allocation in MW and x axis provide no of lines.

4.2.2Transmission Loss Allocation Fig 3 presents the transmission loss allocation between generators respectively. Total system losses occur in IEEE 14 Bus system is 15.87016 MW. 23% of total losses i.e. 3.70114478 MW is allocated to generators and 77% i.e.  12.16902 is allocated to loads.

5. Conclusion In the proposed work authors presents a combined methodology for the transmission usage, loss and reliability margin allocation which is based on the matrices methodology. This method is simple and easy to implement in large power system. Furthermore tran smission loss and reliability margin allocation by this method is direct because all the calculation previously done for usage allocation. This method requires less 100   Baseem Khan et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   7  ( 2014 )  94 тАУ 100 
calculation as compared to other methods such as Topological generator distribution factors proposed by Bialek [4] because matrix inversion is required only one time. Further TRM allocation by this method is more as compare to method presented in [11].
