1. IntroductionIndia is a rice-growing country with a wide range of rice varietiesadapted to wide spectrum of agro-climatic conditions. As a result, thecrop has become a host for a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses, allof which have a negative impact on crop productivity and survival.Realizing the economic losses caused by them, efforts have been madeto comprehend the importance of integrated and automated paddycrop management for the timely intervention and mitigation of thestresses. Furthermore, experts and politicians are also concernedabout improving paddy production and yield. The agricultural expertsidentify the stress categories by the visual inspection of individualpaddy plant leaf which is subjective and tedious in nature. The paddycrop stresses have a complicated composition, and their presentationin different paddy crop varieties is very similar, making classi ﬁcation challenging. The goal of quickly identifying crop stress has variousadvantages for potential farmers and agriculture science researchers.Crop yields can be effectively increased by intervening early and miti-gating stress-related issues using suitable crop management strategiesthat take advantage of technology. This necessitates ongoing study inagriculture science and technological adoption.In agriculture, emerging technologies such as Big Data, MachineLearning, and the Internet of Things have been widely used to improveall parts of rice production processes, ushering in a new era of smartfarming. Signiﬁcant gains in agricultural tasks have been noticed as aresult of innovations in AI-based deep convolutional neural networks.Plant disease recognition, crop/weed separation, fruit grading, andland stat classiﬁcation are just a few examples of agricultural applica-tions where CNNs achieve human-level accuracy. Several improve-ments have been made in the architecture of CNN with the gradualincrease in the number of layers to make CNN scalable to multiclassproblems. The most popular CNN models are GoogLeNet, AlexNet,Inception-V3, VGG-16, DenseNet-128, and ResNet-50. One of the appli-cations under consideration in this work is the processing of images ofArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 6 (2022) 167 –175

Literature searches have been conducted in this regard tolearn about recent deep learning applications in the core topic of thecurrent research.A pre-trained VGG-16 model is deployed for automatic recognitionand categorization of diverse paddy crop biotic and abiotic stressesusingﬁeld images. To illustrate the technological viability of applyingthe deep learning method, researchers have used 30,000 ﬁeld images fromﬁve different paddy crop varieties with 12 different stress classi ﬁ- cations. An average classiﬁcation accuracy of 92.89% is achieved ( Anami et al., 2020b). An upgraded VGG-19 model which was pre-trained onImageNet public image dataset is deployed for the classi ﬁcation ofﬁve categories of paddy crop stresses using leaf images. The augmentedimage dataset is used in the experimentation. An average accuracy of92% is obtained (Chen et al., 2020). Different CNN models are employedfor the identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of plant diseases. The VGG-16,Inception-V4, ResNet, and DenseNet models have deployed to experi-ment on the PlantVillage image dataset which includes 38 differentcategories of diseased and healthy leaf images from 14 different plants.It is reported that DenseNet provides a better classi ﬁcation accuracy score of 99.75%, outperforming the other architectures ( Yakkundimath et al., 2022). Four prominent CNN models are used to construct an auto-mated wheat disease diagnosis system. There are 50,000 labeled imagesof healthy and afﬂicted wheat crop leaves in the image dataset. Thegreatest average recognition accuracy of the VGG-16 model is 97.95%(Lu et al., 2017a). The LeNet-5 and AlexNet models are employed forpaddy crop disease identiﬁcation using an image dataset containing500 images of stable and diseased rice leaves and stems. An averageidentiﬁcation accuracy of 95.48% is achieved using the AlexNet model.The work has also showed that the stochastic pooling techniqueimproves the CNN model's generalization ability and avoids over-ﬁtting (Lu et al., 2017b). Theﬁeld images are used to identify 12categories of biotic and abiotic paddy crop stresses using conventionalimage classiﬁers such as Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN),Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbor ( k−NN). The maximum average classiﬁcation accuracy achieved by the BPNN classi-ﬁer was 89.12% (Anami et al., 2020a).The usefulness of pre-trained deep learning CNN models forconstructing non-destructive and cost-effective systems to automatethe identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of rice crop diseases can be seenwith a literature review. Using traditional image processing techniques,signiﬁcant attempts have been made to automatically identify and clas-sify paddy crop diseases from individual leaf images ( Huang et al., 2015; Mohan et al., 2016
;Mohanty et al., 2016;Orillo et al., 2014;Pugoy and Mariano, 2011;Phadikar et al., 2012;Phadikar et al., 2013;Sethy et al., 2020). The literature survey reveals the potential of pre-trained deeplearning CNN models in the recognition and classi ﬁcation of paddycrop diseases from the public image datasets ( Hughes and Salathé, 2015;Saleem et al., 2020;Yakkundimath et al., 2022). This has stimulated interest in developing a sophisticated paddy crop stress rec-ognition system for use in developing crop management strategies.There are four sections to the paper. The proposed methodology ispresented inSection 2. The classiﬁcation results of the considered CNNmodels are described inSection 3. The work's conclusion is presentedinSection 4.2. Proposed methodologyThe overall methodology for the study is depicted in Fig. 1.T h eﬁrst step is to select an image dataset that depicts various biotic diseases onrice crop leaves. The next step is to label or annotate the training dataset.The learned CNN models' performance is then assessed on the testingimage dataset. The hyper parameters are adjusted to improve the CNNmodels' performance. Finally, the different CNN models' classi ﬁcation performance is compared.2.1. Image datasetFor dataset preparation,ﬁve popular paddy crop varieties, namely,Jaya, Abhilasha, Mugad Suganda, Mugad 101, and Mugad Siri areconsidered. The images were captured in the ﬁeld under natural light condition near solar noon which is the period with the most consistentillumination using a Nikon D3300 Digital SLR camera having a resolu-tion of 60 megapixels. Some of the stressed paddy crop images areimported from PlantVillage image dataset. The PlantVillage is an openlyand publicly available dataset that includes 54,306 images and 26 dis-eases affecting 14 different plants. The image dataset comprises a totalof 3355 images, among which 523 images of Brown Spot symptom,565 images of Hispa pests, and 779 images of Leaf Blast symptoms.The remaining 1488 images are from a healthy paddy crops. Fig. 2 shows some images of paddy crops that are affected by various stresses.The original image dataset comprising a total of 3355 paddy crop im-ages are enhanced to 26,840 using various classical image augmentationtechniques such as translation, arbitrary rotations, shearing, scaling andﬂipping. The images collected from the dataset are of different sizes. Theimage size is reduced to 400 × 400 pixels for minimizing the computa-tional time required for further processing and their storage on themedium. The dataset is partitioned into three sub-datasets: 70% fortraining (18,788 images), 20% for validation (5368 images), and 10%for testing (2684 images). The details of the ﬁnal image dataset used in the work are depicted inTable 1. The images collected from the dataset are of different sizes. The image size is reduced to 400 × 400pixels for minimizing the computational time required for furtherprocessing and their storage on the medium.

1693. Experimental results and discussionThe paddy crop biotic stress classiﬁcation experiments are con- ducted using the Deep Learning Toolbox provided by MATLAB 2021bprogramming platform. The considered pre-trained CNN models areimported and prepared them for transfer learning by editing suitablelayer properties using Deep Network Designer application. In all themodels, the last learnable layer and output or classi ﬁcation layer are re- placed to match the classes in newly constructed paddy crop bioticstress image dataset. All the CNN model training and testing operationsare performed on a single workstation running on Windows 10 operat-ing system, conﬁgured with Intel Core i7 –11,700 processor, 16 GB of RAM, and NVIDIA GPU with 12 GB memory. To get control over modeltraining, the signiﬁcant training options such as initial learn rate, valida-tion frequency, number of epochs, and mini-batch size are initialized to0.0001, 10, 30, and 32 respectively. All hidden layers are activated usingthe‘ReLu’function, while the output layer is activated with the ‘softmax’ function. The network isﬁne-tuned using a stochastic gradient descent(SGD) algorithm with a categorical cross-entropy logarithmic loss func-tion. Batch normalization is applied to improve overall accuracy andfaster learning.The customized CNN models are trained and validated using theaugmented image dataset as depicted in Table 1. The individual CNN model training progress, validation accuracy, loss, and other details oftraining are graphically shown inFigs. 3–7.Fig. 8shows the confusion matrices for the considered CNN models when evaluated with the testimage dataset. The performance comparison of all the CNN models isaccomplished based on the evaluation metrics such as precision, recalland F1 scores derived from the confusion matrices. The evaluation met-ric scores and its computation time per epoch obtained by all the con-sidered CNN models for the four classes of paddy crop images aretabulated inTable 2.Table 2shows that the ResNet-50 model has thebest performance, followed by the DenseNet-128, MobileNet,Inception-V3, and VGG-16 models in that order. The ResNet-50 modelhas yielded the highest evaluation metrics as well as the maximum val-idation and testing accuracies of 96.65% and 92.61%, respectively andreasonable computing time to attain best in classi ﬁcation performance. The performance comparison results of all the considered pre-trainedCNN models are graphically shown in Fig. 9.4. ConclusionsThe effectiveness of contemporary transfer learning models such asInception V3, VGGNet with 16 layers, ResNet with 50 layers, DenseNetwith 121 layers and MobileNet with 28 layers in the classi ﬁcation of paddy crop biotic stresses onﬁve paddy crop varieties is explored inthe present work. Fine-tuning and evaluation of state-of-the-art deepconvolutional neural network models are utilized to determine thebest model. In the classiﬁcation of four categories of paddy crop stresses,including the healthy crop category, the RestNet-50 modeloutperformed all other models with the highest average classi ﬁcation accuracy of 92.61% by learning over 26,840 images. The ResNet-50 andDenseNet-128 models have nearly identical classi ﬁcation results. How- ever, when training and testing times are taken into account, theResNet-50 model is effective. Since the work considers a larger numberof CNN models for the task of image-based paddy crop biotic stressesclassiﬁcation, the results are promising. But, work needs to be carriedout as future research is in improving the computational time. In the
present work, there is a scope for adding new stress categories as wellas enhancement of existing dataset with signi ﬁcant number of stressed paddy crop images. The work can be empowered with the sensorTable 1Summary of paddy crop stress image dataset.Sl.no.Paddy cropbiotic stressclassesNumber of imagesPaddy cropspeciﬁcimagesAfteraugmentationTrainingimagesValidationimagesTestingimages1 Brown Spot 523 4184 2929 837 4182 Hispa 565 4520 3164 904 4523 Leaf Blast 779 6232 4362 1246 6244 Healthy 1488 11,904 8333 2381 1190Total Number ofImages3355 26,840 18,788 5368 2684
