users to click links attached in legitimate looking or spam emails and make them to visit the malicious sites. It initiates them to click, urges them to give their personal information. Phishing attacks are referred as Lure, Hook and Catch (Jacobsson and Myers 2007). Spoofed E-Ma ils poses to be from legitimate company seeking sensitive information. These email addresses are called the ‘Lure’. E-mails with malicious URLs may have legitimate content in the body of the mails which are unable to be detected by content based spam filters. The URLs lead to the actual Phishing sites which are clones of legitimate websites and lure the users into entering sensitive information. The actual phishing websites are the ‘Hook’ which obtains the private information from the user. The malicious user poses various critical c onditions such as account suspension, failed transaction and forcing user to upgrade the newly installed security feature. The links in the email leads to fake phishing site referred as ‘Catch’. The legitimacy of the webs ite may not be displayed by the browser which outlooks the phishing websites as legitimate. In some cases, the user also overrides the browsers decision. 2. Existing solutions  Blacklists may be in the form of IP addresses or webs ites used by email filters and block the users through an available list of IP addresses or websites. PhishNet (Pawan et al 2010) enhances existing blacklists by discovering related malicious URLs. One major problem with blacklists is that they fail to identify phishing URLs in the early hours of a phishing attack because their update process is insufficiently fast. Phishing campaigns have an average life of less than two hours (Sheng et al 2009) and by the time a phishing website is positively identified and blacklisted, it would have almost hacked. Various features are extracted from URLs which includes suspicious characters, number of do ts in the URL, hexadecimal characters, IP addresses and length of the URL. Colin Whittaker et al (2010) discussed a scalable machine learning algorithm to automatically classify phishing pages by training the classifier on noisy dataset. The false positive rate is below 1% and the classifier is based on Google’s phishing blacklist URLs. Justin Ma et al(2009) discuss a method to detect malicious websites by analyzing lexi cal and host based features based on passive aggressive algorithm. The improvement can be obtained by analyzing the features of page content and pagerank. Zhang et al (2007) proposed a content-based method  using a linear classifier and achieved 89% TP(True positive) and 1% FP(False positive).The test case was demons trated for 100 phishing URLs and 100 legitimate URLs. CANTINA+ (2010) classifies phishing URLs and the feature set is more exhaustive and obtained a classification accuracy of 92.3%. There exist various related researches and case studies conducted on analyzing the feature set required to reduce the exhaustiveness and time consumption. Maher Abburrous et al (2010) attempted a survey to identify the required features which helps to improve the accuracy and the precision of detecting malicious URLs. Various sources of phishing attacks are obtained from APWG’s archive(2011) and Phishtank archive(2012). The features are listed in Table 5.1.

The above selected features ( ) display high impact in various studies as mentioned in the literature and hence the feature set comprises features whose impact is greater than 20%.This involved the host based features, lexical features,page rank and suspi cious keywords in the mail for better performance. 
3. URL analyzer Phishing URLs can be analyzed based on the lexical features and host based features of the URL. The lexical feature analyses the format of the URL. URLs cont ain the host name and the path. For example, consider  ‘www.annauniv.edu/emmrc/emmrc.html’,  the host name is www.annauniv.edu and emmrc/emmrc.html is the path. The proposed methodology an alyses host based features such as Pagerank and age of domain, various lexical based features such as URL encoding, presence of suspicious characters, hexadecimal character or malicious IP addresses to hi de them and analyses the word probabilities to find whether the email contains any suspicious links to avoid end users falling by phishing attacks as illustrated in Fig 1. Itis useful as illegitimate users spoof their id entities, pass authentication tests and during content analysis also it may get escaped by avoiding spam ke ywords. Some emails may not contain any message in the body except some malicious links in it urging the users to click them leading to fraudulent websites.  128   Dhanalakshmi Ranganayakulu and C. Chellappan  /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  125 – 131 
     
Fig 1 URL feature extraction 
3.1 Lexical Features (F 1)  Lexical features analyses the format of the URL. It in cludes the length of the host name, length of the URL, the number of dots, presence of suspicious characters such @ symbol, hexadecimal characters and other special binary characters such as (‘.’, ‘=’, ‘$’, ‘^’ and etc.) either in the host or path name. IP addresses and hexadecimal characters are used to hide the actual URLs. For example consider the URL http://www.bankingcompany.com/online /transaction/website/phishing.html” which is shortened using the IP address http://132.115.201.115 which looks like legitimate and not suspicious. The URL can also be represented using hexadecimal base values with a ‘%’ symbol. It may represent any special characters Spoofguard (Neil Chou et al 2004) identified the ‘@’ an d ‘-’ symbol most prominent in phishing URLs. A @ symbol in a URL will enable the URL at the left to discard which is legitimate URL and right to enter into the phishing site. Consider the URL http://www.citibank.com@phishingsite.com” will enter into “phishing site.com” and discards “www.citibank.com”. These ki nds of techniques use the actual phishing website to disguise and pose as legitimate sites.  3.2 Host Based Features  Host based features identify the location , owner and how malicious sites are hosted and managed. Some of the features are as follows  3.2.1 Age of domain (F
2) Age of the domain is used to identify when malicious websites are hosted such that they have less age or relatively new to obtain the user credentials. They will be recently registered sending more mails and some domains may not be available even at the time of checking . It obtains the data in the number of months and some may be in years more recently. The WHOIS lookups on the WHOIS server is used to retrieve the domain registration date, and if the domain registration entry is not found on the WHOIS server, this feature will simply return-1, deeming it suspicious. 3.2.2 Page rank(F
3) Page rank provides the rank for the webpage and proves higher the page rank, the more important is the page. Obviously phishing web pages have less age of do main  and short lived. Hence they obtain a very low page rank or page rank does not exist.  Page rank is a link analysis algorithm first used by Google, in which each document on the web is assigned a numerical weight from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating least popular and 10 129  Dhanalakshmi Ranganayakulu and C. Chellappan  /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  125 – 131 
meaning most popular. A score value of 1 is assigned when the page rank value for a particular webpage is not available. After examining the dataset, 1000 phishing mails and 1000 legitimate mails the percentage of emails matching the Lexical and Host based features are listed in Table 2.

Has “Hexadecimal” Character 0% 0.01% 
Has suspicious character ‘@’ symbol 0% 0.01% 
More No. of Dots 0.01% 0.06% 
Suspicious Age of Domain  35% 75% 
Page rank< 3 feature  1.2% 88% 
3.3 Number of Sensitive Words in URL  3.3.1 Individual occurrences(F
4)and Co-Occurencesof suspicious phishing keywords (F 5) Abu-Nimeh et al (2007) used the “bag-of-words” ap proach with a list of 43 most frequent words as features in a machine learning approach. Garera et al (2007)  used a set of eight sensitive words such as secure, account, update, login, sign-in, banking, confirm and Verify that frequently appear in phishing URLs. The system is trained with 1000 phishing emails to give we ights to the suspicious words found in the phishing e- mails. The count of most occurring words includes Secu re, Account, Update, Login, Verify ,Signin, Banking, Notify, Click, Inconvenient, password etcand their Co-Occurencesin the phishing mail. 3.4Approach -Bayes ClassifierBayes classifier is adapted in spam filters such that individual features of URLs are distributed independently of the values of other features. Bayes theorem is used to calculate the probability of hypothesis for the event B, provided with the training data A,  
                                                                          (1.1) It is often easier to calculate the probabilities,
, P(A), P(B) for the probability that is required. Extrapolating Baye’s rule, assume that legitimate and phi shing websites occur equal in number and hence with equal probability, then the posterior probability that the feature vector X belongs to a malicious URL is such that  
                                                                                       (1.2) 
                                                                         (1.3) 
                                                                                       (1.4) where, P(A) = Probability of feature F in phishing and legitimate dataset. 130   Dhanalakshmi Ranganayakulu and C. Chellappan  /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  125 – 131 
. 
 P(B(Phishing)) = P(B’(Legitimate)) = 0.5 The classifier has a training dataset of malicious phishing URLs and legitimate URLs. The probability occurrence of each feature in the dataset are calculated and their respective scores are obtained (i.e) Count up occurrence of features in the dataset and calculate the cumulative score. If Cumulative score > Threshold, consider as phishing URL else legitimate URL as illustrated in Fig2 .

Hence the URL analyzer method with the help  of minimized phishing feature set identifies the malicious URL in the emails. The datasets are obtained from two sourcesviz DMOZ Open Directory Project and Phishtank(2012). Phishtank is a source of blackliste d phishing URLs which admits user inputs and they are also verified by users. An E-Mail server has been  configured with hMail namedas SSE Mail Server for the testing purposes. The false positive rate refers to the nu mber of legitimate emails classified as phishing emails, and false negative rate refers to the number of phishing emails classified as legitimate. The Table 3 shows that out of 1000 Phishing mails with malicious URLs, the above results were obtained for identifying various lexical and host based features.
