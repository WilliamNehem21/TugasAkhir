Keywords:Moisture contentPotatoAdaptive neuro fuzzy inference systemsArtiﬁcial neural networkResponse surface methodologyThe use of artiﬁcial intelligence models in predicting the moisture content reduction in the drying of potato(Ipomoea batata) slices was the focus of this work. The models used were adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems(ANFIS), artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) and response surface methodology (RSM). The parameters consideredwere drying time, drying air speed and temperature. The capability and sensitivity analysis of the three modelswere evaluated using the correlation coef ﬁcient (R
2) and some statistical error functions such as the average rel- ative error (ARE), root mean square error (RMSE), Hybrid Fractional Error Function (HYBRID) and absolute aver-age relative error (AARE). The result showed that the three models demonstrated signi ﬁcant predictive behaviour with R
2of 0.998, 0.997 and 0.998 for ANFIS, ANN and RSM respectively. The calculated error functionsof ARE (RSM = 1.778, ANFIS = 1.665 and ANN = 4.282) and RMSE (RSM = 0.0273, ANFIS = 0.0282 and ANN =0.1178) suggested good harmony between the experimental and predicted values. It was concluded that thoughthe three models gave adequate predictions that were in good agreement with the experimental data, the RSMand ANFIS gave better model prediction than ANN.© 2020 The Authors.

1. IntroductionThe need for food security is one of the global challenges of our time.In addition to insufﬁcient production of needed agricultural products,one of the major challenges with the issue of food security is inadequatepost-harvest processing and insufﬁcient preservation techniques. This isin addition to the fact that most of the agricultural food crops are perish-able and seasonal. If these agricultural products are not adequately pre-served and stored, they will spoil and become unhealthy for humanconsumption. Food preservation is very important because it enhancespreservation, storage and easier transportation of such agriculturalproducts while mitigating unexpected rise in prices of agricultural prod-ucts (Akinola et al., 2006).Spoilage of agricultural products is caused mainly by the activities ofthe microorganisms and enzymes in the food. The growth of the micro-organisms normally leads to faster rate of spoilage. The presence ofwater in the form of moisture content is the major factor that aids thegrowth and activities of the microorganisms because it increases theirmetabolic activities. Without water or in the presence of limited amountof water, agricultural products will become inhospitable for the micro-organism and inhibit their growth and activities thereby preservingthe product for a longer time (Rajeev et al., 2012). The sweet potato (Ipomoea batata)i sh i g h l yn u t r i t i o u sa n di sr i c hi ncarbohydrates, digestive starch, essential amino acid, etc. It equally con-tains some important elements such as calcium, iron, potassium etc.which are necessary for proper maintenance of the human body.Nigeria is one of the biggest producers of potato. Ugonna et al. (2013) reported that Nigeria is the fourth biggest producer of potato in Sub-Saharan Africa with production yield of about 843,000 t per year. Themajor drawback in potato production is that it decays easily after har-vesting due to its high moisture content which aids the growth and ac-tivities of microorganisms. Hence, there is need to increase itspreservation especially through drying.Drying is one of the post-harvest handling processes that involvesthe removal of moisture from products due to simultaneous heat andmass transfer (Onu, 2017). Drying is a thermo-physical process thatcan reduce the moisture content to a minimal acceptable limit that hin-ders the growth and activities of microorganisms in agricultural prod-ucts (Ravinder et al., 2014;Sajith and Muraleedharan, 2004;Shahzad et al., 2013;Wankhade et al., 2012). Moisture content removal shouldbe done in such a manner that desired quality of the product is not af-fected for prolonged time (Correia et al., 2015;Brooks et al., 2008,Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 39 –47

This will lead to more ef ﬁcient and cost ef- fective preservative method.Response surface methodology (RSM) is an advanced tool for devel-oping, improving and optimizing a process where an output variable de-pends on several input variables (Nwabanne et al., 2017;Mansour and Mostafa, 2011). RSM reveals the interactive relationships between theprocess parameters and needs only relatively few experimental runsto determine the optimum response and propose a predictive model(Adepoju and Olawale, 2014;Ohale et al., 2017). As an improved sys- tematic approach to process variation, RSM considers all the input var-iables involved simultaneously and their effect on the response in a waythat is difﬁcult to depict with mathematical formulations ( Onu, 2014; Okpe et al., 2018). RSM has been used in optimizing several processessuch as the extraction ofTerminalia catappaL. kernel oil (Agu et al., 2020); in predicting the optimum process parameters for productionof activated carbon from rice husk (Iheanacho et al., 2019), in adsorp- tion of malachite green using Nteje clay ( Onu and Nwabanne, 2014), in optimizing chromium VI reduction by isolated acinetobacter ( Nur et al., 2019), in determining the optimum extraction yield of Ferulago angulatathrough supercriticalﬂuid (Gholamhossein et al., 2016). Artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) is an information processing para-digm whose functioning is inspired by the technique used by the brainand other biological nervous systems in processing information ( Assidjo et al., 2008). It was derived from artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) research in the efﬁcient description of multivariate nonlinear processes with ade-quate data and the application of correct training algorithm ( Mingyi et al., 2017). An artiﬁcial neural network usually has input layer(consisting of the input variables), hidden layers (neurons), and an outputlayer (the output). ANN is usually applied in complex systems because itis robust and effective with special ability to describe nonlinear relation-ships between the independent variables and the dependent variable bythe training and retraining of the input-output systems ( Nur et al., 2019;Pareek et al., 2002). Artiﬁcial Neural network modeling is essen-tially black box in nature with the major merit being that it employs mul-tiple input variables in predicting output variables even without priorknowledge of the process relationships ( Mojtaba et al., 2012). Further- more, in application of engineering to agriculture, it serves as a better al-ternative for conventional empirical modeling based on linear and/orpolynomial regressions (Ngankham and Ram, 2011). ANN was employed in predicting the quality characteristics of apples during convective dehy-dration (Karina et al., 2013), in optimum extraction of artemisinin fromArtemisia annua(Josh et al., 2014
), in predicting the microwave-assisted extraction procedure (Mansour and Mostafa, 2011). Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) is an adaptive net-work that is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system ( You et al., 2017). It is an artiﬁcial intelligence model that has effective self-learningfunction and mechanism (Ling et al., 2014). ANFIS is a nonlinear compu- tational intelligent system that adapts itself by forming rules to survivewith changing environment and uncertainty. It is a synergetic system offuzzy inference and artiﬁcial neural network that uses a generated in ﬂu- ential tool from numerical data to predict output ( Adem et al., 2018; Ling et al., 2014). The major strength of ANFIS is that it enhances fuzzycontrollers with self-learning capability for achieving minimum steadystate error (Kiran and Rajput, 2011).Therefore, the aim of this work is to contribute to the ongoing effortsin ensuring food security by modeling the predictive behaviour of mois-ture content reduction in potato drying using ANN, RSM and ANFISmodels which will enhance the post-harvest preservation of potato.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sourcing and preparation of samplesFresh potato tubers used in this work were sourced from the localEke Awka market in Anambra State, Nigeria. The tubers were washed,peeled, sliced to a thickness of 1.5 mm. The slices were then washedto remove dirt.2.2. Drying experimental procedureThe drying experiment was conducted using a conventional hot-airdryer fabricated in Faculty of Engineering, Nnamdi Azikiwe Univeristy,Awka, Nigeria. One of its features is that the temperature and air veloc-ity can be regulated. One hundred grams (100 g) of the sample was usedfor each run of the experiments. The fan and heater were started andallowed to run without load until a stabilized (steady) drying tempera-ture and air speed were observed in the drying chamber. Thereafter, thedrying chamber was loaded with the samples for the experiments. Theactual temperature of the drying chamber was 30 °C lower than the settemperature of the dryer. The speed of the air was measured by a speedmeter (hot wire anemometer, model 20004 AHYK, China), with the pre-cision of 0.01 m/s, while the temperature was measured by digital ther-mometer and the mass of the sample was obtained using a digitalweighing balance (M-Metlar, model M311L, China). Three replicatesof the experiments were conducted and the average used to reduce ex-perimental error.2.3. Determination of moisture contentThe moisture content was determined by using the gravimetricmethod as given in eq.1.MC¼M1−M 2
M2/C2100 ð1Þwhere MC is the moisture content of the sample after drying in dry basis(d/b), M
1is the initial mass before drying, M 2is the mass after oven drying.2.4. RSM, ANN and ANFIS modelingThe three most commonly used RSM methods are the Box-Behnken,central composite design (CCD) and the factorial design ( Mohammad et al., 2014). CCD is aﬁve-level design that incorporates the axial pointsin the design of the experimental runs while the Box-Behnken and thefactorial design are three-level designs. The RSM modeling was per-formed by applying the CCD. This was done to study the interactive ef-fects of the independent input variables on the moisture content whichserves as the response. The independent input variables were dryingtime (minutes), drying air speed (m/s) and drying temperature (°C).These independent variables were varied at ﬁve different levels: +1 and−1 (factorial points), 0 (center point) and + αand−α(axial points). The coded values of the process parameters were determinedby the equation given byRajeshkannan et al. (2012)in Eq.(2).N

Onu et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 39 –47The aim of the optimization was to minimize the moisture contentwhich will increase its shelf life and preservation. Design expert version11.0.1 was used in generating the factor levels and the experimentalruns, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis.The quadratic model was used to express the behaviour of the sys-tem response which is the moisture content (Y) as a function of the in-dependent input variables in Eq.(3). The input variables were dryingtime (X
1), drying air speed (X 2) and temperature (X 3).Y¼β

c
is the number of center points or null points chosen. The term 2ncorre- sponds to the core (factorial) points, 2n corresponds to the star-like oraxial points and n
ccorresponds to the center points. Therefore, byusing six (6) center points, a total of twenty (20) experimental runswere utilized in the optimization process. This consists of 8 core points,6 star-like points and 6 center points. The distance of the star-like point,α, used was 1.316. The center points aids in minimizing experimentalerror while allowing the reproducibility of the data ( Khodadoust et al., 2014). The star-like points or axial points were used for the rotatabilityof the experimental runs which makes the variance of the model predic-tion to be equidistant from the design center ( Sahu et al., 2010). The ex- periments were performed in random in order to avoid systematicerror.The acceptability of the quadratic model depended on the p-value of the analysis of variance and the value of the correlation coef ﬁcient (R
2). The difference between the experimental and the predicted values wasutilized in determining the signiﬁcance of the regression model ob-tained. The three-dimensional (3D) surface plots were employed inthe study of the interactive effects of the input variables.The ANN and ANFIS were simulated by utilizing the Neural Networkof MATLAB 8.5 software 2015 version. The ANN design can be satisfacto-rily modeled using the RSM generated experimental data ( Mourabet et al., 2014;Nazerian et al., 2018). Thus, twenty (20) experimentalruns were used in the ANN modeling. The input layer consisted of dry-ing time (minutes), drying air speed (m/s) and temperature (°C) whilethe corresponding moisture content served as the target or output layeras seen inFig. 1.A b o u t7 0 %o ft h ee x p e r i m e n t a lr u n sw e r eu s e dt ot r a i nt h en e t -work, 15% was used in testing the network while the remaining15% was used to validate the result. These represented 14 experi-ments, 3 experiments and 3 experiments respectively. AccordingtoKiran and Pragnesh (2016), using more data sets in training re-duces processing time in ANN learning and improves the generali-zation capability of models. The 15% used in testing the networkwas to provide an independent measure of network performanceduring and after training. In the validation, the networkgeneralization was measured by network validation and haltedwhen generalization stopped improving in order to avoid overﬁtting.The learning algorithm utilized in modeling the ANN process wasthe Levenberg-Marquardt. In order to enhance reduction of networkerror, the response and the input variables were normalized between0a n d1(Mourabet et al., 2014).Trainlm was used as the training func-tion because it regularizes the bias value using the algorithm of theLevenberg-Marquardt.The appropriate number of hidden neurons was determined by trialand error method with the aim of getting the lowest possible error be-tween the predicted and the measured values. Large number of neuronsleads to unwanted over-ﬁtting and complicated network topologywhile very few neurons reduces the convergence rate of the network(Mingyi et al., 2017).The ANFIS model was stimulated as a ﬁve-layered neural net- work that employed the fuzzy inference system principle. Fig. 2is the ANFIS architecture. The nodes in the ﬁrst andﬁfth layers repre- sent the overall input and output variables respectively. The nodesin the second layer acted as the membership function for the inputvariables while the neurons in the third layer represented fuzzyrules indicating the preconditions and the consequences of therules. Each individual node in the fourth layer was an adaptivenode with a node function. Theﬁfth layer was made up of onlyone node that gave the summation of the incoming signals as theoverall output.The model predictions by the RSM, ANN and ANFIS were comparedby plotting the comparative parity plots of the model prediction withthe experimental data. Equally, some statistical models were used toevaluate the magnitude of the error between the experimental valuesand the predicted values.In addition to the correlation coefﬁcient (R

Experimental resultThe experimental result of the design matrix together with thecoded and actual factors was given in Table 2. The experiments were used to evaluate the single and interactive effects of the drying time,drying air speed and drying temperature on the moisture content re-duction of potato. The lowest moisture content of 18.9% dry basis (db)was obtained at drying time of 180 min, drying air speed of 3.5 m/sand dryer temperature of 90 °C.3.2. Modeling and prediction using RSMThe linear, two factor interaction (2FI), quadratic and the cubicmodels were compared to determine the model that best describedthe drying process inTable 3. The suggested best model was based onthe model with the lowest standard deviation value and the highest cor-relation coefﬁcient. The cubic model was aliased because the CCD doesnot contain enough runs to support a full cubic model ( Oguanobi et al., 2019). The modelﬁtting using regression analysis showed thatthe quadratic model best described the relationship between the outputand input variables with relatively high correlation coef ﬁcient (R
2)o f0.9961 and standard deviation of 1.49. The same trend of quadraticmodel was reported in extraction of artemisinin from Artemisia annua (Josh et al., 2014)The adjusted R2of the quadratic model was 0.9925 which was ingood agreement with the predicted R
2of 0.9651. The adjusted R2was very close to R
2which indicated good correlation of experimental data(Samaram et al., 2015;Mazaheri et al., 2017;Betiku and Ajala, 2014). The relatively small PRESS statistic of 196.92 suggests that the quadraticmodel bestﬁts the data point and can be used to navigate the designspace (Nwabanne et al., 2017). Therefore, the quadratic regressionmodel of the drying process was given in their actual values in Eq. (2). The regression terms with positive sign indicated synergistic effect,while those with negative sign indicate an antagonistic effect ( Onu and Nwabanne, 2014).

Onu et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 39 –47Thep-value gave information whether a statistical hypothesis is sig-niﬁcant or not and how signiﬁcant it is (Agu et al., 2020). The model F- value of 280.27 andp-value ofb0.0001 showed that the quadraticmodel chosen was signiﬁcant. The individual model terms were testedfor their signiﬁcance based on thep-values of each term. A signiﬁcance level of 95% was chosen hence, all the terms whose p-values are b0.05 were signiﬁcant otherwise, they were termed insigni ﬁcant (Gholamhossein et al., 2016).Relatively lowerp-value and higher F-values showed better signi ﬁ- cance effect of the model term on the response ( Josh et al., 2014;Tan et al., 2008). Therefore, all linear terms of drying time (X
1), drying air speed (X
2) and temperature (X 3), the interactive terms of X 1X2,X1X3
and X 2X3and the squared terms of X 12and X 32were signiﬁcant. Only the squared model term of X
22was found to be insigniﬁcant. The model term found to have the signiﬁcant effect on the response was drying time (X
1) followed by temperature (X 3) while the interaction of X
2X3and the squared term of X 32have the least effect on the response.The insigniﬁcant model term was eliminated and the ﬁnal quadratic model equation was given in Eq.(11).YMCðÞ¼þ165:02–1:3435/C2 1–6:332/C2 2þ0:7622/C2 3

12–0:012215/C2 32 ð11ÞThe coefﬁcient of variation (C.V.) of 3.06% obtained shows the repro-ducibility and repeatability of the quadratic model since its numericalvalue wasb10% (Chen et al., 2011). Adequate precision of 65.209 sug-gests adequate model efﬁcacy because it isN4(Oguanobi et al., 2019; Krumar et al., 2007).The Normal plot of Residuals and the Predicted vs Actual plots inFig. 3(a and b) are graphical estimations that compares of the natureof the residuals depicting the correlation between the experimentalvalues and the predicted value. The plot of predicted against actual re-vealed that the points were closely distributed to the straight line ofthe plot. Therefore, it is concluded that the residuals followed a normaldistribution (Iheanacho et al., 2019). The Normal plot of Residualsshowed that the points wereﬁrmly aligned to the straight line of theplot however; some little disperse like a “S”shape was observed as an- ticipated (Nwabanne et al., 2017). These plots show minimal diver-gence of the points from the diagonal.The response surface plots were utilized in investigating the mainand interactive effects between the combination of the independent fac-tors and the response (Iheanacho et al., 2019;Nwabanne et al., 2017). This was done by varying any two of the input variables while keepingthe other constant at its null point. The three dimensional (3-D) plots ofthe interactive effects are shown inFig. 4(a–c).Fig. 4is the interactive effect of temperature and drying air speed. The two factors showed sig-niﬁcant combined effect on the moisture content reduction of the dry-ing process. Minimal moisture content was observed at temperatureof about 75 °C and drying air speed of 2.5 m/s. The ﬁgure equally depicted that the combined effect was mainly as a result of singular ef-fect of temperature because the drying air speed showed little effect.Fig. 4b is the plot of the interactive effect of temperature and dryingtime whileFig. 4c is for drying air speed and temperature. These two ﬁg- ures show that the interactive effects of these combinations areTable 3Model summary statistics of the RSM.Source Standard deviation R-squared Adjusted R

Onu et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 39 –47relatively less signiﬁcant than that of temperature and drying air speed.It was found that increasing the drying time reducing the moisture con-tent of the potato slices. Again, drying air speed seems to have the leasteffect on the drying process among the three independent factors con-sidered. The elliptical nature of the 3D curves suggested good correla-tion between the two variables (Iheanacho et al., 2019). These results indicated that the quadratic model selected is appropriate for themodeling. Similar trend was reported by Oguanobi et al. (2019).3.3. Modeling and prediction using ANNThe drying process was equally modeled using the Arti ﬁcial Neural Network. As explained earlier, 70% of the experimental runs wereused for training of the neural network while the rest were used for test-ing and validation. This was to prevent over-training and over-parameterization (Jamil et al., 2018). The correlation coefﬁcient and the minimum value of mean squared error (MSE) were used as perfor-mance check to determine the optimum number of neurons in the hid-den layer. MSE is the mean squared difference of the output and input.Correlation coefﬁcient values (R
2) was used to validate the correlationbetween input variables and the output. These two were used to mea-sure the predictability of the artiﬁcial neural network (Agu et al., 2020). Through trial and error method, the number of neurons for opti-mal performance was obtained asﬁve in the trainlm algorithm. Gholamhossein et al. (2016)reported six neurons for efﬁcient extrac- tion ofFerulago angulata.Based on enough neurons (5) in the hidden layer and the consis-tency of the input data, a two-layer feed-forward neural network withsigmoid hidden neurons and linear output neurons were employed inmulti-dimensional mapping of the process inputs in Fig. 5. The regression plots with respect to the targets for the training, val-idation, testing and overall network process are presented in Fig. 6.Amean square error (MSE) of 0.0000396 and correlation coef ﬁcient of 0.99947 was obtained for the training. The correlation coef ﬁcient ob- tained was very close to that reported by Gholamhossein et al. (2016). Correlation coefﬁcients of 0.9343, 1.000 and 0.9698 were equally ob-tained for the validation, testing and overall neural network process re-spectively. Theﬁt is reasonably good for the data sets, with correlationcoefﬁcient values in each case were very close to unity. The data fell rea-sonably along a 45-degree line, where the network outputs were equalto the targets. Based on these performance values, it was concluded thatthe network response was satisfactory and that the output adequatelytracked the target in the drying of potato.The plot of the best validation performance was presented in Fig. 7. The performance of the network process for validation was analyzedto determine the reliability of the training process. The training networkshowed a validation performance with mean square error of 0.00656 atepoch 4. This did not indicate any over-ﬁtting problem with the training network since the error was very small.3.4. Modeling and prediction using ANFISThe ANFIS model was structured using a hybrid-learning algorithmthat encompasses the least square and the gradient method. Data

Fig. 5.The ANN network architecture showed ﬁve neurons in the hidden layer.44 C.E. Onu et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 39 –47normalization was implemented before the training of the ANFIS model.Twenty seven fuzzy rules, nine input membership functions and twentyseven output membership functions were employed as shown in Fig. 8. The training was completed at epoch 2 with average training error of0.03574 and average testing error of 0.57092. Kiran and Rajput (2011) reported a training error of 0.011555 at epoch 135 when modeling theeffectiveness of an indirect evaporative cooling system. The total num-ber of parameters was 54 which were evenly distributed between thelinear and nonlinear parameters. The ANFIS model predicted the mois-ture content with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.998.3.5. Comparison of the performances of the RSM, ANN and ANFIS modelsThe experimental values were compared with the predicted valuesof the RSM, ANN and ANFIS models in Table 5. In most of the axial and starlike combinations, the ANFIS model gave a residual of zero. Thehighest positive and negative residuals of 7.95 and−15.92 wereobserved in the ANN model. The three models were found to be reason-ably accurate in predicting the moisture content of the drying processthough the ANFIS with many residual of zero gave the best prediction.The predictive capacity of the models was evaluated with closenessof the correlation coefﬁcient to unity. Furthermore, smaller values ofARE, RMSE, HYBRID and AARE values indicates better predictive capac-ity. The statistical error analysis was given in Table 6. The R
2values of RSM and ANFIS were 0.998 showing better correla-tion than that of ANN which was 0.970. The ARE value of the ANFIS wassmaller than that of the RSM. The RMSE values were 0.0273, 0.0282 and0.1178 for RSM, ANFIS and ANN respectively. This result showed thatthe RSM and ANFIS gave better signiﬁcant prediction than the ANN in the drying of potato slices. RSM was reported to be better than ANN in op-timizing the design parameters for a V perforated baf ﬂe(Sunil, 2015) though in most other cases, ANN gave a better prediction than RSM.3.6. Model optimization and validationOptimum moisture content value of 31.995% was predicted at a dry-ing time of 180 min, drying air speed of 3.5 m/s and dryer temperatureof 60 °C. The test re-test experimental validation technique wasemployed in validating the predicted optimal value. The experimentwas carried out in triplicate and an average value of 32.65% was ob-tained. This showed close agreement with the predicted optimal value.4. ConclusionRSM, ANN and ANFIS models were used to predict the moisture con-tent reduction of potato slices in a hot-air drying process. CCD wasemployed in the RSM analysis where a quadratic model with R
2value of 0.9980 was obtained. Drying time had the most signi ﬁcant singular effect on the drying process followed by temperature. ANN model
