Article history:Received 19 January 2023Received in revised form 5 August 2023Accepted 13 August 2023Available online 14 August 2023Efﬁcient irrigation management of urban landscapes is critical in arid/semi-arid environments and depends onthe reliable estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET
o). However, the available measured climatic data in urban areas are typically insufﬁcient to use the standard Penman-Monteith for ET
oestimation. Therefore, smart landscape irrigation controllers often use temperature-based ET
omodels for autonomous irrigation scheduling. This study focuses on developing deep learning temperature-based ET
omodels and comparing their performance with widely used empirical temperature-based models, including FAO Blaney & Criddle(BC), and Hargreaves & Samani (HS). We also developed a simple free and easy-to-access tool called DeepETfor ET
oestimation using the best-performing deep learning models developed in this study. Four arti ﬁcial neural network (ANN) models were developed using raw weather data as inputs and the reconstructed signal obtainedfrom the wavelet transform as inputs. In addition, long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network(NN) and one-dimensional convolution neural network (CNN) models were developed. A total of 101 active Cal-ifornia Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) weather stations were selected for this study, with>725,000 data points expanding from 1985 to 2019. The performance of the models was evaluated against thestandard CIMIS ET
o. When evaluated at the independent sites, the temperature-based DL (Deep Learning) modelsshowed 15–20% lower mean absolute error values than the calibrated HS model. No improvement in the perfor-mance of the ANN models was observed using reconstructed signals obtained from the wavelet transform. Ourstudy suggests that DL models offer a promising alternative for more accurate estimations of ET
oin urban areas using only temperature as input. The DeepET can be accessed from the Haghverdi Water ManagementGroup website:http://www.ucrwater.com/software-and-tools.html . © 2023 The Authors.

1. IntroductionThe FAO-56 Penman-Monteith is the accepted standardized methodto estimate the reference evapotranspiration, ET
o(Allen et al., 2005). Itaccounts for both energy and mass transfer processes to provide areliable estimation of ETo. However, it requires a wide range ofaccurate meteorological data such as air temperature, humidity, solarradiation, and wind speed. Therefore, its implementation in datascarce situations, such as landscape irrigation management in urbanareas, is challenging and limited. Promising results and signi ﬁcant water savings have been reported for landscape irrigation using smartevapotranspiration-based controllers with on-site weather sensors(Cardenas et al., 2021;Serena et al., 2020). These irrigation products often employ temperature-based ET
oequations in their scheduling algorithms due to the high cost of installing and maintaining acomplete weather station (Davis and Dukes, 2010). Furthermore, for smart controllers that rely on interpolated ET
ofor irrigation scheduling, air temperature data is widely available and spatiallyinterpolated more accurately than other weather parameters(Temesgen et al., 2005).Various studies have evaluated temperature-based ET
omodels (Djaman et al., 2015;Hope and Evans, 1993;Liu et al., 2017;Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 9 (2023) 61 –75

In California, data from CIMIS (California IrrigationManagement Information System) stations have been widely used toevaluate the suitability of empirical temperature-based ET
oequations (Hargreaves and Allen, 2003;Hope and Evans, 1993;Temesgen et al., 2005). Recent multiyear turfgrassﬁeld irrigation research trials inSouthern and Central California revealed accurate estimation of ET
oby the Weathermatic SL4800 smart irrigation controller using theHargreaves and Samani equation (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) compared to CIMIS ET
o(Haghverdi et al., 2021a, 2021b). However, the performance of ET
oestimation methods varies with climate and dataavailability (Djaman et al., 2015), and data requirements vary amongmodels. Therefore, it is vital to evaluate temperature-based ET
o
measurement methods and develop regional/site-speci ﬁc calibration equations, which can help users determine the best approach depend-ing on the availability of data and climate conditions ( Kukal et al., 2020;Long et al., 2013).Machine learning methods have also been proposed to estimate ET
o
based on temperature and solar radiation data ( Fan et al., 2018;Kisi and Alizamir, 2018). Algorithms such as artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) and a combination of wavelet analysis/transform (WA) with ANN, re-ferred to as WA-ANNs, have been explored in various hydrological stud-ies (Adamala, 2018;Adamowski and Sun, 2010;Chen et al., 2020; Evrendilek, 2014;Falamarzi et al., 2014;Kisi and Alizamir, 2018; Partal, 2009;Traore et al., 2016, 2010). The WA-ANN was introducedby (Zhang and Benveniste, 1992) as an alternative approach tofeedforward ANNs to denoise input data. Wavelets can also substitutefor activation functions in feedforward ANNs, referred to as WNNs(Alexandridis and Zapranis, 2013). More recently, deep learning (DL)methods have been used for time series predictions ( Han et al., 2021) and have shown better performance compared to other ML methods.Saggi and Jain (2019)found a superior estimation of ET
owith a deep feedforward ANN compared to other models such as the gradientboosting machine, the generalized linear model, and the random forest.In a study done in the Northeast plain of China, DL models such as tem-poral convolution neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory(LSTM) NN were found to outperform other temperature-based empir-ical models (Chen et al., 2020). The use of one-dimensional CNN models(1D CNN) for sequential or time-series data, such as ET
o,h a s demonstrated improved performance ( Ferreira and da Cunha, 2020). Among these methods, hybrid CNN and LSTM models have also beenused for ET
oestimation (Sharma et al., 2022;Yin et al., 2020). CIMIS data have been used in multiple studies for ET
oestimations using ANN, WA-based, and DL models ( Cobaner, 2013;Kişi, 2010; Partal, 2009;Sowmya et al., 2020). However, models are typically devel-oped using ET
odata obtained from a limited number of sites and testedon the same sites. For instance,Long et al. (2022)recently demonstrated the applicability of the ANN and LSTM models for ET
oestimation using data from two weather stations in China and suggested that thesemodels should be explored over more sites with varying climate condi-tions. Thus, a more extensive analysis of such methods is needed toevaluate the ability to produce generalized results over large regions.Furthermore, with some exceptions, little work has been reported onthe use of LSTM and CNN for ET
oestimation. A particular focus ontemperature-based models is required to assess their utility in urban ir-rigation management.The main objectives of this study are (I) to evaluate the performanceof two temperature-based empirical ET
omodels, (II) to develop calibration equations for the empirical temperature-based models forall climate divisions in CA, (III) to develop and evaluate the accuracyof deep learning approaches (ANN, WA-ANN, LSTM, and 1D CNN) forET
oestimations using different sets of input data, and (IV) validationof the empirical and DL ET
omodels developed in this study.2. Material and methods2.1. Study region and data sourcesThis study was carried out in California using data obtained fromautomated CIMIS weather stations managed by the California Depart-ment of Water Resources (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/). In general, ETo
rates peak during the summer months and are low during winterunder the Mediterranean climate of California, while precipitation isrestricted primarily to winter and spring. Annual normal (1991 –2020) minimum, maximum, and average temperatures vary from −6.8 to 18 °C, 2.5 to 32.8 °C, and−1.75 to 24.7 °C, respectively. Statewideannual precipitation is about 56 cm. A total of 101 active CIMIS stationswith available data ranging from 1985 to 2019 were selected. Approxi-mately 50% of the stations had 25 to 35 years of data, and the remainingstations had at least ten years of data to ensure that a wide range ofweather conditions and drought events were considered. Fig. 1shows the locations of the selected CIMIS stations within the California aridityindex map. The distribution of the weather parameters across theselected weather stations is shown in Fig. 2. Data quality was checked before modeling, and recordings with missing data were removed,and wind speed was limited between 0 and 20 m s
−1. The aridity index, which can quantify precipitation availability overatmospheric water demand, was created following the classi ﬁcation recommended by the United Nations Environmental Programme(UNEP) and using the CGIAR-CSI Global-Aridity Database ( Trabucco and Zomer, 2018). Most of the selected CIMIS stations belonged to thearid (n= 48) and semi-arid (n= 39) classes, while 4, 9, and 1 CIMISstations belonged to hyper-arid, dry sub-humid, and humid classes, re-spectively. The spatial dataset of the seven climate divisions of Californiawas obtained from the National Climatic Data Center- National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration (NCDC-NOAA). The climate divisiondata were used to perform a region-speci ﬁc performance assessment of the models evaluated in this study.2.2. Temperature-based empirical ET
omodelsThe following is a summary of the temperature-based empiricalmodels used in this study. We used Python programming language ver-sion 3.8 (http://www.python.org)t oc a l c u l a t eE T
ofor all selected CIMIS stations. Furthermore, linear calibration equations were developed forthe two regression-based models using the daily ET
odata for each climate division.The FAO 24–Blaney and Criddle method, BC (Allen and Pruitt, 1991; Donald Frevert et al., 1983;Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977) is a modiﬁed version of the BC equation that includes correction factors to adjust forlocal weather or climatic conditions.ET

Daytime wind speed (Ud) was obtained by multiplying the 24-h mea-surements of wind speed by 1.3 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977).

Deep learning modelsIn real-world applications, when all the necessary input variables areavailable, the application of FAO-56 Penman-Monteith as the standardphysically based model is suggested for estimating ET
o. Therefore, the main focus of this study was to develop and evaluate temperature-b a s e dd e e pl e a r n i n gE T
omodels. However, DL models with extra inputvariables, including relative humidity (RH) and wind speed (U) weredeveloped to compare the maximum achievable performance of eachDL approach.2.3.1. Artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) modelsTwo feedforward backpropagation ANN models were developedwith different combinations of input variables ( Fig. 3). One model used several inputs, including T
min,Tmax,Ta, RH, U, and R a,while theother model only had Tmin,Tmax,Ta,a n dR aas inputs. A total of 725,849 data points from 101 CIMIS stations were divided into ﬁve folds such that four folds were used for training and the remaininggroup (∼20% of data) for testing the models. In addition, 12.5% of thetraining set was used as cross-validation for training of the DL models,helping to terminate the training and avoid over ﬁtting. The maximum epoch (i.e., one cycle of a complete presentation of the training dataset through the learning process) was set to 1000; however, early-stopping was implemented when the loss function did not improvefor 20 consecutive epochs. By early-stopping the training of the model,the complexity of the model can be controlled, improving generaliza-tion (Yao et al., 2007). The model development process was repeatedﬁve times to ensure that data from all CIMIS stations had been in thetest set. This approach assessed the generalizability of the models, asdata from the same CIMIS station were never used in the training andtest set simultaneously. The ‘adam’optimizer function (Kingma and Ba, 2015) was used to train the feedforward ANN models, and the bestweights and biases were automatically loaded for testing. The activationfunctions were‘ReLu’and‘linear’for the hidden and output layers, re-spectively. The Python library TensorFlow (TensorFlow Developers, 2021) was utilized to develop the ANN models.The same steps as aforementioned were followed to developWA-ANN models using the reconstructed signals obtained from thewavelet transform. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was applied todecompose the climatic time series of input predictors by passingthrough a series of high-pass and low-pass ﬁlters, separated at different scales. The Daubechies (db10) family of wavelets with decomposition alevel of 10 (2–4–8–16–32–64–128–256–512–1024) was used. The orig- inal time series were decomposed into series of approximation(A) anddetail(D) subseries. The correlation coefﬁcient was computed between the ET
odata series and the decomposed subseries. The subseries with

63correlation coefﬁcient values greater than ±0.1 were recognized aseffective (Partal, 2009). The effective wavelet subseries were used toreconstruct the time series used as inputs to the ANN model. The Pythonlibrary Pywavelets (Lee et al., 2019) was used for this analysis.2.3.2. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network(1D CNN) modelsLong short-term memory (LSTM) layers are a type of recurrent unitoften used in deep learning algorithms. The memory element present inits structure enables it to detect long-term dependencies of sequentialtasks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), resulting in improved per- formance when dealing with time-series problems. Since the output ofan LSTM unit at time steptis a function of all the inputs from the previ-ous time step, it could be said that it has a form of memory. The LSTM unit preserves an internal state (long and short-term) across timesteps and produces an output.An LSTM unit consists of three gates that serve as controllers, asshown inFig. 4(a):•Forget Gate (f
t) - controls which parts of the long-term state should beforgotten.•Input Gate (i
t)- Controls which parts of theg(t) should be added to the long-term state.•Output Gate (o
t) - controls if/when the remembered value is allowedto pass from the unit.InFig. 4(a),‘*’and‘+’are the element-wise multiplication and addi-tion, respectively. Activation functions are sigmoid and hyperbolic tan-gent (tanh), andg(t) represents candidate context value. Thebyvalues are the output from the unit; the xvalues are the input to the unit,andcvalues are the context values. The output and context values al-ways feed their output to the next time step, and the context valuesallow the network to maintain the state between units.

64In short, an LSTM cell can learn to recognize a vital input (inputgate), store it in the long-term state, preserve it as long as it is needed(forget gate), and extract it whenever necessary. The LSTM NN architec-ture used in this study consisted of the input layer, a hidden layer with48 LSTM units, another dense hidden layer with 24 units and ReLUactivation function, followed by the output layer.CNN models are generally applied for image processing and arewidely known for extracting relevant features. However, one-dimensional convolutionalﬁlters (1D CNN) are used to analyze timeseries (Li et al., 2017). Theseﬁlters slide over the input data to capturepossible patterns in the time series. The main distinction of this tech-nique over previous ANN models is that 1D CNN extracts features of asignal by considering local information rather than the entire signal ineach network layer. The 1D CNN architecture used in this studyconsisted of the input layer, a hidden layer with 48 convolution ﬁlters (kernel size =3), a max-pooling layer (size = 2), a dense layer with24 units and ReLU activation function, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The input of the LSTM or CNN layer must be 3-dimensional followingthe format [samples, timesteps, features]. The timestep is equal to30 days, the sample is equal to a row in a dataset (e.g., an input andoutput sequence for a time series), and the feature is input in thedataset. Therefore, the multivariate time series in this study were splitinto multiple samples where each sample has a speci ﬁed number of time steps, and the output is ET
oat the last step. Thus, the input datadimension was [samples. 30, features]. The adam optimizer function(Kingma and Ba, 2015) was used to train the DL models and the bestweights and biases were automatically loaded for testing. The Pythonlibrary TensorFlow (TensorFlowDevelopers, 2021) was utilized to de- velop the ANN models. Two different combinations of input variableswere used for each method, resulting in four DL models evaluated inthis study. One model used inputs T
min,Tmax,Ta, RH, U, and R a,while the other model only had T
min,Tmax,Ta, and R aas input, as described in the previous section.2.4. Performance assessmentThe performance of the models was evaluated against CIMIS ET
o
data, a modiﬁed version of the Penman equation ( Pruitt and Doorenbos, 1977) that uses a wind function developed at theUniversity of California, Davis, and unique cloud factor values for eachstation location. Five statistical indices, including the root meansquared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error(MBE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efﬁciency (NSE), and coefﬁcient of determination (R2), were used to quantify and compare the performance of thetemperature-based models.RMSE¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

omodelsTable 1summarizes the overall performance statistics of all the em-pirical regression and ANN-based ET
omodels evaluated in this study. Fig. 5shows the scatter plots of the ET
oestimated by the models against CIMIS ET
o. The HS model (RMSE = 0.78 mm d−1;M A E= 0.56 mm d
−1) showed better performance among the empiricaltemperature-based models and resulted in a low magnitude of bias(MBE =−0.07 mm d
−1).Kukal et al. (2020)reported the underestima- tion of ET
oby the HS model in the arid, semi-arid, and dry subhumidsites of the US high plains region, while the overestimation of EToby the HS model was reported in the Sahelian climate by ( Djaman et al., 2015). The BC model (RMSE = 0.91 mm d
−1; MAE = 0.67 mm d−1), however resulted in overestimation of ET
owith MBE of 0.27 mm d-1. HS model has an NSE and R2 of 0.85 and 0.86, whereas it was 0.80and 0.91, respectively for the BC model.The ANN models can be ranked as ANN_all > ANN_T > WA-ANN_all> WA-ANN_T based on their performance. They showed high accuracyand reliability (generalizability), since data from the same CIMIS stationwas never present in the training and test set simultaneously. TheANN_all model (inputs: T
min,Tmax,Ta,Ra, RH, U) showed the best performance (RMSE = 0.51 mm d
−1; MAE = 0.35 mm d−1) followed

66by ANN-T (RMSE = 0.69 mm d−1;M A E=0 . 4 9m md−1). WA-ANN models that used reconstructed signals obtained from the wavelettransform resulted in 69% higher error than ANN models that usedraw data as input (Table 1). MBE values were negligible in all ANNmodels, indicating that there was no substantial over or underestima-tion of ET
o,as shown inFig. 5.T h eN S Ea n dR2values ranged from 0.77 for the WA-ANN_T to 0.94 for the ANN_all models. Models using recon-structed signal obtained from the wavelet transform performed reason-ably well with WA-ANN_all (RMSE = 0.96 mm d
−1;M A E=0 . 7 0m m d
−1) performing slightly better than WA-ANN_T (RMSE = 0.99 mmd
−1;M A E=0 . 7 3m md−1). Using the raw input data was a betterapproach than using the reconstructed signal in our study. This resultagrees with theﬁndings of (Falamarzi et al., 2014) but differs from the study by (Kisi and Alizamir, 2018), where ANN models with wavelettransform inputs did not have considerable differences from the modelsdeveloped using raw inputs.The DL models can be ranked as LSTM_all > CNN_all >LSTM_T > CNN_T based on their performance. They showed highreliability (generalization ability), since data from the same CIMIS sta-tion was never simultaneously present in the training and test set. TheLSTM_all model (inputs: T
min,Tmax,Ta,Ra, RH, U) showed the bestperformance (RMSE = 0.44 mm d−1; MAE = 0.30 mm d−1) followed by CNN-all (RMSE = 0.46 mm d
−1;M A E=0 . 3 2m md−1). Both the LSTM and CNN models had comparable performance. MBE valueswere negligible in all ANN models, indicating that there was no substan-tial over- or underestimation of ET
o,as shown inFig. 5. NSE and R2
ranged from 0.89 for the models with four inputs to 0.95 for thoseusing all six inputs.Overall, the DL models with relative humidity, wind speed, airtemperature, and extraterrestrial solar radiation as inputs surpassedother models in performance, such that LSTM_all >CNN_all >ANN_all.This was followed by models using air temperature and solar radiationas inputs such that LSTM_T > CNN_T > ANN_T > HS. All DL modelsoutperformed the HS model with similar input variables. There was a14%, 12%, and 11% decrease in RMSE for the LSTM_T, CNN_T, andANN_T models, respectively, compared to HS. Better performance inestimating ET
oby ANN and WA-ANN models compared to HS wasreported in the literature (Adamala, 2018;Traore et al., 2010). The supe- rior performance of the LSTM and 1D CNN models agrees with thestudies (Chen et al., 2020;Ferreira and da Cunha, 2020) where using a sequence of input variables (past information) to train the models re-sulted in an improved estimation of ET

673.2. Importance of input parametersHS model can be regarded as a truly temperature-based model sinceextraterrestrial solar radiation can be estimated based on the locationand time of the year. Global solar radiation is known to be a more criticalparameter than relative humidity and wind speed in estimatingdaily ET
o, based on a machine learning study conducted in China(Fan et al., 2018). However, daily ET
oanomalies strongly correlate with net radiation anomalies, relative humidity (RH), and cloud cover,and less with average daily air temperature ( Hidalgo et al., 2005). The temperature difference used in the HS model is an indirect measure ofcloud cover and RH at a location (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985). Clear sky conditions result in high maximum day temperatures and lowminimum night temperatures, whereas cloudy days result in relativelylower maximum day temperatures and higher minimum nighttemperatures.In our study, the ANN_all model using relative humidity, windspeed, air temperature, and extraterrestrial solar radiation resulted inbetter performance (27% reduction in MAE) than ANN_T, based ontemperature and extraterrestrial solar radiation. However, ANN_all re-quires more data, typically unavailable for ET
oestimation by smart controllers in residential areas. Many studies, with few exceptions, useR
sas an input to temperature-based models instead of R a.S i n c ew e used R
aas an additional input for the temperature-based models,which can be calculated following the equations given by Allen et al. (1998), the temperature is the only measured input required fortemperature-based models developed in this study. Partal (2009)re- ported no improvement in performance by the ANN and WA-ANNmodels over the HS model. On the contrary, the ANN_T model in ourstudy resulted in a 14% reduction in MAE compared to the empiricalHS model derived from the same inputs.Studies using DL models have reported great performance for ET
o
estimation using solar radiation and temperature as inputs ( Elbeltagi et al., 2020;Sowmya et al., 2020).Sowmya et al. (2020)used deep feedforward ANN models for ET
oestimation at two CIMIS stations andfound that global solar radiation and air temperature can provide com-parable accuracy to the models using a complete set of weathervariables as inputs. In our study however, DL models trained with acomplete set of variables resulted in better performance ( ∼35%reduction in MAE) than models using four inputs, although theperformance of DL models trained with four inputs was not substan-tially lower. Therefore, temperature-based DL can be adopted to obtainaccurate EToestimations for landscape irrigation management by smartweather-based irrigation controllers in data-scarce conditions in urbansettings.3.3. Temporal analysis of the ET
omodelsFig. 6shows the daily mean and standard deviation of the estimatedET
ovalues throughout the year by the models evaluated in this studyversus the CIMIS ET
o. The monthly performance statistics for eachmodel to estimate the monthly average ET
oare shown inTables 2 to 4. The HS (MAE: 0.10 to 0.31 mm d
−1) model consistently performed better throughout the year; however, had a high error in the springmonths relative to other months. The BC model (MAE: 0.08 to0.76 mm d
−1) model had a performance comparable to that of the HSmodel in the winter and spring months but performed poorly in thesummer months, also evident inFig. 6.The ANN-based models can be ranked as ANN_all >ANN_T > WA-ANN_all >WA-ANN_T. The ANN models showed negligi-ble bias throughout the year, with MBE ranging from−0.23 to 0.13 mm d
−1, whereas MBE ranged from−0.3 to 0.05 mm d−1for the HS empir- ical model (Tables 2 to 4). MAE values ranged from 0.05 to 0.14 mm d
−1
for the ANN models and from 0.13 to 0.29 mm d−1for the WA-ANN models. The better performance of the ANN models is also apparent inFig. 6, where the mean and standard deviation of the estimated ET
o
very closely to that of the CIMIS ET othroughout the year.The DL models can be ranked as LSTM_all > CNN_all >LSTM_T > CNN_T. All models showed negligible bias throughout theyear, with MBE ranging from−0.06 to 0.08 mm d
−1, better than the empirical and other ML models evaluated in this study ( Tables 2 to 4). MAE values ranged from 0.04 to 0.11 mm d
−1for the LSTM models and from 0.05 to 0.13 mm d
−1for the CNN models. The betterperformance of the DL models is also apparent in Fig. 6, where the mean and standard deviation of the estimated ET
omatch very closely with that of the CIMIS ET
othroughout the year.The relationship of MAE and MBE with the annual average of themeteorological parameters, including wind speed, was different. The

68HS model tended to have higher MAE with increasing wind speed,vapor pressure deﬁcit, and global solar radiation. Similarly, HS tendsto have a lower MAE with increasing relative humidity, whereasthese trends were not clear for the BC model. In the same way, HStend to underestimate ET
owith increasing wind speed, vaporpressure deﬁcit, and global solar radiation, as indicated by thedecreasing MBE. Furthermore, with increasing relative humidity, HSoverestimates ET
o, whereas MBE changed negligibly for the BC model.The HS model tended to underestimate ET
ounder high wind conditions (> 3 m s
−1) and overestimate ET ounder conditions of high relative humidity (Allen et al., 1998), which is also supported by our results. Reasons may include the continual mixing of warm, dryair from overhead into the equilibrium boundary layer at night,reducing the difference between the maximum and minimum airtemperature values (Temesgen et al., 1999).3.4. Spatial analysis of ETomodelsTable 5summarizes the performance of the models evaluated in thisstudy for each climate division. Also shown in Table 5are the coefﬁcients (i.e., A and B) of BC
faoaveraged for each climate division.The average values of these coefﬁcients across all CIMIS stations wereA=−1.96 and B = 1.37. Based on the effects of weather variables onannual ET
o(Figs. 7 and 8), it can be expected that the performance oftemperature-based ET
oequations will vary based on climate, i.e., morearid regions will tend to have higher error. The southeast desert basinhad the highest error among all climate divisions as it is the aridestregion of the state (Table 5).The HS model was the best performing empirical model in all cli-mate divisions with the MAE ranging from 0.47 to 0.73 mm d

ousing only temperature as input.3.5. ValidationTable 6shows the performance indices of the original/calibrated em-pirical models and the DL models developed in this study. Since waveletanalysis ANN models resulted in the worst performance compared toother DL models, these models are excluded from the validation. Empir-ical models calibrated using the coefﬁcients presented inTables 1 and 5 were evaluated at the validation sites. This analysis was performed toindirectly account for the meteorological variables not used in the Har-greaves equations, such as RH and U.Fig. 10shows the box plots for the models evaluated at the validation sites. We observed that the climatedivision-speciﬁc calibration, HS(cal
cd)w i t hM A E=0 . 6 6m md−1, performed slightly better than the original HS model (MAE =0.68 mm d
−1) which also concurs with the results from other studies(Kukal et al., 2020;Senatore et al., 2020); however, the performance im- provement was not substantial in our study. The original BC model re-quires information about relative humidity and wind speed as shownin Eqs.2a n d3. We obtained the average value of BC coef ﬁcientsAand Bfrom 101 CIMIS stations and used these values to calculate BC(cal),while the climate division-speciﬁc average was used to calculate BC(calcd). BC(cal cd)w i t hM A E=0 . 8 6m md−1resulted in comparable performance to the original BC model (MAE = 0.81 mm d
−1) for the validation sites.On the other hand, temperature-based DL models showed improvedperformance with ANN_T (MAE = 0.57 mm d
−1), LSTM_T (MAE = 0.54 mm d
−1), and CNN_T (MAE = 0.56 mm d−1), resulting in a 15%, 20%, and 17% reduction in the MAE, respectively, compared to the HS(cal
cd) model. The performance indices for the other DL models usingall weather inputs are also shown in Table 6. It is deduced that deep learning models can help estimate ET
oat a new location accurately. Furthermore, including the temporal information as inputs, forexample, in LSTM and CNN-1D models, does not result in a substantialimprovement in performance compared to ANN models.Readers should note that this paper only focused on ET
oderived from CIMIS stations because of its widespread use in irrigation schedul-ing and availability in various climate conditions ( Fig. 1). Meteorological data, speciﬁcally temperature data, are available from the highly densenetwork of stations from National Centers for Environmental Informa-tion (NCEI) by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA). However, most ET
oequations are developed using data fromirrigated agriculture crops, and CIMIS measures meteorological vari-ables in a“standardized condition”o naw e l l - w a t e r e de x t e n d e ds u r f a c eof green grass. In contrast, public weather sites often lie adjacent to

72asphalt, oiled or graveled lots, streets, roads, roofed structures, or withinnon-irrigated, non-cultivated lands (Allen and Pruitt, 1986). This must be considered since the choice of the ET
oequation depends signiﬁcantly on the origin and the environmental conditions of itsdevelopment. Therefore, future work in regional/site-speci ﬁc calibra- tion of temperature-based empirical models using data from these sta-tions might be helpful (Kukal et al., 2020;Long et al., 2013;Senatore et al., 2020).4. ConclusionThis study evaluated the performance of deep learning (DL) and twoempirical temperature-based ET
omodels at 101 active CaliforniaIrrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) weather stationsin California, using >725,000 observations from 1985 to 2019. The DLmodels outperformed the empirical equations and showed high gener-alizability when evaluated on the independent sites. Our results suggestthat using raw input data for ANN models is better than using the recon-structed signal obtained from the wavelet transform. Furthermore,using information about the last 30 days along with the input, as imple-mented in the DL models, surpassed other models in performance.The Hargreaves & Samani model was the best performing empiricalmodel across the seasons, years, and climate divisions, and further per-formance improvement can be achieved by using the climate division-speciﬁc calibration provided in this study. Since CIMIS stations aremainly located in arid/semi-arid regions in California, our models aremost reliable and recommended to be used in similar climate condi-tions. Nevertheless, the study offers a methodology that can be followedin other data-sparse regions. Considering the dif ﬁculty in collecting the meteorological input parameters like wind speed and humidity,

73calibrated Hargreaves & Samani, ANN_T, LSTM_T, and CNN_T modelsthat we developed in this study can be adopted for accurate estimationsof ET
oacross California. Extraterrestrial solar radiation (R a), another input in the temperature-based models, can be calculated based onlocation and time of the year following the equations given by Allen et al. (1998). Thus, these models only require on-site air temperaturemeasurements as inputs.The results of this study and the calibration information can be usedfor water resource management and irrigation scheduling by irrigation/agricultural experts for reliable EToestimations using temperature-based methods. More speciﬁcally, DL methods have the potential to bedeployed in various smart irrigation controllers that collect on-sitetemperature information for the estimation of ET
