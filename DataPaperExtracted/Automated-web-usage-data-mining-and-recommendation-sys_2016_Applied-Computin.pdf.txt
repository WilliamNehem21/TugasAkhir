1. Introduction
Data mining is the extraction of knowledge from large amount of observationaldata sets, to discover unsuspected relationship and pattern hidden in data, summa-rize the data in novel ways to make it understandable and useful to the data users[13,31,2]. Web usage mining is the application of data mining technique to auto-matically discover and extract useful information from a particular web site[2,22,30].
The term web mining was believed to have ﬁrst came to be in 1996 by Etzioni inhis paper titled ‘‘The World Wide Web: Quagmire or Gold mine’’ and since thenattention of researchers world over has been shifted to this important researcharea[26]. In recent years, there has been an explosive growth in the number ofresearches in the area of web mining, speciﬁcally of web usage mining.According to Federico and Pier[9], over 400 papers have been published onweb mining since the early paper published in 1990s.
The Really Simple Syndication (RSS) reader website was developed for the pur-pose of reading dailies news on-line across the Globe, but lack ways of identifyingclient navigation pattern and cannot provide satisfactory Real-Time response tothe client needs, so, ﬁnding the appropriate news becomes time consuming whichmakes the beneﬁt of on-line services to become limited. The study aimed at design-ing and developing an automatic, online, Real-Time web usage data mining andrecommendation system based on data mart technology. The system is able toobserve users/clients navigation behavior by acting upon the user’s click streamdata on the RSS reader web site, so as to recommend a unique set of objects thatsatisﬁes the need of an active user in a Real-Time, online basis. The user access andnavigation pattern model are extracted from the historical access data recorded inthe user’s RSS address URL ﬁle, using appropriate data mining techniques.
The K-Nearest Neighbor classiﬁcation method was used online and in Real-Time to exploit web usage data mining technique to identify clients/visitors clickstream data matching it to a particular user group and recommend a tailoredbrowsing option that meet the need of the speciﬁc user at a given time [24]. For instance, if a user seems to be searching for politics news on china daily on his/her visit to the RSS reader site, more politics news headlines from other dailiessuch as CNN politics news will be recommended to the user with the required feedneeded to be added to his/her proﬁle in order to access such news headlines asideshis/her originally requested news. This is aimed at assisting the user to get relevantAutomated web usage data mining and recommendation system 91information without explicitly asking for it, so as to ease and fasten navigation onthe site without too many choices being presented to the user at a time, More so,the study will assist the web designer and administrator to re-arrange the contentof the web site in order to improve the impressiveness of the web site by providingonline Real-Time recommendation to the client.
To achieve this, the web users RSS address URL ﬁle was extracted, cleansed,formatted and grouped into meaningful session for data mining analysis, datamart was developed, this is as a result of the fact that the raw URL ﬁle extractedis not well structured to be used directly for data mining [19]. In designing the data mart, the process of URL data acquisition and model extraction was imple-mented using database management software speciﬁcally the Structured QueryLanguage, MySQL 2008[20]. The process of the development of the automaticReal-Time web usage mining and recommendation application was done byadopting the Java programming language with NetBeans as the editor and com-piler[21]. The MATLAB software was used for interpretation and graphical pre-sentation of the result obtained[17]. A thorough presentation of theexperimental result was done in order to assist the site designer and administra-tor to improve the content and impressiveness of the said RSS reader site. Fig. 1showing the architecture of the overall system can be seen in Supplementary material.
2. Related work
This section reviews some related works pertinent to this study, the review isspeciﬁcally organized into subsections as follows:
2.1. Web data mining
Zdravko and Daniel[31], described web data mining as application of data miningtechniques to discover patterns in web content, structure and usage. It is a branchof applied artiﬁcial intelligence that deals with storage, retrieval and analysis ofweb log ﬁles in order to discover users accessing and usage pattern of web pages[26].
2.2. Forms of data mining system
Two forms of data mining tasks were identiﬁed by researchers over the years, theseincludes; predictive and descriptive[13,1,7].
In predictive data mining task, inference is performed on current data in a data-base in order to predict future values of interest while in descriptive task, data in adatabase are classiﬁed by characterizing the general properties of the data, it ﬁndspattern describing the data in the database so as to present the interpretation tothe user[13,1,8].92 D.A. Adeniyi et al.2.2.1. Classiﬁcation of data mining system
Data mining system can be classiﬁed using different criteria. Jiawei and Micheline[13], identiﬁed these criteria as kind of database mined, kind of knowledge mined,type of technique utilized and according to type of application adapted. Federicoand Pier[9], stated further that in web usage data mining task, different techniquescan be adopted, but the issue is how to determine which technique is most appro-priate for the problem at hand. A multiple approach or an integrated techniquethat combines the beneﬁts of a number of individual approaches can be adoptedby a comprehensive data mining system[28].[13,15,16], stated that there are dif- ferent techniques for data classiﬁcation which includes; decision tree classiﬁer,Bayesian classiﬁer, K-Nearest Neighbor classiﬁer, and rule base classiﬁer. In ourwork, the K-Nearest Neighbor classiﬁcation method was adopted.
2.3. Overview of some related data mining techniques
Below is a brief overview of some of the data mining techniques according to dif-ferent scholars in the ﬁeld as it relates to our work.
Decision tree: The use of classiﬁcation and regression tree (CART) was adoptedby Amartya and Kundan[1]in their work. In constructing a decision tree, theyapplied both the gini index(g) and entropy value (e
i) as the splitting indexes, themodel was experimented with a given set of values, different sets of results wereobtained for both the outlook, humidity, windy, Temp, and Time for execution.The result of the experiment shows that the best splitting attribute in each casewas found to be outlook with the same order of splitting attributes for bothindices.
The decision tree technique has the restriction that the training tuples shouldreside in memory, so, in the case of very large data, decision tree construct there-fore becomes inefﬁcient due to swapping of the training tuples in and out of themain and cache memories. As a result of this a more scalable approach such asthe KNN method, capable of handling training data that are too large to ﬁt inmemory is required.
The SOM model: Self Organizing Map (SOM) or Kohonen neural networkmodel was explored by Xuejuu et al.[30], in their work, to model customers nav-igation behavior. The model was used to create clusters of queries based on usersession as extracted from web log with each cluster representing a class of userswith similar characteristics, in order to ﬁnd the web links or product of interestto a current user on a Real-Time basis. The experimental result of the SOM modelperformance was compared with that of K-Means model, and the SOM model wasfound to outperform the K-Means model with value of correlation co-efﬁcient ofSOM model scoring twice that of K-means result.
Our work shares essentially the same goals as SOM, but differs in its construc-tion. In SOM, the user proﬁles have been pre-determined ofﬂine by the ofﬂineAutomated web usage data mining and recommendation system 93usage pattern discovery module, while in our work, user proﬁles are determinedonline, thereby making real time response and recommendation faster.
The path analysis model: Resul and Ibrahim[26], in their work used the pathanalysis method to investigate the URL information of access to the FiratUniversity web server, web log ﬁle so as to discover user accessing pattern ofthe web pages, in order to improve the impressiveness of the web site. They explainfurther that, the application of path analysis method provides a count of numberof time a link occur in the data set, together with the list of association rules whichhelp to understand the path that users follow as they navigate through the FiratUniversity web site.
The Path analysis model is based on information from the clients’ previous nav-igation behavior, the method provides a count of number of time a link occur inthe dataset. Though our work shares the same goal of recommendation but againdiffers in its approach, which is based on user’s current navigation behaviorsrather than previous navigation behavior as in path analysis method.
Bayesian classiﬁer model: Decision rule and Bayesian network, support vectormachine and classiﬁcation tree techniques were used by Rivas et al. [27], to model accidents and incidents in two companies in order to identify the cause of accident.Data were collected through interview and modeled. The experimental result wascompared with statistics techniques, which shows that the Bayesian network andthe other methods applied are more superior than the statistics technique. Rivaset al.[27], stated further that the Bayesian/K2 network is of advantage as it allowswhat-if analysis on data, which make the data to be deeply explored.
In theory, Bayesian classiﬁer is said to have minimum error rate in comparisonwith all other classiﬁer but in practice this is not always the case, due to inaccuracyin assumptions made for its use, such as class conditional independency and the lackof available probability data which is usually not the case when using KNN method.
The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN): Many researchers have attempted to use K-Nearest Neighbor classiﬁer for pattern recognition and classiﬁcation in which aspeciﬁc test tuple is compared with a set of training tuples that are similar to it.[12], in their own work introduced the theory of fuzzy set into K-NearestNeighbor technique to develop a fuzzy version of the algorithm. The result of com-paring the fuzzy version with the Crisp version shows that the fuzzy algorithm dom-inates its counterpart in terms of low error rate. In the work of [11]. The K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm was used alongside with ﬁve other classiﬁcation methods tocombine mining of web server logs and web contents for classifying users’ navigationpattern and predict users’ future request. The result shows that the KNN outper-formed three of the other algorithms, while two of them performed uniformly. Itwas also observed that KNN archives the highest F-Score and A(c) on the trainingset among the six algorithms.[25], as well adopted the KNN classiﬁer to predict pro-tein cellular localization site. The result of the test using stratiﬁed crossvalidationshows the KNN classiﬁer to perform better than the other methods which includesbinary decision tree classiﬁer and the naı¨ve Bayesian classiﬁers.94 D.A. Adeniyi et al.2.4. Justiﬁcation for using KNN algorithm over other existing algorithm
The K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm is one of the simplest methods forsolving classiﬁcation problems; it often yields competitive results and has signiﬁ-cant advantages over several other data mining methods. Our work is thereforebased on the need to establish a ﬂexible, transparent, consistent straightforward,simple to understand and easy to implement approach. This is achieved throughthe application of K-Nearest Neighbor technique, which we have tested andproved to be able to overcome some of the problems associated with other avail-able algorithms. It is able to achieve these by the following:
– Overcoming scalability problem common to many existing data mining meth-ods such as decision tree technique, through its capability in handling trainingdata that are too large to ﬁt in memory.– The use of simple Euclidean distance to measure the similarities between train-ing tuples and the test tuples in the absence of prior knowledge about distribu-tion of data, therefore makes its implementation easy.– Reducing error rate caused by inaccuracy in assumptions made for usage ofother technique such as the Naı¨ve Bayesian classiﬁcation technique, such asclass conditional independency and the lack of available probability data whichis usually not the case when using KNN method.– Providing a faster and more accurate recommendation to the client with desir-able qualities as a result of straightforward application of similarity or distancefor the purpose of classiﬁcation.
2.5. Signiﬁcance of the study
Available published literature makes it clear that though web based recommenda-tion systems are increasingly common, there still available many problem areascalling for solutions. The fact is that most existing works lack scalability and capa-bility when dealing with on-line, Real-Time search driven web sites, more so, therecommendation quality and accuracy of some are doubtful, since they mostlyrelied on historical information based on clients’ previous visit to the site, ratherthan his immediate requirement. Some recommendation systems as well, createa lot of bottleneck through system computing load when handling scaled web siteat peak visiting time thereby slowing down the recommendation process.
To solve the above issues the following solutions were made through oursystem.
– Scalability problems common to many existing recommendation system wereovercome through combine on-line pattern discovery and pattern matchingfor real time recommendation, in this regard our algorithm works better thandecision tree algorithm.Automated web usage data mining and recommendation system 95– Our result indicates that the adoption of the K-NN model can lead to a moreaccurate recommendation that outperformed many other existing models. Inmost cases the precision rate or quality of recommendation by our system isequal to or better than 70%, meaning that over 70% of product recommendedto a client will be in line with his immediate requirement, making support to thebrowsing process more genuine rather than a simple reminder of what the userwas interested in on his previous visit to the site as seen in path analysistechnique.– Our recommendation engine collects the active users’ click stream data, matchesit to a particular user’s group in order to generate a set of recommendation tothe client at a faster rate, therefore overcoming the problem of bottleneckcaused by system computing load when dealing with scaled web sites at a peakvisiting time, as it is in many existing data mining methods.– Our system provides a precise recommendation to the client based on his cur-rent navigation pattern, thereby overcoming time wastage in ﬁnding the rightproduct or information caused by presentation of many irrelevant choices tothe client at a time as it is in many existing systems.
Hence, the proposed approach is capable of addressing the issues and providesa straightforward, simple to understand and easy to implement web usage classi-ﬁcation and recommendation model.
3. Methodology
This section presents detail description of the realization and implementation ofweb usage data mining system. The presentation of the application of the pro-posed methodology for the analysis of users’ RSS address ﬁle of the RSS readerwebsite was showcased. We have developed an online, Real-Time recommenda-tion expert system that can assist the web designer and administrator to improvethe content, presentation and impressiveness of their website by recommending aunique set of objects that satisﬁes the need of active user based on the user’s cur-rent click stream.
3.1. Overview of steps in performing web usage data mining task
Data mining task can be categorized into different stages based on the objective ofthe individual analyzing the data[1,7].
The overview of the task for each steps is presented in detail in four subsectionsas follows:3.1.1. Data acquisition, preprocessing and data mart development
Data acquisition: This refers to the collection of data for mining purpose, and thisis usually the ﬁrst task in web mining application [6]. The said data can be96 D.A. Adeniyi et al.collected from three main source which includes (i) web server (ii) proxy server and(iii) web client[9]. In this study, the web server source was chosen for the fact thatit is the richest and most common data source, more so, it can be used to collectlarge amount of information from the log ﬁles and databases they represent. Theuser proﬁle information, the access and navigation pattern or model are extractedfrom the historical access data recorded in the RSS reader site, users’ address data-base. The data are so voluminous as it contains so many detailed information suchas date, time in which activities occur, saver’s name, IP address, user name, pass-word, dailies name, required feed, news headlines, and contents, as recorded in thedatabase ﬁle. In fact, the original document is about 5285 pages.
Data pre-processing: In the original database ﬁle extracted, not all the informa-tion are valid for web usage data mining, we only need entries that contain rele-vant information. The original ﬁle is usually made up of text ﬁles that containslarge volume of information concerning queries made to the web server in whichin most instance contains irrelevant, incomplete and misleading information formining purpose[30,11]. Resul and Ibrahim[26], described data preprocessing asthe cleansing, formatting and grouping of web log ﬁles into meaningful sessionfor the sole aim of utilizing it for web usage mining.
Data cleansing: Data cleansing is the stage in which irrelevant/noisy entries areeliminated from the log ﬁle[18]. For this work the following operations were car-ried out: (i) Removal of entries with ‘‘Error’’ or ‘‘Failure’’ status. (ii) Removal ofrequests executed by automated programs such as some access records that areautomatically generated by the search engine agent from access log ﬁle and prox-ies. (iii) Identiﬁcation and removal of request for picture ﬁles associated withrequest for a page and request include Java scripts (.js), and style sheet ﬁle (iv)Removal of entries with unsuccessful HTTP status code, etc.
Data mart development: Two crown corporation[29], explained that data mart is a logical subset of data warehouse. If the data warehouse DBMS can supportmore resources, that will be required of the data mining operation, otherwise aseparate data mining database will be required. Since the raw log ﬁle is usuallynot a good starting point for data mining operation, the development of a datamart of log data is required for the data mining operation. In this work a separatedata mart of users’ RSS address URL was developed using relational databaseManagement software MySQL[20,19].3.1.2. Transaction identiﬁcation
There is need for a mechanism to distinguish different users so as to analyze usersaccess behavior[11]. Transaction identiﬁcation is meant to create meaningful clus-ters of references for each user. Xuejuu et al.[30], stated that a user navigationbehavior can be represented as a series of click operations by the user in timesequence, usually call click stream, which can further be divided into units of clickdescriptions usually referred to as session or visit.Automated web usage data mining and recommendation system 97Session identiﬁcation: According to[30,11], a session can be described as agroup of activities carried out by a user from the user’s entrance into the web siteup to the time the user left the site. It is a collection of user clicks to a single webserver[4]. Session identiﬁcation is the process of partitioning the log entries intosessions after data cleansing operation[18,3]. In order to achieve this Xuejuuet al.[30], suggested the use of cookies to identify individual users, so as to geta series of clicks within a time interval for an identiﬁed user. One session can bemade up of two clicks, if the time interval between them is less than a speciﬁc per-iod[4,5].3.1.3. Pattern discovery
Pattern discovery is the key process of web mining which includes grouping ofusers based on similarities in their proﬁle and search behavior. There are differentweb usage data mining techniques and algorithms that can be adopted for patterndiscovery and recommendation, which includes, path analysis, clustering, andassociate rule. In our work, we have experimented with the K-Nearest Neighborclassiﬁcation technique as described in Section3.2in order to observe and analyzeuser behavior pattern and click stream from the pre-process to web log stage andto recommend a unique set of object that satisﬁes the need of an active user, basedon the users’ current click stream.3.1.4. Pattern analysis
Pattern analysis is the ﬁnal stage in web usage mining which is aimed at extractinginteresting rules, pattern or statistics from the result of pattern discovery phase, byeliminating irrelevant rules or statistics. The pattern analysis stage provides thetool for the transformation of information into knowledge. We have incorporatedan SQL language to develop a data mart using MySQL DBMS software speciﬁ-cally created for web usage mining purpose in order to store the result of our work[16]. The data mart is populated from raw users RSS address URL ﬁle of the RSSreader’s site that contains some basic ﬁelds needed; our experiment result is pre-sented in Section4.
3.2. Our approach
The problem at hand is a classiﬁcation problem, therefore the K-NearestNeighbor method of data mining is ideal. The objective of the system is to createa mapping, a model or hypothesis between a given set of documents and classlabel. This mapping was later to be used to determine the class of a givenTest(unknown or unlabeled) documents[31]. The K-Nearest Neighbor model isthe simplest and most straightforward for class prediction, it is the most popularsimilarity or distance based text and web usage classiﬁcation and recommendationmodel[31].98 D.A. Adeniyi et al.3.2.1. K-Nearest-Neighbor technique
According to Leif[14], a non-parametric method of pattern classiﬁcation popularlyknown as K-Nearest Neighbor rule was believed to have been ﬁrst introduced byFix and Hodges in 1951, in an unpublished US Air Force School of AviationMedicine report. The method however, did not gain popularity until the 1960s withthe availability of more computing power, since then it has become widely used inpattern recognition and classiﬁcation[13]. K-Nearest Neighbor could be describedas learning by analogy, it is learnt by comparing a speciﬁc test tuple with a set oftraining tuples that are similar to it. It is classiﬁed based on the class of their closestneighbors, most often, more than one neighbor is taken into consideration hence,the name K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), the ‘‘K’’ indicates the number of neighborstaken into account in determining the class[13]. The K-NN algorithm has beenadopted by statisticians as a machine learning approach for over 50 years now[31]. The K-NN is often referred to as ‘‘Lazy learner’’ in the sense that it simplystores the given training tuples and waits until it is given a test tuple, then performsgeneralization so as to classify the tuple based on similarities or distance to thestored training tuples. It is also called ‘‘instance based learner’’. The lazy learneror instance based learner does less work when presented with training tuples andmore work during classiﬁcation and prediction, therefore makes it computationalexpensive, unlike the eager learners that when given a training tuple construct aclassiﬁcation model before receiving the test tuple to classify, it is therefore veryready and eager to classify any unseen tuples.[13,31,1].[13,14], stated that the K-NN error is bounded above twice the Baye’s error rate.
3.3. The working of K-Nearest Neighbor classiﬁer
The K-Nearest Neighbor classiﬁer usually applies either the Euclidean distance orthe cosine similarity between the training tuples and the test tuple but, for the pur-pose of this research work, the Euclidean distance approach will be applied inimplementing the K-NN model for our recommendation system [13].
In our experiment, suppose our data tuples are restricted to a user or visi-tor/client described by the attribute Daily Name, Daily Type and News categoryand thatXis a client with Dayo as username and Dy123 as password.
The Euclidean distance between a training tuple and a test tuple can be derivedas follows:
LetX ibe an input tuple with p features (x i1,xi2,...,x ip) Letnbe the total number of input tuples (i=1 ,2 ,...,n) Letpbe the total number of features (j=1 ,2 ,...,p)The Euclidean distance between TupleX
iandX t(t=1 ,2 ,...,n) can be deﬁned as
dðx i;xtÞ¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃðx
i1/C0x t1Þ2þqðx
i2/C0x t2Þ2þ...þðx ip/C0x tpÞ2ð3:1ÞAutomated web usage data mining and recommendation system 99In general term, The Euclidean distance between two Tuples for instanceX
1=(x 11,x12,...,x 1n) andX 2=(x 21,x22,...,x 2n) will be,
distðx 1;x2Þ¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃXni¼1ðx1i/C0x 2iÞ2qð3:2Þ
Eq.(3.2)is applicable to numeric attribute, in which we take the difference between
each corresponding values of attributes tuplex 1andx 2, square the result and add them all together then get the square root of the accumulated result this gives us thedistance between the two pointsx
1andx 2[13,14]. In order to prevent attributeswith initially large ranges from outweighing attributes with initial smaller ranges,there is a need to normalize values of each attributes before applying Eq. (3.2).
The min–max normalization can be applied to transform for instance value Vof a numeric attributeAtoV
1in the range [0,1] by using the expression
V1¼V/C0minAmaxA/C0minAð3:3Þ
minAand maxAare attributeA, minimum and maximum values[13].
In K-NN, classiﬁcation, all neighboring points that are nearest to the test tupleare encapsulated and recommendation is made based on the closest distance to thetest tuple, this can be deﬁned as follows:
LetCbe the predicted class
Ci¼fx2C p;dðx;x iÞ/C20dðx;x mÞ;i#mgð3:4Þ
The nearest tuple is determined by the closest distance to the test tuple. The K-NN
rule is to assign to a test tuple the majority category label of its K-Nearest trainingtuple[14].3.3.1. Computing distance for categorical attribute
A categorical attribute is a nonnumeric attribute such as color and object name.To calculate the distance, we simply compare the corresponding values of the attri-butes in tuplex
1with that ofx 2, if the values are the same, then the difference istaken to be zero(0), otherwise the difference is taken to be one(1). For instance, iftwo users,x
1andx 2click stream on the RSS reader site is both sport news cate-gory, then the difference is zero(0), but if tuplex
1is sport and tuplex 2is politics, then the difference is taken to be one(1)[13].3.3.2. Missing values
If the value of a given attributeAis missing in tuplex 1orx 2or both, for categor- ical value, if either or both values are missing we take the difference to be one(1),in numeric attribute ifx
1andx 2values are missing we also take the difference tobe one(1), if only one value is missing and the other is present and normalized wecan consider the difference to be |1/C0V
1|o r| 0/C0V1| whichever is greater is chosen[13].100 D.A. Adeniyi et al.3.3.3. Determining the value of K, the number of Neighbor
In reality, the value ofKis usually odd numbers, ie.K=1 ,K=3 ,K= 5, etc. this is obvious in order to avoid ties[14].K= 1 rule is mostly referred to as the nearestneighbor classiﬁcation rule. The value ofK(Number of neighbor) can be deter-mined by using a test set to determine the classiﬁcation error rate, by experiment-ing with different values ofK, starting withK= 1, then theKvalue with minimum error rate is selected[13]. Jiawei and Micheline[13], stated further that the largerthe training tuple, the larger the value ofK. Zdravko and Daniel[31], in their work, experimented with different values of up toK= 19, with and without dis-tance weighting on a set of document collections, the experiment was run with acomplete set of 671 attributes and concluded that a small set of relevant attributesworks better than all attributes, that the experiment works perfect with K=1 , andK= 3 and with little improvement inK= 5. So, ifKapproaches inﬁnity, the error rate approaches that of Baye’s error rate [13]. Zdravko and Daniel [31], further stated that 1-NN makes a better prediction using single instance how-ever large the training set is, but under the assumption that there is no noise andall attributes are equally important for classiﬁcation.
In our work, we adopted 5 as the maximum value of K. We simply applied the distance weighted K-NN approach, in which we experimented for different valuesofKon our sample data, starting fromK=1 ,u pt oK= 9. We discovered that the experiment works better withK=1 ,K= 3 and with little accuracy atK=5 , so, we selectedK= 5, which gives us the minimum error rate. The algorithm forthe K-Nearest Neighbor classiﬁer model is shown in Fig. 2, in Supplementary material.
3.4. Application of K-Nearest Neighbor classiﬁcation technique to predict user’sclass label in the RSS reader’s web site
Example 1. Let us consider the RSS reader sites’ client click stream as a vectorwith three(3) attributes: Daily name News category and Added required feed type,with users represented byX
1,X2,X3,X4,...,X 11as the class labels as shown inTable 1. Assuming the class of userX
3is unknown.
To determine the class of userX 3, we have to compute the Euclidean distancebetween the vectorX
3and all other vectors, by applying Eq.(3.2).
The Euclidean distance between two tuples for instance training tuple X 1and test tupleX
3ie.
X1=(x 11,x12,x13) andX 3=(x 31,x32,x33) each with the following attributesas inTable 1.
X1= (CNN news, World,www.*world) andX 3= (Punch ng, politics,www. *politics) will be:

1
with that ofx 3as explained previously. If the values are the same then the differ-ence is taken to be zero(0), otherwise, the difference is taken to be one(1). So, for(x
1,1andx 3,1) ie. (CNN news and Punch ng), the difference is 1, for ( x 12andx 32) ie. (World and Politics) the difference is 1, likewise for ( x
13andx 33) ie., (www.*- world and www.*politics) the difference is 1 as well, therefore,

Repeating the same process in our example for all other tuple x 2,x4,...,x 11, the
result of these calculation produced a stream of data as shown in Table 2, which shows the users sorted by their Euclidean distance to the user x

The 1-NN approach simply picks the user with minimum distance to x 3, (the ﬁrst one from the top of the list) and uses it’s class label ‘‘politics’’ to predictthe class ofx

However, distance weighted K-NN can be helpfulin determining the class a given test tuple belong, whenever there seems to be a ties[31]. For instance, the distance weighted 5-NN will simply add the distance forclass politics as in our example inTable 2and compare it with that ofEntertainment whichever is greater is selected. i.e. 1.000000000 +1.000000000 + 1.000000000 + 1.141421356 = 4.141421356 while that of enter-tainment is 1.141421356 thus, weight of ‘‘politics’’ > ’’Entertainment’’ Then the5-NN will as well classify userx
3as ‘‘Politics’’ because it has higher weight thanentertainment. The distance weighted K-NN allows the algorithm to use moreor even all instances instead of one instance as in 1-NN.
4. System evaluation and analysis of result
This section evaluates our system by applying the result of the experiment con-ducted. The result was presented and analyzed in order to evaluate the qualityof our recommendation system based on K-Nearest Neighbor classiﬁcationmodel. In the previous section we established that a class with minimum distanceto the test tuple will be predicted for 1-NN or in case ties exist, the weighted dis-tance predict a class with greater weighted distance as in 5-NN in example 1 andrecommendation will be made based on this, for user with unknown class.
Software was developed with Java NetBeans programming language andMySQL DBMS was used in creating the data mart in order to implement ourmodel using K-NN method. The sample interface from the automated on-lineReal-Time recommendation system developed for the purpose, indicating theactive user’s click stream, a dialog box presenting his requested news headlinesand a message box presenting Real-Time recommendation to the user based onhis current request is shown in Fig. 3 inSupplementary materialand the source code in Java NetBeans programming language for the system is also availableas part ofSupplementary material.
In this work, the number of classCof userXthat can be recommended by therecommendation model is set at 5, ‘‘5’’ indicates different news categoriesheadlines and user classes that could be presented to the active user, based oninformation from the user’s click stream. However, this number could be increasedor decreased depending on the available options at a given time.
In this study however, the computation of Euclidean distance that produced theset of values from which the closest distanceC
i={x2C p;d(x,x i)6d(x,x m),i #m}, was not repeatedly shown, because of size, since the calculation followsthe same procedures.Table 2shows the sorted result according to distance tothe test tuple.
Godswill[10], stated that in real life analysis, a model performance quality canonly be measured by ability to predict accurately, the new data set rather than thetraining data set in which the model was trained. They explained further that theAutomated web usage data mining and recommendation system 103predictive ability of a model will be questionable and cannot be used for predic-tion, if the model performs well in the training set but performs poorly in the testvalidation data set or new data set.
4.1. Presentation of result
Example 2: Using the data inTable 1, this time around assuming the class of userX
7is unknown. We can determine the class of userx 7based on his current click stream information by computing the Euclidean distance between the user x

and all other users as we did in example 1

4.2. Analysis of the results
The MATLAB code[17,23], that was used for graphical analysis of the experimen-tal result fromTables 2 and 3as shown inFig. 4and Figs. 5 and 6 is available onrequest.
In order to model the users click stream in the RSS readers web site, TheK-Nearest Neighbor classiﬁcation technique of data mining was applied on theextracted users RSS address database. The data set was produced by computingthe Euclidean distance between the test tuple and the training tuples as shownin example 1 and example 2 and data set presented in Tables 2 and 3respectively.

5. Summary of ﬁndings
Different criteria can be used to determine the quality and efﬁciency of a particularweb site, which includes the following: contents, presentation, ease of usage, easeof accessing required information, waiting time of users, to mention just a few. Inthis study a novel approach is presented to classify users based on their currentclick stream, matching it to a particular user group popularly referred to asNearest neighbor and recommend a tailored browsing option that satisﬁes theneeds of the active user at a particular time, by applying the web usage data min-ing technique to extract knowledge required for providing Real-Time recommen-dation services on the web site.
We have conducted experiments on our designed experimental system. The dataset used in the system is the RSS user access database for a two months period,which was extracted, pre-processed and grouped into meaningful sessions anddata mart was developed. The K-Nearest Neighbor classiﬁcation technique wasused to investigate the URL information of the RSS users’ address database ofthe RSS reader site as stored in the data mart created. Evaluating sample testing
Figure 4Graph showing Euclidean distance from the other User/Neighbor to user X 3andX 7.Automated web usage data mining and recommendation system 105session, the results are presented and analyzed. The results of our experiment indi-cate that the adoption of K-Nearest Neighbor model can lead to more accuraterecommendation that outperformed other classiﬁcation algorithms. In most casesthe precision rate or quality of recommendation is equal to or better than 70%,this means that over 70% of news recommended to a client will be in line withhis immediate requirement, making support to the browsing process more gen-uine, rather than a simple reminder of what the user was interested in on his pre-vious visit to the site as seen in path analysis technique.
The ﬁndings of the experimental study can now be used by the designer andadministrator of the web site to plan the upgrade and improvement of the web site,in order to ease navigation on the site without too many choices at a time as wellas meeting their needed information without expecting them to ask for it explicitly,therefore improving the impressiveness of the web site.
6. Conclusion
Our work provides a basis for automatic Real-Time recommendation system. Thesystem performs classiﬁcation of users on the simulated active sessions extractedfrom testing sessions by collecting active users’ click stream and matches this withsimilar class in the data mart, so as to generate a set of recommendations to theclient in a Real-Time basis.
The result of our experiment shows that an automatic Real-Time recommenda-tion engine powered by K-NN classiﬁcation model implemented with Euclideandistance method is capable of producing useful and a quite good and accurateclassiﬁcations and recommendations to the client at any time based on his imme-diate requirement rather than information based on his previous visit to the site.
7. Recommendation for future work
Our designed system is a proof-of-concept, prototype of idea for using webusage data mining with K-NN technique, and there are some aspects in whichit can be improved in any future work. The study could be taken much furtherby investigating the users RSS address URL of the RSS reader in a continuousbasis.
More research also need to be carried out on many other data mining tech-niques, comparing the result with this model, so as to determine the most effectivemodel in handling a problem of this nature in the nearest future.
