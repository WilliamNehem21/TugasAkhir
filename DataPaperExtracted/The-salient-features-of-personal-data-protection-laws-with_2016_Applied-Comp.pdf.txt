1. IntroductionThe term ‘‘cloud computing”is often used in various spheres of public life. Itrefers to technology created to optimize business processes and improve the servicequality of different service providers and to increase people’s informatization level.Questions on people’s interpersonal relationships arise more acutely in the ﬁeld ofmedicine, government, banking and the private sector. The application of cloudcomputing is a strategically important development for computer technologiesand offers the opportunity to provide different services.The active introduction of cloud computing posed questions for legislatorsabout the speciﬁcs of regulating people’s behavior online. These questions concerndata security when it is stored in the cloud, and whether cloud computing isprivately- or government-owned. Questions about the requirements for cloudInternet Service Provider’s (ISP) effective functions, as well as an ISP’sresponsibility for its own actions and those of third parties, remain unanswered.Is it possible to be sure that technology which allows us access to cloud comput-ing is reliable and safe? What if public information and IT systems are hostedabroad?In this article we will not consider the questions of the processing of state secretsor publicly accessible data by cloud computing. Rather we will address the mainissues with cloud computing as far as data protection is concerned. Kristina Irionhas described this problem, saying ‘‘many governments have raised concernsabout national data sovereignty when government information is moved to thecloud. How can conﬁdentiality of public information assets residing in the cloudbe ensured? What if public information and IT systems are hosted abroad? ...” [[16], p. 41]I will consider the difﬁculties that legislation encounters when trying to ensurethe protection of limited-access data, such as personal details.2 Z. Anna2. The concept of cloud computing in Europe and Russia2.1. The legal concept of cloud computing in Europe and RussiaAlthough currently the active application of the term ‘‘cloud computing ”in the Russian Federation, and implemented programs for public e-health ande-government are based on cloud computing, this term has no legislativedeﬁnition. The State Program of the Russian Federation ‘‘Information Society(2011–2020)”considers the development of cloud computing to be one of the mainpriorities for 2015. The creation of a national platform of cloud computing isprovided for in this government program. It is planned to connect all thepublic authorities of the Russian Federation in the period of 2011–2020 [30]. In fact, cloud computing was taught at technical universities in 1990s and thefurther development of this technology at public institutes was predicted.Consequently, we use the deﬁnition of the Institute of Electrical andElectronics Engineers (IEEE). According to the IEEE’s deﬁnition published in2008, ‘‘Cloud data processing is a paradigm within which information isconstantly stored on servers on the Internet and is temporarily cached withthe client party, for example on personal computers, game consoles, laptopsand smart-phones[15].”The IEEE, investigating the prospects for developingcloud computing, drew a parallel between this technology and the internet. InRussia, IEEE companies operate in Siberia, the Northwest (St. Petersburg)and Central Russia (Moscow)[32].Unlike Russia, the European Union passed a law in 2012, in which it was spec-iﬁed that ‘‘Cloud computing in simpliﬁed terms can be understood as the storing,processing and using of data on remotely located computers accessed over theinternet.”This means that users can command almost unlimited computing poweron demand, that they do not have to make major capital investments to fulﬁl theirneeds and that they can access their data from anywhere so long as they have aninternet connection. Cloud computing has the potential to slash users’ ITexpenditure and to enable many new services to be developed [6].” In Russia, the lack of a legal deﬁnition allows ambiguous interpretations of thearea of legislative regulation.2.2. The technical concept of cloud computing in Europe and RussiaCloud computing is considered to be a platform for different services. However,it is only classiﬁed in the technical sphere. The site International Organizationfor Standardization (ISO) contains the following classiﬁcation of cloudcomputing:(1) SaaS (Software as a Service) – the user of cloud computing is granted theright to use and access the necessary software.Personal data protection laws with special reference to cloud technologies 3(2) IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) – the user of cloud computing is granted theright to use a provider’s hardware–software complex for work and datastorage.(3) PaaS (Platform as a Service) – the user of cloud computing is granted theright to use a hardware–software complex for the development, testing,expansion and support of web applications[13].In 2013, the Russian Federation’s service for technical export control set out theState projected standard which deﬁned cloud services such as follows:– Hardware as a Service (HaaS);– Security as a Service (SecaaS);– Business process as a Service (BPaaS);– Data as a Service (DaaS);– Trust as a Service (TaaS);– Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS);– Cloud Development Environment as a Service (CDEaaS);– Communication as a Service (CaaS);– Platform as a Service (PaaS);– Connection as a Service (CnaaS);– Transparency as a Service (TraaS);– Workplace as a Service (WaaS).This classiﬁcation complements the ISO classiﬁcation. However, it seems it isredundant. Probably for this reason it is not accepted in Russia as a legalstandard.3. The policy of the States about the regulation of cloud computingLegal questions about the regulation of the use of cloud computing are a concernfor the majority of the European countries. In 2012, the EC developed a proposalfor the regulation of the European parliament and for the Council on the protec-tion of individuals’ personal data processing and on the free movement of data(General Data Protection Regulation)[21].The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) discussed the importance of this problem ofdata protection, particularly personal data, in cloud computing. ‘‘Data privacyconsiderations are often overlooked in the development phase of the cloud, Inter-net of Things and Big Data solutions, and instead are viewed through a maze ofcomplicated regulations and guidance[4].”Angela Adrian remarks also that‘‘unfortunately the legal infrastructure is inadequate to secure privacy. ”[[1], p. 49] This problem is very important for Russia. In 2010 the Deputy Minister of theMinistry of Communications and Mass Communications, Ilya Massukh, said that‘‘these kinds of proprietary technologies in Russia are practically non-existent,therefore this sector is actively engaging with foreign companies such as4 Z. AnnaGoogle[20].”But, in 2014, a Russian Advisory Council from the Ministry ofCommunications and Mass Media Communications was created to improve thedevelopment of, and implement a state policy for, standards and legal regulationof cloud computing. The Advisory Council aimed to develop suggestions forimproving the legislation for cloud computing to ensure the regular interactionof the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media with the expert communityon cloud technologies[29].EU Member States are also attempting to solve the problems which have arisenfor users and developers of cloud computing. On 11 September 2013, theEuropean Commission (EC) adopted a legislative package called ‘‘ConnectedContinent: Building a Telecoms Single Market. ”The website claimed that ‘‘thepackage could boost the cloud computing market in Europe, as, among others,it aims at improving the quality of service that new services (such as cloudcomputing, video-conferencing, 3D printing) can offer [7].” In Russia, according to the Order of the Government of the Russian Federationof 22.02.2012 No. 238-p Rostelecom
1was appointed the sole executor for the fur-ther creation and development of complex information technology and telecom-munications infrastructure including cloud computing and e-government for2012–2014.Rostelecom must execute the list of activities of the Russian state program‘‘Information Society (2011–2020 years).”This program includes the developmentof a portal for public services, the development of a common space of trust in elec-tronic signatures, the development of interagency electronic interaction and a sin-gle identiﬁcation system. It is planned that Rostelecom will engage in thedevelopment of mechanisms which enable the use of mobile devices for accessto e-government services and to the state-mail address which is used for the inter-action between citizens and government agencies.Rostelecom must create common directories and qualiﬁers for state informationsystems and it must develop systems such as the ‘‘Electronic Registry Ofﬁce, ” ‘‘E-Regions”and ‘‘E-democracy.”The basis for the implementation of thesesystems is a cloud computing platform. These systems offer infrastructure andsoftware as a service (IaaS and SaaS). [The Ofﬁcial website of the Ministry ofCommunications and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation]The Strategy ‘‘of the development of information technologies in the RussianFederation for 2014–2020 and planning until 2025 ”directs the creation of a Russian national platform for cloud computing[31]. For the realization of thisstrategy, the Russian government operates as the sole customer for everythingneeded for the Russian market for information technologies. Rostelecom devel-oped and launched a cloud platform in August 2011. This helps Rostelecom selltheir computing resources and software to third parties. In the future, thisplatform could be integrated into the national platform of cloud computing.
1The largest national telecommunications company in Russia.Personal data protection laws with special reference to cloud technologies 5Currently, the Russian Federation plans to create seven powerful data centers,on the basis of which cloud services for government agencies and academia will beprovided. They include the public services platform, ‘‘Gospriklad, ”which was developed for the provision of public services[27].The Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation of July 20, 2011 N1275-p approved the concept of the creation and development of an integratedinformation system for the state management of public ﬁnances, the so-called‘‘Electronic budget.”This concept was recommended to the executive authoritiesof the Russian Federation and local authorities for the development of systems ofpublic (municipal) ﬁnance. The subsystems of ‘‘Electronic budget ”system will be available as a service for citizens of the Russian Federation, the municipalities orgovernment sector organizations on apro bonobasis. These subsystems will besubmitted as a model of ‘‘Software as a Service”(SaaS).The portal of the Russian ‘‘Electronic budget”will consist of closed and of openparts.The open part of this portal is being provided as a public information resource,providing free access to the regulatory, statistical and analytical information forthe management of public ﬁnances. Storage and processing are being carriedout in a centralized service of the ‘‘Electronic budget ”system.The closed part of this portal consists of ‘‘private ofﬁces ”which can be available to users with the appropriate authorization and electronic signature keys. Theclosed part is the common point for user access to all services of the ‘‘Electronicbudget,”which will include a uniﬁed system of management of user access levels,depending on their powers. These services will be available to users of the cloudplatform in areas such as medicine, housing, energy, and transport.An example of the application of cloud computing for providing public servicesis the UK. In 2010 the UK started a project called G-Cloud (‘‘Governmentcloud”). This optimizes the activities of government data centers and reduces gov-ernment spending. Features of the G-Cloud include ﬂexible scaling, open access toresources, an adequate level of security, a high degree of standardization andextensive information sharing. Such features make G-Cloud an attractive and eco-nomical solution to the complex architecture of internet-based administration. It isplanned that through the G-Cloud the British authorities will have been able toreduce IT costs by over 20% in 2014[25].In the UK, a government gateway (Government Gateway) was introducedwhich provided the centralized online access to the government cloud. TheGovernment Gateway has helped to bring together the disparate public internetresources of Great Britain, and also has closed a thousand duplicate administra-tion sites out of a previous total of four thousand. This government gatewayallows the exchange of information between portals. In addition, it stores all infor-mation in case of the failure of one of the subordinate portals. All citizens andlegal entities are required to register in the Government Gateway for work and6 Z. Annato use this technology. The residents and the organizations in Britain are able touse three main British online services:1. DirectGov: the portal of the Ministry of Work and Pensions for individuals;2. NHS Choices: the portal of the Ministry of Health for individuals;3. BusinessLink: the portal of the Ministry of tax and customs revenues forbusinesses.The applicable technological system provides the transaction authenticationand security. According to experts, the savings will be not less than £8 each timea citizen accesses these services[25].Unfortunately, in the Russian Federation there are not so many examples of theuse of models of public services based on cloud computing, although, from 2013the idea of cloud computing in government was being actively implemented [26]. 4. Legal regulation on use of personal data in RussiaOf course, answers to the above questions are linked to the category of informa-tion (limited access or open information) and also to subjects of the relationshipssuch as the ISP, the user or the government. Cloud technology can belong toforeign or Russian ISPs. Information can be public or have limited access (ch. 2Art. 5 of Federal law ‘‘Information, Informational Technologies and Protectionof Information”)[9].Limited access information can be personal data;‘‘know-how”; and secret data imported from companies, and is regulated onlyby Federal legislation.Cloud computing depends on its owner, which can be public or private. Publicclouds belong to the state authorities or the local council. Furthermore, publiccloud data may be better protected than the private cloud computing.As Angela Adrian remarks, ‘‘how should legal rules change to accommodatethe new communication technology? If cloud computing does not alter our funda-mental values, how should legal rules adapt and change in order to maintain ourcurrent values? What should the substance of our rules be in light of the changingenvironment for the actors in the cloud? [Angela Adrian, p. 49]According to Art. 7 of the Russian Federal law ‘‘On personal data, ”‘‘the users of personal data and other persons who have access to personal data are obligednot to disclose this information to third parties and not to impart personal datawithout consent of the subject of personal data. The other cases must be providedby the law[10].”What ought to be done if information is stored in a foreign cloud?According to item 11. Art. 3 of the Federal law ‘‘On personal data, ”the cross- border transfer of personal data is the transfer of personal data to the territory ofa foreign state, to the authority of the foreign state, to a foreign national person ora foreign legal entity.Personal data protection laws with special reference to cloud technologies 7Therefore, the cross-border transfer of personal data is the transmission of per-sonal data on any person from the Russian Federation to a foreign person, abroadas, for example, when a person is ﬁlling in a form online to purchase goods from aforeign seller.Art. 19 of the Law ‘‘On personal data”states that the Russian operator of per-sonal data has to establish in the agreement with the foreign handler of the infor-mation, the duty to comply with the conﬁdentiality of personal data, to ensure tothe safety of personal data, and also to comply with other requirements to protectpersonal information. According to item 3. Art. 12 of the Law ‘‘On personal data ” the operator of personal data must be convinced that the foreign country to whichthe data are transferred provides adequate protection for people’s rights to theirpersonal data. The Federal law ‘‘On personal data ”speciﬁes that states can beconsidered in two groups of countries:(1) Member countries of the Convention for the Protection of Individuals withregard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data (1981); (This Conven-tion came into force in the Russian Federation on September 1, 2013) [24]. (2) Countries which are not the party to the Convention for the Protection ofIndividuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data(1981), but which are listed as foreign states which provide adequate protec-tion of the people’s rights to their personal data.

The Russian Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, in unofﬁcial letteron May 13, 2009, explained that ‘‘the adequacy of protection means that theforeign state provides a level of security of people’s rights to their personal data,not less than the standards provided for in Russia. One of the assessment criteriaof the state in this respect is the ratiﬁcation of the Convention for the Protectionof Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data(1981)[17].”However, if a cross-border transfer of personal data is being carried out in for-eign states which do not provide adequate protection for people’s rights to theirpersonal data, then the user of the personal data must receive, in written form,that person’s consent for their personal data to be transferred. These relationshipsbetween foreign ISP (operator of personal data) and the owner of personal dataare regulated by the two Russian laws. They are the Federal law ‘‘On personaldata”and the Federal law ‘‘On electronic signatures”[11].

AnnaIn accordance with part 4 Art. 9 of the Federal law ‘‘On personal data, ”the participants in the relationship have the right to use an electronic signature tocreate a written form of their agreement. Art. 4 of the Federal law ‘‘On electronicsignatures”deﬁned the rights of parties in the electronic interaction been using anyinformation technology and (or) the technical means to apply an electronicsignature. However, the Federal law ‘‘On electronic signatures ”requires that participants (the provider of personal data and owners of personal data) mustapprove of these actions. This approval can be placed on the main web page ofthe cloud ISP which handles personal data. The owner of the personal data mustagree with these conditions.However, there is another view. Vladimir Kanashevsky writes that sending ane-mail message from a Russian user to a foreign cloud ISP of personal data cannotbe signed with an electronic signature. ‘‘The foreign ISP potentially can bebrought to civil liability in accordance with Russian law. In connection with thisaction, the claim for the damages and compensation for moral damages can bebrought to the foreign operator[14].”I do not accept the opinion of Vladimir Kanashevsky. Firstly, this author didnot consider the provisions of the Russian Federal law ‘‘On electronic signatures. ” This law points directly to the recognition of foreign electronic signatures. Article7 of this law indicates that ‘‘if an electronic signature is created in accordance withthe law of a foreign state and the international standards then it is recognized inthe Russian Federation as an electronic signature that corresponds to the Federallaw ‘‘On electronic signatures.”Also, according to part 2 of Art. 7 of this law ‘‘Onelectronic signatures,”an electronic document signed by an electronic signaturecannot be regarded as illegal only on the basis that the electronic signatureveriﬁcation key certiﬁcate is issued in accordance with the rules of the foreignlaw. [Federal law ‘‘On electronic signatures,”2011]Secondly, part 2 of Art. 9 of the Federal law ‘‘On personal data ”determines that the consent of the subject of personal data can be given in any form. Forexample, this form can be an e-mail message. Thus, the Federal law ‘‘On personaldata”and the Federal law ‘‘On electronic signatures”deﬁne the legal conditions ofconsent recognition.However, be aware that the Federal law ‘‘On personal data ”allows the ISP of personal data not to obtain the consent of the subject of personal data if the cross-border transfer of personal data is carried out ‘‘for the execution of a contract.And party to this contract is the subject of personal data. ”(part 4 Art. 12 of the Federal law ‘‘On personal data”). Thus, this Federal law indicates the presenceof the preliminary agreement on cooperation.There is another exception under which the telecom operator
3does not have to obtain the consent of the personal data individual. In 2013, the Russian Federallaw ‘‘On communications”was changed[12]. Art. 53 of this law added the right
3The telecom operator in accordance with Russian law is a legal entity or individual employer which providescommunication services based on a relevant license.Personal data protection laws with special reference to cloud technologies 9of the telecom operator to entrust the processing of personal data of clients tothird parties even if a telecom operator has not received the consent of this person.This is the case only if the telecom operator processes the personal data in accor-dance with the contract for the provision of telecommunications services, and/orthe telecom operator acts for the implementation of the rights and legitimate inter-ests of the service provider or the client. However, the Federal law ‘‘On commu-nications”did not disclose whether the operator had to warn of the fact thatpersonal data was processed by a third party.In addition, in 2014 the Federal Law ‘‘On Personal Data ”was included the obligation of the operator of personal data to provide entry the storage, clariﬁca-tion, update, change and the extraction of personal data of citizens of the RussianFederation with the use of databases that were in the territory of the RussianFederation.Thus, Kanashevsky’s opinion about the complexities of personal data process-ing by a foreign cloud ISP of personal data does not apply in most cases.In 2013–2014, the overall transmission model of personal data to externaloperators was changed in Russia. The list of cases expanded in which consent isnot required from the subject of personal data on processing their data by thirdparties. So in terms of legal regulation in Russia, the implementation of any cloudservice through the use of foreign cloud has become easier.5. Ensuring the technological security of the transmission and processing of personaldata in Russia and EuropeOf course, the cross-border transfer of data is associated with problems of trans-mission security and the processing of personal data. Experts in the technicalsphere claim that it is impossible to ensure the absolute safety of these technologies[2]. Noriswadi Ismail has also written about these problems [18]. Providers of cloud services must address the questions of data security. Thetechnological complexity of security in the cloud means that a virus-infected ﬁlefrom one client can infect other connected and inactive clients. In connection withthis, there is the danger of compromised data being stored in the cloud. Theresponsibility for protection lies with the provider. Users of cloud services needto be sure that the provider uses security tools. The provider of cloud servicesshould allow the user to check the level of protection and should record the actionsof all clients who have access to the cloud.Also it is difﬁcult to select a required standard from all the existing standards. AEuropean Commission communication described this problem: ‘‘A jungle ofstandards generates confusion by, on one hand, a proliferation of standards andon the other hand a lack of certainty as to which standards provide adequate levelsof interoperability of data formats to permit portability; the extent to which safe-guards are in place for the protection of personal data; or the problem of the databreaches and the protection against cyber-attacks ...[6]”. The authors propose to10 Z. Annasolve the problem of responsibility for the actions of third parties through a choiceof jurisdiction which is determined by the agreement.But here it is necessary to bear in mind that there is no legal obligation tochoose standards in the European Union or the Russian Federation. The choiceof technology depends only on the parties to the relationship. Usually, the respon-sibility lies with the cloud ISP of personal data for the choice of the standard.Taiwan chose this approach. Fa-Chang Cheng and Wen-Hsing Lai write that‘‘The Information Industry in Taiwan is now trying to realize the accountabilityconcept through building up the certiﬁcate system in protecting the personal infor-mation privacy, especially for the purpose of protection within Cyberspace [8].” In Russia, the Federal Service for the Supervision of Communications, Infor-mation Technology, and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor) for reducing the require-ments for the protection system described in the ‘‘Recommendations on thechoice of methods for the depersonalisation of data[19]”made recommendations and proposed various methods to anonymize personal data. When personal datadepersonalize the complexity of the selection standards is lowered.Noriswadi Ismail writes about solution adopted by Microsoft. ‘‘Microsoft pro-poses the amendment of CFAA’s civil action provision that the cloud service pro-viders possess a private right of action against those who illegally access their data-centers or secure unauthorized access to their customers’ accounts. This proposedcause of action shall allow cloud service providers to combat digital criminals onbehalf of their customers.”[[18], p. 252]If there are no special requirements of the law, then a Russia provider of cloudcomputing can voluntarily be audited and certiﬁed by the ISO/IEC 27001: 2005and (or) SAS 70 Type II and Type I. Voluntary certiﬁcation will allow the providerto prove that he sought by his actions to ensure data security.The European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) proposedusing ISO27001. Moreover ENISA noted that all suppliers must demonstratecompliance. They are NOT required to be accredited but compliance is veriﬁedthrough yearly submission of their information security management systemand associated policy documents.Additional certiﬁcations and accreditations assist European Health organisa-tions in choosing appropriate providers, e.g., ISO20000 (Service Management),ISO9001 (Quality), but these are not required.In terms of audit and compliance with regulations or the nominated standardsof the service provider, cloud computing service providers must ensure that theyare able and willing to allow the right to audit their policies, processes, systemsand services.”[Cloud Computing. Beneﬁts, risks, 2009]There are other mechanisms to ensure information security of processed andstored data. The report made by ENISA suggests possible solutions to existing prob-lems. All data collected by European Health must satisfy the following requirements:Data (including sensitive personal data) must be encrypted in transit and at restwhere potentially at risk (e.g., on mobile devices);Personal data protection laws with special reference to cloud technologies 11Data processing must satisfy European data protection law (e.g., deﬁnition of‘‘data processor”for all operations);National law applies certain restrictions on the processing of the data (e.g., datashould not leave the original country of collection at any time);Clinical safety has to be paramount with certain applications, meaning thatintegrity and availability have to be guaranteed in some instances;Sensitive data should be destroyed at a speciﬁed time in its lifecycle (e.g., bydestruction of hard disks at the ‘end of life’ of equipment);Physical security controls in data-centers where data is stored must be ade-quately assured (some of this is covered currently via ISO27001 submissions fromsuppliers);Senior staff are given special responsibility for the conﬁdentiality of ‘‘patientand service-user information[3].”The Federal law, ‘‘About Technical Regulation[12]”in Art. 12 permits the voluntary application of standards in the ﬁeld of a hardware–software. At thesame time, the Russian Federation is actively cooperating with such organizationsas the Technical Committee (TK) in the ﬁeld of standardization. This has givenRussian experts the opportunity of working in the international ﬁeld of ITstandardization. The international organization is the joint technical committeeIS0/IEC JTC1, ‘‘Information technologies,”with its subcommittees and workinggroups. The Russian experts working in this organization have had the opportu-nity to vote when standards have been discussed and new rules proposed.Thus, the question of the technological security of personal data betweenEurope and Russia can be solved if countries agree on a speciﬁc standard asany international standard is developed by ISO is legal in the territory of Russia.Every participant in a well-regulated market knows that, without implementa-tion of the requirements of the existing standards which are have been developedwith the direct voluntary participation of the product suppliers and service provi-ders, not only successful activity but the existence of the market itself, would beimpossible.6. ConclusionCloud computing has drawbacks which carry new risks. These are topical both inRussia and Europe.The European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) has identi-ﬁed network and information security risks which small and medium size enter-prises (SMEs) should take into account when adopting cloud computing. [5] 1: Software security vulnerabilities2: Network attacks3: Social engineering attacks4: Management GUI and API compromise12 Z. Anna5: Device theft/loss6: Physical hazards7: Overloads8: Unexpected costs9: Vendor lock-in10: Administrative or legal outages11: Foreign jurisdiction issuesThe Cloud Security Guide for SMEs detailed the causes of such risks for plat-forms such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.Russia has not produced an ofﬁcial, systematized description of the risks asso-ciated with cloud computing. However, there is a systematized list of requirementsfor the protection of the information contained in information systems. Thus, in2013, the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control promulgated an Order‘‘On approval of requirements on data protection that do not constitute statesecrets and that are included in state information system [28].”In this Order, cloud computing is mentioned only in claim 24 as ‘‘the measures of information protec-tion that is being selected and is being implemented in information system...canapply to the environment of virtualization and cloud computing. ” In 2014, the Ministry of Communications prepared a bill ‘‘On Amendments toCertain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation regarding the use of cloudcomputing[23].”This proposed amendments to the Federal Law ‘‘On Informa-tion, Information Technologies and Protection of Information. ”It included the concept of ‘‘cloud computing”and the qualiﬁcation requirements for providersof cloud computing services; requirements for ﬁnancial stability of the respectivesuppliers; data protection which is processed by such providers; rules for tariffregulation of prices for cloud computing services; conditions for the use of cloudcomputing and rules for the provision of cloud services; and responsibilities of theparties. Simultaneously, the bill proposes to amend the Federal Law ‘‘On personaldata”to establish protection for personal data subject to cross-bordertransmission.The adoption of this bill should enable a deﬁnition of the scope of legal rela-tions, rules and regulations applicable to the parties involved in such relationships.However, it has not yet been introduced into the State Duma for consideration.This is a serious impediment to the further development of relationships in connec-tion with cloud computing in the Russian Federation.References
