Keywords:Areogeophysical dataMicrolevelingDeep convolutional networkMoG-RPCAABSTRACT
Residual magnetic error remains after standard levelling process. The weak non-geological effect, manifestingitself as streaky noise alongﬂight lines, creates a challenge for airborne geophysical data processing and inter-pretation. Microleveling is the process to eliminate this residual noise and is now a standard areogeophysical dataprocessing step. In this paper, we propose a two-step procedure for single aerogeophysical data microleveling: adeep convolutional network isﬁrst adopted as approximator to map the original data into a low-level part withnature geological structures and a corrugated residual which still contains high-level detail geological structures;second, the mixture of Gaussian robust principal component analysis (MoG-RPCA) is then used to separate theweak energyﬁne structures from the residual. Theﬁnal microleveling result is the addition of low-level structures from deep convolutional network and ﬁne structures from MoG-RPCA. The deep convolutional network does not need dataset for training and the handcrafted network serves as prior (deep image prior) to capture the low-levelnature geological structures in the areogeophysical data. Experiments on synthetic data and ﬁeld data demon- strate that the combination of deep convolutional network and MoG-RPCA is an effective framework for singleareogeophysical data microleveling.
1. IntroductionAs an efﬁcient geophysical prospecting technique, aerogeophysicalexploration plays an important role for the survey of resources ( Gao et al., 2016). The measurement between largeﬂight line spaces (several Kilo- meters) can cause levelling errors for typical aerogeophysical data ( Luo et al., 2012). The non-geological effects still remain after standardlevelling, displayed in airborne geophysical images in the form of weakstreaky noise alongﬂight lines. It affects the subsequent data processingand interpretation. Microleveling or decorrugation is the process tosuppress the residual noise. It has become one of the standard steps forprocessing of aerogeophysical data, which provides high-quality datasetfor subsequent work.There have been a lot of research on the speci ﬁc operation methods of microleveling. Classical microleveling methods are based on the space/Fourier domainﬁlters or the combinations (Syberg, 1972;Minty, 1991; Ferraccioli et al., 1998;Siemon, 2009;Paterson, Grant&Watson, 1998). All the directionalﬁltering microleveling techniquesﬁlter out part of the high frequency geological structures along the ﬂight lines (Gorune et al.,2018). To extract the space localized anomaly details, Fedi et al. ( 2003) proposed the discrete wavelet transform based magnetic ﬁelds decorru- gation methods. Microleveling can also be achieved by statisticalmethods (Gorune et al., 2018;Davydenko et al., 2014;Zhang et al., 2018).Gao et al. (2021)designed a leveling method based on curvelettransform. Leveling error in data can be effectively removed due to themulti-scale and multi-directional features of curvelet transform.Areogeophysical data microleveling shares common features fromproblem deﬁnition to operation with stripe noise removal in imageprocessing. For a comprehensive and systematic review of the imagedestriping methods, please refer toChang et al. (2020). In recent years, machine learning has been widely used in the ﬁeld of geophysics (Wang et al., 2020,2021;Magrini et al., 2020;Cuddy, 2021). Since deep CNN models have successfully solved many geophysical problems ( Zhou et al., 2021;Yu et al., 2021;Wu et al., 2021;Huang et al., 2021;Li et al., 2021
), the image destriping method using deep CNN models is naturally pro-posed. However, these methods need a large number of training samples,which are not feasible for the microleveling of ﬁeld aerogeophysical data. Ulyanov et al., 2020showed that the structure of generator CNN can

Using thenetwork as a handcrafted prior, they demonstrated excellent applicationsin image denoising, super-resolution and inpainting. Without trainingdataset,Liu et al. (2021)used U-net structure as seismic data prior, andapplied to seismic data missing trace reconstruction. Qiu et al. (2021) proposed an unsupervised denoising method for seismic random noiseattenuation by using the high and low impedance of ConvNet to noiseand seismic data.In this paper, we propose a two-step procedure for single aero-geophysical image microleveling. After levelling, the residual corruga-tion in the image is weak comparing to the amplitude of the geologicalstructures and contributed to the high frequency components in the two-dimensional image. In our proposed algorithm, the ﬁrst step is to use the generator network with Deep Image Prior (DIP) ( Ulyanov et al., 2020)t o extract the strong amplitude of the low-level nature geological structuresin the areogeophysical data. The horizontal stripe weak corrugation isthen separated from the data mixed withﬁne scale geological structures. For the second step, MoG-RPCA (Zhao et al., 2014) is adopted to separate theﬁne scale structures from the residual of the deep convolutionalnetwork. And then the separated structure details are added back to thelow-level geological structures inﬁrst step.The paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces deep con-volutional network and MoG-RPCA in detail; Section III presents themodel structure and parameter selection process used in this paper. InSection IV, we conduct experiments and discuss the results. And in Sec-tion V, we draw our conclusions.2. Proposed method2.1.

0Þis the loss function, andRðxÞis the regularization function which uses to capture the generic regularity of natural geological struc-tures.In our task, the deep convolutional network model replaces RðxÞwith an implicit prior captured by a convolutional neural network ( Ulyanov et al., 2020), as followsθ

θis the mapping (the deep convolutional network with the parameter θ), andzis a random initialized input.When iterating，the initial value is random weights θ
0, and the pa- rameters are updated by minimizing the data item equation (2). Each iteration is a network training process. The speci ﬁc iterative process is illustrated inFig. 1.Ulyanov et al. (2020)found that CNN presented low impedance tonature image by comparing the reconstruction task loss curves of originalimage and shufﬂed image (rearrange the image pixel amplituderandomly). This means the CNN network approximates the “clean”image ﬁrst when it contains random noise. In this way, it can be used toattenuate the random noise from an image. To show the effectiveness ofthe method, we conduct similar test on the aerogeophysical data. We usedeep convolutional network to reconstruct the original aerogeophysicaldata and the corresponding shufﬂed data, and the loss curves are showninFig. 2. FromFig. 2, it can be seen that the impedance to the realaerogeophysical data is lower than shufﬂed data, which means deep convolutional network can capture aerogeophysical data statistics priorand can be used for microleveling.Different from random noise, for aerogeophysical data, the stripenoise is low-frequency alongﬂight lines. However, the corrugated linesare high-frequency for the two-dimensional image. And after standardlevelling, the amplitude of the stripe noise is weak comparing to the maingeological structures in the aerogeophysical data. Fig. 3shows the iter- ation process of synthetic data. We observe that because of the MeanSquare Error (MSE) loss function, the network will extract naturegeological structures with larger amplitude value and separate the stripenoise. For the weak energyﬁne structures with amplitudes same level asthe stripe noise will also be removed. Therefore, the residual separatedby deep convolutional network contains weak energy ﬁne structures. For a high-quality microleveling result, the ﬁne structures need to be preserved.2.2. MoG-RPCAWe use MoG-RPCA to separate theﬁne scale structures from the re- sidual of the deep convolutional network. The robust principal compo-nent analysis (RPCA) is a powerful method, which decomposed the givendata matrix into low rank matrix and sparse matrix ( Vidal et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017). The formula of RPCA can be expressed asY¼LþS; (3)whereLis a low rank matrix andSis a sparse matrix. RPCA has suc- cessfully solved many machine learning and computer vision problems.Wu et al. (2019)proposed a workﬂow to attenuate seismic trafﬁc noise using thelp-norm RPCA.Zhao et al. (2014)developed a generative RPCA model under the Bayesian framework by modeling data noise as amixture of Gaussians (MoG). This method (MoG-RPCA) has shown goodeffects on random noise removal and background subtraction.

21MoG-RPCA is generally used when the non-sparse effective infor-mation is low rank, and the sparse random noise is high rank. TheGaussian mixture is used to estimate the noise. However, for aero-geophysical data, the low-rank part is low-frequency stripe noise, thehigh rank part is the detail geological structures we need. The originalnature geological structures of aerogeophysical data does not satisfy thesparse condition. And most of the information will be extracted as theprincipal component together with the stripe noise, so there is no way toachieve good microleveling effect by directly using the MoG-RPCA to theoriginal data.However, weﬁnd that most of theﬁne structures retained in the re- sidual after deep convolutional network processing is sparse, which canbe extracted by MoG-RPCA. We can use this method to extract the ﬁne structures from the residual and add it to the nature geological structuresobtained by using deep convolutional network. Therefore, the micro-leveling of aerogeophysical data can be realized by the two-step pro-cedure we proposed.To be speciﬁc, MoG is a universal approximator with any continuousdistribution (Bishop, 2006).

Network architectureThe generalized network is a full convolution encoder-decoder ar-chitecture. This type of network structure ensures that the size of theoutput data is same as that of the input data. In order to avoid the loss ofvalid data details in the pooling operation, skip-connections are alsoadded to the network. To avoid degradation of network's generalizationability, the BatchNorm structure is added to each convolution level,deconvolution level and skip-connections level. We use LeakyReLU as thenonlinear mapping and choose bilinear upsampling in the upsamplingoperation. We implement the downsampling technique by using averagepooling. For the depth of network, considering the microleveling effectand computational cost, the depth of network is set to 5 layers. Althoughthe valid geological structures are different with locations, the stripenoise is same. After testing, we select the network with largest impedanceto the low-frequency stripe noise in the data. The speci ﬁc network structure is shown inFig. 4.3.2. Parameter settings of MoG-RPCAExcept for the Gaussian numberK, all the parameters in the model are set in a non-informative way, to make their in ﬂuence on the posterior distribution as small as possible. In the experiment, we set

224. Experiments4.1. Synthetic dataThe synthetic data experiment is conducted on noiseless aero-geophysical data (Fig. 5a) with stripe noise added (Fig. 5b). The data dimension is 256/C2256. Before inputting the data into the network,normalize it so that its value is between [0,1]. The initial input data of thenetwork is uniform noise generated between 0 and 0.1 with the samedimensions as the experimental data. The learning rate is set to 0.01.Fig. 5shows the microleveling process of our two-step proceduremethod. First, we use deep convolutional network to process the syn-thetic data (Fig. 5c), extract most of the low-level geological structures(Fig. 5d) and get the corrugated residual ( Fig. 5e). By comparing the corrugated residual with the original data, it can be seen that the residualalso contains lots of weak energyﬁne structures. Next step we use MoG-RPCA to further extract theﬁne structures in the corrugated residual. Ascan be seen fromFig. 5f andgthat almost all theﬁne structures areextracted. Finally, the weak energyﬁne structures extracted by MoG- RPCA (Fig. 5f) is added to the low-level geological structures obtainedby deep convolutional network (Fig. 5d) to obtain the micro-leveling result (Fig. 5h).We use structural similarity (SSIM), MSE and Peak Signal to NoiseRatio (PSNR) to quantitatively evaluate the synthetic aerogeophysicaldata micro-leveling effect. The metrics are shown in Table 1. Through Table 1, we canﬁnd that the presence of stripe noise does have a certainimpact on aerogeophysical data and the two-step microleveling proced-ure we proposed is effective.4.2. Field dataTheﬁeld data used in our experiments is the real aerogeophysicaldata attached to Geosoft's Oasis montaj software with dimension of289/C2289, which is shown inFig. 6. The parameters setting is the sameas the synthetic data experiment.We also use MoG-RPCA and discrete wavelet transform method ( Fedi

23et al., 2003) to directly process the original data. The microleveling resultand the low-frequency stripe noise are shown in Fig. 7andFig. 8 respectively. We can see that only using MoG-RPCA ( Figs. 7c and8c), the horizontal stripe noise and the nature geological structures are regardedas the principal component together and cannot be separated. Thediscrete wavelet transform method (Figs. 7d and8d) effectively removes the stripe noise, but it also removes a lot of geological structures. Ourmethod extracts the effective information further on results of deepconvolution network (Figs. 7a and8a), so the removed energy (Fig. 8b) does not contain any valid information, and the microleveling result(Fig. 7b) is the best.We also extract same column of data from the four sets of micro-leveling results and plot them inFig. 9. The results inFig. 9further prove that compared with the single deep convolutional network ( Fig. 9a), MoG-RPCA (Fig. 9c) and discrete wavelet transform method ( Fig. 9d), the two-step microleveling procedure we proposed ( Fig. 9b) effectively removes the strip noise and retain more natural geological structures.5. Discussions and conclusionsIn this paper, we propose a two-step procedure for single aero-geophysical data microleveling, using deep convolutional network andMoG-RPCA. The deep convolutional network does not need dataset fortraining and can capture the low-level nature geological structures in theareo-geophysical data. The speciﬁc network structure is determined formicroleveling effect, computational cost, and number of parameters.MoG-RPCA is used to further extract the weak energy ﬁne structures in the corrugated residual and obtain the microleveling result. We usesynthetic andﬁeld areogeophysical data to conduct the experiments andshow the effectiveness of the proposed method. The two-step micro-leveling procedure can be used to generate labels for the supervisedmachine learning microleveling methods.FundingThis work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0602204-01).Declaration of competing interestWe declare that we do not have any commercial or associative in-terest that represents a conﬂict of interest in connection with the worksubmitted.Table 1Quantitative evaluation of microleveling result on synthetic data.
