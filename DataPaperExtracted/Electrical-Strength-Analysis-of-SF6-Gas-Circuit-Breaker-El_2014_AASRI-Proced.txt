1. Introduction SF6 circuit breaker insulation system design can be of two kinds with gas gap or along the surfaces of solid dielectrics. The discharge conditions of along the surfaces of solid dielectrics differ significantly from the discharge conditions in the gas gap and it can be the main factor in determining the circuit breaker geometric dimensions. In operation, the insulation system must withstand the normalized AC voltage and normalized overvoltages. Nowadays SF
6 insulation has gained wide-spread acceptance in high-voltage units as internal insulation due to high physical-chemical and electrical characteristics. Therefore the demand arose for reliable and accurate calculation techniques for analysis of structures‚Äô electric strength by main gaps. However, presently available criteria are frequently empirical or semi-empirical and application ‚Äì specific, consequently their application is limited [1]. Therefore performance evaluatio n of construction under high-voltage is complicated.

2. Problem definition and solution The discharge mechanism along the dielectric surfaces is still the subject of intense research [2, 3, 4] but theoretical description suitable for engineering calculations is currently unavailable. Therefore it is necessary to use different kind of simplification [5]. Based on presently-available calculation techniques, electri c strength analysis of switching unit node under high voltage with internal insulation was performed in the present study. General view of switching unit node is given in Fig. 1 [6]. Nodes are numerated as follows:   1 - grounded casing; 2 - epoxy insulator; 3 - SF

cleanup system (filter); 4- clamping element for current conductor 7 and insulator 2; 5 - screen in current- conducting system-filter gap; 6 - screen in current-cond ucting system-grounded casing gap; 7 - current conductor. Gas flow is indicated by arrows.

Nominal voltage is 220 kV, SF6 inflation pressure (absolute) is 0,7 MPa. The objective of the present study was to determine potential causes of insulator 2 flashover by internal and in some cases by external surface, during tests by normalized lightning pulses, particularly, to eliminate possible construction defects.  2.1 Calculation techniques Distribution pattern of electrical field in the node unde r investigation (Fig. 2) was obtained for analytical calculation in software package Elcut 5.5 (correspondin g region is denoted in Fig. 1 by rectangular frame). Herewith axially-symmetrical problem of electrostatics was so lved. Field distribution is denoted by equipotential lines, intensity distribution is denoted by arrows. Elements designations are given in accordance with Fig. 1. Contours (a-b) and (c-d-e-f) indicate possible directions of discharge formation.  Axially-symmetrical problem setting slightly impairs calculatio n accuracy (in comparison with three- dimensional model), but it allows to carry out  an estimative analysis. The most probable directions of discharge formation, subject to calculation, are given in  Fig. 2. Basic parameters of gaps, under investigation, are given in Table 1. Two main gaps types can be distinguished in construction un der investigation: purely gas-insulated gap (a-b, c-d, e-f) and a gap along insulator surface (d-e).  59  Daniil A.

2.2 Purely gas-insulated gaps In general, calculation technique of purely gas-insulated gaps comprises:  xDefinition of discharge independence condition in ca se
  of streamer or avalanche-type mechanism of discharge formation;  xDefinition of analytical dependence of i
ntensity distribution in a gap (in case of inhomogeneous fields);  xDefinition of resultant expression for calculation of 
 initial voltage with the use of approximated dependency of effective impact ionization coefficient on electrical field intensity.

Obtained results show that there is an adequate electrical strength of construction in case of ‚Äúpure‚Äù conditions in a gap, for which given expressions are correct. We can also make conclusion that approximated dependence of more simple form for intensity distribution in a gap in case of excessively inhomogeneous fields can be applied. Difference in calculated values is approximately 3%.  The results obtained indicate insufficient dielectric strength design, even for a gap in the unpolluted particles and decomposition products in SF6. The gas gap dielectric strength a-b is slightly greater than the withstand test voltage. Discharge voltage along the surface of the solid dielectric d-e is 0.77 of the withstand test voltage. Possible discharge path c-d-e-f is represented of electric line of force in the investigated gap, however, as shown in [5] the discharge gap along the surface of the dielectric may have another way.  Thus there is a high probability of electrical discharge occurrence in the gap either a-b or c-d-e-f.  
3. Conclusion 
In this paper, based on the discharge streamer inception criterion of tank circuit breaker electric strength is calculated. The results obtained indicate insufficient dielectric strength of this design. The theoretical results obtained during the lightning impulse test of breaker insulation are confirmed experimentally. At the moment, dielectric strength by varying the gap from 82 to 100 mm is increased.
