KEYWORDSe-Learning;Higher education;Adoption factors AbstractThe advent of the Internet in the twenty-ﬁrst century has led toremarkable changes in several aspects of our lives. This advanced technologyhas become an essential tool of communication and information, thus offeringunique advantages to both educators and students. Despite a recent educationalrevolution in Saudi Arabian educational systems, the issue of access to highereducation still remains one of the more enduring challenges. The need for moredelivery modes that take education to learners wherever they are, and not withinthe boundaries of the campus, is thus a necessity. e-Learning could dramaticallyincrease access to tertiary education and training, especially for those learnerswho were once denied learning opportunities for any reason, such as health, dis-tance or the like. Yet, successful implementation of e-learning requires an under-standing of the issues that promote the effective use of the technologies. Thisarticle discusses the factors that inﬂuence e-learning in Saudi higher educationthrough analysing the perceptions and attitudes of Saudi university students(n= 531). It reports the results of a survey conducted to investigate the accep-tance of e-learning in a Saudi higher education institution as perceived by univer-sity students. The ﬁndings demonstrated that attitudes toward e-learning,subjective norms, perceived behavioural control as well as e-learning systemsattributes were critical determinants of students’ behavioural intention to use

1. IntroductionThe new advancement in communication and information technologies has madean impact on some aspects of today’s societies. Largely, commerce, politics andeducation have been undeniably inﬂuenced (Garrison and Anderson, 2003; Khan,2005). Terms like the global village, information society and knowledge societysymbolize the new realties and change in modern societies. Education facilitatedby the new ICT or e-learning is transforming learning and instruction forms(Garrison and Anderson, 2003) in ways ‘‘that extend beyond the efﬁcient deliveryor entertainment value of traditional approaches’’ (Garrison and Anderson, 2003,p. 2). For this reason, more and more educational institutions around the worldare embracing e-learning systems and investing heavily in this sector. In SaudiArabia, the government has launched a national plan for the utilizsation of infor-mation technology (IT). The plan urges, ‘‘the implementation of e-learning anddistance learning and all their prospective applications in higher education’’(National Centre for e-Learning and Distance Learning, 2008 ). Furthermore, a national centre for promoting e-learning was established to fulﬁl the followinggoals:To develop infrastructure for e-learning.To collaborate with higher education, government and corporate partners tosolve e-learning problems.To provide complete e-learning solutions.To develop QA standards for e-learning.To develop rules and regulations for e-learning.To establish awareness of e-learning programs (National Centre for e-Learningand Distance Learning, 2008).However, effective use of e-learning only occurs ‘‘when users choose to migrate ormove from less efﬁcient systems to relatively more advanced and more beneﬁcialinnovations’’ (Ndubisi, 2006). Investments in the infrastructure, staff IT trainingand content development may not be sufﬁcient to ensure a successful adoptionand use of e-learning (Ndubisi, 2004). Several studies have highlighted that under-standing the factors that inﬂuenceusers’acceptance and use of e-learning is impor-tant for a better implementation and use of e-learning. The purpose of this study,therefore, is to investigate the factors that inﬂuence e-learning acceptance by Saudi32 K.Al-Siraihi Al-Harbiuniversity students. This paper is constructed as follows: ﬁrst, it will give a brief ac-count of e-learning. Second, it will describe the theoretical framework of this study.Third, it will present the research model and hypotheses. Then a subsequent sectionon the research methodology will follow. Next, the ﬁndings will be presented and dis-cussed in the light of research hypotheses. Finally, some implications are offered.2. e-Learninge-Learning refers to ‘‘the use of new multimedia technologies and the Internet toimprove the quality of learning by facilitating access to resources and services aswell as remote exchanges and collaboration’’ (Holmes and Gardner, 2006). e-Learning can take place totally online in virtual environments or in a mix of vir-tual and face-to-face environments; a mode entitled ‘blended learning’. e-Learninghas the potential to impact positively on education. It provides great opportunitiesfor both educators and learners to enrich their educational experiences ( Holmes and Gardner, 2006). Individuals who were disadvantaged for geographic, physicalor social circumstances have increasingly better educational chances via e-learning.Furthermore, e-learning supports synchronous and asynchronous communicationsin various formats ranging from text, voice and audio. In addition, supported bythe openness and ﬂexibility of the Internet, e-learning provides the teaching andlearning transactions with unfathomable amounts of information independent ofthe pressure of time and the constraints of distance (Holmes and Gardner, 2006). 3. Theoretical frameworkExplaining human behaviours have been a topic of vast research. The researchconducted byAjzen (1985) and Fishbein and Ajzen (1975)to understand human behaviour has been of paramount impact in psychology and other social sciencesdisciplines. The theories of Reasoned Action (TRA) ( Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975) and Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1985) have been used extensively to explainnumerous behaviours. Among the most prominent extensions of these theories isDavis’ (1989) the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) that addresses technol-ogy acceptance and use behaviours. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)has attracted substantial attention and found to be robust in explaining the accep-tance and use of various technological innovations [e.g. Internet-based courses(Arbaugh, 2000), websites (Koufaris, 2002) and the Internet (Shih, 2004)]. The the- oretical framework of this study is based on these prominent theories. The follow-ing section gives a brief account of them.3.1. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB)The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) was proposed by Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) to explain human behaviours. It postulates that the key determinante-Learning in the Saudi tertiary education: Potential and challenges 33of an individual’s behaviour is his or her intention, which is in turn a functionof two determinants, attitude toward the behaviour and subjective norm.Attitude toward the behaviour is deﬁned as ‘‘the individual’s positive or nega-tive evaluation of performing the behaviour of interest’’ ( Ajzen, 2005, p. 118). Subjective norm is deﬁned as ‘‘the person’s perception of the social pressures toperform or not to perform the behaviour under consideration’’ ( Ajzen, 2005, p. 118). However,Ajzen (1985)others realised that the theory was not sufﬁcientand had a limitation. TRA is capable of explaining only volitional behaviours(Godin and Kok, 1996). If the behaviour is not completely under volitionalcontrol, even if the individual is highly motivated by his or her attitudes andsubjective norm, he or she may not actually perform the behaviour as a resultof some other constraints.Ajzen (1985)proposed a modiﬁed version of TRA todeal with this weakness. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was proposedto explain behaviours in which individuals have partial volitional control. Thenew concept of TPB was termed Perceived Behavioural Control and it refers tothe person’s perceived ability to perform the behaviour of interest ( Ajzen, 2005). According to the new theory of Planned Behaviour, individuals’ inten-tion to perform a behaviour is a combination of their attitude toward perform-ing the behaviour, their subjective norm and their perceived control of thatbehaviour. Generally, individuals intend to perform a behaviour when ‘‘theyevaluate it positively, when they experience social pressure to perform it andwhen they believe that they have the means and opportunities to do so’’ ( Ajzen, 2005, p. 118). There is a vast literature that applied TRA and TPB to investi-gate and predict various behaviours.Yoh et al. (2003)examined consumers’ intentions to use Internet apparel and found that TRA is a robust model witha strong predictive power. In addition,Ndubisi (2004, 2006)has applied TPB to online learning adoption and found the theory to be a good predictor ofadoption behaviours.3.2. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)Davis (1989)proposed the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) speciﬁcally toexplain technology acceptance and usage behaviours. TAM postulates that anindividual’s acceptance and use of a technology is determined by the attitudes to-ward the technology. In addition, TAM posits that two basic perceptions of thetechnology also have inﬂuence on the acceptance and usage behaviours, namely,perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. These two constructs are anteced-ents to one’s attitude. Perceived usefulness refers to ‘‘the degree to which a personbelieves that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance’’(Davis, 1989, p. 320)). Perceived ease of use refers to ‘‘the degree to which a personbelieves that using a particular system would be free from effort’’ ( Davis, 1989, p. 320)). TAM has been applied to diverse technologies and has been found tobe a robust model (Ndubisi, 2004, 2006; Venkatesh, 2000).34 K.Al-Siraihi Al-Harbi4. The research model and hypothesesThis research proposes a model for explaining and predicting students’ acceptanceof e-learning. Based on the theories of TPB and TAM, the proposed modelincludes constructs and relationships which may prove to be important in thecontext of e-learning. These constructs are grouped into four factors: individual,system, social and institutional. The individual factor includes three demographiccharacteristics of the students (i.e. gender, mode of study, place of residence andfaculty), attitude, Internet experience and self-efﬁcacy. The e-learning system fac-tor includes some attributes of e-learning, speciﬁcally, usefulness, ease of use,accessibility, ﬂexibility and interactivity. The social factor includes a subjectivenorm. The institutional factor includes university support. Fig. 1shows the re- search constructs and the hypothesized relationships between them.Based on the abovementioned theories, the following hypotheses werepostulated:H1: There is a relationship between intention to use e-learning and attitude towarde-learning.H2: There is a relationship between intention to use e-learning and subjectivenorm.H3: There is a relationship between intention to use e-learning and Internet self-efﬁcacy.H4: There is a relationship between intention to use e-learning and universitysupport.H5: There is a relationship between intention to use e-learning and perceivede-learning accessibility.

Methodology5.1. Data collection methodTo collect the data for this research a survey employing questionnaire technique wasused. A total of 531 questionnaires were distributed and collected during classhours. Ethical issues, such as respondents’ consent and conﬁdentiality were ensured.5.2. InstrumentationThe questionnaire consisted of three sections. The ﬁrst section collected informa-tion about the students’ Internet experience and self-efﬁcacy. The second sectionelicited information on their perceptions and attitude toward e-learning. The thirdsection gathered some demographic information. The items of the questionnairewere adopted from previously validated instruments ( Ajzen, 1985; Davis, 1989; Moore and Benbasat, 1991; Stoehl and Lee, 2003). Respondents were asked torate their perceptions and attitude using a 7-point Likert scales ranging from1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree. Statements measuring self-efﬁcacyused a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = no conﬁdence to 5 = Very highconﬁdence. Experience was captured using three items measuring duration andfrequency of using the Internet.5.3. Data analysis techniquesDescriptive statistics were used to describe and understand the data. Multipleregression analysis was used to test the research model. In addition, t-test and ANOVA were employed to examine the differences between the students basedon their demographics. Regression analysis assumptions including normality,36 K.Al-Siraihi Al-Harbilinearity, multicollinearity and homoscedasticity were examined ( Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007). No violations of these assumptions were detected. Similarly, theassumptions for thet-test and ANOVA were also met.5.4. Psychometric properties of the instrumentThe reliability of the instrument was measured by using Cronbach’s alpha (seeTable 1). The instrument had a very high reliability, a= .97. The alpha coefﬁ- cients for the sub-scales were also very good, exceeding the minimum thresholdrecommended in the literature of 0.70, thus indicating good internal consistency(Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007).To conﬁrm the validity of the model’s key dimensions, principle componentsanalysis (PCA) was carried out. Prior to performing PCA, the suitability of datafor factor analysis was examined. The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin value was .932;exceeding the minimum recommended value of .6 (Hair et al., 2006). The Bartlett test of sphericity reached statistical signiﬁcance, supporting the factorability of thedata (Hair et al., 2006). Guided by conceptual and practical considerations, thestudy accepted factor loadings of .40 and above whichHair et al. (2006)were con- sidered important. The oblique rotation was used as it represents the clustering ofvariables more accurately (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007). Forty-three items out of the original 44 were loaded on 11 factors with a total variance of 70%. One expe-rience item was dropped because of poor loading. Key dimensions, items loadings,Eigenvalues and variances are presented inTable 2.6. SampleA stratiﬁed cluster sample of students (n= 531) was randomly drawn fromthe population of students at King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah, SaudiArabia.Table 1Reliability of the scale.MS D #a Internet experience 5.145 1.498 2 .85Internet self-eﬃcacy 3.569 .9428 7 .91Attitude 5.515 1.283 3 .85Perceived ease of use 5.558 1.344 4 .93Perceived usefulness 5.522 1.185 5 .91Perceived ﬂexibility 5.565 1.282 4 .84Perceived interactivity 5.641 1.293 3 .88Perceived accessibility 5.124 1.322 4 .81Subjective norm 5.213 1.280 4 .87University support 4.227 1.513 4 .84Behavioural intention 5.331 1.256 3 .81Overall scale 43 .97e-Learning in the Saudi tertiary education: Potential and challenges 37Table 2PCA results.Item Loading Eigenvalue and variance extractedPU2 .879 Perceived usefulness E= 17.96;V= 33.2% PU3 .846PU4 .734PU1 .580PU5 .480SE2 .836 Self-eﬃcacy E= 4.552;V= 8.4% SE3 .833SE5 .777SE4 .689SE7 .652SE1 .649SE6 .534US1 .886 University support E= 2.924;V= 5.4% US3 .764US4 .646US2 .908SN1 .879 Subjective norm E= 2.090;V= 3.8% SN3 .862SN2 .748SN4 .640BI3 .948 Behavioural intention E= 1.809;V= 3.3% BI1 .929BI2 .543PA1 .830 Perceived accessibility E= 1.725;V= 3.2% PA2 .764PA3 .747PA4 .621PF3 .685 Perceived ﬂexibility E= 1.489;V= 2.7% PF4 .659PF2 .600PF1 .422PE3 .809 Perceived ease of use E= 1.324;V= 2.4% PE4 .766PE2 .763PE1 .729PI2 .788 Perceived interactivity E= 1.247;V= 2.3% PI1 .759PI3 .646ATT2 .674 Attitude E= 1.150;V= 2.1% ATT3 .580ATT1 .565EX2 .771 Experience E= 1.024;V= 1.8% EX1 .72038 K.Al-Siraihi Al-Harbi7. Results of analysis7.1. Sample proﬁleTable 3presents the demographic proﬁle of the survey respondents. Of thosewho participated, 39% were male and 61% were female. Eighty-four percentof the respondents were regular students and only 16% were enrolled as exter-nal. These proportions mirror reality. Furthermore, the majority of the respon-dents (76%) were from the city. With regard to their Internet experience, 56% ofthe students described themselves as having high Internet experience. This is notsurprising since the respondents are young university students who had takenearlier Internet and computer courses during high school. Only less than 3%of the sample reported no Internet experience.Table 3also summarises the type of Internet connection the students reported. DSL connection (54%) is the pre-vailing type, whilst satellite connection is the least used (3.4%), probably due toits high costs.7.2. Explaining intention to use e-learning (BI)A multiple regression analysis was undertaken for intention to use e-learning andits proposed determinants in this research (attitude, subjective norm, self-efﬁcacy,university support and perceived e-learning accessibility).

As theorized, the research model explaineda signiﬁcant proportion of the variance in BI (Table 4). The model accounted for43% of BI’s variance and this is considered a large effect ( Cohen, 1988). Looking at the individual determinants of BI, attitude (b= .32), subjective norm (b= .22) and university support (b= .18) had all signiﬁcant inﬂuence on BI at the .001%level. Perceived e-learning accessibility (b= .12) had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on BIat the .01% level, whereas Internet self-efﬁcacy (b= .083) was signiﬁcant at the.05% level. Therefore, hypotheses 1–5 were supported.7.3. Explaining attitude to using e-learningAs proposed by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the two constructs ofperceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) explained a signiﬁ-cant percentage of variance in attitude,R
2= .46% (Table 5). According toCohen (1988)this is a large effect. PU had a strong signiﬁcant effect on ATT ( b= .33). PEOU had even a stronger inﬂuence on ATT (b= .40). Both results of this anal-ysis gave support to hypotheses 6 and 7.7.4. Explaining perceived usefulness (PU)Hypotheses 8 and 10 were supported as perceived interactivity (PI) ( b= .40) and perceived ﬂexibility (PF) (b= .43) were found to have strong signiﬁcant inﬂuenceon the perceptions of e-learning usefulness at the .001% level as shown in Table 6.

On the other hand, Internet expe-rience (IE) (b= .06) was not found to have a signiﬁcant relationship with PU,thus hypothesis 9 was rejected.7.5. Explaining perceived ease of use (PEOU)The model also hypothesises that the perceptions of ease of use (PEOU) are inﬂu-enced by Internet self-efﬁcacy (SE) and experience of using the Internet. It wasfound that SE has a strong signiﬁcant inﬂuence on PEOU ( b= .36), whereas IE has a small but signiﬁcant effect on PEOU (b= .147) at the .01% level. Bothconstructs accounted for .23% in PEOU variance (Table 7). This is considered a medium size effect (Cohen, 1988). Thus, hypotheses 11 and 12 were supported.7.6. Differences between the studentsTo examine the differences between the students in their intention to use e-learningbased on their demographics, a series oft-tests and ANOVA were utilised. To seeif there is difference between male and female students regarding their intention touse e-learning, an independent samplest-test was conducted.Table 8shows that male students were signiﬁcantly different from female students on their intentionto use e-learning (p= .002). Male students demonstrated greater intentions to usee-learning than female students. However, the magnitude of the difference in themeans was very small (g
2= 0.02). Further, to see if the students are different intheir intention to use e-learning based on their place of residence, another t-test was carried out. No statistically signiﬁcant difference was found between the

Anothert-test was performed to see if there isdifference in intentions based on the mode of study.Table 8also reveals that exter- nal students have greater intention to use e-learning than regular students(p= .000). The effect of size was very small (g
2= 0.03) (Cohen, 1988). Finally, a one way between groups ANOVA was conducted to see if the students of thedifferent faculties are different in their intention to use e-learning. A statisticallysigniﬁcant difference was found among the different faculties, F(11, 519) = 3.435,p= .000. The effect size calculated using eta squared was .06, which is amedium effect according toCohen (1988). Post hoc comparisons using TukeyHSD test indicated that the mean score for the students in the faculty of economicsand administration (M= 5.8134,SD= .90377) was signiﬁcantly different fromthe students of the faculty of Arts and Humanities ( M= 5.0942,SD= 1.29397), the students in the faculty of Home Economics ( M= 4.9023, SD= 1.35078) and the students in the faculty of science ( M= 4.7353,SD= 1.45037). These signiﬁcant differences support hypothesis 13.8. DiscussionThis study proposed a model to explain and understand Saudi university students’intention to accept and use e-learning. It adoptedAjzen’s (1985)theory of planned behaviour as well asDavis’ (1989)TAM as its theoretical framework. Students’intention (BI) was found to be very well explained by the determinants of behav-ioural intention as proposed byAjzen (1985). Attitude is an important factor thatinﬂuences BI to use e-learning. This result is similar to previous ﬁndings ( Stoehl and Lee, 2003), which have shown that attitude toward performing behaviourhas an inﬂuence on the intention to carry out this behaviour. In other words, stu-dents who hold favourable attitude about using e-learning are more inclined to ac-cept and use this innovation. The results also showed that the inﬂuence ofimportant groups such as instructors or peers was signiﬁcant. This result is in linewith the results reported in a previous research (Taylor and Todd, 1995) thatTable 8Comparisons between students.VariableM SD t df pBIMales 5.54 1.17 3.09 528 .002Females 5.19 1.28BIJeddah 5.31 1.28 /C0.67 520 .503 Outside 5.39 1.17BIRegular 5.25 1.28 4.78

This impliesthat the students’ conﬁdence of using the Internet may have an inﬂuence on theirintention to adopt e-learning.Ma and Liu (2005) and Rezaei et al. (2008)found similar results, yet, they reported that Internet self-efﬁcacy was found as a strongdeterminant of e-learning adoption and usage. Perceived e-learning accessibility,which corresponds to the second construct of PBC, was found signiﬁcant and thusinﬂuencing intentions to use e-learning. This implies that if the university studentsfeel that they have ready access to e-learning (i.e. speedy Internet connection withaffordable costs, the necessary equipments), they will be more encouraged to usee-learning (Abdel-Wahab, 2008). The ﬁnal determinant of BI suggested by ourmodel is university support (US), which was found to have a statistically signiﬁ-cant inﬂuence on students’ intention to use e-learning. This result suggests thatthe students will accept and use e-learning more readily if the university supportsthe e-learning initiative. This study further conﬁrms the important role of institu-tional support reported in previous research (Selim, 2007). The two constructs of TAM, namely PU and PEOU were tested for their inﬂu-ence on ATT and were found to be signiﬁcantly impacting attitudes. This givesfurther support to the robustness of TAM. Moreover, in an attempt to understandPU, perceived ﬂexibility (PF), perceived interactivity (PI) and Internet experience(IE) were proposed as antecedents of PU. The two constructs of PF and PI werefound to be important in forming PU perceptions. However, PU was not signiﬁ-cantly inﬂuenced by prior experience with the Internet. Students’ experience withthe Internet over time will not increase the perceptions of usefulness. Stoehl and Lee (2003)reported similar results. To explain PEOU, IE and SE were postulatedas antecedents of this construct. The results demonstrated that Internet experiencesigniﬁcantly impacted the perceptions of PEOU. In other words, the students’experience with the Internet over time will increase the perceptions of ease ofuse (Stoehl and Lee, 2003). In addition, Internet self-efﬁcacy was also found asa strong factor inﬂuencing PEOU. This ﬁnding implies that students with higherconﬁdence in using the Internet will perceive e-learning as easier to use. This con-curs with the ﬁndings ofMa and Liu(2005)that users strongly anchor ease of useperceptions to their SE. Finally, in exploring the differences between the Saudi stu-dents in their intention to use e-learning, gender, mode of study and facultyemerged as personal characteristics that are associated with intention to usee-learning. A signiﬁcant gender variation was found for the intention to usee-learning supporting prior research (Ong and Lai, 2006). Saudi male students showed more liking to use e-learning than the female students. In a study con-ducted byWagner et al. (2005)the students’ status of study (part-time or full-time)e-Learning in the Saudi tertiary education: Potential and challenges 43was found to have an impact on perceptions of on-line learning. Similarly, the cur-rent study found a signiﬁcant difference between external and regular students intheir intention to use e-learning. External students showed greater intention to usee-learning than regular students. The attractiveness of e-learning for externalstudents is maybe due to the beneﬁts of e-learning systems, such as their ﬂexibilityand interactivity (Taylor and Todd, 1995; Ndubisi, 2006). Furthermore, the students were found different in their intention to use e-learning based on theirfaculty.9. ConclusionIn summary, this research sought to determine the factors that inﬂuence Saudi uni-versity students’ intention to use e-learning. The ﬁndings showed that e-learningacceptance is inﬂuenced by several factors. The results indicated that the students’attitude toward e-learning is the most important factor in determining students’intention to use e-learning. The students’ decision to use e-learning is also deter-mined by their subjective norm, i.e. the inﬂuence of the important people aroundthem. Moreover, perceived e-learning accessibility plays a role in shaping the stu-dents behavioural intention regarding e-learning acceptance. University support ofthe e-learning initiative as well as the students’ conﬁdence of using the Internetinﬂuence the students’ intention to use e-learning. Furthermore, the perceptionsof e-learning usefulness, ease of use were found signiﬁcant in forming an attitudetoward e-learning. Similarly, the perceptions of e-learning ﬂexibility and interac-tivity were found important in shaping the perceptions of e-learning usefulness.In the same way, the perceptions of ease of use were inﬂuenced by experienceand self-efﬁcacy. Finally, the students showed differences in their intention touse e-learning based on their gender, mode of study and faculty. Male, externaland economics and administration students demonstrated stronger intentions touse e-learning.10. Implications of the ﬁndingsAs attitude toward e-learning was found to have a strong impact on the intentionto use e-learning among the students, policy-makers should attempt to build po-sitive attitudes among the potential e-learners such as male and external students.One way of achieving this goal is by highlighting the usefulness of this mode oflearning to potential users. One of the greatest advantages of e-learning as per-ceived by the students is that it gives university students greater ﬂexibility in timeand place (Ndubisi, 2006). Moreover, e-learning enhances interactivity, i.e. com-munication between the students among themselves and with their tutors. As a re-sult, designers of e-learning systems should pay attention to these beneﬁts anddesign e-learning programmes that offer ﬂexibility and interactivity. In addition,attitude toward e-learning is inﬂuenced by the perceptions of e-learning ease of44 K.Al-Siraihi Al-Harbiuse. In other words, potential users are more likely to adopt and use e-learning ifthey deem it easy to use (Ndubisi, 2006). This suggests that designing easy to usesystems can lead to a better adoption of e-learning among the students. Equallyimportant to the acceptance of e-learning is the inﬂuence of the society. As e-learn-ing is still new, the students have limited knowledge of this service. The society,thus, may provide the students with an alternative source for judging e-learning.Educating the society (e.g. family and instructors) with the beneﬁts of e-learningcan thus facilitate its acceptance.Perceived e-learning accessibility emerged in this research as an importantfactor of e-learning acceptance. The students are more likely to accept and usee-learning if they think they have easy access to the system. Thus, e-learningsuppliers (e.g. the university) should ensure trouble-free access to e-learning.The university can increase students acceptance of e-learning by providing trainingfor the students on using the Internet as well as by making available Internetaccess points across the university and also by offering technical support. Finally,since some groups of students (e.g. males and external) showed more demand touse e-learning, attention should be given to these groups and make every effortto meet their requirements and high need for e-learning. Equally important, isto direct attention to the other groups of students who showed less interest ine-learning.11. LimitationsThis study had some limitations. First, e-learning in Saudi Arabia is still in its in-fancy with a paucity of information on its use at the time of the study. Thus, thegreatest part of pertinent literature comes from other nations and may not truth-fully explain the situation in Saudi Arabia. Second, the current study relied on onesample that had its unique features and may not be totally representative of thebroader population. This may affect generalising the ﬁndings. Furthermore, thisstudy utilised only self-reported measures. Although this method has been repeat-edly employed in the past as a way of measuring attitude and perceptions, it is nec-essary to be aware of the weaknesses and issues associated with this method.References
