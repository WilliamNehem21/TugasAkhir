 1. Preface  
The product modeling design is Effective expression of seman tic to some extent, and Product form characteristics plays a 
key role in the product semantics comm unication. Products are perceived by users through its shape information and 
Produce short-term memory which matches th e experience and knowledge of long time memory in the process of intuition, 
So as to form the individual perceptual intention of the product by users. User's perceptual intention of the product is usually 
with some fuzziness and can hardly be qu antitative analysised, so we introduce language as a variable to its description 
based on fuzzy theory method, and make this fuzzy language information into numerical value which make the quantitative 
analysis of user's perceptual intention information possiable. 
This paper try to use statistics method to establish user model of automotive products form based on the fuzzy theory, 
and puts forward the possiable quantitative resear ch tools to household car product form. The research procedure as shown 
in figure 1.

 Experimental sample use the Sampling method. The first place is to build domestic automobile samples.We used the 
stratified random sampling method which Selected 25 household cars as a sample, as is shown in table 1;The second place 
is subjects sample.We use the Quota sampling method, and Tr y to make the distribution of average proportion In the 
professional, gender, age, etc into consider ation.We select 20 males and 20 females as subjects In this experiment,Including 
12car appearance designers, 5 automotive engineers, 7 fore ign trade managers, 7 civil servants, 3 accountings and 6 
teachers.  
This psychology experiment use questionnaire survey method depth interview method to get composition factors that 
describe product, And further the semantic analysis scale method. Adding seven degree adjectives for composition factors 
respectively from weak to strong, On behalf of the "very approve of, is in favor of - a little for - neutral - just don't agree 
with -- inot in favor of - not in favor of a lot" ,and correspond score to - 3 points, - 2 points, 1 points, 0 points, 1 points , 2 
points, 3 points. When Using the semantic analysis scale for experiment, the participants should choose the point Most 
conforms to his feeling to score in the seven scale accord to his impression of this evaluation object. We got the household 
cars' component factor after the depth interview for 10 designers and engineers: 1. (simple - complex), 2. (personality - 
mass), 3. (cold - kind), 4. (dynamic - calm), (delicate - strai ghtforward), 6. (traditional, modern), 7. (small - atmospheric),  
(soft - hardened), 9. (luxury - plain), (human - machine) . C onstructing seven scale of product component factor . With one 
model for example, all models by analogy.

3.2 necessity analysis based on the Applied statistics  
Data analysis  
We take the principal component analysis method of applie d statistics to work, the essence of the principal component 
analysis method is a multivariate statistical analysis method wh ich converts multiple measured variables into several 
unrelated indicators, the composite indicators are not relevant, which refers to the information that each of the composite 
indicator representatives do not overlap. Such method is very suitable for experimental analyzing which contains multiple 
variables multiple samples and large quantity of experimental data. 
Input the data of Table 2 into MICROSOFT EXCEL to made worksheet, and import SPSS program. Apply the Data 
Reduction under Analyze menu and choose Factor to analyze. In theFactor Analysis dialog box, first put these 10 pairs of 
component factors into Variables box, select Initial Solution in Discriptives tab, Indicate that the factor analysis are the 
commons, eigenvalues, percentage of variance and cumulative perc entage, and select KMO and Bartlett's test of sphericity 
in correlation matrix option to display the KMO sampling appropriate parameters and sphericity test of Bartlett's. Then 
select "Principal components" method in factors-extraced ta b,"Correlation matrix" in the "Analyze" option, “Eigenvalues 
over” in "Extract" option, and select eigenvalue that greater than 1 when setting factors-extracted. Finally select the "Save a s 598   Yue Pang and Fang Bian  /  AASRI Procedia   3  ( 2012 )  595 – 600 
variable" in "Factor Scores" dialog box , so you can storage factor scores to the new data file and generate a new variable 
name. This experiment select "Regression" method and select "Exclude cases listwise" for the processing mode of missing 
values,which refers to analyz the observed values when there are no missing values in all the variables. 
Principal component extraction results  
The experiment's common degrees form's Output results is  shown in the Chart 2. "Initial" stands for Initial common 
degrees of each variable quantity, all this value are 1. "Extraction" is regeneration common degrees after Extraction of 
factors. It shows information ratio of each factor are extracted. It  can be seen from this one , all variables 's information 
ratio been extracted is more than 0.5, and there are eight variables's extracted information ratio is above 0.7 or very close t o 
0.7. It shows that each variable's information had been extracted a lot, It is reasonable analysis.

The total variance explained table results shown in the Ch art 3. "Total "represents the eigenvalue, the size of the 
characteristic value reflects the common factor of variance cont ribution, and bigger Eigenvalue represents the bigger 
variance contribution. "% of Variance" on behalf the percentage of the characteristic value in Variance. 
"Cumulative %"represents the additive value of percentage. The eigenvalue bigger than 1 is listed in right column. 
"Extraction Sums of Squared Loadings" draws two factors m eet the requirements, and variance that these two factors 
explained  accounted for 65.414% of the whol e variance which reflect most of the information of all variables. They are 
principal component extracted in the experime nt which can be Used for further analysis.

 3.3 Household car products image profile  
On the basis of the analysis of the above data, we can ap ply the extracted main component to draw two points which 
determined by two variables in two-dimensional space, and then analyze the distribution characteristics of the data through 
the distribution characteristics of these points , including density degree and distribution dir ection.Then using the Scatterplot 
functions of SPSS software to set the X-axis for"REGR Fator Scoer 1 for anlysis 1 [fac1_1]”,the Y-axis for “REGR 
provided Fator Scoer for analysis 1 [fac2_1]” in the left rectangular box, then output samples two-dimensional imagery 
maps,as shown in the figure, the horizontal axis represents the aggregative indicator 1 of principal component analysis, the 
vertical axis represents the aggregative indicator 2 of the prin cipal component analysis and the red dots represent samples. 
The load value of the principal component is called correlati on coefficient in factor component matrix ,if they are greater 
than 0.5 ,it means the relevance is higher and what original variables the composite indicator better represents. we can know 
what variables the aggregative indicator 1 and 2 respectively better represent according to this principle. Using the principle 
that the variables which two axes representatives could not repeat, we can label the horizontal axis in negative direction for 
fine, soft, simple, user-friendly, the horizontal axis in the positive direction for the rough, rigid, complex, mechanical; lab el 
longitudinal axis in the positive direction for the public , friendly, quiet, traditional, rustic, longitudinal axis in the neg ative 
direction of the personality, apathy, dynamic, modern and luxurious. 
We can get the following conclusions after analyzing the image schema of the 25 family car models:Firstly, the area 
where red dots are intensive, means integrating each variable indicators the product imagery is very close in the area; the 
area where red dots are parse, means the product imagery is decentralized in this area. In this way we quantify the aesthetic 
perception people to the Tablet PC , which is not easy to be intuitive reaction perc eptual. The area where product imagery is 
intensive, is called products imagery coincidence area, means that it is not suitable for re-development of new products, 
such as in the figure, we can see the imagery of V olkswagen Golf and Polo, Mazda 6 and Ford iosis, Wei Zhi and Picasso 
are coincidence, then we should avoid the image focal point and select the area where product imagery is decentralized if 
we want to develop new models. 
Secondly, analyzing from the distribution direction of the dot, the endpoint in the negative direction of the horizontal axis 
is the V olkswagen Beetle, this period represented by variables are adelicate, soft, simple, user-friendly. Prototype of Beetle 
is designed by German designer Porsche in  1930s, We can see it from the location of the imagery maps that the car is one of 
the personalized models recognized of publ ic. The endpoint in the positive direction of the horizontal axis is the General 
Motors Cadillac cts, this endpoint represented by the variables are the rough, cold, complex, mechanical. This body waist is 600   Yue Pang and Fang Bian  /  AASRI Procedia   3  ( 2012 )  595 – 600

very tall and strong,and headlamps, fog lamps of the car are using angular, rectangular elements. imagery figure of each car 
samples can be analyzed in the same way to find the positioning of the models in the branding process.

Conclusion  
Automobile product appearance modelling had attracted more and more attention in our country,but there still exist some 
problems in design process when designers work on the appe arance of automobile. They don't  form the scientific and 
systematic analysis to users' demand but depands on their fee lings, which calls for hidden trouble of the elimination. This 
paper gets perceptual image profile based on the morphology of the car through statistics, psychology, social studies of 
science research theory and research methods, and Buildes user's mental models. With Putting forward scientific and 
effective product value data analysis method, provides a basis for future automobile appearance design. References [1] Bruno Sacco, Understanding of Mercedes Desi gn, Mercedes-Benz of North America,1988,16
