The present paper aims to develop and validate a robust and secure watermarking algorithm. Firstly, the algo-
rithm transforms the cover image and the watermark image separately by FRFT to obtain the amplitudes of both 
the cover image and watermark image, and then the two-level DWT transformation only carries out for the 
amplitude of the cover image. Secondly, the algorithm applies the SVD to the low-frequency sub-band of the 
second level DWT of the cover image and the amplitude of the watermark image. Thirdly, a new matrix is 
constructed based on the singular values from both the cover and watermark images to embed watermark in-
formation. Lastly, the algorithm takes the preliminary numerical calculation to determine an appropriate 
transformation order of FRFT for the cover image and to provide an outstanding balance between the imper -
ceptibility and robustness in the proposed watermarking scheme. Moreover, it guarantees the security of 
watermarking scheme by the transformation order of FRFT. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 
watermarking scheme provides better performance in imperceptibility and resistance against traditional signal 
processing and geometric attacks, especially in image rotation, image cropping, average filtering, median 
filtering, and Gaussian filtering in comparison with the existing methods in the literature.

1.Introduction 
Digital watermarking is a research topic in modern information se-
curity, which involves many research fields such as encryption, digital 
signal processing, communication technology and multimedia applica -
tion. The importance of digital watermarking technology in protecting 
an image from various attacks is highlighted by embedding secret in-
formation to a specific host image. With the progress and application of 
digital multimedia and information technology, the application scopes 
of digital watermarking have covered information hiding, copyright 
protection, content integrity authentication, product anti- 
counterfeiting, product traceability, etc. [1–5] There have been 
numerous publications over the last 20 years on digital watermarking technology to meet the growing needs of the information age [6–10]. 
Based on different application fields, many digital watermarking 
schemes have been focused and advanced in different perspectives. 
It is well known that digital watermarking can be divided into two 
categories, the spatial domain and the transform domain [11–20]. Most 
of the previous works on digital watermarking technologies have been 
conducted in the spatial domain [21–23]. Spatial domain-based trans -
form methods embed watermark information into a host image by 
directly altering the pixel values of a cover image. The spatial 
domain-based watermarking schemes have the merits of low complexity 
and easy implementation, but they are vulnerable to be attacked. The 
transform domain-based watermarking schemes embed watermark in-
formation into a host image by altering the frequency coefficients of an 
image after various different transformations. In fact, the transform 
domain-based schemes are mainly based on considerations of both 
spectral features of images and human visual system to hide the infor-
mation. At present, the main transformation methods applied to digital 
watermarking include DCT [15,16,24–27], DWT [28,29] and SVD 
[30–33] and so on. Most existing schemes in digital watermarking have 
been proposed based on DCT, SVD, DWT and other technologies in 
transform domain [6–8,12,17–20,33–36]. The research progress of

2digital watermarking technologies has been greatly promoted by the 
aforementioned schemes. 
The research field of digital image watermarking has gradually 
broadened as FRFT domain. FRFT is a new transformation method, 
which maps information from time (space) axis to frequency axis, and 
can be rotated by any angle [37]. Compared to the other transformation 
methods, the watermarking schemes in FRFT domain have offered 
greater flexibility with regards to the fact that FRFT can simultaneously 
represent the spatial and frequency information. Tsai et al. [36] 
embedded watermark information in the domain of FRFT and its four 
kinds of generalized transforms. Vicente et al. [38] proposed to use the 
fractional Fourier transform for analyzing and reconstructing the 
magnetization of the object in the presence of the secondary field. Rawat 
et al. [39] put forward a robust watermarking algorithm in FRFT 
domain, where the original image was not altered by embedding the 
watermark information into the original image. Zhang et al. [40] pre-
sented a digital image watermarking technique in FRFT domain and 
analyzed the energy distribution of the transform image. A chirp typed 
watermark information was embedded into the spatial domain directly, 
and detected in the FRFT domain in the paper. Shi et al. [41] designed a 
novel fractional wavelet transform in order to correct the boundedness 
of the wavelet and the FRFT. The proposed transform method could 
provide signal representations in the time-fractional- frequency plane. 
By analyzing the previous works of literature, these studies have 
emphasized on watermarking algorithms only in FRFT itself, as opposed 
to the combination of SVD, DWT and FRFT. These findings suggest that 
the watermarking schemes only in FRFT domain might not be so effec-
tive against different malicious attacks, especially for geometric attacks. 
There are many alternative methods available for improving the 
imperceptibility and robustness in a variety of situations. In all of these 
cases, a robust digital watermarking scheme is proposed based on DWT 
and SVD in FRFT domain. The proposed watermarking scheme inherits 
the advantages of multi-resolution analysis of the DWT and the stabil -
ities of SVD as well as the capability of signal representations in FRFT 
domain. The primary objective of our proposed scheme is to improve the 
imperceptibility, robustness and security of digital watermarking. 
The main focus of this paper is to propose a robust and secure 
watermarking scheme based on the new blend of DWT and SVD in FRFT 
domain. It provides an alternative for more secure watermarking 
embedding technology. In the field of image watermarking based on 
FRFT, the transformation order of FRFT can be used as a secret key in the 
process of embedding and extracting watermark information. 
The organizational structure of the rest of our paper is as follows. We 
introduce the fundamental theories in Section 2. Section 3 gives more 
details of our proposed watermarking scheme. In Section 4, the exper -
imental results and analysis are presented in detail, and the advantages 
of the proposed scheme compared with other existing schemes are given. 
Finally, Section 5 summarizes this paper and draws conclusions. 2.Background theory 
2.1. Discrete wavelet transform 
DWT is an invertible transform in the frequency domain, the working 
principle of which is based on the wavelets with varying transform 
frequency. The significance of DWT lies in the ability to decompose 
signals at different scales, and the selection of different scales can be 
determined according to different targets. For many signals, the low- 
frequency component is very important, which often contains the 
characteristics of the signal, while the high-frequency component gives 
the details or differences of the signal. Approximation component and 
detail component are often used in wavelet analysis. Generally speaking, 
approximation component represents the high-scale of the signal, that is, 
the low-frequency information; Details component represent the high- 
scale signal, that is, high-frequency information. 
It is a powerful and useful means for signal analyzing and processing, 
which decomposes a 2D image into four independent sub-bands, namely 
LL (approximate component details), HL (horizontal component de-
tails), LH (vertical component details) and HH (diagonal component 
details) [5]. An image can be transformed repeatedly by DWT to get 
multi-scale wavelet decomposition, so as to make it have multiplied 
approximations and details. The highest coefficient in low-resolution 
band LL of DWT denotes the most information. The DWT has the char-
acteristics of multi-resolution and multi-layering, and accords with the 
human vision system. It has certain advantages in improving the 
imperceptibility of watermark. The formula of DWT can be expressed as 
follows: 
WaCb〈ftCψaCb〉 (1)  
where a is the scaling factor and b is the translation factor; ftrepresents 
the specific signal, and ψaCbis the wavelet function. WaCbis the 
result of the wavelet transform, which is a function of a and b. 
2.2. Singular value decomposition 
SVD, as an effective algebraic feature extraction method in linear 
algebra, has been widely used in the fields of data dimensionality 
reduction algorithm, recommendation system, natural language pro-
cessing and so on. This mainly origin from its good properties, such as 
good stability. When one image is subject to small disturbance, the 
singular value of it will not change greatly. In many digital water -
marking schemes based on SVD, most watermark information is 
embedded in a cover image built on a new matrix of singular values. 
We study an m×n matrix A for an image and get the following re-
sults by performing SVD on matrix A, as shown in expression (2) [30]: 
AU[
D

0]
m×nVT(2)  
where U is a matrix with dimensions m×m and VT is a diagonal matrix 
with dimensions n×n. The columns of U andVT are referred to as the left 
and right singular vectors of A, respectively. D∃Rr×r is a square diag-
onal matrix, Ddiagσ1Cσ2CBBBCσrwith positive diagonal entries called 
the singular values of A, which are arranged in descending order: 
σ1≽σ2≽BBB≽σrF0. 
2.3. Fractional order Fourier transform theory and analysis 
FRFT is an important method in information analysis and processing 
for non-stationary signals, which can represent the information in both 
spatial and frequency domain simultaneously. It is totally different from 
the conventional Fourier transform that only expresses the information 
in frequency domain or spatial domain. The two-dimensional fractional 
order Fourier transform is extended from the one-dimensional fractional 
order Fourier transform. Suppose that for any two-dimensional signal Abbreviations

where 𝒟p1Cp2sCtCuCvis the kernel function of two-dimensional FRFT α
p1πE2, βp2πE2.  
it is found from the expression (5) that the transform kernel of two- 
dimensional FRFT can be decomposed into the product of two trans -
form kernels of one-dimensional FRFT, namely: 
𝒟p1Cp2sCtCuCv𝒟p1sCu×𝒟p2tCvC (6)  
where αβ0, the two-dimensional FRFT is equal to the function 
itself; when α0CβπE2, the two-dimensional FRFT is DFT only for t; 
when απE2Cβ0, the two-dimensional FRFT is DFT only for s; when 
αβπE2, the two-dimensional FRFT is equivalent to the conven -
tional two-dimensional Fourier transform. 
According to formula (3), α and β are the fractional order of the 
fractional Fourier transform, the rotation angles of the coordinate axes. 
When the rotation angle α and β is an integer multiple of πE2, the above 
fractional Fourier transform becomes the traditional Fourier transform. 
The traditional Fourier transform is a standard and powerful tool for analyzing and processing stationary signals, but it is weak for processing 
and analyzing time-varying non-stationary signals. This is because the 
traditional Fourier transform uses the global basis function, which 
highlights the good characteristics of FRFT to analyze some non- 
stationary signals. 
2.4. FRFT of two-dimensional watermark image 
Fig. 1(a)-Fig. 1(f) show the FRFT results of the watermark image for 
Foshan University with different transformation orders. In our paper, we 
only study the cases of transformation order p1p2. As shown in 
Fig. 1, the information of the two-dimensional watermark image in the 
spatial-frequency domain is changed with the transformation order of 
FRFT. When the transformation order p1Cp20C0, the watermark 
image presents complete spatial domain feature information [Fig. 1(a)]. 
When the transformation order p1Cp21C1, the watermark image 
presents complete frequency domain feature information [Fig. 1(f)]. The 
more the transformation order p1Cp2is close to0C0, the more spatial 
information of the watermark image is reflected in the transformed 
image after FRFT. The more the transformation order p1Cp2is close 
to1C1, the more frequency information of the watermark image is re-
flected in the transformed image after FRFT. In other graphs, the spatial 
and frequency domain feature components of watermark images are 
simultaneously included. [Fig. 1(b)–1(e)]. In addition, the watermark 
images have different transformation coefficients with different trans -
formation orders of FRFT, the transformation coefficients of which 
corresponds to the ratio of spatial information to frequency information. 
It should be noted that the FRFT transform images of the watermark 
image have certain confidentiality. The original image feature infor-

4mation can be restored from the transformed image after FRFT with the 
same transformation order of p1Cp2. If we have no correct trans -
formation order, the original image feature information is not obtained 
correctly. The transformation order of FRFT p1Cp2can be used as a key 
for image encryption. Therefore, the proposed scheme based on the 
combined FRFT and other image watermarking technology will have 
more freedom, security, and flexibility. 
3.A robust watermark embedding and extracting structure 
based on DWT-SVD in FRFT domain 
In this study, a novel image watermarking scheme has been proposed 
based on DWT-SVD combined technology in FRFT domain. In this sec-
tion, we comprehensively discuss the proposed watermarking scheme, 
including the process of watermark embedding and extraction. Suppose 
I and W indicate the gray cover image with dimension size M×M and the 
watermark image with dimension size L ×L. I_W represents the water -
marked image. 
The frame diagram of watermark embedding process is illustrated in 
Fig. 2. The detailed steps of watermark embedding are given as follows: 
Step (1): First, perform FRFT on the cover image I with the trans -
formation order p1Cp2. The amplitude of the cover image after 
FRFT is obtained, which is implemented by the first level DWT. A low 
frequency approximation component (LL1) and three high frequency 
detail components (HL1, LH1, HH1) of the first layer are generated 
after the first level of DWT. Next, the low frequency approximation 
coefficient (LL1) of the first layer is carried out by the second level 
DWT to produce a low frequency approximation component (LL2) 
and three high frequency detail components (HL2, LH2, HH2) of the 
second layer. Following that we apply SVD transform to the low 
frequency approximate coefficient IF (LL2) of the second layer and 
get the singular value S1 based on the following formula (7). 
U1S1V1SVDIF (7)   
Step (2): Perform FRFT on the watermark image W with the trans -
formation order p1Cp2. Apply the SVD transform to the amplitude 
(WF) of the transformed watermark image after FRFT, and get the 
corresponding singular value S2 according to formula (8). 
U2S2V2SVDWF (8)   Step (3): Based on the singular values S1 andS2 obtained in steps (1) 
and (2), a new matrix S is constructed according to formula (9) 
below. Where k is embedding strength. We obtain the low frequency 
coefficient matrix LLIW by applying inverse SVD transform to the 
new matrix S based on Eq. (10).

1 (10)   
Step (4): The low frequency coefficient matrix LLIW of the above- 
mentioned image with watermark information features and three 
detail high frequency coefficients (HL2, LH2, HH2) in step (1) are 
transformed by the first level DWT inverse transform to obtain the 
LL2∕matrix coefficient, and then LL2’ matrix coefficient and three 
high frequency coefficients (HL1, LH1, HH1) are implemented by the 
second level DWT inverse transform to obtain the low frequency 
coefficient matrix LL1’. 
Step (5): Perform FRFT inverse transform on LL1’ to form the 
watermarked image I_W. 
The process framework of watermark extraction is illustrated in 
Fig. 3, and the specific steps of watermark extraction are given as 
follows: 
Step (1): We conduct FRFT on the watermarked image I_W and 
obtain its amplitude as I_W’. 
Step (2): The first level DWT is exerted to the amplitude I_W∕and the 
low frequency approximate component (LL1) of the first layer is 
obtained. Then the low frequency approximate component (LL1) is 
carried out by the second level DWT. The low frequency approximate 
coefficient matrix IF∕(LL2) of the second layer is obtained after the 
second level DWT transform. 
Step (3): The singular value matrix S∕is obtained by applying SVD 
decomposition toIF∕according to formula (11) below. Then the 
singular value matrix S∕
2 corresponding to the watermark informa -
tion is obtained by the rule of embedding watermark according to 
formula (12).

watermark embedding and implement inverse FRFT on the W∕to 
obtain the final watermark information.

4.Experiment results and discussions 
The cover gray-scale images with the size of 512 ×512 [Fig. 4(a) - 
Fig. 4(d)] and the Foshan University watermark gray-scale image with the 
size of 128 ×128 [Fig. 4(e)] are selected as the simulation objects to 
analyze and discuss the watermark embedding and extracting mecha -
nism proposed in this paper. All numerical calculations are completed in 
MATLAB 2019b. 4.1. Means of performance evaluation 
Imperceptibility and robustness are two major contents of evaluation 
for the research of digital image watermarking algorithms. Impercepti -
bility is used to assess the distortion degree of the original image after 
embedding watermark information. In general, PSNR (Peak Signal to 
Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity), NC (Normalized Correlation) 
and BER (Bit Error Rate) are main means of performance evaluation for 
watermarking schemes. PSNR [18] is used to evaluate the visual quality 
of the image after embedding watermark information. PSNR is repre -
sented by the following Eq. (14):

fiCjCgiCjDenote the gray pixel value of the original cover image and 
the watermark image corresponding to the locationiCj. M, N are the

PSNR value, the better the imperceptibility of the image, and the less the 
image distortion. 
PSNR usually ignores the sensitivity of the human visual system, 
while SSIM [18] reflects the similarity of objects in the scene from image 
brightness, contrast and structure attributes, which can represent the 
lack of PSNR to measure the similarity of image structure. Its definition 
is expressed by the following formula (15):

The robustness of the algorithm is the ability of the watermarked 
image to against various attacks, mainly including image processing and 
geometric transformation. NC and BER between the original watermark 
and the extracted watermark are two widely common means to estimate 
the quality of extraction watermark. They measure the difference be-
tween the extracted watermark image and the original watermark 
image. The larger the NC value, the smaller the BER value will be. It 
indicates the extracted watermark image is more similar to the original 
watermark image; otherwise, the extracted watermark image is less 
similar to the original watermark image. The NC is expressed as follows 
(17): 
NC⋃PW

where WCW∕indicate that the original watermark image with the same 
dimension size ofPW×QW as the extracted watermark. Generally, the 
range of NC value is (0, 1). The more the value of NC is close to 1, the 
more similar the two images. 
The BER is defined as the ratio of the number of error bits to the total 
number of bits to measure the accuracy of data transmission. It can be 
expressed by formula (19) as follows: 
BER1
PW×QŴPW
i1̂QW
j1WiCj⊖W∕iCj×100%C (18)  
where WiCjCW∕iCjrepresent the original watermark image and the extracted one with the same dimension size ofPW×QW respectively in 
formula (19). The symbol ⊖indicates XOR operation. Generally, the 
smaller the value of BER, the better the robustness of the watermark 
image. 
4.2. The determination of FRFT transformation order 
The imperceptibility and robustness are two contradictory criteria 
for almost all the watermarking schemes. When a watermarking scheme 
has higher imperceptibility, it has weaker robustness, and vice versa. In 
the specific evaluation index, the higher the PSNR and SSIM , the better 
the imperceptibility will be. In fact, lower BER and higher NC value 
means greater watermarking robustness. How to balance the imper -
ceptibility and robustness is the first problem for the further studying of 
the proposed watermarking scheme in FRFT domain. The trans -
formation order of FRFT must be determined so that the imperceptibility 
and robustness can be acceptable. We have established the quantitative 
relationship between FRFT transformation order and PSNR , SSIM , BER 
and NC, as shown in Fig. 5(a) to Fig. 5(d). Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the 
PSNR and SSIM values of embedding watermark information in the 
original cover image Lena with different FRFT transformation orders. At 
the same time, the average BER and the average NC of Lena are calcu -
lated with FRFT transformation orders against four typical attacks, as 
shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d). The four typical attacks are Gaussian noise 
(m 0, v 0.05), Gaussian filtering (s 1), histogram equalization and 
rotation attack (rotation angle 30•). As shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), the 
watermarked image has better transparency with the increase of FRFT 
transformation order. The larger the FRFT transformation order, the 
larger the overall trend value of PSNR and SSIM values in a certain range 
will be. As shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), the average NC decreases with the 
increasing FRFT transformation order against four typical attacks while 
the average BER shows up an opposite tendency. It means that the 
robustness of watermark becomes worse with the increase of FRFT 
transformation order. 
From the results of Fig. 5, it is shown that the range of the appro -
priate transformation order of FRFT can be determined, to achieve a 
relative balance between imperceptibility and robustness. When the 
transformation order of FRFT is in the range of 0–0.1, the PNSR and 
SSIM values and average NC are relatively high and the average BER is 
low, so the imperceptibility and robustness are acceptable in this 
appropriate range of transformation order of FRFT. 
4.3. The analysis and discussion of imperceptibility 
In this subsection, we select four different cover images and embed 
the watermark into four different cover images to estimate the imper -
ceptibility of our proposed watermarking scheme. The corresponding 
values of PSNR and SSIM have been calculated in selecting an appro -
priate FRFT transformation order p1 p2 0.05, as described in 
Table 1. The corresponding values of PSNR and SSIM , which are rela-
tively high and stable, are shown in Table 1. The average value of PSNR 
is 57.53 and the average value of SSIM is 0.885, both of which are at a 
high level. As we can see in Table 2, the obtained PSNR for the proposed 
scheme are satisfactory in comparison experiments. It is demonstrated 
that the proposed watermarking scheme in our paper meets the re-
quirements of the imperceptibility of cover images. 
4.4. The analysis and discussion of robustness in digital watermarking 
In this section, we evaluate the robustness of our proposed water -
marking scheme against many typical attacks by calculating BER value 
and NC value between the original watermark and the extracted one. 
Generally, typical attacks mainly consist of signal processing and geo-
metric transformation. Signal processing attacks mainly include median 
filtering, Gaussian filtering, average filtering, Gaussian noise, salt and 
pepper noise, speckle noise, JPEG compression, histogram equalization, M. Tang and F. Zhou                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Array 15 (2022) 100230
7contrast adjustment, motion blur, etc. Geometric transformations 
include image cropping, image scaling, rotation attacks, etc. The NC 
values and BER values are calculated for the four watermarked images, 
corresponding to the extracted watermark image against the above 
signal processing and geometric attacks, as shown in Table 3 and 
Table 4. The majority NC values of the extracted watermark are greater than 0.98, while the corresponding values of BER are generally less than 
0.25. In addition, the cover image Einstein containing the watermark 
image is attacked against many signal processing and geometric trans -
formations and the watermark are extracted in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 illustrates 
the visual effect of the watermark extracted against the noise attack is 
slightly general, while the effect of the extracted watermark is very 
satisfactory against other image attacks. The above results show our 
proposed scheme in the paper has strong robustness for typical attacks 
such as image filtering, rotation attack, scaling attack, salt and pepper 
noise, image cropping, JPEG compression, histogram equalization, 
Gaussian noise, speckle noise and so on. 
In the field of digital watermark, geometric attacks are often 
encountered, such as image rotation and image scaling. Many existing 
schemes are not very strong robustness against geometric attacks 
[42–44]. We investigate the quality of the extracted watermark against 
the two geometric attacks. Specifically, the quantitative relationship 
between the NC and BER values with the rotation angle and size of scale 
has been established, as shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 7(a) 
and (b), the NC and BER values change continuously with the rotation 
angle in range of 0•–90•. When the rotation angle is greater than 50•, 
most NC values are more than 0.97, while the BER value is less than 
15%. In addition, the larger the rotation angle, the smaller the BER value 
will be. In the whole range of rotation angle, the values of NC and BER

8are relatively good and acceptable. Fig. 8(a) and (b) illustrate that the 
NC values and BER values change with the size of scale against image 
scaling attacks. Here, we explore the case the size of scale is 0.5–2.5. 
When the size of scale is less than 1.5, the NC values is greater than 0.98, 
and the BER values is also within the acceptable range. It is demon -
strated that our proposed watermarking scheme in this paper has strong 
robustness in anti-rotation attack and anti-scaling attack. 
We calculate the NC values of Lena cover image against image pro-
cessing, and compare them with other schemes, which are shown in 
Table 5 [19,36,46]. These image processing attacks include Gaussian 
filter (3 ×3, 5 ×5), median filter (3 ×3, 5 ×5), Gaussian noise (m 0, 
v 0.03), pepper and salt noise (d 0.02), average filtering (3 ×3) and 
histogram equalization. As shown in Table 4, the NC values of our 
proposed scheme are almost in the high range, which are slightly lower 
than those of Ernawan [36] for Gaussian filter (5 ×5) and median filter 
(3 ×3). The values of NC in our proposed scheme are higher than those 
of NC corresponding to Liu [19] except the Pepper and salt noise (d 0.02) and corresponding to Zhou [46] except the Gaussian noise (m 0, 
v 0.03) and Pepper and salt noise (d 0.02). More importantly, our 
proposed scheme has more obvious and outstanding advantages in 
anti-geometric attacks. We also calculate the values of NC against geo-
metric attacks and compare them with the other watermarking schemes. 
Fig. 9 shows the NC values of the extracted watermark image using 
different schemes [42–45]. In terms of image rotation and image crop-
ping, the NC values of the proposed scheme in this paper are greater than 
those of the other four schemes [42–45], indicating its great advantages. 
In the aspect of image scaling, the NC values of our proposed scheme are 
slightly larger than those of Jimson [42]and Zear [43], but much larger 
than those of the other two schemes. 
From the experimental comparison results in Figs. 5–9 and Tables 1- 
5, it is proved that our proposed scheme based on DWT and SVD in FRFT 
domain provides greater imperceptibility and robustness. It has good 
imperceptibility and robustness for the following reasons: (1) We make 
use of FRFT with the ability to express the information characteristics in Table 4

10spatial and transform domain simultaneously; (2) We have the advan -
tages of both spatial and transform domain in watermarking algorithm, 
combining the multi-resolution features of DWT with the stability of 
SVD; (3) The transformation order of FRFT is used as a key in the process 
of extracting watermark, which can make the proposed scheme more 
secure. 
5.Conclusion 
To improve the imperceptibility and robustness in invisible water -
marking systems, we propose a robust and secure algorithm based on 
DWT and SVD transform in FRFT domain in this paper. In the pre-
liminary experiment, an appropriate transformation order of FRFT is 
determined to offer a better balance between imperceptibility and 
robustness. In addition, the original cover image and watermark image 
are transformed by FRFT with regards to the fact that FRFT has the 
ability to simultaneously represent the information in spatial domain 
and transform domain. Furthermore, in DWT transform, the LL (low 
frequency component) sub-band, which has the largest energy, is 
selected to embed the watermark information that improves the 
robustness against malicious attacks. Then, the watermark embedding is 
implemented in SVD decomposition by adding the singular values of the 
original cover image with the singular values of the watermark image 
multiplied by a scaling factor. Besides, the safety of watermarking 
scheme is improved by utilizing the transformation order of FRFT. 
Moreover, the proposed watermarking scheme is based on DWT and 
SVD transforms in FRFT, which can protect the useful and informative 
image against various of different extreme signal processing and geo-
metric attacks. The above experimental results confirm that our pro-
posed scheme provides greater visual imperceptibility and robustness, 
especially in terms of image rotation, image cropping, average filtering, 
median filtering and Gaussian filtering compared to other literature 
schemes. In future, the authors are interested in seeking a new robust 
image watermarking scheme invariant to extreme signal attacks, such as 
speckle noise and pepper and salt noise in future communications.
