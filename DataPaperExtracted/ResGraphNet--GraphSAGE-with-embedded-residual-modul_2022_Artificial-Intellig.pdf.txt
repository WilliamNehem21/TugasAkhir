Data-driven prediction of time series is significant in many scientific research fields such as global climate
change and weather forecast. For global monthly mean temperature series, considering the strong potential
of deep neural network for extracting data features, this paper proposes a data-driven model, ResGraphNet,
which improves the prediction accuracy of time series by an embedded residual module in GraphSAGE layers.
The experimental results of a global mean temperature dataset, HadCRUT5, show that compared with 11
traditional prediction technologies, the proposed ResGraphNet obtains the best accuracy. The error indicator
predicted by the proposed ResGraphNet is smaller than that of the other 11 prediction models. Furthermore,
the performance on seven temperature datasets shows the excellent generalization of the ResGraphNet. Finally,
based on our proposed ResGraphNet, the predicted 2022 annual anomaly of global temperature is 0.74722◦C,
which provides confidence for limiting warming to 1.5◦C above pre-industrial levels.
1. Introduction
The Global monthly mean temperature is a key climate indicator,
which is usually expressed as a temperature ‘‘anomaly’’ that is just
the difference from the average over a fixed period. Since 1850, as a
typical time series, temperature series has been measured at weather
stations, by ships and buoys and by satellites. The Paris Agreement is
a legally binding international treaty on climate change, and its goal
is to limit global warming to well around 2◦C, preferable to 1.5◦C,
compared to pre-industrial levels. Thus, as a typical prediction problem
of time series, it is significant to predict global mean temperature,
which demonstrates the megatrend of global warming and climate
changing. In the past few decades, prevalent climate models of the
Earth have been proposed and worked well for weather and climate
forecasting ( Gordon et al. , 2000 ; Stott and Kettleborough , 2002 ; Smith
et al. , 2007 ). However, not all significant physical and chemical pro-
cesses can be explicitly resolved by these deterministic models ( Bauer
et al. , 2015 ). Instead, in this study, the data-driven models ( Pathak
et al. , 2018 ; Arcomano et al. , 2020 ; Taylor et al. , 2022 ) are focused
on the near-term climate prediction ( Kushnir et al. , 2019 ) using time
series of the global monthly mean temperature.
Nowadays, there are myriad data-driven methods to predict time
series including global mean temperature series, such as the autore-
gressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) ( Contreras et al. , 2003 ),
the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous

support vector regression ( Smola and Schölkopf , 2004 ), the recurrent
neural networks (RNN) ( Hopfield , 1982 ), temporal convolutional net-
work ( Li et al. , 2021 ), etc. In particular, as a deep learning model, the
RNN and its variants, such as long-short term memory (LSTM) ( Hochre-
iter and Schmidhuber , 1997 ) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) ( Chung
et al. , 2014 ), have been widely applied in time series prediction in
the Euclidean domain. However, different from many other time series,
the global temperature generally shows a rising trend due to increas-
ing accumulation of CO2in the atmosphere as a result of fossil fuel
consumption, which leads to some bottlenecks in the performance of
traditional data-driven methods. For example, because the global mean
temperature series show rich relational structure in the long sequences,
the inherent architecture of the RNN limits its representation ability
with slow and complex training procedures. To improve the accuracy
and efficiency of prediction, the graph neural network (GNN) ( Scarselli
et al. , 2009 ) is an emerging approach to expand the representation of
artificial neural network with the help of relevant concepts of graph
theory in the non-Euclidean domain.
The current GNN models are mainly categorized as recurrent GNNs,
convolutional GNNs, graph autoencoders, and spatial–temporal GNNs
(Wu et al. , 2021 ). As a pioneering work, Kipf and Welling proposed
a simplified graph neural network model, graph convolution network

(GCN), that operates directly on a graph and induces embedding vec-
tors of nodes based on the properties of their neighborhoods ( Kipf and
Welling , 2016 ). The major limitation of GCN is inherently transductive,
GraphSAGE is an inductive framework that can quickly generate em-
beddings and predict for unseen information ( Hamilton et al. , 2017 ).
Whereas, due to over-smoothing problem, it is difficult to improve
the predictive performance with stacked up many GraphSAGE layers.
Meanwhile, as a classical deep convolution neural network (CNN) with
strong feature extraction, the residual neural network (ResNet) helps in
tackling the vanishing gradient problem using identity mappings ( He
et al. , 2016 ). Thus, the embedded ResNet module also can act as a
buffer layer to reduce the over-smoothing problem of the GraphSAGE
layers ( Oono and Suzuki , 2020 ).
Therefore, we propose a specific deep neural network, called Res-
GraphNet, for the prediction of the global monthly mean temperature
series. The ResGraphnet is an end-to-end architecture that consists of
two GraphSAGE layers, an embedded ResNet layer and a full-connected
(FC) layer. Meanwhile, the path graph is selected to represent the
temperature time series, as the underlying topology of GraphSAGE.
The subsequent experimental results show that compared with simply
using the GraphSAGE or the ResNet as the network layers, our proposed
ResGraphNet has a stronger accuracy and a generalization ability in
predicting time series, especially monthly mean temperature series. Our
source code is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7213337 .
Compared with the previous models which has been commonly
used in prediction of time series, our contributions of the proposed
ResGraphNet mainly includes the following points:
1. To the best of our limited knowledge, this is the first study
to model a temperature series as a path graph and learn the
characteristics of the global temperature between the connection
weights of each node in the GNN with embedded ResNet.
2. Results on several temperature time series datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art temperature series
methods, with possessing a shorter training time and faster
convergence speed.
3. Our proposed ResGraphNet predicts that the 2022 annual
anomaly of global temperature is 0.74722◦C, which provides a
confidence for limiting warming to 1.5◦C above pre-industrial
levels.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The Chapter II briefly
introduces the basic concepts of the ResNet and the GraphSAGE, and
then elaborates the architecture of the proposed ResGraphNet. The
Chapter III shows experiments of datasets that reveal the performance
of the proposed ResGraphNet. Finally, conclusions are drawn in the
Chapter IV.
2. Data and method
2.1. Datasets of temperature time series
For understanding and predicting global surface temperature
changes, a public time series HadCRUT5 (Morice et al. , 2021 ), the
global surface temperature dataset from 1850.Jan to 2022.Mar in every
month is analyzed mainly in this study. As shown in Fig. 1, since 1936,
because of increasing accumulation of CO2in the atmosphere as a result
of huge fossil energy consumption, the global temperature is increasing
gradually ( Arrow , 2007 ). This is a challenge to those methods that use
past data to predict the future information ( Dougherty et al. , 2005 ;
Hastings et al. , 2014 ; Terando et al. , 2014 ), because it is difficult to
learn the drastic changes in temperature data in the last few years.
Therefore, to tackle this problem, we build the novelty architecture of
ResGraphNet.
In additional, ERSSTv4 ( Smith et al. , 2008 ), ERSSTv3b ( Smith et al. ,
2008 ), Berkeley-Earth ( Rohde et al. , 2013 ), HadSST3 ( Kennedy et al. ,
2011 ), and ERA5 ( Hersbach et al. , 2020 ) also are temperature data
measured in different ways and in different areas. These datasets
also are applied to verify the generalization ability of the proposed
ResGraphNet.
2.2. Residual neural network
ResNet is a type of neural networks that applies identity mapping.
It is known that simply stacking up CNN layers cannot indefinitely
improve the performance of the CNN model, due to the vanishing
gradient problem ( Glorot and Bengio , 2010 ). To solve this problem
effectively, the concept of a highway network is proposed as ( Srivastava
et al. , 2015 )
𝑦=(𝑥,𝑤𝑖)⋅𝜏(𝑥,𝑤𝑡) +𝑥⋅(𝑥,𝑤𝑐) (1)Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 148–156

Fig. 2. The architecture of a ResNet module that is applied in this study.
where𝑥and𝑦are the input and output of the layers aimed, and the
𝜏(𝑥,𝑤𝑡)and(𝑥,𝑤𝑐)are the transform gate and the carry gate, respec-
tively. For simplifying parameters and reducing the risk of over fitting,
the ResNet set these two gates as the identical mapping(i.e., 𝜏(𝑥,𝑤𝑡) =
1,(𝑥,𝑤𝑐) = 1) (He et al. , 2016 ), then the forward propagation formula
is
𝑦=(𝑥,𝑤𝑖) +𝑥 (2)
where the function (𝑥,𝑤𝑖)represents the residual mapping to be
learned. As shown in Fig. 2, in this study, the ResNet module is mainly
composed of 4 CNN layers, which can be expressed as

where𝑥and𝑦is the input and output of our ResNet module ( Fig. 2)
and𝐷𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑡 is the dropout layer. In the following content, the 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑁𝑒𝑡
also denotes the forward propagation process in Eq. (3).
2.3. GraphSAGE neural network
In this study, a graph is defined as 𝐺= (𝑉,𝐸 ), where𝑉=
{𝑣0,𝑣1,…,𝑣𝑁−1}denotes the nodes and 𝐸denotes the edges. 𝐴∈R𝑁×𝑁
is the adjacency matrix. If there is an edge from 𝑣𝑖to𝑣𝑗, that is
∃(𝑣𝑖,𝑣𝑗) ∈𝐸, then𝐴𝑖𝑗= 1otherwise𝐴𝑖𝑗= 0. And then the degree
matrix𝐷is defined as 𝐷𝑖𝑗=∑𝑁−1
𝑗=0𝐴𝑖𝑗. Thus, the Laplacian matrix 𝐿
is defined as 𝐿=𝐷−𝐴. In addition, the normalized form of Laplacian
matrix =𝐷−1∕2𝐿𝐷−1∕2is often used in practical applications. If datainformation of node 𝑣𝑖is𝒙𝑖, then GraphSAGE updates node information
by sampling and aggregating adjacent points of each node 𝑣𝑖, that is:
𝒙′
𝑖=𝑾1𝒙𝑖+𝑾2⋅𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑗∈𝑁(𝑗)𝒙𝑗 (4)
where𝑁(𝑗)is the set of adjacent points of a node 𝑣𝑖, which can be
obtained by the adjacency matrix 𝑨of a graph 𝐺;𝑾1and𝑾2are
the learnable network weights; 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 demonstrates that the aggregation
method adopts the mean aggregation. Fig. 3 shows the running process
of the GraphSAGE. For the random sampling process of nodes, the
number of the first-order sampling nodes is 1 and the number of the
second-order sampling nodes is 1. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the node
aggregation takes the mean value after weighted summation of the
information of adjacent points. Then, we update the information of the
current central node, as shown in Fig. 3(c).
2.4. Proposed ResGraphNet
To pay attention to rich correlation in the temperature time di-
mension, we propose that the 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑁𝑒𝑡 module is embedded in two
GraphSAGE layers. Assuming that the input and the output of the
network are 𝒙and𝒚, its forward propagation can be expressed as:
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪⎩𝑓1=𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑆𝐴𝐺𝐸1(𝒙,𝑨)
𝑓2=𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑁𝑒𝑡 (𝐷𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑡 (𝑓1))
̂𝒚=𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑆𝐴𝐺𝐸2(𝐷𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑡 (𝑓2),𝑨)(5)
where𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑆𝐴𝐺𝐸𝑖is the𝑖th GraphSAGE layer, 𝑖= 1,2.𝑨is the
adjacency matrix of the graph.
Here, notice that the GraphSAGE layers (including most other GNN
layers) need a given topology structure of a graph in advance (i.e. the
adjacency matrix 𝑨). For a specific time series, it is an open topic to
build an available graph ( Lacasa et al. , 2008 , 2009 ; Wang et al. , 2019 ;
Chen et al. , 2022 ). In this study, to preserve the inherent correlation
and causality of time series, we consider adjacency matrix 𝑨𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎof the
path graph which satisfies
𝑨𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ=⎡
⎢
⎢
⎢
⎢
⎢
⎢⎣0 1 0 ⋯ 0 0

0 0 0 ⋯ 0 1
0 0 0 ⋯ 0 0⎤
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎥⎦(6)
For the path graph, each node 𝑣𝑖has an edge 𝑒𝑖,𝑖+1pointing to the next
node𝑣𝑖+1, and the time series prediction task studied in this paper is to
utilize the past data to predict future data. Based on this idea, a node
𝑣𝑡can be constructed for each time 𝑡, set𝒙= [𝑥0,𝑥1,…,𝑥𝐿−1]𝑇,𝑥𝑡∈
R𝑀×1,𝑡= 0,1,…,𝐿− 1, then𝑥𝑡is the value of node 𝑣𝑡,𝑨𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ∈R𝐿×𝐿.
So the role of 𝑨𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ, is to make the value 𝑥𝑡of time series 𝒙at time𝑡
(the value of node 𝑣𝑡) be related to the value 𝑥𝑡+1of next time 𝑡+1(the
value of node 𝑣𝑡+1).
Consequently, to further alleviate the gradient disappearance prob-
lem, a FC layer is applied to mitigate the instability of results due to
the residual connection. From Fig. 4, the proposed ResGraphNet can be
written as
⎧

̂𝒚=𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑆𝐴𝐺𝐸2(𝐷𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑡 (𝑓3),𝑨)(7)
Ideally, for the proposed ResGraphNet, the main features of time series
will be learned by the shallow layers ( 𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑆𝐴𝐺𝐸 ), and more detailed
features will be extracted by the deeper module ( 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑁𝑒𝑡 ). To verify
performance of the ResGraphNet, the experimental results are shown
in Chapter 3.Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 148–156

3. Experiment and result
This chapter first shows the training dataset and the test dataset
based on real time series data. Then, we build models based on different
algorithms and set the parameters of these different models. Finally, the
training dataset are applied to train each model, while the test dataset
are used to evaluate the performance of models.
3.1. Dataset samples
Now we build training datasets and test datasets based on Had-
CRUT5 . At the beginning, if we set the length of time series as 𝑙, then
it can be denoted as 𝑫= [𝑑0,𝑑1,…,𝑑𝑙−1]. The first 50% of the data are
selected as the training dataset. 𝑫𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛and the last 50% are selected
as the test dataset 𝑫𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡, whose lengths are 𝑙𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛and𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡respectively.
The target task of this paper is to predict time series. We hope to
use the data before time 𝑡to predict the data at time 𝑡and the error
between the prediction result and the real data will be as small as
possible. To achieve this purpose, for each time 𝑡, we set the input data
𝑥𝑡= [𝑑𝑡−𝑙𝑥,𝑑𝑡−𝑙𝑥+1,…,𝑑𝑡−1]and the input label 𝑦𝑡= [𝑑𝑡], and each pair of
𝑥𝑡and𝑦𝑡constitute a sample 𝑠𝑡, then𝑠𝑡= {𝑥𝑡,𝑦𝑡}, where𝑙𝑥is the length
of input data 𝑥. In other words, we use 𝑙𝑥data before time 𝑡to predict
the data at time 𝑡. According to the above steps, the training dataset
𝑺𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛= [𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛
0,𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛
1,…,𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛
𝑚𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛−1]can be constructed for 𝑫𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛and thetest dataset 𝑺𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡= [𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡
0,𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡
1,…,𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡
𝑚𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡−1]can be constructed for 𝑫𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡,
where𝑚𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛and𝑚𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡are the number of samples of 𝑫𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛and𝑫𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡,
respectively. Meanwhile, 𝑺𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛and𝑺𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡can be divided into training
data𝒙𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛, training labels 𝒚𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛, test data 𝒙𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡and test labels 𝒚𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡. The
construction process of samples is shown in Fig. 5.
3.2. Parameters and indicator
For any sample 𝑠𝑡,𝑥𝑡is the input of the model and ̂ 𝑦𝑡denotes the
corresponding output. The loss function of the proposed model is the
mean square error and the network weights are updated by the negative
direction of the gradient decline of the loss function.
For regression problems, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is
generally selected as the performance evaluation indicator ( Bellocchio
et al. , 2012 ). However, the RMSE is easily affected by the data itself.
If there are great differences in the value distribution of different time
series, the magnitude of their RMSE may be completely different, which
makes it impossible to compare the testing results of these time series.
Therefore, we further apply the determination coefficient (also named
as R2score) as our indicator. For any model, we denote the input data
and predicted results as 𝒙𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛and̂𝒚𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛respectively, then we set 𝒙𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡
and̂𝒚𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡for test set. Their R2score is defined as r𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛, r𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡:

𝑚𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡are mean values of the 𝒚𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛and the
𝒚𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡, respectively. If 𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡of one model is closer to 1, this model has a
stronger time series prediction ability.
3.3. Performances on different models
Now we train all the models based on 𝑺𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛, and use 𝑺𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡for
performance testing where we set 𝑙𝑥= 60 and𝑙𝑦= 1. In Table 1,
there are 12 models are applied, including the proposed ResGrapNet,
the ResNet, the GraphSAGE, the GNN with Unified Message Passaging
Model (UniMP) ( Shi et al. , 2020 ), the GCN ( Kipf and Welling , 2016 ),
the Graph Isomorphic Network (GIN) ( Morris et al. , 2019 ), the RNN
with LSTM, the RNN with GRU, the Random Forest Regression (Forest),
the Linear Regression (Linear), the ARIMA and the SARIMAX. We
calculate R2score of each model, as shown in Table 1. Using climate
spirals, we draw the true data and predicted results of the 𝑺𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛, and
the true data and predicted results of the 𝑺𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡of 12 models, as shown
in Fig. 6. From Table 1, the𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡of the proposed ResGraphNet is 0.9980,
which is the best in all of 12 models. As shown in Fig. 6, the predicted
climate spirals of the proposed ResGraphNet is closest to the true data,
but the prediction of the Forest is the worst with the 𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡= 0.6397.
Moreover, because the time series is too long, it is not intuitive to
directly observe the curve between the prediction results and the true
data. Hence, we define the error index 𝒆= [𝑒0,𝑒1,…,𝑒𝑚𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡−1]as
𝒆=̂𝒚𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡−𝒚𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡(9)Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 148–156

Then we can count and plot the frequency distribution of all elements
𝑒𝑖in the 𝒆as shown in Fig. 7. Most of the errors 𝑒𝑖computed by the
ResGraphNet are distributed within the interval [−0.03,0.06], but errors
𝑒𝑖of other models are outside this interval. In other words, the error 𝑒𝑖
computed by the ResGraphNet is smaller than that of other models.
Furthermore, to compare the computation time, we record the time
spent on training different models, as shown in Table 2. From Table 2
it turns out that ResGraphNet can indeed converge faster than ResNetTable 3
𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡in different 𝑙𝑦and different models.

12 0.9858 0.7988 0.7768 0.7690
and RNN with LSTM and GRU. Due to the addition of 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑁𝑒𝑡 module,
the training time of ResGraphNet is longer than that of GraphSAGE.
Because the traditional machine learning including Forest and Linear
adopts a simpler calculation process than the Neural Network, the
running time of them is also quite shorter. In this Scenario, the pro-
posed ResGraphNet makes a certain and acceptable sacrifice for the
computation time, in exchange for the highest prediction accuracy.
In the previous analysis, we set 𝑙𝑥= 60 and𝑙𝑦= 1. Actually, we
hope that ResGraphNet can still maintain its good performance, when
the length of predicted time series is becoming longer. The results 𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡
based on different 𝑙𝑦and different models are shown in Table 3.𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡
decreases with the increase of 𝑙𝑦, but ResGraphNet outperforms other
models. In other words, the length of time series, that can be predicted
by the ResGraphNet, is limited in a way. When the temperature change
of 12 months (i.e. 𝑙𝑦= 12) in 2021 year is expected to be predicted, the
indicator𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡between 𝒚𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡and̂𝒚𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡can remain above 0.98. Therefore,
for the prediction of future temperature, the length of predicted time
series𝑙𝑦= 12 is available.Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 148–156

3.4. Prediction of future temperature
To show the prediction performance of the ResGraphNet for un-
known future temperature, we firstly list the known true data and pre-
dicted results of 2021 in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, for HadCRUT5
dataset, the predicted result of annual mean temperature (0.76863◦C)
is close to the measured value (0.76185◦C). Similarly, the tempera-
tures in northern hemisphere HadCRUT5-N and southern hemisphere
HadCRUT5-S are also tested.
Next, Table 5 and Fig. 8 show the results in 2022 year. The corre-
sponding𝑚𝑠𝑒between the predicted results and measured data in 2022
January, February and March are 0.0015, 0.0109, 0.0048 respectively,
as well as the high similarity of annual temperature. Thus, the results
of prediction show the proposed ResGraphNet can accurately predict
the unknown temperature data in the future to some extent. Note that,based on our proposed model, the predicted 2022 annual anomaly of
global temperature is 0.74722◦C, which is smaller than that of 2021.
The predicted results of 2022 provide more confident to limit global
warming to well below 2◦C, preferably to 1.5◦C above pre-industrial
levels (red circle in Fig. 8).
3.5. Other datasets
Finally, to verify the generalization ability of the proposed Res-
GraphNet, we test the prediction performance of models based on
other different public datasets, including HadCRUT5-N, HadCRUT5-S,
ERSSTv4, ERSSTv3b, Berkeley-Earth, HadSST3 and ERA5. Meanwhile,
we additionally consider some other time-series prediction models,
i.e. the GraphSAGE, the Linear, the GRU, the ARIMA and the SARIMAX,Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 148–156

as the comparison methods. Table 6 reveals that the performance of the
proposed ResGraphNet is the best among six prediction models.
When applied to seven different datasets, the 𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡calculated by
using the proposed ResGraphNet is still closer to 1 than that of other
models. Therefore, the proposed ResGraphNet has a strong general-
ization ability in temperature prediction, and has potential to predict
temperature data in many scenarios.4. Conclusion
This paper proposes a specific ResGraphNet that consists of two
GraphSAGE layers, an embedded ResNet layer and a FC layer, which
is an end-to-end architecture for time series prediction of the global
monthly mean temperature. Based on some global mean temperature
datasets, the performance of the proposed ResGraphNet is evaluated.Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 148–156

The results of the comparison methods show that the proposed Res-
GraphNet has the best accuracy and generalization to predict monthly
anomaly of temperature series. In addition, the predicted 2022 annual
anomaly of global mean temperature is 0.74722◦C, which helps us
understand the trend of global warming of 1.5◦C above pre-industrial
levels.
However, there are still two problems that have not been well
solved in this paper. First, there is still no better method to choose
the best graph structure for specific data such as temperature time
series. Second, this paper does not solve the problem of long-term
prediction of temperature series. Therefore, We hope to further improve
the performance of the current model.
