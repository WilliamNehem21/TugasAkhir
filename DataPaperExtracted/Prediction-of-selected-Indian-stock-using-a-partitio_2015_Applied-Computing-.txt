KEYWORDSARIMA;GARCH;Highly volatile data;Predictive datamining;Partitioning andinterpolation;Time seriesforecastingAbstract Accurate long-term prediction of time series data (TSD) is a very use-ful research challenge in diversiﬁed ﬁelds. As ﬁnancial TSD are highly volatile,multi-step prediction of ﬁnancial TSD is a major research problem in TSD min-ing. The two challenges encountered are, maintaining high prediction accuracyand preserving the data trend across the forecast horizon. The linear traditionalmodels such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and gener-alized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) preserve data trendto some extent, at the cost of prediction accuracy. Non-linear models like ANNmaintain prediction accuracy by sacriﬁcing data trend. In this paper, a linearhybrid model, which maintains prediction accuracy while preserving data trend,is proposed. A quantitative reasoning analysis justifying the accuracy ofproposed model is also presented. A moving-average (MA) ﬁlter based pre-processing, partitioning and interpolation (PI) technique are incorporated bythe proposed model.

1. Introduction
Financial TSD mining provides useful information for the investors, banks andinsurance companies to channel their funds properly for better returns. This deci-sion making is the primary motivation for prediction of ﬁnancial TSD. Accuratemulti-step ahead prediction of ﬁnancial TSD becomes more difﬁcult, as the ﬁnan-cial TSD is highly volatile. If prediction is one-step ahead preserving data trend isirrelevant. However, as the forecast horizon increases, preserving data trendbecomes signiﬁcant. In either case, prediction accuracy should remain high.Hence, the two basic requirements for multi-step ahead prediction model aremaintaining high prediction accuracy and preserving the data trend across the pre-diction horizon.
Traditional models like ARIMA, GARCH or ANN cannot meet both therequirements simultaneously. However, a hybrid model may provide scope forpreserving data trend across the forecast horizon while maintaining good predic-tion accuracy, which motivates the research work of this paper. Most of the tra-ditional models such as ARIMA, GARCH and ANN are applied for one-stepahead forecasting in many works of the literature, where prediction accuracy isof major concern. However, in the present paper, we target multi-step ahead pre-diction, which requires preserving data trend in addition to high prediction accu-racy. Such a model should account for the nature of TSD at every stage in themodel.
Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section2presents a literature survey of different prediction models existing in the literature. The proposed PI basedhybrid ARIMA–GARCH model is detailed in Section 3. A quantitative analysis of the proposed model is discussed in4. The proposed and the traditional modelsare applied on selected NSE India data and the performance is compared in Sec-tion6. The paper ends with conclusion in7.

ARIMA models are popularized after Box and Jenkins, who developed a coher-ent, versatile three-stage iterative cycle for time series identiﬁcation, estimation,and veriﬁcation. This method is also known as the BoxJenkins approach [1].I n [2]quarterly automobile insurance paid claim costs are forecasted using economet-ric and ARIMA models. In[3]the performance of ARIMA model is comparedwith extended Wiener ﬁltering for short term load forecasting in electric powerPrediction of selected Indian stock using a ARIMA–GARCH model 131systems. In[4]ARIMA is used to perform one-day-ahead forecasts of tomorrow’sfederal funds rate. ARIMA with a wavelet based decomposition is used in one-step ahead forecasting of average global temperature in [5]. ARIMA model is suit- able for short term forecasting, if this model is applied for long term prediction theprediction accuracy may not very accurate which can observed from [6], where employment information of Chinese computer industry is forecasted.
Engle in 1982 introduced ARCH model[7]which is known for forecasting high-ly volatile TSD. An improved version of ARCH model called generalized ARCHalso known as GARCH model[8]was introduced by Bollerslev, Engle, and Nel-son in 1994. Several extensions of GARCH model are found in the literature.Some of the extensions are extensively surveyed in[9].I n[10]a simple (linear) GARCH(1,1) model is applied on Swiss market index and the results show thatthe model provides a good parametrization for the daily returns. GARCH modelis further explored and studied in[11]and showed that the presence of outliers hasan impact on the forecast results. In[12]GARCH models are used to forecasthourly prices in the deregulated electricity markets of Spain and California andthe results outperform ARIMA model when volatility and price spikes are present.Some times GARCH models are inappropriate to model as they assume Gaussiandistribution. In such cases student-T distribution can be assumed. This fact is fur-ther investigated in[13].
Many Hybrid models are derived in the literature for time series forecasting.The hybrid models combine strengths of few individual models to render betterprediction accuracy. A composite ARIMA–GARCH model for forecasting rain-fall data is presented in[14]. ARIMA is used with GARCH model for forecastingdaily load and maximum electricity demand estimation as seen in [15], which pro- vides a better long term forecasting. In[16], trafﬁc modeling and prediction usingARIMA and GARCH models are proposed. A MA ﬁlter based hybrid ARIMA–ANN model is proposed in[17]. Other techniques like spectral analysis to forecastreal time trafﬁc ﬂow[18], Grey–Markov model to forecast Chaina electric-powerdemand[19]also exist in the literature.
3. PI based hybrid ARIMA–GARCH prediction model
Details of modeling TSD using ARIMA, GARCH, ANN, and wavelet-ARIMAare all present in the literature mentioned in Section2. Here, the proposed hybrid ARIMA–GARCH prediction model is discussed.
Financial data are highly volatile in nature. If this volatility nature is character-ized and accounted at every stage in a prediction model, both the data trend andaccuracy requirements can be met simultaneously. General characteristics of high-ly volatile TSD are changing variance as a function of time, volatility clustering(VC) and fat tail distribution (FTD)[20]. These are mathematically characterizedusing conditional standard deviation, autocorrelation plot of absolute or squaredreturns, Quartile–Quartile plot respectively[20]. Using these characteristics a MA132 C. Narendra Babu, B. Eswara Reddyﬁlter decomposition technique is developed. Along with this, a unique PItechnique is used to build the PI-based hybrid ARIMA–GARCH model. Thetwo techniques are detailed as follows.
3.1. MA ﬁlter based decomposition technique
Given TSD is decomposed into two components, one of which is smooth, calledthe trend component and the other named as noise component. This decomposi-tion is shown inFig. 1. The MA ﬁlter is given in(1), wheremindicates length of the ﬁlter,sm
tis the smoothened trend component ander tis the noise component. It is adjusted such that one of the decomposed components is highly volatile withpredominant VC and FTD, but the other is low volatile with relatively very lessVC and no FTD.

To decide onm, the TSD should be mathematically characterized for volatility,
VC and FTD.3.1.1. Volatility
Volatility is termed as the continuous changing of variance as a function of time[21]or variability of prices or returns of a given TSD[22]. The popular measure of volatility is the conditional standard deviation, r
t, given in(2), which is the vari- ance of TSD available till the time lagt.I n(2),r
trepresents the returns data. Ifr t
changes slowly with time, the TSD is identiﬁed as low volatile, else it is highlyvolatile.

According to[23], some TSD can be characterized by VC, which means largechanges are more likely to be followed by large changes and small changes morelikely follow small changes, in the given TSD. VC implies, though the time samplesappear uncorrelated across time, they are actually dependent across time. VC canbe quantiﬁed using the autocorrelation plot of absolute returns data [23], or using autocorrelation plot of squared returns[20]. If these plots slowly decay as a func-tion of time lag, then the data are said to exhibit VC. If the decay is relatively slow,the effect of VC is high, else it is low. The autocorrelation sequence can be calcu-lated using(3), where,srepresents the time lag.

If the distribution of given TSD deviates from that of Gaussian (Normal), then thedata are fat tail distributed. This means the data exhibit peaked nature at the cen-ter and the tails are fatter than that of Gaussian distribution. To quantify FTD,Jarque–Bera normality test can be used. According to this test, if the kurtosis ofTSD is 3, it is Gaussian distributed and if kurtosis is not equal to 3, it exhibitsFTD. Note that if the data are highly outlier prone, kurtosis is greater than 3and if it is less prone to outliers, the kurtosis is less than 3 [24]. Kurtosis is com- puted using(4). Another way of identifying FTD is the Q–Q plot on returns data[20]. If this Q–Q plot deviates substantially from the standard normal Q–Q plot,the data have FTD.

Note that in[20], it is shown that log returns on the data are same as the relative
returns on the data, by using Taylor expansion. So the relative returns data givenbyr

Let the original TSD be represented asx 1;x2;x3;x4;x5...x Tr fg , whereTrrepre- sents the last sample data point in the series. These data are then split into Ppar- titions as shown in(6).

Consider any one of the partitions in(6). Each partition is a TSD with less thanTr sample data points. On this data, a linear interpolation is done to obtain Trdata points. This process is repeated on each of the partitions and Pdifferent TSD are obtained, each consisting ofTrsample data points. Thus interpolated TSD parti-tions are notated asTP1;TP2;TP3;...;TPP.
3.3. Steps in proposed model
The steps involved in the proposed model are described below.
1. The given TSD are decomposed into two series using a MA ﬁlter given in (1).m is chosen such that one of these decompositions is highly volatile with pre-dominant VC, FTD (notated asS1), while the other which is low volatile withrelatively less VC, FTD (notated asS2).2. TheS2 series withEndata values is given as training data, and an ARIMAmodel is ﬁt. Correspondingly predictions are made over the prediction horizon.3. TheS1 series is split intoMpartitions. If originalS1 is considered as x
1;x2;x3;x4;x5...x En fg , theMpartitions are indicated in(6).

Then each partition is linearly interpolated to obtain same number of data
pointsEn,a si nS1 series. Let theseMinterpolated partitions beP1;P2;P3;...;PM.4. Consider one partitionP1 with ﬁrstErdata values, whereEr<En. UsingEr values as training data a GARCH model is ﬁt, validated and En/C0Erforecasts are obtained. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) with En/C0Erpre- dicted and actual data values is obtained. This process is repeated on all P2 toPMpartitions. The best GARCH model is ﬁnalized as the one with mini-mum error. The best partition which gives this best GARCH model is usedto forecast over the complete prediction horizon.5. The predictions from step 2 and step 4 are added to form the ﬁnal predictions.
The above proposed hybrid model is shown inFig. 2.Prediction of selected Indian stock using a ARIMA–GARCH model 1354. Simulated TSD: Analysis of decomposition and PI techniques
The proposed PI based hybrid ARIMA–GARCH model has improved predictionaccuracy than individual models. The success of this technique lies in the success ofthe decomposition and PI techniques. On a simulated highly volatile TSD, thesetwo techniques are applied and analyzed. Later, the improved prediction accuracyof the proposed method is justiﬁed and its other advantages and limitations arediscussed.
4.1. Analysis of MA ﬁlter based decomposition technique
In particular MA-ﬁlter should be able to provide series S1 andS2 properly, with a suitablem. A highly volatile TSD is simulated. It is veriﬁed for volatility, VC andFTD as follows:
/C15The presence of volatility is veriﬁed using conditional standard deviation plot./C15The prominence of VC is veriﬁed using autocorrelation plot of absolute returns./C15The presence of FTD is veriﬁed using Q–Q plot and also using value of kurtosis,k.
For a ﬁlter length,m¼35, the results of the analysis are shown inFig. 3. The ﬁgure shows from left to right, the two decompositions, their conditional standardHighly volatile component with prominent VC and  FTDLow volatile component withno/less VC and no FTD

Itcan be observed that the seriesS1 is highly volatile with predominant VC andFTD, and the other is seriesS2, is low volatile with less VC and no FTD. Thusit is indeed possible to obtain the required two series by selecting a proper valueofm. Note that the value ofmis not unique. For example in this case, we observedthat for values ofmranging in 256m635, the required two series can be prop-erly obtained (Results are not presented).
4.2. Analysis of PI technique
Let a TSD, referred as raw data here, have 500 data points. If 10 partitions aredone, each partition will have 50 points. In this case, the ﬁrst partition has the datapoints 1;11;21;...;491, second partition has data points 2;12;22;...;492, and the last partition has data points 10;20;30;...;500. To have the same numberof data points as the original data in each partition, each partition is interpolated,to obtain 500 data points. On series 1 ofFig. (3), the PI technique is applied with10 partitions. It is observed that all the interpolated partitions retain volatility; andVC, FTD change only slightly than that of the series 1. If the number of partitionsmade 30, this change is more. However, in both the cases, the partitions havevolatility, VC and FTD. From this observation we can conclude the following.When the PI step is performed with 10 partitions, the partitioning did not violateNyquist sampling theorem[25]; and after interpolation, each partition still hassame frequency content as the initial series. In this case kurtosis of all thepartitions is nearly same as the kurtosis of initial series. When PI with 30 partitionsis performed, it violates Nyquist sampling rate, which implies that some highfrequency components are being removed from the partitions. In this case,kurtosis of different partitions is different.0 500 1000200400600800Series 1 Data

The proposed model renders better prediction accuracy for a long term predictionon a highly volatile TSD. In this section, quantitative reasoning as to why the pro-posed method is better, is illustrated.
5.1. Application of the right model
FromFig. 2, on the low volatile decomposition with less VC and no FTD,ARIMA model is applied. This is apt because ARIMA model assumes a Gaussiandistribution (i.e. no FTD), no VC and constant variance [1]. Similarly on the high- ly volatile decomposition, which has VC, and FTD, GARCH model is beingapplied. This is apt because, GARCH model relaxes the constraint of constantvariance[26], and is suitable for data with VC[23]. The proposed hybrid modelis hence applying apt individual models based on the nature of decompositions.Note that in general decomposition improves prediction accuracy [24], and in this case, due to the application of right model to each of the decomposition accuracyfurther improves.
Instead of directly applying GARCH model onS1, if PI technique is applied,P different data series result. On each of the series, GARCH is suitable because, thevolatility, VC and FTD still prevail as discussed in Section 4.2, irrespective of the number of partitionsP. Now out of thePdifferent GARCH models, the bestmodel can be chosen. Let this best model be obtained due to the B
thpartition. This means that some of the data points, which do not really play any role in prediction(for example, outliers) are not present in thisB
thpartition and so this partitiongave the best prediction accuracy.
5.2. Advantages and limitations of the proposed model
The advantages of the proposed model are that, it is well suited for long term pre-diction. Also, being a linear model, the data dynamics i.e. data trend is preservedand the prediction accuracy is high, better than the popular ANN. The ANN onthe other hand uses the training data and learns from the data before prediction.It blindly tries to maximize the overall prediction accuracy. In this process, thedata dynamics are sacriﬁced. This reasoning supports the fact that the proposedprediction model is better than the ANN model. The proposed model is clearlybetter than ARIMA, GARCH and Wavelet ARIMA models also, because thenature of the given time series data is clearly accounted at every stage in themodel.
The limitation of the proposed model is that, the number of partitions Pis decided based on trial and error. If the estimation of Pfor a given data set is possible, it will improve the model, though complexity increases. Also, in thispaper, the covariates are not considered. The proposed model is shown to work138 C. Narendra Babu, B. Eswara Reddywell for univariate data. If the covariates are considered, the prediction accuracystill further improves because taking the effect of covariates, implies the dependen-cies of the data are completely being accounted. The drawback will be the modelcomplexity and tuning of the increased number of model parameters [22]. So this study is not included in this paper.
6. Experimental results and discussion
In this section, on selected ﬁnancial TSD originating from NSE India data, theproposed model, ARIMA, GARCH, wavelet-ARIMA and ANN are applied.The performance measures used for comparison, are the error measures, MAPE,Maximum Absolute Percentage Error (MaxAPE), MAE and Root Mean SquareError (RMSE) which are given in(7)–(10)respectively.

The highly volatile NSE India data[27]selected are close price stock data of SBI,
number of trades data of Tata Steel. A 20-step ahead prediction is performed inboth the cases. This implies using the data values available till yesterday, the datavalues from today till another 20 days are predicted. In both these TSD cases, theproposed method outperformed other models in terms of prediction accuracy andalso in preserving data trend.
6.1. TSD1
The close price values of SBI shares from January 2010 to December 2011 are con-sidered as TSD1 for the study. On this highly volatile TSD, the proposed model isPrediction of selected Indian stock using a ARIMA–GARCH model 139applied. Accordingle,S1 andS2 are obtained. OnS2, ARIMA is applied and fore-casts are obtained. OnS1 PI is applied to result in twelve partitions. The VC, FTDand Q–Q plot of all the partitions are similar to those all S1 indicating that all the partitions retained the same nature asS1. The corresponding error measures,MAPE, MaxAPE, MAE, and RMSE are tabulated in Table 1along with the error measures of ARIMA, GARCH, ANN and wavelet ARIMA. The actual and thepredicted TSD values over the forecast horizon are shown in Fig. 4. It is inferred from the table that the proposed model outperforms all the others. From Fig. 4,i t is clear that the proposed model follows the data trend better than the other mod-els. Unfortunately, this fact is not evident from MAPE, but from MAE andRMSE, it is very much evident.

The number of trades of Tata Steel from January 2011 to December 2011 is con-sidered as TSD2 for the study. On this highly volatile TSD, the ARIMA,GARCH, wavelet ARIMA, ANN and the proposed model are applied. Theresults of MAPE, Max APE, MAE, and RMSE for these models are given inTable 2. The proposed model outperformed others as in the previous case. Thecorresponding actual and the predicted values in the prediction horizon are showninFig. 5.

In this case the pro-posed model used 11 partitions, where 6 of them had almost same VC, FTD andQ–Q nature as theS1 series while the other 5 showed very different nature. The

7. Conclusion
In this paper, for highly volatile ﬁnancial TSD, a hybrid ARIMA–GARCH modelis proposed, which is suitable for multi-step ahead forecasting. The techniqueinvolves a MA ﬁlter based decomposition as a pre-processing step on givenTSD. The proposed model is applied on selected NSE India data sets to get mul-ti-step ahead prediction. The obtained results are evaluated using error perfor-mance measures MAPE, MaxAPE, RMSE, whose values conﬁrm the improvedprediction accuracy compared to traditional models ARIMA, GARCH andANN. The proposed model also preserved the data trend over the prediction hori-zon better than the others. The prediction performance can be studied by theinclusion of covariates, which forms the future scope of this paper.
