Gully erosion is one of the important problems creating barrier to agricultural development. The present researchused the radial basis function neural network (RBFnn) and its ensemble with random sub-space (RSS) and rotationforest (RTF) ensemble Meta classiﬁers for the spatial mapping of gully erosion susceptibility (GES) in Hinglo river basin. 120 gullies were marked and grouped into four-fold. A total of 23 factors including topographical, hy-drological, lithological, and soil physio-chemical properties were effectively used. GES maps were built by RBFnn,RSS-RBFnn, and RTF-RBFnn models. The very high susceptibility zone of RBFnn, RTF-RBFnn and RSS-RBFnnmodels covered 6.75%, 6.72% and 6.57% in Fold-1, 6.21%, 6.10% and 6.09% in Fold-2, 6.26%, 6.13% and6.05% in Fold-3 and 7%, 6.975% and 6.42% in Fold-4 of the basin. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curveand statistical techniques such as mean-absolute-error (MAE), root-mean-absolute-error (RMSE) and relative gullydensity area (R-index) methods were used for evaluating the GES maps. The results of the ROC, MAE, RMSE andR-index methods showed that the models of susceptibility to gully erosion have excellent predictive ef ﬁciency. The simulation results based on machine learning are satisfactory and outstanding and could be used to forecastthe areas vulnerable to gully erosion.
1. IntroductionSoil and water are severely threatened by soil erosion, which is aworldwide big environmental issue ( Arabameri et al., 2020a). Long-term erosion effects are visible, but short-term erosion effects may not beapparent (Singh and Singh, 2018). Over the past decades, the impact ofsoil erosion has increased rapidly (Gayen et al., 2019). Due to the for- mation of dissolution and alkalinity in rangelands, farming lands, andforest areas the rate of gully erosion in these area are excessive ( Gar- cía-Ruiz, 2010). Gully erosion breaks down the soil ecosystem and de-grades the quality of the river and wetlands water ( Vanmaercke et al., 2016;Debanshi and Pal, 2020).As per the Hungarian classiﬁcation, gully erosion is linear erosionprocess (Kert/C19esz, 2009). Gullies are two types that are permanent gulliesand ephemeral gullies (Casalıet al., 1999). A permanent gully is deﬁned as the broad and deep channels eroded by the concentrated ﬂow that removes surface soil and parent material not removable via normaltillage operations. Ephemeral gullies, on the other hand, are created bythe concentrated overlandﬂow that can be remedied through regulartillage activities (Casalıet al., 1999). Gully erosion occurs when the surface runoff is concentrated into a channel and results in the formationof rills that grow over time into deep trenches on the ground ( Karuma et al., 2014;Debanshi and Pal, 2020). Several geo-environmental vari- ables, including climate, landscape, soil, geology, and land use, are thekey factors inﬂuencing the growth and occurrence of the gully ( Guerra et al., 2018). Several researchers used lithology, land use, slope, aspect,plan curvature, stream power index, topographical wetness index andlength-slope factor as gully erosion predisposing factors in different partsof the world (Conforti et al., 2011; Conoscentiet al., 2018; Cominoet al.,2016). The integration of rainfall, runoff, and in ﬁltration affects the soil erosivity that often results in gully erosion ( Lal, 2001). Gully erosion is also the three-dimensional in nature affected by the broad range ofenvironmental factors (Zhang et al., 2015). Normally, a gully have a steep-sided or vertical headwall, a width larger than 0.30 m, and a depthgreater than 0.60 m (Brice, 1966). The factors of lithology, soil quality,topography, climate, vegetation, and land use are important controllingfactors for the formation of gullies ( Ogbonna et al., 2011). Several physio-chemical factors of soil like texture, soil volume, clay, sand pH,electrical conductivity, sodium absorption ratio (SAR), sodium, calcium,manganese, bulk density inﬂuence the formation of gullies (AsghariSar- askanroud et al., 2017:Hosseinalizadeh et al., 2019). To various erosive agents and external forces, physio-chemical factors assist to detach and

Electrical Conductivity (EC) and SAR interactions increase the sensitivity of soil to gully erosion(Shahrivar et al., 2012). Besides, soil physical and chemical propertiescan not only increase the susceptibility to gully erosion but can alsoreduce the growth of vegetation in the soil. The literatures of Nandi and Luffman (2012);Battaglia et al. (2002)assessed gully erosion based on soil physio-chemical factors. However, the integration of numerousenvironmental factors using appropriate methods for gully susceptibilityerosion modeling (GESM) is essential for protecting the soil and water(Shit et al., 2015).In the present decade, machine learning ensemble approaches havebeen applied to the assessment of natural hazards in different parts of theworld. The machine learning-based models are more effective and pre-cise than traditional conventional methods. The ensemble techniques e.g.functional classiﬁer and its ensemble with meta, tree classi ﬁer, multi- criteria decision method and its ensemble with bivariate and multivar-iate statistical models, etc. were used in mapping the gully erosion sus-ceptibility, landslide susceptibility,ﬂood susceptibility, land subsidence susceptibility, etc. (Pham et al., 2019;Gayen et al., 2019;Hosseinaliza- deh et al., 2019;Garosi et al., 2019;Taheri et al., 2019). Present GESM is regarded as a resource management method for the prevention andmaintenance of soil erosion (Roy and Saha, 2019;Gayen and Saha, 2017). Some researchers e.g.Pham et al. (2019), applied the REPT ap- proaches and made an ensemble with hybrid machine learning metaclassiﬁers Bagging, MultiBoost, Rotation Forest, Random Subspace tomap the landslide susceptibility. The results of the models showed thatthe meta classiﬁers increased the predictive capability of the REPTreemodel.Pham et al. (2017)also applied the MLP and its ensemble withBagging, Dagging, Random subspace, rotation forest classi ﬁers for LSM modeling, and found similar results. Chen et al. (2017)were used ANN, ME, and SVM for landslide susceptibility assessment. The ensembleANN-SVM has the highest predictive performance for the assessment ofLSM in its study.Hembram et al. (2021)used a similar approach for mapping the susceptibility to gully erosion. For mapping, the suscepti-bility to gully erosion of the present study area novel ensemble methodsof radial basis functions neural network (RBFnn) and random sub-space(RSS) and rotation forest (RTF) hybrid ensemble meta classi ﬁers were used. Geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS)integrating with the machine learning algorithms have created a goodbasement for mapping the different natural hazards. RS and GIS arereliable and efﬁcient technologies that induce meaningful results in theprediction of small and medium-scale gully erosion ( Zerihun et al., 2018). For this phenomenon, many geospatial and geo-statistic methodsintegrating with the GIS were used for natural hazard modeling ( Choubin et al., 2019).The k-fold cross-validation (CV) approach is one of the statisticalvalidation approaches used for mapping the various natural hazards. TheK-fold may be in several forms, namely two-fold, three-fold, four-fold,etc.
Arabameri et al. (2020b)used a four-fold cross-validationapproach to map the susceptibility of land subsidence. Ghorbanzadeh et al. (2018)used the 4-fold validation method for mapping land subsi-dence and vulnerability to forestﬁres. In this study, we have used the

29four-fold validation approach for mapping the gully erosion susceptibil-ity and selecting the best ensemble method.The study was aimed to detect gully erosion-prone areas in EasternIndia's Hinglo river basin using the hybrid machine learning ensembleapproaches namely RBFnn, RSS, and RTF. For GESM the K-fold cross-validation approach was applied. The receiver operating characteristic(ROC), mean absolute error, root mean square error (RMSE), and relativegully density (R-index) methods were selected for the evaluation of theGESMs.2. Study areaGeographically, the Hinglo river basin occupies an area of approxi-mately 442.95 sq. km and extends from 23/C144207.0900Nt o2 4/C140056.7800N latitudes and 86
/C1459032.6800Et o8 7/C1423031.9100E longitudes (Fig. 1). The height of basin ranges from 7 m to 235 m from the mean sea level. Theclimatic condition of the basin is largely in ﬂuenced by the South-West Monsoon. The wet and rainy south-west Indian monsoon is verystrong, storming compared to the winter Indian Monsoon. According toobservation data from the Indian Metrological Department (IMD), theaverage rainfall is 1326 mm.Granite-gneiss formation, Barakar formation, ironstone shale forma-tion, quartzite, and younger alluvium geological segments made up theresearch area (GSI, 1985). The greater part of the study area is occupiedby the granite-gneiss geological formation. The newer geological allu-vium formation is highly fertile and suitable for agriculture, and rice,master, wheat, maize, and sugarcane are the major crops cultivated inthis basin. The agricultural activities are the basic and main economicactivity of the river bank dwellers. Based on USDA's soil texture classi-ﬁcation given in 1985, the basin is consist of ﬁne loamy mixed haplustalf, ﬁne loamy mixed with plustalf, clay, clay loam, sandy, sandy loam, andloam soil textures (NATMO, 2001). From a morphological viewpoint the

30research area's upper section is characterized by higher slope. Themaximum slope is 35
/C14which is found in the catchment's northwestportion. The upper portion of the basin is facing a huge problem of gullyerosion (Ghosh and Shah, 2015). The main erosive processes that affectthe landscape in the study area are related to runoff waters. In locationswhere there is no vegetative cover and in cultivated ﬁelds, overlandﬂow processes are highly active. In the upper catchment area large portion iscovered by the lateritic soil. Bare surface, presence of lateritic soil andrunoff are combinedly inducing the gully erosion in this study area. Inthese circumstances for sustainable land management and reducing thegully erosion some protective measures should be taken into consider-ation. For the sustainable management of the basin ﬁrst, it is essential to map the potential area of gully erosion in the basin and then strategiesshould be formulated giving the priority on level of gully erosion po-tential. Viewing the gully erosion problem we mapped the area suscep-tibility to gully erosion using the novel ensemble method.3. Materials and methodsIn this research following steps were carried out ( Fig. 2).1. Data regarding gully erosion and gully erosion conditioning factors(GECFs) were collected;2. Thematic layers of GECFs were prepared and gully erosion datasetswere classiﬁed into four folds using K-fold cross validation (CV)approach in GIS platform,3. GECFs were selected using multi-collinearity assessment and Infor-mation gain ratio (IGR)4. An artiﬁcial intelligence i.e. Radial Basis Function (RBF) neuralnetwork and its ensemble with Meta classiﬁers i.e. Random sub space (RSS) and Rotation forest (RTF) models were applied to produce gullyerosion susceptibility maps (GESMs).5. Signiﬁcance of GECFs was assessed using random forest (RF) model,6. Models performance was analyzed using ROC, statistical methods likeMAE, RMSE and relative gully erosion density (R-Index) methods.3.1. Data sourcesThe ALOS PALSAR DEM was obtained from the Alaska satellite fa-cility department. Precipitation data was obtained from the IndiaMetrological Department of the nearest rainfall stations. The currentstudy area's geological map was collected from the Geological Survey ofIndia. The Landsat 8OLI/TIRS was downloaded from the United StatesGeological Survey (dated April 2108, path ¼143, row¼39) for the extraction of the land use map and NDVI. Soil texture map was obtainedfrom the department of NSSLUP (National Soil Survey and Land Use

Measurement of width, depth and areal coverage were alsodone throughﬁeld survey. The soil chemical properties such as pH,manganese, phosphorous, potassium, iron, organic carbon, sulfur, zincwere measured through laboratory analysis.3.2. Inventory map of gully erosion (GEIM)GEIM is the basic prerequisite for the gully erosion assessment andmodeling. The GEIM represents the location of gullies that were mappedin GIS.

33imagery can be used to obtain the information about gully erosion inremote areas where human cannot reach. The Google Earth image is ofhigh resolution and has good capability to detect the gullies in the remotearea (Arabameri et al., 2020b). First, gullies were identiﬁed through the Google earth images and then for the locational veri ﬁcation and mea- surement of width, depth and areal coverage ﬁeld survey was done with global positioning system (GPS). In the study area, a total of 120 gullieswere identiﬁed (Fig. 3). The gully polygons were converted to points(head-cut point). Equal number of non-gully points was also selectedrandomly. Then the points were used in training and testing the models.A k-fold CV framework (Fig. 2) was chosen to remove the negative im-pacts of randomness on the efﬁciency of machine learning approaches.The four-fold CV was used to divide the GEIM into four folds (F1,F2,F3
and F 4) for modelling GESM (Fig. 2). Then, the models were run four times. For instance, the ‘t' model was run with F
1,F2and F 3datasets without allowing the F
4fold and then model was evaluated with the F 4
subset. For each time 75% of the selected gully and non-gully points wereused for training the models and 25% were used for validating thetrained models. Duringﬁeld survey geometry of some gully wasmeasured. The gully's maximum length is 782 m, and the gully's shortestlength is 387 m. The maximum depth is 6.5 m, and the minimum depth is2.5 m. The maximum width is 9.2 m, and the minimum width is 3.5 m.

35Some valuableﬁeld photos were taken during theﬁeld measurement and survey, as shown inFig. 4.3.3. Preparation of effective factorsIn the present study various environmental factors for modeling thegully erosion susceptibility (GES) including topographical, hydrological,lithological, soil physical and chemical characteristics were selectedconsidering the previous literatures. These factors were constructed inthe GIS platform as spatial datasets for modeling through the differentensembles methods.3.3.1. Topographical and Hydrological factorsGully formation is regulated by topographic factors ( Shit et al., 2013). The topographic factors affect the erosive power of runoff, possibledischarge,ﬂow velocity, and transport efﬁciency (Claps and Rossi, 1994). Two types of topographic attributes exist, i.e. the primary and secondaryattributes. The primary topographical attributes are altitude, slope, slopeaspect, catchment area, the curvature of plane and pro ﬁle and secondary topographical attributes are SPI, STI, CI, TRI, TPI, and TWI ( Garosi et al., 2019). All these topographical factors were derived from PALSAR DEMusing the SAGA GIS tool. Altitude is an important gully conditioningfactor that inﬂuences the formation of the gully (Gayen et al., 2020). In the present study, the altitude of the basin is derived from PALSAR DEMwith a resolution of 12.5 m*12.5 m. Therefore, elevation varies from 7 mto 235 m as per the PALSAR DEM (Fig. 5a). Drainage development and surface waterﬂow are determined by the degree of slope, which isconsidered to be the main explanatory factor for gully formation ( Mar- arakanye, N., 2016;Hembram et al., 2020). In this research, the slope map is extracted from PALSAR DEM and the maximum slope of the basinis 31/C14(Fig. 5b). The plan and proﬁle curvatures on local terrains inﬂu- ence overlandﬂow, surface runoff, and subsequently gully formation(Burian et al., 2015). A curvature of the plane can be deﬁned as the hypothetical line crossing a speciﬁc cell on the contour line (Evans and Cox, 1999). The plan curvature for this basin was extracted from DEMwith the SAGA GIS tool (Fig. 5c). Convergence index (CI) shows the reliefstructure as a set of channels and ridges. This re ﬂects the agreement between the slope orientation of the surrounding cells and the theoreticalorientation of the matrix. The value of CI ranges from 100 to /C0100 respectively (Fig. 5d). Terrain ruggedness index (TRI) inﬂuences the initiation of a gully. TRI is the form of the terrain and it impacts on waterﬂows which determine the rate of gully erosion ( Claps and Rossi, 1994) TRI ranges from 0 to 82.56 (Fig. 5e).Precipitation data was collected from the Indian MetrologicalDepartment for the various stations. Based on IDW interpolation method,

Using surface curve number (SCN) method ( Soil Conservation Service, 1985), the annul runoff was estimated in GIS platform. The surface runoffvalue of this study ranges 667 mm–1337 mm respectively (Fig. 5h).3.3.2. Soil physio-chemical factorsPhysical and chemical properties of soil also play an important role inthe degradation of soil and the initiation of gullies. The soil texture mapof the study area was obtained from the National Bureau of Soil Surveyand Land Use Planning. The basin is composed of various types of soilaccording to the USDA classiﬁcation, includingﬁne loamy mixed haplutalfs, and plutalfs, clay, clay loam, sandy, sandy loam, and loamrespectively (Fig. 6a). The soil depth was prepared using the IDW methodin ArcGIS environment (Fig. 6b). Soil chemical factors were measuredfrom soil samples, including pH, boron, copper, manganese, zinc, iron,phosphorous, and potassium, organic carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. Anarrow stretch of 0.5 m/C20.5 m was chosen, and around 1 kg soil fromthe 0–20 cm depth from each sample was collected. A total of 106 soilsamples were collected (Fig. 3). After collecting the soil samples analo-gous standard laboratory analytical methods were used to measure thesoil chemical properties. The thematic maps of chemical parameters i.e.pH, OC, manganese, nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, sulfur, and zincwere produced in the GIS setting (Fig. 6).3.3.3. Lithological factorsA geological map was developed using the digitized method from thegeological map no. 73 m (scale 1:50,000) obtained from the GeologicalSurvey of India (GSI, 1985). The research area is covered by thegranite-gneiss, barakar formation, ironstone shale, quartzite, and neweralluvium (Fig. 7a). The larger part of the basin is covered by thegranite-gneiss. In the upper part of the basin is covered by the laterite soiland bared. As results most of the gullies were found in this part. Thelineament of the present study was derived from the panchromaticband-8 of Landsat 8OLI/TIRS. The distance to the lineament map wasprepared in a GIS platform using the Euclidean distance bufferingmethod. The maximum distance to lineament in this study area is 1.65km (Fig. 7b).3.3.4. Land use/land cover (LULC)Another important factor that widely regulates the formation ofgullies is the LULC (Galang et al., 2007). The rangeland and barren lands are generally the most vulnerable to gully erosion due to the greatestimpact of precipitation and comparatively higher surface runoff than thevegetation-covered areas. The vegetation-covered area can reduce theerosive effect ofﬂowing water (Maugnard et al., 2014). In general, there is a negative association between the density of vegetation and theerosion rate (Collins et al., 2004). The supervised LULC map was ob-tained from Landsat 8OLI/TIRS in the present study. The ﬁve main land-use types were identiﬁed comprising agricultural land, waterbodies, fallow land, vegetation-covered area, and settlement or built-upareas (Fig. 8). The maximum parts of the basin are covered by the agri-cultural land, followed by the vegetation, water bodies, built-up, andfallow land area.3.4. Selection of GECFsFor modeling the gully erosion susceptibility in the Hinglo river basinﬁrst GECFs were chosen based on the previous literatures. Thereafter,effectiveness of these factors was assessed using multi-collinearity testand Information gain Ratio (IGR) method before using for training themodels.
3.4.1. Multi-collinearity assessmentIn multiple regression models, linearly related two or more explana-tory variables are called multi-collinearity. To remove the highly corre-lated and inappropriate factors among the various geo-environmentalfactors for mapping various natural hazards, tolerance (TOI) and vari-ance inﬂation factor (VIF) were widely used ( Saha 2017;Roy and Saha 2019;Arabmaeri et al. 2020;Sardooi et al., 2019;Yu et al., 2015). The threshold values of VIF and TOL are <5 and>0.1, above these values factor has the collinearity problem ( Saha et al., 2022).3.4.2. Information Gain Ratio (IGR)The predictive ability of the selected 24 conditioning factors of gullyerosion was tested. Weak and inappropriate variables should have to beexcluded from GECFs. The selection of effective factors can provide a

38precise and proper prediction of model results ( Ngo et al., 2018.). The predictive capacity of various data mining methods such as Fuzzy-Roughsets (Liu, 2007.), Relief-F (Park et al., 2019), and Information Gain Ratio (Tien Bui et al., 2019.) was applied by various researchers. InformationGain (IG) depends on the theory of information which uses to measurethe signiﬁcance of GECF variables. It was considered as the standardtechnique for quantifying the predictive capability of GECFs in datamining approaches (Svoray et al., 2012). However, IG has a natural error that tends to favour attributes with many possible values and can,therefore, lead to low predictability of the resulting models ( Al-Abadi and Al-Najar 2020). To remove this problem,Quinlan (1993)developed an IGR method where a higher IGR value indicates a higher or more pre-dictive ability of the factor. It has a particular static formula that ismentioned in the following equation to obtain the GECFs ’IGR values in this study.The training data S is composed of n input samples, n (Li, S) is thenumber of samples in the training data S belonging to the class Li (Gul-lies, non-gullies).

Base classiﬁer: Radius basis function neural network (RBFnn)Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFnn) is a familiar nonlinearneural network. The RBFnn is characterized as a neural network withhidden layers. In addition, RBF consists of three layers, namely the inputlayer, the hidden layer, and the output layer. For each unit, the inputlayer converts data or vector elements into hidden layers. Each unit in thehidden layer then activates according to the associated RBFnn. Theoutput layer eventually calculates a linear combination of the hidden unitactivations. The performance of the RBFnn model learning for the inputpattern x is as follows in the classiﬁcation case (Yavari et al., 2019) (Eq. (7)):Table 3R-index values of GESM models in different folds.

In addition, the primary value of all variance pa-rameters (s) in the network is set to the absolute Euclidean squareddistance between any pair of cluster centers.3.5.2. Hybrid ensemble models3.5.2.1. Random sub space (RSS) classiﬁer.The random sub-space clas- siﬁer (RSS) is an important hybrid ensemble and a parallel learning al-gorithm.Ho (1998)introduced Random sub-space (RSS). For thisalgorithm, multiple decisions of the classiﬁer were combined using the optimization of the sub-set. Such function space subsets are chosenrandomly from the training classiﬁers (gully inventory datasets). Comparatively, the ensemble approach of random sub-space (RSS) isdistinguished from the others by an ensemble algorithm since it consistsof multiple sample numbers (Pham et al., 2020). The classiﬁcation of the original feature space was done in theﬁrst stage by the q dimensional training of subsets L. In this study, the RBFnn as base classi ﬁer was applied in this algorithm for each of these subsets. In the end, the inte-gration of the base classiﬁer has extracted from the weighted majorityvote that is stated in the following (Shirzadi et al., 2017) Eq.(8).βðxÞ¼argmaxy2f/C01;1gX

(2006)sug- gested rotation forest (RTF) which is one of the common hybrid ensembletechniques. It is regarded as an important technique for strengthening theweaker classiﬁers (Ozcift 2012). The RTF analyzes large multivariatedatasets using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce theirdimensionality (Jolliffe 2002) and splitting the original training datasetsinto sub-sets which are then used to train the classi ﬁers. It has a large application in the various branches andﬁelds e.g. medical (Ozcift and Gulten, 2012) and remote sensing data classiﬁcation (Xia et al., 2014; Kavzoglu and Colkesen, 2013) as the effective and powerful machinelearning ensemble technique. RTF has also been used in hazard modelingparticularly for landslide susceptibility modeling ( Pham et al., 2017). Rodriguez et al. (2006)suggested rotation forest (RTF) which is one ofthe common hybrid ensemble techniques. It is regarded as an importanttechnique for strengthening the weaker classi ﬁers (Ozcift 2012). The RTF analyzes large multivariate datasets using the Principal ComponentAnalysis (PCA) to reduce their dimensionality ( Jolliffe 2002) and split- ting the original training datasets into sub-sets which are then used totrain the classiﬁers. It has a large application in the various branches andﬁelds e.g. medical (Ozcift and Gulten, 2012) and remote sensing data classiﬁcation (Xia et al., 2014;Kavzoglu and Colkesen, 2013)a sa n effective and powerful machine learning ensemble technique. RTF hasalso been used in hazard modeling particularly for landslide suscepti-bility modeling (Pham et al., 2017).3.6. Measuring the relative importance of the GECFs by random forest(RF) modelRF machine learning technique is a revised form of classi ﬁcation and regression tree (CART).Breiman (2001)introduced RF. It can be used as

40an efﬁcient model for solving problems of classi ﬁcation and regression (Kuhnert et al., 2010). It is a signiﬁcant overhaul of the bootstrap ag- gregation and belongs to the ensemble model family ( Jaafari and Pour- ghasemi, 2019). The RF algorithm was performed in two stages: 1) the RFmodel uses a bootstrap sampling technique to set up training sets around2/3 of all observations randomly and creates a tree for each training set(Youssef et al., 2016). Approximately 1/3 of all observations that are notused during the construction of the training set will be used during thebootstrap sampling as a test set and known as the out-of-bag sample(OOB) which can be used to determine misclassi ﬁcation errors and es- timate anticipated predictive accuracy ( Youssef et al., 2016). In fact, error in OOB can be used as a generalization error measure. 2) The nodesof each tree shall be divided according to the best explanatory variablesselected from the explanatory variables input randomly selected subset.The random selection of explanatory variables at each node reduces theimpact between any pair of trees in the forest; therefore, raising the foresterror rate. Further details on the RF model can be found in Breiman (2001),Palczewska et al. (2014), andOshiro et al. (2012). In our anal- ysis, the package“random forest”in R 3.5.1 program was used to predictthe relative importance of the GECFs.3.7. Validation techniquesROC curve, statistical methods such as MAE, RMSE, and relative gullydensity (R-Index) methods were applied for the justi ﬁcation and accuracy assessment of the GESMs.3.7.1. ROC curveReceiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve is a well-knownapproach used for performance analysis of models ( Arabameri et al., 2020b;Gayen et al., 2020). The area under the curve (AUC) deals withthe theoretical accuracy of the models ( Youssef et al., 2016). This tech- nique was, therefore, applied in the various natural hazards mapping, e.g.gully erosion susceptibility (Saha et al., 2020;Arabameri et al., 2020b; Debanshi and Pal, 2020); land subsidence susceptibility (Ghorbanzadeh et al., 2018), groundwater potential (Saha 2017), landslide susceptibility (Meena et al., 2019), rill-interrill susceptibility (Bosino et al., 2020) and alsoﬂood susceptibility (Arabameri et al., 2020a) mapping. The ROC curve has the speciﬁc cut-off values which classify model performance(Hembram et al., 2021). The AUC was designed by the true positive rate(sensitivity) against false positive rate (1-speci ﬁcity) following equations (11)–(13).Sensitivity¼

ðPTPþPTNÞðPþNÞ (13)Based on the four types of classiﬁcation such as true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) area underthe curve of ROC (AUCROC) was calculated. The true positive (TP) andthe True negative (TN) are the number of pixels properly classi ﬁed by the models, while false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) are thenumber of pixels incorrectly classiﬁed by the modes (Arabameri et al., 2020a). Researchers considered if the AUC value is less than 0.5 theperformance is erroneous of models ( He et al., 2019). The values of AUCROC were categorized into different categories by Fressard et al. (2014), e.g. AUCROC<0.7 as bad, AUCROC¼0.7 to 0.8 as average, AUCROC¼0.8 to 0.9 as good and AUCROC¼0.9 to 1 as excellent results.3.7.2. Statistical techniquesFor this analysis, statistical techniques such as MAE and RMSE wereapplied for the accuracy evaluation of the models. Garosi et al. (2019a,b); Saha et al. (2020)were used these methods for analyzing the perfor-mance of gully erosion modeling. MAE is de ﬁned as the sum of the dif- ference between predicted values and actual values. The square root ofMAE is known as RMSE. The calculation of the MAE and RMSE was donefollowing equations(14) and (15).MAE¼1NXni¼1/C12/C12Y

R-indexFor this analysis, the relative gully erosion density (R-index) methodwas used for evaluating the relationship between the GESM and temporalgully locations. Inﬁeld survey the gully sample was collected using GPS.A total of 120 gullies in the study region are demarcated. The R-indexwas developed byBaeza and Corominas (2001). The R-index was calculated using Eq.(16).R¼ðni=NiÞ.Xðni=NiÞ/C2100 (16)Where, ni is the percentage of the area susceptible to gully in each class ofGESM and Ni is the percentage of gully in each susceptibility class. If theR-index values are higher for very high and high susceptibility classes,performance of the model will be treated as good.4. Results4.1. Multi-collinearity evaluationThe results of the multi-collinearity test ( Table 1) are showing that the GECFs have no collinearity problems because all the selected factorsmaintained the threshold limits of TOL and VIF values ( >1 and<5). In the present study, distance to lineament has the highest TOI value(0.968) and the lowest VIF value (1.033). Contrarily, phosphorus has thelowest TOI value (0.208) and the highest VIF value (4.808). The two ormore variables in the present analysis are not strongly associated. Henceall GECFs are suitable for modeling gully erosion.4.2. Application of Information Gain Ratio (IGR)The IGR is an important machine learning method, applied to judgethe efﬁcacy of GECFs. According to the IGR method, all GECFs are suit-able for GES modeling. Among these factors, the land use/land cover hasthe highest IGR value (AM¼0.101) followed by TWI, DL, CI, slope, PC,TRI, DR, surface runoff, soil type, geology, OC, Potassium, Lof, elevation,rainfall, Nitrogen, pH, Sulfur, Zinc, Manganese, Phosphorous, and soildepth respectively (Fig. 9).4.3. Analysis of GESMsGESMs were produced using RBFnn, RSS-RBFnn, and RTF-RBFnnmodels. Each fold has three GESMs like Fold-1 has RBFnn and RSS-RBFnn and RTF-RBFnn models and a total of 12 GESMs wereJ. Roy, S. Saha Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 28 –45
41generated in GIS settings. The GESMs were then categorized into ﬁve groups with the help of Jenk ‘s natural break classiﬁcation system, namely very low, low, medium, high, and very high classes of suscepti-bility. The areal distributions of GESMs are shown in Figs. 10–12. The areas of the basin covered by the very high susceptibility class in RBFnnRTF-RBFnn RSS-RBFnn are 6.75%, 6.72% and 6.57% for Fold-1. In thecase of fold-2, very high susceptibility covered 6.21% (RBFnn), 6.09%(RSS-RBFnn) and 6.10% (RTF-RBFnn) areas of the basin and on the otherhand, 6.23% (RBFnn), 6.05% (RSS-RBFnn), and 6.13% (RTF-RBFnnn)areas are occupied by the very high susceptibility class for Fold-3. ForFold-4 the very high susceptibility class covered 7% (RBFnn), 6.42%(RSS-RBFnn), and 6.97% (RTF-RBFnnn) of the catchment respectively.GESMs results showed that the very high susceptibility region of gullyerosion is located in the catchment's northwest and middle parts due tothe concentration of lateritic soil and the presence of barren land.However, a very small portion of the basin is covered by the very highsusceptibility class.4.4. Validation of GESMsROC curve, statistical methods, as well as relative gully erosiondensity (R-index) methods were used for judging the model accuracy. Inthe present analysis, AUC was obtained using training and validationgully erosion datasets. The curve produced using training gully locationsis known as the succession rate curve (SRC), and validation data is knownas the prediction curve rate (PRC). The ROC results are shown in Table 2. AUC values for GESMs are calculated using the succession curve rate(SCR) and the prediction curve rate (PRC). The RSS-RBFnn hybridensemble was achieved the highest AUC values for both SCR and PRC inthe case of all the folds (Fig. 13andTable 2) followed by the RBFnn and RTF-RBFnn respectively. After combining the hybrid meta classi ﬁer (RSS) with the RBFnn the level of accuracy of the RBFnn model hasincreased for all the folds. Although, AUC of the success rate of the RTF-RBFnn model for fold 3 and fold 4 has decreased. Besides, these the levelof accuracy has also increased for RTF-RBFnn model.MAE and RMSE were also calculated for validating the producedmodels of four folds datasets. The reliable and important models have theRMSE and MAE values<0.5 of The MAE values of RBFnn, RSS-RBFnnand RTF-RBFnn models for the training datasets are 0.070, 0.041,0.058 in Fold-1, 0.047, 0.042, 0.042 in Fold-2, 0.030, 0.025, 0.025 inFold-3, 0.053, 0.031, 0.041 in Fold-4 and for the validation datasets are0.080, 0.071, 0.075 in Fold-1, 0.040, 0.039, 0.040 in Fold-2, and 0.090,0.075, 0.080 in Fold-3, and 0.093, 0.082, 0.083 in Fold-4 respectively(Table 2). The RSS-RBFnn model has the lowest value of RMSE for boththe datasets (training and validation) in all the folds and followed by theRTF-RBFnn and RBFnn respectively. In the current study, the MAE andRMSE values of all the models for both training and validation datasetsare below the cut of value (<0.5). Therefore, the performances of all themodels are excellent.The results of the R-index are shown in Fig. 14andTable 3. The very high gully erosion susceptibility class of RBFnn, RSS-RBFnn and RTF-RBFnn achieved the highest R-index values i.e. 84, 86, 85 in Fold-1,72, 74, 72 in Fold-2, 77, 78, 76 in Fold-3, and 86, 89, 88 in Fold-4(Table 3). If the R-index values of models are increased from very lowto very high susceptibility, the models will more accurate and appro-priate for gully erosion susceptibility assessment. In the current analysis,all models' R-Index values increased from very low to very high suscep-tibility class (Fig. 14). Hence the R-index also justiﬁed the selected models as excellent for mapping the gully erosion susceptibility.5. DiscussionsIn this analysis, the construction of GESM was done using the RBFnnand its ensemble with RSS and RTF meta classi ﬁers. K-fold cross- validation (CV) method for GESM modeling was implemented in thepresent analysis and the inventory map of the gully was then categorizedinto four-fold and a total of 12 GESMs were made. In the current research,to obtain the right and optimal predictive performance of models, themachine learning-based ensemble techniques were applied for the gully
erosion modeling. RBFnn and its ensemble with RSS and RT ensembleMeta classiﬁers were used for the spatial mapping of gully erosion sus-ceptibility (GES). In the present study, the accuracy of the base classi ﬁer RBFnn has increased by nearly 2%–3% after ensemble with the hybrid meta classiﬁers as like the works done byPham et al. (2017,2019);Chen et al. (2017). GESMs were assessed using the methods of ROC curve,RMSE, MAE, and R-index. Garosi et al. (2019); Arabameri et al. (2020b); Chen et al. (2019); Pham et al. (2017; 2019) used the ROC, RMSE andMAE curves to assess the accuracy of different hazard models. Meena et al. (2019)used the R-index for assessment of the susceptibility tolandslides. This similar method was applied in this research to measurethe accuracy of GES models and to select the best model. The R-indexmethod helps to detect the density of the pixels of gullies in susceptibilityclasses.The GESMs were produced using the CV approach and evaluated theaccuracy using different methods such as AUC, MAE, RMSE, and R-index.However, a single statistical method is not adequate to validate themodels because validation points were randomly selected, validationsamples are small in number and one validation method might have higherror (Garosi et al., 2018). AUC of ROC, RMSE, and MAE were used forthe validation of the models. A higher AUC value indicates good ef ﬁ- ciency and excellent capability of spatial prediction ( Hosseinalizadeh et al., 2019). In this study, the results of AUC, R-index, MAE, and RMSErevealed that the used method are excellent for modeling gully erosion.The machine learning-based ensemble models deliver better and perfectresults than the single model (Arabameri et al., 2020b;Hembram et al., 2021). The integrated models i.e. RSS-RBFnn and RTF-RBFnn wereshown better results than RBFnn. The ensemble model, i.e. RSS-RBFnn,has the highest and best predictive output in the current analysis, fol-lowed by the RBFnn and RTF-RBFnn models. RSS-RBFnn model isshowing nearly 6.5% of the study area has very high gully erosion sus-ceptibility (Fig. 15). The upper part of the basin has the very high sus-ceptibility of gully erosion because most of the parts of the uppercatchment area are bare surface and have laterite soil which is favorablefor gullying. According to the results of the study length of overland ﬂow or surface runoff has signiﬁcant contribution in producing the gullies inthe study area and same kind of results can be found in the work ofConforti et al. (2011);Conoscenti et al. (2018);Comino et al. (2016). For reducing the rate of gully erosion in the upper and middle catchmentareas of the basin the planners should take strong strategies of affores-tation and check dam formation. However, this work will attract theresearchers for studying the gully erosion in other regions and providevaluable information to the planners for land use management in thisstudy area.5.1. Factor signiﬁcance analysisIn the study for GESM modeling a large number of go-environmentalfactors such as topographical, hydrological, lithological, soil physio-chemical parameters were used. The chemical properties retain thecohesive, soil health and soil particle strength and in turn determine thepossibility of gully formation (Hosseinalizadeh et al., 2019;AsghariSar- askanroud et al., 2017). The combinations of the physio-chemical topo-graphical, hydrological, lithological, and soil parameters for mappinggully erosion are more precise and effective. Romer and Ferentinou (2016)noted that a large number of databases can enhance the model's
performance in achieving the best results and perfect prediction. Hos- seinalizadeh et al. (2019a,b)used 24 geo-environmental factors liketopographical, hydrological, lithological, soil physio-chemical parame-ters to map the susceptibility of the gully head cut. The RF model wasused to determine the importance of factors. The results of the model areshown inTable 4. The outcome of RF model showed that the LULC (RF ¼ 22.149) has the highest contribution in making the area susceptible toJ. Roy, S. Saha Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Geosciences 3 (2022) 28 –45

ConclusionsGeomorphic threats such as soil and gully erosion, ﬂooding,ﬂash ﬂood, and land subsidence have been increased because of increasinghuman interference with nature. Among the various natural hazards,gully erosion is the most important which is creating a huge problem inthe agricultural sector and also reducing the economic growth in acountry like India where a large portion of the GDP comes from thissector. The only way for managing the gully erosion is the proper map-ping of gully erosion susceptible area through sound methods. The GESMis the most powerful tool for planning land use and for environmentalmanagement. The selection of effective GECFs is the preconditions forGES mapping and gully erosion management. In the present analysis 24geo-environmental variables used for modeling GES using the K-fold CVapproach. GESMs were constructed in the GIS platform using the RBFnn,RSS, RTF models, and these maps were evaluated by the ROC curve,MAE, RMSE, and relative gully density (R-index) method. All modelshave perfect to excellent performance for evaluating gully erosion, ac-cording to the statistical procedures used for the validation. Among theGES models, the RSS-RBFnn has the best predictive performance for gullyerosion modelling. The results of the GESMs showed that the areas proneto gully erosion are located in the catchment's northwest and middleportions, because of the presence of laterite soil, high drainage density,maximum concentration of surface runoff and bare surface. In the studyarea for reducing the soil erosion in the upper part of the basin immediatesuitable measures such as afforestation, agro-forestry, check-dem con-struction and proper land use management should be taken. Majordrawbacks of the present work are preparation of data layers from smalland medium scale maps. Among the selected factors specially, soilmicronutrient are very difﬁcult to be related via causal effect to the gullydevelopment because these factors indirectly involved in inducing gullythrough changing soil conditioning. However, the produced GESMs willhelp in implementing sustainable management plans to decision-makers,engineers, and land-use planners.Declaration of competing interestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in ﬂuence the work reported in this paper.FundingNo funding was received for this work.Credit author statementJagabandhu Roy:Methodology, Format analysis, Investigation,Writing original draft Software, preparation; Sunil Saha:Methodology, Format analysis, Investigation, writing original draft preparation,Writing review and editing.AcknowledgmentsAuthors would like to thanks the inhabitants of Basin because theyhave helped a lot during ourﬁeld visit.
