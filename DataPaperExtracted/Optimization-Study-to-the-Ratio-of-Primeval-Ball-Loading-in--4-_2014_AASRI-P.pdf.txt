Abstract 
Optimized study to the ratio of primeval ball loading in 4.0 × 6.0m overflow ball Mill of Yingezhuang gold mine, the research results showed that it pertains to low hard and brittle ores, the accurate size ball should be used rather than big size ball due to mainly fines mineral are produced in the process of comminution. As the yield of intermediate granularity between 8 to 0.45 mm reach up to 50.34%,the intermediate particles should be strengthened in grinding, -400 mesh content is about 40% and -10um content accounts for a quarter of the grind products what showed that particles size are not satisfied and unfavorable to subsequent separation. The optimum scheme of primeval ball loading is that: ĳ70: ĳ60: ĳ50˖ĳ40= 15: 15: 30: 40 for ĳ4.0 × 6.0m overflow ball mill, the separate sizes contents is 64.19% between 0.15~0.019mm which 
increasing by 19.14% compare with 44.78% and the mill -200mesh utilization coefficient increasing 12.6 percents compare with 0.14 about original program when ĳ4.0 × 6.0m overflow ball mill work itself alone, in 
 addition, the mill -200mesh utilization coefficient increasing 11.71 percents compare with 0.1503 about original program when ĳ4.0 × 6.0m overflow ball mill and ĳ3.6 × 6.0m grate ball mill are working together.

 1. Introduction The designed daily processing capacity is about 4700 ton and gold deposit belongs to the type of quartz vein of Yingezhuang Gold Mine. As the ores are in short supply, the ĳ3.6 × 6.0m grate ball mill on and off, neve
 rtheless, ĳ4.0 × 6.0m overflow ball mill working all along, T
 he underflow particles returns to regrinding and the overflow particles enter into flotation subs equent after hydrocyclone about one stage grinding products, grinding flow diagram of Yingezhua ng Gold Min as the figure 1 shows. ĳ4.0 × 6.0m overflow ball mil
 l is closed-circuit grinding, it need to not only own return oversize, but also the return oversize from ĳ3.6 × 6.
 0m grate ball mill, due to the ĳ3.6 × 6.0m grate ball mill work uncertain which bring many inconve
niences forĳ4.0 × 6.0m overflow ball mill. The Plant scheme of primeval ball loading is that: ¶100: ¶80:¶60=20:40:40 for ĳ4.0 × 6.0m overflow ball mill, coarse particles (>0.15mm
 ) is a larger, the yield of - 200 mesh is between 18% to 20% and the size composition is irrational in grinding products. This paper aims to optimize the Ratio of Primeval Loading Ball and the size composition of grinding products.

Table 2 results indicated that: (1) The maximum particle di ameter is 14.33 of new feed by the 95% of the sieving particle size and the yield of less than 200 mesh  is 11.27%, it said that pertains to brittle ores, the accurate size ball should be used rather than big size ball due to mainly fines mineral are produced in the process of comminution and the intermediate particles should be strengthened in grinding because the yield of Intermediate granularity between 8 to 0.45 mm reach up to 50.34%. (2) Needed to grind coarse particles(>0.2mm) contents are 83.03% for new feed  based on the requirements of grinding process, Decreased 25.47 percent after grinding and the grind efficiency (E
+0.2) is 30.58% and it’s lower when the ĳ4.0 × 6. 0m overflow ball mill working alone, In the same way, the grind efficiency (E
+0.2) is 28.82% when two mills working together, thus it can be seen grinding ef ficiency is low which single open or double open. (3) The coarse particles (>5mm) content is only between 6% to 7% and the fine particles (<0.2mm) content up to 40% in underflow whatever single open or double open, its said that raise the classification efficiency and will 17  Qingfei Xiao et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   7  ( 2014 )  14 – 19 
 be the direction that we work hard to study from now on. (4) In both single open and double open, the particles size is not satisfied for grinding products , fi ne-grained (<400 mesh) content is about 40% and less than 10um content accounts for a quarter of product s, which has unfavorable influence on consequent processing. The size composition unreasonable caused by th e ball diameter is too large in the first, of course, it also related with screening efficiency. So we should not only improve grinding, also improve the screening efficiency
 [3-6]. 4.  Study on the Ratio of primeval ball loading Used the particle sizes ratio of 1:1 with mill new feeds and underflows as full feed, the accurate ball diameter has calculated for new feed size which respectively are 15mmˈ12mmˈ10mmˈ8mm and 5mm according t
 o the ore average mechanical intensity what is 673.52 kg/cm
2, the working conditions of ĳ4.0 × 6. 0m overflow ball mill and Duan’s semi-theory formul a. Then Determined the ratio of each balls by the principle of roughly equivalent with the each particles group contents ( shown in Table 3). Finally got a Ratio of primeval ball loading as follows: Recommended scheme 1: ĳ70: ĳ60: ĳ50: ĳ40 = 15: 15: 30: 40 and av
 erage ball diameter is 50.5mm; For convenience the recommendatory scheme 2 is ĳ70: ĳ60:ĳ50: ĳ40 = 25: 25:
  25: 25 and average ball diameter is 55.5mm; selected two schemes that larger than recommended scheme for average ball diameter in order to be plenty comparative selection, there are large scheme 3 and 4 respectively, large scheme 3 is ĭ80: ĳ70: ĳ60: ĳ40 = 15: 15: 30: 40 and average ball diameter is 56.5mm, large sc
heme 4 is ĭ80: ĳ70: ĳ60: ĳ40 =20: 20: 20: 40 and average ball diam
eter is 58mm; The scheme 5 used plant what is ĳ100: ĳ80: ĳ60 =20: 40: 40 and average ball diameter is 76mm, to compare with plant scheme, selected a larger sc
heme what is ĳ100: ĳ80: ĳ60 = 60: 30: 10 and average ball diameter is 90mm

Loaded 100kg balls and 12kg specimens in the D×L is 450×450 mm discontinuous mill, each grinding time was determined 18 minutes through exploring test to ensure the yield of -200mesh between 60% to 65% (Recovery can reach 95%). Test to primeval ball loading about recommendatory, large, plant and larger scheme in the same grinding conditions. In order to compare, using the following seven indexes to evaluate the results of grinding which are coarsest particles percentage content between 0.9mm to 5mm, unqualified size percentage content between 0.2mm to 0.9mm, the yi eld of fine particles of less than 200 mesh, the percentage content of selectable size between 0.15 to  0.019mm, the yield of over-grinds (<0.01mm) , the utilization coefficient of -200mesh (t/m
3h) that express the productivity and these schemes with a multiple of plant scheme . The results are shown in table 4 and 5:

The comparative results of table 4 and 5 shown that: (1)The diameter of ball so too larger that grinding area is small and lack of impact times which lead to coarse particles is too much, the higher unqualified size content, the yield of fine particles and less than 200mesh is low in grinding productions for larger scheme and plant scheme, so them continue to not use in grindi ng process. (2) Recommended scheme is highly targeted, high fine proportion, -200mesh content and Productivity, the first scheme is best especially, the separate sizes contents is 64.19% between 0.15~0.019mm which increas ing by 19.14% compare with 44.78% and the mill - 200mesh utilization coefficient increasing 12.6 percents compare with 0.14 about original program when ĳ4.0 × 6.0m
  overflow ball mill working itself alone, in addition, the mill -200mesh utilization coefficient increasing 11.71 percents compare with 0.1503 about original program when ĳ4.0 × 6.0m overflow ball mill and ĳ3.6 × 6.0m grate ball mill working together. (3) The l
 arge scheme is smaller than larger or plant scheme and bigger than recommended scheme, therefore, the grinding effect in between and can be counted as "average". After the comprehensive comparison of th e conclusion: there is a good grinding effect for ĳ4.0 × 6.0m
  overflow ball mill what ever ĳ4.0 × 6.0m overflow ball mill work itself alone 
 or there are working together and the first scheme is ensured primeval ball loading what is: ĳ70: ĳ60: ĳ50: ĳ40 = 15: 15: 30: 40. 5.
