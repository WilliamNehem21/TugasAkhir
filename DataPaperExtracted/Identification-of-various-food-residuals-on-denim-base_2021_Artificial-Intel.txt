1. IntroductionThe development of science and technology is a double-edgedsword. It does bring security to people's life, on the other hand, it maybe also used by criminals, who may go beyond the boundaries of lawand morality. Therefore, new technologies should be introduced to theexploration of crime scenes to combat the increasingly complex andvolatile crime situation. The analysis of trace material evidence is an im-portant technique in criminal investigation ( Sumad-on, 2021). On the one hand, thermal residual is important to analyze the thermal trace in-formation in crime scenes (Ai et al., 2020;Xu et al., 2020;Li et al., 2018), however, the forensic investigator is often asked to ﬁnd the origin of a certain material, which is found at the crime scene ( Klaasse et al., 2021;Palmer, 2016). Liquid is the main form of trace material evidence,including beverages, blood, semen, saliva, urine and sweat. The analysisof trace material evidence presents a major challenge, due to the factthat some liquids left at crime scenes are invisible to the naked eyeand the amount is limited or even tiny. Recently, researchers have de-veloped many effective chemical experimental methods for thedetection of liquid traces at crime scenes. Tobe et al. introduced thatthe hexagon OBIT method could be used for DNA analysis and thatblood could be detected by spraying luminol on suspicious areas(Tobe and Daeid, 2009). Blum et al. developed stable DNA markerswhich could reliably identify blood and saliva stains ( Blum et al., 2006). Fereja et al. developed a luminol electrochemical luminescentbiosensor, which could successfully distinguish blood stains fromother stains when embed to a smartphone as the detection device(Fereja et al., 2019). However, chemical testing is inevitably destructiveand detrimental to crime scene protection. In addition, most chemicalexperiments need to be carried out in the laboratory, so the results can-not be directly identiﬁed in the criminal scenes, which causes inconve-nience to the detection of cases.As a result, researchers begin to apply non-contact, rapid ﬁeld mea- surement methods, such as near infrared spectroscopy ( Oravec et al., 2019;Takamura et al., 2018), Raman spectroscopy (Doty and Lednev, 2018a;Rosenblatt et al., 2019) and computer vision, to detect materialevidence at crime scenes. For near infrared spectroscopy, Takamuraet al. demonstrated a dry urine trace detection method based on Fouriertransform attenuated total reﬂection infrared spectroscopy, whichﬁ- nally indicated the chemical source of gender difference in urine donors(Takamura et al., 2019). Zhao et al. proposed a nondestructive detectionArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 125 –132

In terms of the application of Raman spectroscopytechnology, Kyle et al. established a support vector machine discrimi-nant analysis model to correctly predict the age of blood donors withhigh accuracy (Doty and Lednev, 2018b). Muro et al. developed a non- destructive detection technology using Raman spectroscopy to deter-mine the sex of saliva donors at the scene of a crime with high accuracy(Muro et al., 2016). However, the detection methods mentioned abovelack spatial dimension information. Additionally, researchers appliedcomputer vision technology to identify and detect material evidence.Tarawneh proposed a non-contact recognition system to effectivelyidentify low qualityﬁngerprints so the problems were solved thatpalmprint recognition was difﬁcult in low quality images (Tarawneh et al., 2018). Zhu et al. established a trace detection device based onthe principle of reﬂection transformation imaging, which suggested animportant application prospect in criminal investigation ( Zhu et al., 2019). Unfortunately, the computer vision technology lacks the infor-mation of spectral dimension and the component analysis which are re-sponsive to the spectrum, which is important for crime scene analysis.Hyperspectral imaging technology is composed of images and spec-tra. The data acquired by this technology includes three kinds of infor-mation viz. space, radiation and spectrum. The technique is widelyused in agriculture (Mahesh et al., 2015;Ahmed et al., 2016), medicine (Chiang et al., 2017;Li et al., 2017), remote sensing (Adão et al., 2017; Xue and Baofeng, 2017;Duan et al., 2020), textile (Mirschel et al., 2019;Ryu et al., 2017), environment (Foglini et al., 2019;Olmos et al., 2019), and chemistry (Roberts et al., 2018;Jia-Huan et al., 2018). In theﬁeld of medical criminal investigation, Przemys et al. introduced amethod for detecting the gunshot residue on the fabric based onhyperspectral technology, which was conducive to collecting evidenceat the crime scenes (Głomb et al., 2018). Majda et al. proposed a method to get the age of blood stains by estimating the dry degree of them withthe help of hyperspectral imaging technology, which could quickly andeffectively distinguish blood stains by time ( Majda et al., 2018). Cadd et al. proposed a visible wavelength reﬂectivity hyperspectral imaging technology, which could clearly identify blood stains on white tilesand even distinguishﬁngerprints in blood from a variety of other ﬁnger- prints in red or brown media (Cadd et al., 2016). Nakamura et al. used hyperspectral technology to measure the ﬂuorescence of potentialﬁn- gerprints, hence, the visual identi
ﬁcation and detection of untreatedﬁn- gerprints are realized successfully (Nakamura et al., 2015). It is not reported that hyperspectral imaging technology has beenused to detect liquid food residues at crime scenes. Although the suspectcannot be identiﬁed directly from the liquid food residue, the unique-ness of the liquid food residue can also provide indirect evidence forthe case. By detecting liquid food residues left at the scene, the policecan get more details about the case and promote the investigation. Ac-cordingly, this will help toﬁght against the evil forces, promote the de-velopment of intelligent public security system, and create a good publicsecurity environment for the construction of a harmonious society.The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of usinghyperspectral reﬂectance imaging to estimate various food residualson denims. The main steps are as follows: (1) establish the hyper-spectral reﬂectance imaging to acquire the mean pre-processed spectraof denims contaminated by various food residuals; (2) select the wave-lengths particularly related with the food residuals using Partial LeastSquares (PLS) algorithm; (3) develop the combination optimal classi-ﬁers for classifying and recognizing various food residuals on denims.2. Materials and methods2.1. Samples of liquid residuals on denimTo simulate the traces of various liquids that might be left at thecrime scenes, a variety of common drinks are selected as the materialsfor this experiment, including apple juice, Coca-Cola, coffee, oolong teaand milk. Cotton denim fabrics covering light, medium and dark colorsare chosen to carry these liquids. To simulate different residual time,we dilute each liquid with different concentrations covering concentra-tions of 100%, 50%, and 25%. Hence, 15 experimental liquids are ob-tained viz. apple juice, Coca Cola, coffee, oolong tea and milk withconcentration of 100%, 50%, and 25%, respectively. The solutions pre-pared above are used to contaminate the three colors of fabrics to get45 experimental groups. Plus 3 groups that are not contaminated, weeventually have 48 experimental groups.The samples in each of the experimental groups are obtained bysoaking the cut fabrics in the prepared solutions. The three colors of cot-ton denim fabrics are all cut into small squares with the size of 4 cm×4cm. Five samples are prepared for each material condition mentionedabove. After drying, a total of 240 experimental samples including 15fabrics that are not dyed are obtained. All samples are individually en-capsulated in sealed bags with labeled numbers.2.2. Hyperspectral imaging systemA pushbroom Vis–NIR hyperspectral reﬂectance imaging system is applied to acquire spectral data of the fabric samples prepared previ-ously. The schematic diagram of imaging system is shown in Fig. 1. This imaging system is mainly composed of an imaging spectrograph(Imspector V10E, Spectral Imaging Ltd., Finland) attached to a 16-bitcharge-coupled detector camera of 1004 (spatial)×1002 (spectral) ac-tive pixels (Falcon EM285CL, Raptor Photonics Led., U.K.) and a C-mount lens (Model Xenoplan 1.4/17, Jos. Schneider Optische WerkeGmbH, Germany), Osram Tungsten halogen lamp, sample stage, andcomputer.The conventional line-scan hyperspectral imaging instruments usetheﬁxed image acquisition module and the moving sample stage fordata acquisition. However, in practical scenarios, there may not be asample stage that can move linearly and reliably. Hence, in our research,the hyperspectral imaging system is specially designed which keepsboth the image acquisition module and the sample stage ﬁxed while working. This bistatic hyperspectral imaging architecture is achievedby adding a slit to the lens, and the movement of slit can be controlledby a linear motor (shown in the top right corner of Fig. 1). The hyper- cube can be collected by controlling the uniform movement of the slit.The maximum distance that the slit can reach is 16 mm.In the current work, the movement speed of slit is set at 0.8 mm/s.The exposure time and the gain of camera are set to 30 ms and 1, respec-tively. The illumination intensity of halogen lamp is set at 44 Klux. Thehypercube with the spectral range covering 328.81 –1113.54 nm with full width at the half maximum of approximately 0.8 nm can be ob-tained with these imaging parameters.2.3. Spectral calibrationTo reduce the instability of light source in spatial dimension, the ob-tained hyperspectral reﬂectance images are required to be subjected tothe spectral calibration. The equation below was utilized to correct theraw hyperspectral image:R

Therefore, in Eq.1, the images in numerator and denominatorY. Chen, Z. Xu, W. Tang et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 125 –132
126are respectively captured under working and corrected exposure time.I
dis obtained when the lens cap is closed, and is used primarily to reducethe effects of dark currents in the imaging chip. To guarantee the stabil-ity of the calibration process, ten reference white and dark images wereacquired each time, and then averaged for correction.2.4. Hyperspectral data pretreatmentAs described above, the distribution of the liquid on the fabric andthe composition of the fabric are uniform. Therefore, we ignore the spa-tial information of the collected hyperspectral data, and only analyzethe spectral information. However, the spatial information ofhyperspectral image is very useful in practical application scenarios.For example, at an actual crime scene, the location of the liquid residueon the fabric is unknown to us, and we can scan the entire fabric usinghyperspectral imaging system to eventually ﬁnd the exact location of the liquid residue.For each image, we collected 2000 spectra. Since there were 5samples for each material condition, a total of 10,000 spectra wereultimately selected for each material condition. For each category,80% and 20% of spectra were randomly selected as calibration andprediction sets.To reduce the noise caused by imaging equipment, in this research,the Gauss Low Pass Filter (GLPF) is chosen to convolute the spectralvalue on the spatial scale, and attenuate the high-frequency compo-nents. The GLPF is:Hu,vðÞ ¼e

0,v0).D0stands for the radius ofﬁlter, and it depends on the parameterσ.To remove the spatial information, we ﬁrst cropped the hyper- spectral image to preserve effectively contaminated areas. A point sam-pling method commonly used in biological sampling counts called theﬁve-point sampling method was then used to select the valid pixels.Theﬁve-point sampling method starts at the center of the image, andthen selects theﬁve points that pass through the intersection of thetwo diagonals at the center and the four corners, together, as represen-tative pixels of the image.2.5. Characteristic wavelength selectionThe extraction of characteristic wavelengths can greatly reduce dataredundancy, retain the most representative wavelengths, simplify themodel, and speed up model calculation. Partial Least Squares (PLS)removes useless noise and overly tight correlations between databy mapping a high-dimensional original feature vector to a low-dimensional new feature vector. Therefore, PLS is widely used tomodel linear relationships between samples' attributes and features.Let the output results beYm×1, and featuresX m×p. The formulas can be expressed as follows:y¼XWcþe¼Xbþe ð4ÞwhereXis the feature matrix;Wrepresents the weight matrix ofX;cis the regression coefﬁcient vector andestands for prediction error. b, which equals (b

i∣, indi- cates how important theith wavelength is toy. The bigger∣b
i∣is, the greater its inﬂuence onyis. In this research, PLS is employed to extractcharacteristic wavelengths, and weﬁnally extract 10, 50 and 100 featurewavelengths to model.2.6. Combination optimal classiﬁerSupport vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) algorithmsare adopted to construct classiﬁcation models with training data. Fur-thermore, we explore the combination of SVM and RF to improve theperformance of the ultimate model.Random forest (Breiman, 2001) is a supervised machine learning al-gorithm that just emerged in this century. It focuses more on accuratelydescribing the data and classifying them into corresponding categories,as well as summarizing the data. The standard SVM focuses more onbinary classiﬁcation, but it has applied in multi-category classi ﬁcation as well (Belousov et al., 2002). The optimization strategy is shown inAlgorithm 1.

One of the highlights of this system is that the sample stage keeps still while the slit on the len moves to get the hyperspectral data of sample's different areas.Y. Chen, Z. Xu, W. Tang et al.

1,R O CC u r v e ,A U Ca r e considered.1) Confusion Matrix: we assume that “Positive”means the positive sam- ples and“Negative”means the negative samples. Meanwhile, “True” represents that the prediction is right while “False”represents that the prediction is wrong. As a result, “TP”and“TN”mean that the pos- itive sample is classiﬁed as“Positive”and the negative sample is la- beled as“Negative”, respectively.“FP”and“FN”represent that the negative sample is labeled as“Positive”and the positive sample is clas- siﬁed as“False”. The four indicators make up the confusion matrix.2) TP Rate (TPR) and FP Rate (FPR): it is a ratio that is used to estimatethe classiﬁcation ability of a model within the range from 0 to 1. Theycan be calculated by the following equation:TPR¼

The x-coordinate is FPR, and the y-coordinate is TPR. In general, the closer the ROC curve is to theupper left corner, the better the performance of the classi ﬁer is.Area under curve (AUC) is deﬁned as the area under the ROC Curve.The value of AUC is generally between 0.5 and 1, and the greater thevalue of AUC is, the better the efﬁciency of the classiﬁer is.3. Experimental results and discussionAll work has beenﬁnished in Matlab 2014b. With data processedthrough each step, we analyze the results carefully.3.1. Results of pretreatmentAfter pretreatment via Guassian lowﬁltering with differentσ, there are different changes in spectral pro ﬁle. Take the hyperspectral data of pure liquid Coca-Cola as the example, as shown in Fig. 2.I t can be seen that there is an increasingly obvious change in the de-tails of the spectrum asσincreases: asσincreases, the details of spectral proﬁles become less, and the curve becomes smoother viz.many sharp burrs vanish. On the other hand, smoothing also makesthe spectrum proﬁle reduces a lot of original features. Therefore,having considered both the processed images and the classi ﬁcation results, the Guassian low passﬁlter withσ1 is adopted, which can reach the goal of reducing the burrs and retaining necessary originalfeatures.The Guassian low passﬁlter withσ1 is used to process all the simu- lation materials and the carrier viz. apple juice, Coca-Cola, coffee, oolongtea, milk and light, medium and dark fabrics, which are shown in Fig. 3 andFig. 4.Compared with the spectrogram of fabrics, the spectrogram of liq-uids is much messier. Even after treatment, there is still much burrand sharp bulge, and the curve is more irregular. The spectrogram ofcoffee, in particular, shares a similar trend with coke, apple juice andtea, perhaps because of their close color similarity.Among these three kinds of fabrics, it can be seen that there are twopeak values in three images. It may be caused by the fact that theY. Chen, Z. Xu, W. Tang et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 125 –132
128components of the fabric are more sensitive to the light of twowavebands. With color deepens, theﬁrst crest begins to gradually de- cline, and almost vanishes in terms of dark fabric. Thus, we draw theconclusion that theﬁrst wave crest can mainly distinguish the threekinds of fabrics. Meanwhile it may be the characteristic wavelength ofthese kinds of fabric.3.2. Analysis of characteristic wavelengths' resultsAs mentioned above, we use PLS algorithm to extract feature wave-lengths after pretreatment. We acquire 10, 50 and 100 characteristicwavelengths and use them respectively to model. The top 100 wave-lengths of coffee are elaborated inFig. 5.

129As we can see fromFig. 5, the feature wavelengths of top 10 ap-proximately concentrate at 800 nm viz. 1136 cm
−1, probably due to the functional group C-Os and C –N‘ss t r e t c h i n gm o d ei n caffeine, which is the main component in coffee. The featurewavelength of 700 nm viz. 1428 cm
−1may come from the functional group C-Hs stretching mode in caffeine and sugar. Theother 5 feature wavelengths are probably from other organicmatter in coffee. For the top 11 to 50 feature wavelengths, it can bepredicted that more characteristics are included. As expected, forthe range of 625 nm to 750 nm viz. 1333 cm
−1to 1600cm−1,t h e wavelengths additionally stand for C=C in stretching mode, whilethe wavelengths of 780 nm to 830 nm viz.1204 cm
−1to 1282cm−1
nm may be attributed to C-Os and C –N‘s stretching mode of caffeine. The similar explanation can be applied to the top 51 to100 feature wavelengths.The top 10 wavelengths are more reﬂective of the characteris- tics of coffee's spectrum; the top 50 can roughly cover the charac-teristics; and the top 100 can reﬂect the characteristics more speciﬁcally. The characteristic wavelengths of number 10, 50 and100 are identiﬁed by the combination classiﬁer, which are used by random forest and SVM algorithms. When the number of char-acteristic wavelengths is 50, the classi ﬁcation system performs best. Under the best circumstance, the TP rate is 83.5%, and theFP rate is 2.3% when classifying liquid on denim, which is elabo-rated in the part‘Performance of Classiﬁers for Contaminative Denim Classiﬁcation’.3.3. Performance of classiﬁers for liquid category classiﬁcationThe results of liquid category classiﬁcation are presented inTable 1. According toTable 1, optimal strategy, as expected, performs betterthan SVM and RF algorithms. Compared to other indicators, it is easyto observe that the precision of optimal strategy reaches 96.6%, whichis the highest and improves most as well. Almost all the evaluation indi-cators of optimal strategy are promoted except FPR, but it only declinesa little. It is very likely that the combination of SVM and RF can obtain arelatively satisfying classiﬁcation model.3.4. Performance of classiﬁers for liquid residue time (concentration)judgmentTable 2exhibits the classiﬁcation results of liquid residue time. Whatstays the same is that the optimal strategy is the one which performsbest. It can also be noticed that the performance of all classi ﬁers are

130not as good as the ones classifying the liquid category. It may be causedby the following reasons: 1) excessive classi ﬁcation results in the per- formance degradation of the classiﬁer; 2) the liquid of the same cate-gory but different concentrations consists of essentially the samecomponent, so the hyperspectral difference between the liquids of dif-ferent concentrations is not enough to distinguish them; 3) the concen-tration difference is not signiﬁcant enough, resulting in a relativelysmall difference after being dried.In general, the overall performance of the combination method im-proves the classiﬁcation system, which shows the feasibility of our clas-siﬁcation model.3.5. Performance of classiﬁers for contaminative denim classiﬁcationTable 3shows the classiﬁcation results of fabrics with liquid by vari-ous methods. Unsurprisingly, the optimal strategy has the best resultson the whole, which proves the combination strategy feasible. It isworth noting that AUC of optimal strategy is approximately close to 95%.To make it clearer, the speciﬁc results of optimal strategy aredisplayed inTable 4. It can be noted that the system shows a little differ-ence at different categories. TPR of L-Coffee is relatively good, 95.1%,while M-Tea only 70.6%. Fortunately, we can see that the average of allindicators is satisfactory. Positive indicators are all more than 81%, espe-cially AUC is over 91%. The ability of our system to classify multi-category samples is considered to be satis ﬁed.3.6. Future work in the researchThe work can achieve the basic tasks viz. detecting stained clothwith liquid, category of liquid, the kind of cloth, and even the residuetime. But owing to the fact that the whole project process is completedin the laboratory, so something that may appear in reality is not consid-ered. So in future work, we should pay more attention to these: 1) theincrease in the variety of liquid and cloth will lead to a decrease in theaccuracy. In view of the real situation at the crime scene, a high recallrate is required; 2) sample categories need to be expanded. Since the re-sidual liquid on the cloth can be identiﬁed only if the liquid is included in the database, it is necessary to add more kinds of liquids; 3) the clas-siﬁcation accuracy of different concentrations is relatively low. Sincewhat the hyperspectral reﬂects is more about the difference betweendifferent components, it is necessary to increase the accuracy throughappropriate adjustment; 4) we will attempt to use the deep learningto construct classiﬁcation model; 5) the portability of the system shouldbe taken into consideration. Currently, the system seems a little toolarge to take into crime scenes. We will try to use multispectral imagingtechniques for the construction of relevant models.4. ConclusionIn this work, we develop the hyperspectral imaging system for thedetection of liquid residue traces at the crime scene. After gaininghyperspectral images and preprocessing, classi ﬁers viz. SVM and RF, are selected to establish the classiﬁcation models. Based on these, theoptimal combination strategy, SVM combined with RF is chosen to con-struct model. The system can achieve the tasks of classifying liquid cat-egory, liquid concentration, and even different liquid categories ondenim. It can be seen from the fact that all positive indicators over81%, even some over 91% when tackling the most challenging task, de-tecting different liquid categories on denim. Furthermore, the systemperforms even better when classifying liquid category and liquidconcentration.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare that there is no conﬂict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.AcknowledgementsThis work is sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundationof China (No. 61901172, No. 61831015, No. U1908210), the ShanghaiSailing Program (No. 19YF1414100), the “Chenguang Program
