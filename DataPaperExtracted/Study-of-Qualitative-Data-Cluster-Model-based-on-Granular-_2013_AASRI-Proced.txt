Granular computing theories in the field of computer are introduced into the statistical analysis of qualitative data, based 
on the traditional qualitative data analysis methods. Multidimensional qualitative data by use of information system are 
described, and the mathematic al model of qualitative data cluster model based on granular computing is given. The 
feasibility and the superiority are verified by treating massive data. This method may provide a new train of thought for 
analysis of large and complex qualitative data.

1. Introductions 
With the rapid development of the in formation society, the i nformation need to be processed is increasing, 
and most of the data are not quantitative, which contains a large amount of qualitative data. The traditional 
data cluster analysis is based on the geometric distance to measure the similarity of the cluster analysis method, 
and the distance between the qualitative data is unable to accurately measure, in the face of these mass data, 
the traditional classification methods are limited, ther e are a great problems in operational efficiency.

There is high consistency between description for data in information system (Liu, 2001) and description for qualitative data in nature, while the former is more suit able for large data description. First, qualitative data are represented by information system. Then meaningful variable subsets are determined by using of the concept of granularity and solving the granularity ma trix progressively (He, 2005, and Yao, 2000). The purpose of classification for massive qualitative data is realized finally. From the perspective of the information theory, the info rmation content can be used to measure the size of granular, the relationship between granolas represent the degree of dependence similarity or contain (Luo, 2007). Task of cluster analysis is to find the optimal s ubset and then realize the cluster of observation object. According to this idea, change of importance degree of cl uster variable subset can be used to judge the end of cluster process. The mathematical model of qualitative data cluster model is given based on granular computing, the purpose of classification for massive qua litative data is realized, and the feasibility and the superiority are verified by treating massive data (Pu, 2002). 2. Description for information system of qualitative data For 
m objects, each of which has n components. Let ()ij m n Xxu  be an initial data matrix, in which (1 , 2 , , ; 1 , 2 , , )
ijxim jn   represents numerical value of the ith object in the jth variable. It can be seen that this data matrix has the same form as information system in rough set, represented by the information system 
(,,,)SU A V f , where U represents non blank finite set of object, it corresponds m objects in qualitative data, called discourse; 
A represents nonempty finite set of attribute, it corresponds n variables in multidimensional qualitative data; 
aaAVV
¬è  , aV represents the range of attribute A, corresponds value set of variables in qualitative data; 
: fUA Vuo  is information function, it gives a information value to every attribute of each object, that is: 
, , ( , )a aA x U f x a V¬è ¬è ¬è , corresponds mapping relation of every object and value of variable in qualitative data. Qualitative data are described in the form of information system, can not only overcome shortcomings of representing massive data by high dimensional contingenc y table, but also offer basis for the next researches.

(,,,)SU A V f : a information system;

PA¬é, it is easy to verify that indistinguishable relation ()GD P  are equivalent relation in set U, and

()IND P  are the roughest discourse relation (full relation) G, ()IND P U U u , ()GD P  is the maximum value 1; while 
()IND P  are the finest discourse relation (equal relation) Z, ()IND P U , 331  Haiyan Li et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  329 ‚Äì 333 
()GD P is the minimum value 1U . Therefore, distinguishing power of variables can be described by granularity of variables, the smaller variable‚Äôs granularity is, the stronger distinguishing power it will have. According to viewpoint of particle (Huang, 2005), each variable in qualitative data is indistinguishable relation, they all have some distinguishable ability, so each variable has its granularity, the granularity will be smaller when they are combined with each other, and then variable set of smaller granularity and stronger distinguishable ability will come into being.
 
3.2. Calculation and Construction of Model 
Suppose that there are m objects 12{, , , }m Ux x x  , and n variables 12{, , , }n A aa a  . If division of variable set 
A to U is 12{, ,, }s UA X X X  , the problem need to solve is to find a best variable subset 
BA¬é, such that the division of subset B to U is 12{, , , }k UB YY Y   (ks). In the progress of calculating best variable subset, variable subset 
1{,}kl Ba a  is obtained at first by calculating granularity matrix of variable 
A step by step, such that it satisfies: 
1,max ( , ) ( , )ij k lij PGD a a GD a a
dd  
until the decrement of importance degree of subset after merging sort reach a prescribed critical value G, that is: 
12{} 1 { } 2() ()AB ABSig B Sig B dG 
the cluster stopped. Concrete steps are as follows: step1:  calculate granularity matrix of one dimensional subset of cluster variable set 
A after screening. step2:  if 
1,max ( , ) ( , )ij k lij PGD a a GD a a
dd , then get subset 1{,}kl Ba a , and calculate 
1{} 1()ABSig B . step3: given critical value 
G. If 
1 {} { } {} 1 max{ ( ), ( )} ( ) 0
kl Aa k Aa l ABSig a Sig a Sig B     ' , then cluster progress stopped in the previous step, and let variable be the highest importance degree as cluster variable; if 
dG' , it indicates that the correlation between ka and la is not marked, stop cluster at this time; if 
!G' , then get 2B after calculating granularity between subset 1B and other subsets, and calculate 
12{} 1 { } 2() ()AB ABSig B Sig B ' , until it satisfies the requirement of end of cluster. When the above-mentioned model is carrying out, 2 aspects must be paid more attention: First, there may be not only one potential important factor behind cluster variable subset which are look for in the process of cluster, that is there may be 2 or more important structures appear in cluster, in that case, cluster process of qualitative data is the same as the description above, while difference is that there may be not only one cluster subset at last. Second, 
G defines the minimum value of the importance degree of cluster variable subset, the maximum value is 1, considering setting the critical value 
G according to the percentage of importance degree, for instance, importance degree of 5% is 0.05, importance de gree of 1% is 0.01, similar to the significance level setting, 
G can be set by different level.  
3.3. Analysis of Example 
Experiment data used in here come from Bishop, 1976, which were the survey of the preference of detergent products. Set 
1 2 1008{, , , }Ux x x  , which takes 1008 informants as observation objects; variable set 
1234{, , , }A aaaa , where 1a represents softness, range 
1{ 1(soft), 2(midle),3(hard)}aV ; variable 2a 
represents if it had used trademark M, range 
2{ 1 yes ,2(no)}aV ÀÑÀÖ ; variable 3a represents the temperature of 332   Haiyan Li et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  329 ‚Äì 333 
water, range 
3{ 1(high), 2(low)}aV ; variable 4a represents trademark liked by informants, range 
4{ 1(trademark ), 2(trademark )}aVX M . Equivalence relation formed by variable set classifies informants into 24 categories; see concrete data in table 1.

Calculate one-dimensional granularity matrix of variable set 1234{, , , }A aaaa , see computing result in table 2.

From table 2 can be know that 24 max{ ( , )} ( , ) 0.016ij GD a a GD a a   , thus subset 12 4{,}Ba a , and calculate its importance degree, then

Given 0.02G , the cluster progress stopped because G' . Cluster variable subset 
12 4{,}Ba a , variable 2arepresents detergent product if it had used trademark M, variable 
4a represents liked trademark. As can be seen that variable subset represents spending habits of the informants. Therefore informants can be classified acco
rding to spending habits: 1) informants who had used detergent products of trademark 
M, liked trademark is X; 2) informants who had not used detergent products of trademark 
M, liked trademark is X; 3) informants which had used detergent products of trademark 
M, liked trademark is M; and 4) informants who had not used detergent products of trademark 
M, liked trademark is M. Facts also indicate consumers pay much more attention to brands than softness and temperature of water, such classification fits the reality. In conclusion, equivalence relation formed by variable se t is classified into data of 1008 informants of 24 categories, determined variable subset 
12 4{,}Ba a  which is meaningful to cluster by calculating granularity matrix, then calculate importance degree after merging sort and do comparative analysis, define threshold value 
G, classify informants into 4 categories from spending habits, thus stop the whole cluster progress. Further show the feasibility of qualitative data cluster model based on granular computing, it can not only manipulate massive data but also increase the computational efficiency. 333  Haiyan Li et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  329 ‚Äì 333 
4. Conclusion 
Qualitative data are described by using information system, a mathematical model of qualitative data cluster is given based on granular computing, and a ne w method of determine best cluster variable subset upon the basis of analyzing variable subset is proposed. Th is cluster method not only fits cluster which has one important classification structure data, but also fits cluster which has multiple important classification structure data. Examples show that this model is highly effective in the face of massive data, and provides a new idea for analysis of huge and complex qualitative data.
