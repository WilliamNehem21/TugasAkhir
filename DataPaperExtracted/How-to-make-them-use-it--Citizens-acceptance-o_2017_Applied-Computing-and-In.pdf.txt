With the evolution of mobile technologies and its applications, more and more government agencies areputting forth a huge effort to encourage citizens to use mobile government services. Hence, the citizens’opinion is important to enhance the services and improve their engagement in the government services.Hence, this study has critically reviewed and explored the existing technology acceptance models andtheories in order to develop an evaluation framework. The proposed framework is empirically testedby structural equation modeling using data collected from a structured questionnaire. Furthermore,the validated research model contains important variables to ensure the acceptance of mobile services.We hope that the implications of this study will help the public organizations and governments to gainmore understanding about what drives the development and acceptance of mobile government services./C2112017 The Authors.

1. IntroductionThrough the rapid growth of information technology and thedemand for effective and efﬁcient government services, the gov-ernments have adopted e-governments to provide online servicesand more information to citizens, businesses, government agenciesand others[1,2]. Thus, one of the most popular technology is themobile technology which is signiﬁcantly changing communication,learning activities and most importantly changing human–com-puter interaction[3]. Mobile government is an important case forthe citizens because it has the potential to facilitate the citizenslife; by making the government services available on the mobilephone instead of them using the traditional way of visiting the gov-ernment agency and ofﬁces to ﬁll the forms, request information orapply for a service which requires a lot of efforts and more time tobe wasted traveling to the agency location. Making the govern-ment services available on phone and accessible anywhere andanytime, saves effort of traveling physically to the governmentagency. It’s just the future of every service in our daily life.Mobile government helps to enhance the citizen’s accessibilityto online services and facilitates the traditional ways of tasks per-forming by the government agencies. For instance, citizens usingmobile government can respond ﬁrst to instant information abouttrafﬁc accidents. Police or agency inspectors can use Smartphoneor PDA to submit report or data back to home ofﬁces while theyare still in the accident’s location [4]. In addition, governments can use the mobile services to provide emergency-related informa-tion (about homeland security, wildﬁres, natural disasters) to citi-zens[1].The use of mobile technology is rapidly increasing in our lifenowadays. In 2015, the number of mobile users increased rapidlyin the working places. For example, nowadays 64% of the employ-ees are using Smartphone’s in their work [5]. Mobile government can make the government services available and accessible any-where and anytime, and almost to anyone. Further, aside fromthe new technology evolution that takes a place to facilitate mobilegovernment, several cultural and organizational changes are alsoneeded[6]. This requires willingness and ﬂexibility to change thegovernmental ﬁeld accordingly[7]. One of the critical success fac-tors of mobile government is the user acceptance [8]. This study aims to measure the users’ acceptance of mobile governments byinvestigating the important factors that play a main role in the cit-izen’s perspective.2.

provided system or application. In the ﬁeld of user behavior, thereare two models that have been used popularly namely: TechnologyAcceptance Model (TAM)[9]and the Uniﬁed Theory of Acceptanceand Use of Technology (UTAUT)[10].Different researchers consider different factors to measureusers’ acceptance. For example, in terms of e-banking, someresearchers claimed that perceived ease of use, perceived useful-ness, privacy and security are the most signiﬁcant variables thatmight inﬂuence users’ adoption of the new services [11]. Mean- while, Lee et al. (2002) argue that self-efﬁcacy and social inﬂuencefactors signiﬁcantly inﬂuence perceived ease of use and perceivedusefulness of using mobile Internet [12]. Consequently, there are several variables that appear in different theories and modelswhich are highly similar to the factors used in the technologyacceptance model[13]. In the next section, we are going todescribe the factors used in this study to examine the citizens’acceptance of mobile government. In the following subsections,we are going to discuss the model factors and hypotheses whichhave been adopted by previous researches and the mainapproaches in the ﬁeld of user acceptance.2.1. Social Inﬂuence (SI)The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and the Theory of PlannedBehavior (TPB) indicate that social inﬂuence (SI) is an importantfactor that determines technology usage and acceptance. SI seemsto be more signiﬁcant in the earlier phases rather than the laterphases, to motivate the social and to study the culture needs beforeproviding new technologies; will increase the usage and the accep-tance of such technologies[14]. Consequently, the followinghypotheses are proposed:H1a.Social inﬂuence will have a positive effect on behavioralintention to use mobile government services.H1b.Social inﬂuence will have a positive effect on usage behaviorof mobile government services.2.2. Cost of Service (CS)To ensure the user acceptance of the price of service providedby mobile government compared to normal ofﬁce services; theuser beneﬁts should be promoted and clariﬁed, speciﬁcally whenwe propose new services to the market. Also, its value must bein reasonable prices in order to allow users to use such new ser-vices[15]. The cost of service might affect user’s access to the gov-ernment services and information either positively or negatively.Also, the cost of services must reﬂect the value of the speciﬁcservices.H2.Cost of services will have a negative effect on behaviouralintention to use mobile government services.2.3. Perceived Trust in Technology (PTT)PTT plays a vital role in reducing perceived risks of using newtechnologies, especially for transactions involving uncertainty.Since the adoption of mobile government is still in the early stagein some countries, the users are not clear about the technical capa-bility of their service provider to provide m-service and about thesecurity and reliability of the provided services [16]. Citizens’ adoption behavior, preferences and requirements might beaffected by cross-cultural characteristics. The mobile governmentadoption behavior should be analyzed focusing on cultural differ-ences[17].H3.Perceived trust in technology will have a positive effect onbehavioral intention to use mobile government services.2.4. Perceived Usefulness (PU)PU focused on the importance of the provided information. Itsconcerns are on how meaningful, informative, relevant, important,signiﬁcant and helpful is the information or services for user’s deci-sion[18,19]. It is more about the beneﬁt that user can earn fromusing speciﬁc service or application. Hence, the following hypoth-esis is proposed:H4.Perceived usefulness will have a positive effect on behavioralintention to use mobile government services.2.5. Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU)PEOU is common factor employed widely in the investigation ofthe acceptance of new proposed technology [20]. In past studies’ results, PEOU has an indirect effect on behavioural intention touse new technologies and a direct effect on attitude toward usingtechnology[19–21]. PEOU represents the user friendly, the ease of
using services and the error free usage. Thus, the following hypoth-esis is proposed:H5.Perceived ease of use will have a positive effect on perceivedusefulness of mobile government services.2.6. Behavioral Intention (BI)BI is a major factor aims to predict the user intention to usingthe new technology again. This predictor assumes that behaviouralintention will have a positive effect on attitude toward using theproposed technology[22]. A user’s intention to use the mobile gov-ernment service is related to real usage of the services [14,23]. The user’s intention commonly is represent the user’s loyalty which isdepends on several factors such as social inﬂuence, perceived trustand ease of use. Accordingly, the following hypothesis is proposed(seeFig. 1):H6.Behavioral intention will have signiﬁcant effects on the usagebehavior of using mobile government services.3. Research methodThe research method explains a few aspects about the data col-lected for this study and the sample proﬁle. In the next section, weare going to discuss the data collection method.3.1. Data collectionYoung citizens are the important target of this study due totheir familiarity with the new technology of mobile devices andwireless technology. This study adopted a set of questionnaireraised by past research and studies, as well as concerns mentionedin the literature related to this study [14,24–26]. The survey items are measured using 5 point-Likert-scales ranging from stronglydisagree to strongly agree.The data collection for this study started in February 2016 in thecity of Dammam in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. The dataI. Almarashdeh, M.K. Alsmadi / Applied Computing and Informatics 13 (2017) 194–199 195were collected randomly from 468 citizens who have used, or haveinterest in using, mobile government. The researcher then con-ducted reliability tests for each construct to assess the goodnessof measure, and indicate accuracy in measurement. The question-naire consisted of 7 sections. The ﬁrst section collected the demo-graphic data while the next sections elicited information about thefactors used in the research model (Questionnaire items are pro-vided in theappendix).3.2. Sample proﬁleAs shown on the result of the data of the demographic distribu-tion, 44% were males and 56% of the respondents were femalesdemonstrating the sufﬁciency of the variety of responses in gener-alizing the results in both genders. Furthermore, the participants ofthis study include a variety of age level from 18 to above 65 yearsold.Table 1shows that most of the respondents (72%) were in theage level of 18–34 years old. This indicates that this group of peo-ple represents the major ages of this study.Fig. 2explains how the citizens get information about the newservices provided by the local governments. The results show that25% of the citizens get information about the new services from theinternet source, 22% from television and 20% from the newspaper.On the other hand, the lowest notiﬁcation comes from magazine(11%), word of mouth (10%), radio (10%) and SMS messages (2%),respectively. Even though SMS nowadays is more popular as aneasy way to reach the citizens, still it’s rarely used to notify citizensabout new services.4. Data analysisAMOS is the most widely used Structural Equation Modeling(SEM) to validate the structured data. AMOS version 18.0 was usedin this study to analyze the hypotheses generated. We conducted 2types of analysis; the ﬁrst was the analysis of the measurementmodel while the second was the analysis on the structural modelas recommended by the literature[27].4.1. Measurement modelThe total reliability test of the 28 items (the questionnaire itemsavailable in theappendix) used in this study is 0.902. According toHair et al. (2010), the reliability of 0.70 or above is considered to beacceptable data structured[28]. Hence, as can be seen fromTable 2,H1 a

Alsmadi / Applied Computing and Informatics 13 (2017) 194–199the reliability test shows values above 0.70 for all constructs whichshows well-structured data.Table 2shows the mean value and the reliability test for all items and constructs (every construct con-tains 3 items minimum) used in this study.4.2. The structural modelUsing the SEM analysis technique provides the researchers withdifferent methods of analysis such as conﬁrmatory factor analysis,latent variable analysis, path analysis, linear structural relationanalysis and covariance structure analysis [27]. Therefore, SEM is the best for analyzing the strength of casual relationship of theconstructs.Table 3below summarizes the ﬁt indices used toobserve the structural model as recommended by the previousstudies[29].The result inTable 3shows that all measures are above the rec-ommended values which indicate a good model ﬁt. The model inFig. 3below shows the regression test of the model hypothesiswhich indicates that the stringer effect on citizens’ behavioralintention to use mobile government services is the social inﬂuence(SI) with value of 0.34, followed by perceived trust in technology(0.28) which indicates a very strong effect on citizens’ intentionto use mobile government services. The paths analysis shows thatall model hypotheses are supported and have signiﬁcant affect atthe 0.01 level.5. DiscussionMeasuring user acceptance of the provided services is not aquestion that we can easily answer but it’s a variable that playsan important role in the user decision which needs to be examined.These variables could be money or social or it could be the serviceitself, e.g. the service is not important, not useful, not easy tounderstand or use. Social Inﬂuence (SI) commonly plays an impor-tant role in inﬂuencing the individual’s behavior of accepting newtechnologies. SI is one of the important variables that have a largeshare among technology adoption studies. Social factors or culturereﬂections heavily inﬂuence individuals who may or may notaccept the new technology based on their beliefs and social back-ground[30].The result from the path analysis shows that among all inde-pendent variables, social inﬂuence has the strongest effect on citi-zen’s intention to use mobile government (C.R = 0.34). It alsoaffects the actual use behavior of the mobile government withregression value of 0.28. Those results give the social inﬂuence fac-tor the ﬁrst priority among the factors that might affect user accep-tance of mobile government. The second priority is given toperceived trust in technology, which affects user intention signiﬁ-cantly in regression value of 0.30. In contrast, the cost of services isnegatively affecting the citizen’s intention to use mobile govern-ment. The value of/C00.18 indicates that, if the cost of servicesdecreases that means the citizens intention will increase.According to the results, perceived usefulness has a signiﬁcantinﬂuence on user intention to use mobile governments(C.R = 0.17). Also, the ﬁndings conﬁrmed that perceived ease ofuse has signiﬁcant effect on behavioral intention (C.R = 0.18) whichis in line with TAM’s results in previous studies. Thus, the ﬁndingsindicate that behavioral intention to use mobile governmentservices is affecting the actual usage behavior (C.R = 0.20). Theseresults are in accordance with AlAwadhi and Morries (2009),TAM and UTAUT studies[21,31,32]. These results are contrary towhat Liu et al. (2014) who stated that future research should becautious when using TAM and perceived usefulness to interpretthe service adoption in mobile government context [33]. The path analysis indicates that all independent factors havesigniﬁcant positive correlation. Among those factors, the largestcorrelation is between social inﬂuence and perceived trust (0.66).This indication shows that trust can change the society to usemobile government more and if the trust of technology goes lower,the social inﬂuence will go low too and that will affect the citizen’sintention to use mobile government negatively. Also, cost ofservice is correlated positively with social inﬂuence (0.63). Thislarge correlation shows that if the cost of service is cheap thesociety will talk about it more and the intention to use mobilegovernment will be higher.The implications of this study are directed to implementers anddevelopers or governments. These bodies need to guarantee theusefulness, the ease of using mobile government and the securedtrusted technology with lower cost of accessibility. Those factorswill enhance the actual users’ use of mobile government and willattract the citizen’s intention to use mobile government. That willenhance the government’s performance and save the cost and timeof both citizens and organizations. Gaining the citizens trust is thekey that motivate the society to use and talk about the mobile gov-ernment and that will increase the intention to use.This study contributes to the previous studies by analyzing theeffect of social inﬂuence, perceived usefulness, cost of service,Table 2Measurement model values.

At the same time, this effect has beeninﬂuenced indirectly by the correlations between those indepen-dent variables which inﬂuenced the total effect on behavioralintention to use mobile government, and the usage behavior. Inour future research, we are going to study the mediated factorsthat might affect the citizens’ acceptance of mobile government.6. ConclusionThis study has critically reviewed and explored the existingtechnology acceptance models and theories. The related impor-tant factors of the existing technology acceptance models are dis-cussed in view of developing mobile government services andthen integrated into the proposed research model in order tomeasure the user’s acceptance of mobile government services.The proposed model attempts to measure the acceptance ofmobile government among citizens using SEM AMOS18 to testthe research hypotheses. The results of this research show thatindependent variables (perceived usefulness, social inﬂuence, costof service, perceived ease of use and perceived trust) has signiﬁ-cant direct effect on the citizens’ behavioral intention to usemobile government and indirect effect on the actual use behavior.Among all those affects, social inﬂuence has the strongest effecton the user’s intention to use mobile government. These implica-tions indicate that perceived trust in technology is the key forgaining the social intention to use mobile government services.Furthermore, we hope that the implications of this study will helpthe public organizations and governments to gain more under-standing about what drives the development and acceptance ofmobile government services. Since this research is limited to afew factors, we believe that measuring the effect of perceived riskin the user acceptance of mobile services will bring valid resultfor the future research.Appendix A.
