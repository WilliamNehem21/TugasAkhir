Abstract 
Metal intermetallic laminated (MIL) composites are fabricated upon reaction sintering of titanium and aluminum foils of various thicknesses. The intermetallic phase of Al
3Ti forming during the above processing gives high hardness and stiffness to the composite, while unreacted titanium provides the necessary high strength and ductility. Some results of studies of microstructure and some mechanical properties of  layered composites are presented on the example of Ti-Al system. Static and dynamic tests results are discussed for th e case when the intermetallic reaction was interrupted in the course of intermetallic sintering and also for the case when it was completed.

 air reaction sintering of chemically active metal foils und er pressure [1]. The work results [2] show that the main factor enhancing toughness of a composite material is layered morphology; fiber and particle morphology comes next. The advantages of layered composite materials are not limited to high values of strength and stiffness of intermetallic phase and high toughness of the metal constituent. Geometry of the layered structure allows, by changing the ratio between thicknesses of metallic and intermetallic constituents, achieving desired levels of the composite material mech anical properties. Required ratio between thicknesses in a layered metal-intermetallic composite is, in its turn, ensured by such selection of thicknesses of initial metal foils when one of the components would be completely consumed for forming the intermetallic. The remaining volume of the second component would be responsible for ductility and toughness of the composite metal component. The purpose of this paper is to present the part of our results obtained in investigating the structure and mechanical properties of metal
intermetallic laminated composites in Ti-Al system synthesized both under interrupted [3] and completed intermetallic reaction conditions. 2. Experimental To fabricate metal
intermetallic laminated composites, we used commercial titanium (wt % 99.3 Ti, 0.16 Fe, 0.08 Si, 0.05 C, 0.10 O) and aluminum (98.2 Al, 0.8 Fe, 0.5 Si, 0.1 Cu, 0.1 Zn, 0.1 Mn) foils with different thickness. Before sintering titanium foils were etched in (87% HNO
3+10% HF+3% H 2O) solution. Aluminum foils also were etched in 20% NaOH solution. All the foils then were water flushed, and dried before assembling. The above procedures are needed to remove surface contaminations and oxide films. Unfortunately very thin oxide films stay on the surface in any way. An assembly of alternating foil layers was subjected to open air sintering under controlled heat and pressure loading (Fig.1). Initial thicknesses of metal foils as well as layers quantity are summarized in Table 1.

 Compression tests for (20 × 20 × 10) mm and (30 × 10 × 10) specimens were performed at a load applied both along and across composite layers on a universal FP-100/1 testing machine at a testing speed of 2 mm/min. To evaluate the structure of composites, we used scanning (Quanta FEI equipped with a microanalyzer) electron microscopes. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis  of phase composition was performed with a DRON-3 diffractometer using monochromatized CuK
 radiation. The microhardness was measured on a PMT-3 microhardness tester at a load of 0.5 N.  Impact bending tests were carried out at room temp erature on V-notched specimens (10 × 10 × 55) mm using a Tinius Olsen IT 542 (United States) instrumented pendulum impact testing machine. The maximum stored energy of the machine was 542 J, and the impact speed was 5.47 m/s. Two types of specimens were prepared: specimens with the crack arrester and crack divider orientation.

 propagation were determined from load displacement impact loading diagrams using a special purpose software package. 3. Results and Discussions In the process of solid diffusion of components at in terfaces the clusters of intermetallic phase are nucleate and grow in. Titanium oxides at a temperature 873 K may be reduced by aluminum according to reactions (1, 2): 
2O3 + 3Ti                                                                             (1) 3TiO
2 2O3 + 3Ti                                                                          (2) 
Such local perforation of the surface layer of titani um oxides [4] may take place, followed by formation and growth of Al
3Ti in the same place. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals the shape of titanium tri-aluminide clusters and their spatial distribution at the interfa ce of the initial metals. As can be observed from

Fig.2 grain size of Al 3Ti from aluminum side is much smaller then for titanium side. When temperature approaches the melting point of aluminum and a thin layer of aluminum melt appears, the reaction rate increases rapidly and formation of a tri-aluminide layer is controlled by the exothermic reaction (3): 
3Al + Ti  Al 3Ti + Q                                                                                        (3) 
Presentation of strength properties for layered composites  is discussed for only two cases. First case we have when the reaction is interrupted (Fig. 3a - in terrupted reaction structure) and sintered composite has about 15-17% of intermetallic together with the rest of unconsumed aluminum and residual titanium. Second case we have when the reaction is completed (Fig. 3b  - complete reaction structure) and for our choice of initial foil thickness relation MIL - composite has 15-17% of residual titanium and 83-85% of Al
3Ti phase. 110   Patselov A. et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   3  ( 2012 )  107 – 112

XRD data demonstrate that the laminated composite samples fabricated by interrupting an intermetallic reaction in sintering contain the 
 phases of titanium and aluminum, the Al 3Ti phase with space group D0 22, and a certain amount of oxide Al
2O3 at the centreline of aluminum. After completion of the intermetallic reaction, X-ray diffraction patterns have no aluminu m lines, which indicate that it was fully consumed in sintering. Results of microhardness measurements for laminated composites showed that titanium microhardness is 1750-1860 MPa while tri-aluminide microhardness is about 5000 MPa. The results for static load indicated that the MIL co mposites exhibited anisotropic features both for mechanical properties and fracture behavior. It should  be noted a significant difference in mechanical properties determined by static compression for the lo ad application directions along and across the layers (see Table 2). For example, proportional limit differ by a factor of about 1.5 and the shortening at a peak load differ by a factor of 7. A pronounced anisotropic character of the mechanical properties is also observed during impact bending tests. It is established that the impact strength and total energy of fracture, depend strongly on the orientation of the notch. For the sa mples with arrester orientation, the crack propagation energy is higher than that in the case of divider orientation samples by a factor of about 4 (see Table 2). That is, the anisotropy of composite structure is clearly evident in its mechanical properties both under static and dynamic loading.

 As for the second case when we have MIL - composite after completed reaction with 85% of intermetallic fraction anisotropy of mechanical properties does not obse rved in such a way like for above first case. For example, according to static compression tests ductility pr esented here by shortening at peak load practically the same for both load directions (see Table 3).

 Load
displacement impact loading diagrams are also indica ting to the high energetic intensity of the crack passing process through the composite layers. Presence of load oscillations before its maximum points to additional absorption of impact energy when a deflection of  crack by interface of layers is occurred. In spite of different character of fracture behavior for crack arrester (Fig. 4a) and crack divider (Fig. 4b) oriented samples visible on load-displacement impact loadin g diagrams (Fig. 4b, 5b) there is no significant discrepancy in dynamic strength values.

  According to the results of dynamic loading (see Table 3) there is no such apparent anisotropy of properties for MIL composites with high volume fraction of aluminide.
