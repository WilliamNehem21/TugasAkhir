KEYWORDSData store update;Ontology;Knowledge base;Seafood;QualityAbstractEnsuring the quality of food, particularly seafood has increasingly become an importantissue nowadays. Quality Management Systems empower any organization to identify, measure,control and improve the quality of the products manufactured that will eventually lead to improvedbusiness performance. With the advent of new technologies, now intelligent systems are being devel-oped. To ensure the quality of seafood, an ontology based seafood quality analyzer and miner(ONTO SQAM) model is proposed. The knowledge is represented using ontology. The domainconcepts are deﬁned using ontology. This paper presents the initial part of the proposed model –the analysis of quality test parameter values. Two algorithms are proposed to do the analysis –Comparison Algorithm and Data Store Updater algorithm. The algorithms ensure that the valuesof various quality tests are in the acceptable range. The real data sets taken from different seafoodcompanies in Kerala, India, and validated by the Marine Product Export Development Authorityof India (MPEDA) are used for the experiments. The performance of the algorithms is evaluatedusing standard performance metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy. The results obtainedshow that all the three measures achieved good results.

1. IntroductionIn seafood processing industries, control measures are adoptedto ensure the safety and quality of products. Various qualityassurance standards exist to guarantee the safety and qualityof goods. Some of them are International Organization forStandardization (ISO), Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point(HACCP), Quality Management Program (QMP), TotalQuality Management (TQM), etc.[3].

So the authorproposed ONTO SQAM, a knowledge-based model to ensurethe quality of the seafood.Knowledge-Based Systems are expert systems that utilizeArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) techniques to generate knowledgefrom the data, analyze the data and convert it into meaningfulinformation, thereby acting as a human expert. Ontologiespropose an efﬁcient knowledge representation technique inArtiﬁcial Intelligence systems. Ontologies provide sound rea-soning systems. The deﬁnition of ontology follows as a ‘‘ for- mal, explicit speciﬁcation of a shared conceptualization ”[1]. Ontologies were developed in AI to facilitate knowledge shar-ing and reuse[2]. Ontologies provide a formal semantics forthe description of many concepts involved in the domain andrelations between these concepts[6]. The knowledge base ofthe proposed model contains information about the seafood,details of the test parameters, values, etc. It is implementedusing different ontologies. The ontologies analyze the qualitytest results, and a better, and detailed quality report is gener-ated automatically by the system.Every seafood organization is conducting organoleptic,microbiological, and chemical checks at all stages of seafoodproduction. The standard values are used to compare theresults of all the above tests, and the management takesappropriate measures when the quality is found to be poor.Currently, the companies do these procedures manually.But there is a possibility that sometimes the test valuesobtained will not be in the acceptable range. It happens dueto several reasons such as test equipment failure, insufﬁcientincubation and input errors. Currently, in the seafood indus-try, no electronic checks are done to ﬁgure out these types ofmistakes that can happen at the initial stage. Also, thelaboratory technologist is not comparing the test value withthe values obtained in the past for similar trials. So in theproposed model, two algorithms are suggested to do theinitial analysis of quality test parameter values. The aim ofthis is to understand about any errors or quality issues atthe beginning stage itself. A comparison algorithm is pro-posed to ensure the validity of the test procedures and theaccuracy of the values obtained. Data store update algorithmupdates the data store with a minimum acceptable value andmaximum value for each test. If there is a signiﬁcant differ-ence between the values currently generated and the previousvalues, the system alerts the technologists to check the testprocedure or to repeat the tests again. In the proposedONTO SQAM model, different algorithms are proposed foranalysis, mining, and prediction of data. This paper presentsonly the initial part of the proposed model – the analysis ofquality test parameter values.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2com- prises of the materials and methods. The section describes thedesign of ontologies, analysis of quality test parameter values,and the proposed algorithms. Section3includes results anddiscussions. It illustrates the data sets used, the performanceof the algorithms on the selected data sets and the values ofperformance metrics. Section4presents the conclusion whichis followed by references.2. Materials and methods2.1. Knowledge modeling - design of ontologiesOntologies deﬁne the semantics of the concepts identiﬁed in adomain. There is no single method to develop an ontology.This research follows the approach proposed by Noy andMcGuinness in the development of ontologies [4]. Many inter- esting ontologies are available on the web in different domains,particularly in the medical domain. Such ontologies enableinformation sharing, and other applications reuse them. Butin seafood domain, no relevant ontologies exist. So the ontolo-gies used in the proposed model are developed from scratch.The proposed ONTO-SQAM model comprises of threeontologies: theSeafoodontology,Test Speciﬁcationsontology, andSeafood IntegratedOntology.Fig. 1presents the taxon-omy ofSeafoodontology.The parent classes inSeafoodontology are the central con-cepts in the domain such as product types, ﬁsh categories,country of export and type of tests.Country, Fish, Product,Test, etc., are the main classes of the ontology. Each of thesemain classes consists of different subclasses according to theirtypes. The main ﬁsh categories included in the ontology areBony Fish, Cephalopods, Crustaceans, Molluscs, and Scombridae. The various seafood under each category is theinstances of the particular class. For example, the instancesofCephalopodsare
Cuttleﬁsh, Octopus, Squid, etc.Fig. 2shows Cephalopodsclass and its individuals (instances).Similarly, theTestsubclass consists of subclassessuch aschemical,microbiologicalandorganoleptic. Each of these classes, in turn, consists of further subclasses as giveninFig. 1.
Figure 1Taxonomy of seafood ontology.Algorithms to analyze the quality test parameter values of seafood 141Fig. 3shows the taxonomy ofTest SpeciﬁcationsOntology. It contains the test standards of seafood and sanitation itemssuch as water, ice and salt used during the seafood processing.Quality Checking tests are of two types – Internal Test andExternal Test. The speciﬁcations are different for internal testsand external tests.External-TestandInternal-Testare the two sub-classes of theTest-Speciﬁcationontology. Under each ofthese classes, we have subclasses to represent sanitation itemand seafood item.Internal-Test-Non-FoodandInternal- Test-Seafoodare the two subclasses ofInternal-Test class. Test-Spec-Raw-AllCountriesandTest-Spec-Uncooked-Frozenare the two primary classes ofInternal-Test-Seafoodclass. For each category of raw seafood, the test speciﬁcationsare independent of the country of export. So the ﬁve subclassesofTest-Spec-Raw-AllCountriesrepresent the test speciﬁcationsof ﬁve categories of seafood included inSeafoodontology. Butin the case of frozen seafood, each country of export has itsstandards for speciﬁc seafood. So a subclass is deﬁned for eachcountry under the classTest-Spec-UncookedFrozenand for each of those classes, subclasses are deﬁned to include the teststandards of particular seafood.Seafood IntegratedOntology is a storehouse of each pro-duct test ﬁle with the corresponding test report. This ontologyis used by the proposed Data Store Update algorithm toupdate the test values as explained in the later sections.2.2. Analysis of quality test parameter values – proposed modelFig. 4shows the proposed model to analyze the test parametervalues. Initially, the laboratory technologist conducts tests(organoleptic, microbiological and chemical) as usual, andthe sample results are input to the proposed model. The modelgenerates a product test ﬁle (owlﬁle) that contains the testparameters and the results of each sample. It produces a newﬁle for each test sample, which contains the test parametersand the obtained parameter values.Before checking the values with the test standards stored intheTest Speciﬁcationsontology, the comparison algorithm(Analysis I) analyzes the parameter values. This checking doesensure that the obtained values are in the acceptable range.Data store update algorithm updates the acceptable valuesfor a particular test in the data store. The permitted valuefor each test item is computed by the data store update algo-rithm using ontology data andTest Speciﬁcationsontology. These values are stored in the Data Store, making it availablefor fast retrieval. The comparison algorithm compares the cur-rent test values with the values retrieved from the data store. Ifthe values are not in the permissible range, the laboratory tech-nologists provide necessary alerts.If the values are in the acceptable range, the product test ﬁleis validated (Analysis II) as per the speciﬁcations stored in theTest Speciﬁcationsontology.Table 1shows the microbiologi-cal, organoleptic and antibiotic test parameters with their stan-dards to check the quality of molluscs raw material.The test quality standards for validation are implementedusing Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) [7].Fig. 5shows the rule in SWRL to validate the Molluscs. The microbiologi-cal tests check the presence of ‘TPC’, ‘Vibrio Cholera’,‘Vibrio-Parahaemolyticus’, ‘E-Coli’ and ‘Staphylococcus-Aureus’ in molluscs. Organoleptic factors are ten in number, listedfrom 6 through 15 inTable 1. Paralytic shellﬁsh poisoning(PSP) and Diarrhetic Shellﬁsh Poisoning (DSP) are two majorbiotoxins associated with shellﬁshes such as clams, mussels andoysters. These 19 parameters determine the overall quality ofthe raw material. The technologist compares the valuesobtained with the tolerance limit. The acceptance/rejection of

This report tells the acceptance status of thetest input sample.2.3. Proposed algorithms to analyze the test parameter valuesTheTest Speciﬁcationsontology stores the microbiological,chemical and organoleptic test standards (min_valueandmax_- value). So these test standards are available only during theAnalysis phase. Also due to scalability issues of ontology, itis time-consuming to every time retrieve the test standardsdirectly from the ontology. So a data store update algorithmis proposed to compute the permitted value for each test item.The above algorithm stores the updated min_valueand max_valueof each test in the data store, making it availablefor fast retrieval. When the laboratory technologist inputs thevalue, a comparison algorithm retrieves the permitted rangeof the concerned test from the data store. The comparisonalgorithm checks whether the value entered by the user is withinthe allowable range, by comparing the test input value withmin_valueandmax_valueavailable in the data store.2.3.1. Data store update algorithmTable 2shows the proposed Data Store Update algorithm. Thepurpose of this algorithm is to update the data store with anacceptable minimum and maximum value for each test. In thebeginning, the algorithm retrieves the corresponding past testvalues from the ontology. Then the algorithm removes theduplicates and sorts the values. The next step is to set aminimum value and a maximum value. The Test Speciﬁcationsontology outputs the standard test limits ( minandmax) of the concerned test. The algorithm compares the minimum of thepast test values with the standard minimum limit retrieved fromthe ontology and accordingly sets themin_value. Similarly, it sets themax_value. The algorithm also computes the varianceof the test values. In the end, it updates the computed valuesmin_value,max_value, and thevariancein the data store. Thisalgorithm is executed periodically as per the system settingsso that the data store contains the updated values.2.3.2. Comparison algorithmTable 3shows the proposed comparison algorithm. The pur-pose of this algorithm is to ensure the validity of the test pro-cedures and the accuracy of the values obtained. So thiscomparison is not made with the standard limits of the test.Instead, the comparison algorithm checks the test values withthe values in the data store. The algorithm retrieves themin_valueandmax_valueof the current test from the datastore and compares with thecurrent_value. If thecurrent_value is within the permissible range, it means that the values areknown. Otherwise, the algorithm checks the range of variationof the test values from the data store values. For this, it com-putes the range and standard deviation. The algorithmretrieves the variance stored in the data store and calculatesthe standard deviation. Next step is to identify the severityof the error. If thecurrent
_valueis lesser than themin_value, the algorithm checks whether it is also smaller thanmin_value/C0std_dev. If so, the algorithm concludes that theoutput is at the acceptable level. Otherwise, if the current_value

If both the aboveconditions are false, it means that thecurrent_valueis not acceptable, and the algorithm generates the concerned alerts.Correspondingly the technologists can check the test valuesor can repeat the test. Similarly, if thecurrent_valueis greater than themax_value, the algorithm checks further as mentionedabove and generates concerned alerts. Once we have a largenumber of test values and their reports in the data store, thecomparison algorithm gets a collection of test values so thatit can set themin_valueandmax_value. So the accuracy ofthe comparison algorithm is increased as more data accumu-late in the data store.3. Results and discussion3.1. DatasetsThe data sets used are taken from different seafood companiesin Kerala, India, which exports seafood and seafood productsto all around the world. The Marine Product Export Develop-ment Authority of India (MPEDA) validated the data sets.The data sets consist of details of seafood purchased from var-ious landing centers. It includes the purchase date, seafoodtype, landing center code, quantity, importer details, microbi-ological, chemical, organoleptic test details and details of sea-food exports to different countries. The experiment used threedatasets of seafood families namely, Bony Fish, Cephalopods,and Molluscs. Each family includes different types of seafood,and each group contains valid and invalid data.Table 4presents the statistics of the data sets.3.2. Performance metricsThe performance of the proposed comparison algorithm isevaluated using the statistical measures such as Precision,Recall, and Accuracy[5].Precision is the ratio of the number of valid samples cor-rectly retrieved to the total number of samples extracted asvalid.Precision¼

The tables below present the results. It shows the observedresults and the predicted ones along with the performance met-rics (seeTables 5–7).For Bony Fish dataset, the algorithm identiﬁed 37 test sam-ples correctly as true positives and ten samples as true nega-tives. It wrongly lists two valid test samples as havingproblems in the test values. The algorithm incorrectly outputsthree invalid test samples as within the allowable limit.For Cephalopods data set, the algorithm correctly listed 74test samples and 12 test samples as true positives and true neg-atives respectively. It wrongly classiﬁed two positive test sam-ples as negative, and ﬁve negative test samples as positive.For Molluscs data set, the algorithm correctly outputs 15test samples as known values. The algorithm correctly recog-nized 3 test samples as ‘probable error’ or ‘unacceptable value’.One sample whose test value was in the acceptable range wasoutput wrongly as ‘probable error’. The number of sampleswhose test values were outside the range identiﬁed as ‘knownvalue’ is 2.3.3.

The Data StoreUpdate algorithm updates the acceptable minimum andmaximum value of a test in the data store. The Comparisonalgorithm compares the new test values with these updated val-ues to ensure that the test values are in the acceptable range.Later, the actual comparison of the test values with the teststandards stored in the ontology is performed. The perfor-mance metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy are usedto evaluate the performance of the model. The experimentalresults obtained on the datasets show that all the threemeasures achieved good results.FundingThis research did not receive any speciﬁc grant from fundingagencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-proﬁt sectors.References[1]Ying Ding, Schubert Foo, Ontology research and development.Part 2-a review of ontology mapping and evolving, J.
