Despite the burgeoning  development  of artiÔ¨Åcial  intelligence  (AI) applied in the medical Ô¨Åeld, there have been 
little bibliometric  and collaboration  network  researches  on the patents related to this inter-disciplinary  research  
domain.  Patentometric  and Social Network  Analysis  (SNA) are used to conduct  the characterizations  of patent 
applications  and cooperative  networks,  mapping  a holistic landscape  related to the AI-medical  Ô¨Åeld. Derwent  
Innovation  Index database  (DII) is adopted  as the patent data source. The results indicate  that the quantity  of 
AI-medical-related  patent applications  has been increasing  explosively  since 2011. The United States of Amer- 
ica (US) is both the foremost  country developing  related technologies  and the primary  target of patent Ô¨Åling by 
non-residents.  The hotspot of the current research  include medical image recognition,  computer-aided  diagnosis,  
disease monitoring,  disease prediction,  bioinformatics,  and drug development,  etc. Low density of the assignees  
cooperation  network  implies the slight patent collaboration.  Companies  and academic  institutions  are the friski- 
est innovation  subjects  in the AI-medical  Ô¨Åeld. The geographical  proximity  has a positive inÔ¨Çuence  on the patent 
collaboration  because co-owned  patents are concentrated  on the institutes  in the same nation. Domestic  collabo-  
ration is the major collaborative  pattern. The spatial agglomeration  of trans-regional  patent cooperation  is fairly 
sparse, which requires  a further escalation  in knowledge  circulation.  It has practical  signiÔ¨Åcance  to understand  
the developing  situation  and patent cooperation  network  in the AI-medical  Ô¨Åeld, providing  a reference  for future 
strategy  planning,  development,  and technological  marketization.  
1. Introduction  
In recent ten years, ArtiÔ¨Åcial  Intelligence  (AI) techniques  have been 
booming  globally,  due to the accumulation  of big data, innovation  of al- 
gorithms,  and improvement  of the computer  processing  capacity.  AI is 
already  notably  promoting  the major progress  of technology  and indus- 
try, from autonomous  vehicles  to medical  diagnosis  to advanced  manu- 
facturing.  In terms of the life and medical  sciences  Ô¨Åeld, AI techniques  
have broad applications,  for instance,  drug design [ 4 , 10 , 27 ], prediction  
of disease/drug  risk [24] , medical  diagnosis  [ 1 , 30 ], facilitating  detec- 
tion of cancer,  medical  image analysis  [ 23 , 26 , 31 ], genomics,  physio-  
logical parameter  monitoring  [ 2 , 6 ], and so on. These applications  of AI 
techniques  are expected  to change the work pattern  of doctors  and com- 
plement  traditional  medical  tools, availably  enhancing  the accuracy  and 
eÔ¨Éciency  of diagnosis.  
The patent data is regarded  as a unique resource  for the study of 
technological  change [14] . Based on the patentometrics  analysis,  it can 
investigate  the technique  development  trend [ 18 , 45 ]. Meanwhile,  the 
importance  of the collaboration  network  in promoting  knowledge  pro-

collaborations  can facilitate  the improvement  of research  quality,  result- 
ing in more eÔ¨Äective  scientiÔ¨Åc  production  [34] . Many studies are con- 
cerned on the co-author  networks  [33] , co-citation  networks  [20] , co- 
word networks  [39] , international  collaborations  [ 21 , 37 , 38 ], and cross- 
institution  collaborations  [7] , in publications  (e.g. papers and journals),  
which adopt the social network  analysis  (SNA) to study the relation-  
ships involved  in the networks.  However,  to our knowledge,  there is no 
bibliometric  and collaboration  network  analysis  based on patents  in this 
inter-disciplinary  research  Ô¨Åeld. 
Therefore,  the patentometric  is applied  to gain a comprehensive  view 
of the AI-medical  techniques,  and predict the development  trend. The 
patent application  year, technology  life cycle, geographical  distribution,  
and the collaboration  relations  of assignees  are delved deeper into the 
status of technological  development.  SNA is carried out to investigate  
the collaboration  network  formed  between  institutions  that are engaged  
in the AI-medical  Ô¨Åeld. The schematic  diagram  of patent analysis  is ex- 
hibited in Fig. 1 .

2. Method  and data 
2.1. Data collection  and pre-processing  
The patent search strategies  are presented  in Table 1 [43] , which 
consists  of topic search and Derwent  Manual  Code (DMC) search. DMC 
is a hierarchical  system of the DII database  itself, providing  a consider-  
ably detailed  classiÔ¨Åcation  of technical  subjects  and the technical  nov- 
elty of an invention  [44] . According  to the standard  of DMCs, patents  
are divided  into 21 sections  (A to X, except I, O, R), and each section 
is subdivided  into more speciÔ¨Åc  classes.  Section  B (pharmaceuticals)  is 
taken for the patent retrieval,  which includes  15 subdivisions  of the 
codes. 1282 records  from Derwent  Innovation  Index (DII) database  are 
retrieved  and exported  on December  16, 2019. Each record represents  
a patent family, a group of related inventions  Ô¨Åled in one or multiple  patent authorities  [28] . Key elements  of records  include  patent num- 
ber(s), priority  application  information,  DMCs, titles, designated  states, 
application  details,  inventor(s),  assignee(s),  patent details,  IPC classiÔ¨Å-  
cation number,  cited patents,  cited articles.  Each of these patent family 
records  is showed  as a single patent. After manually  removing  dupli- 
cates, 3610 items of single patent information  are acquired  [43] . The 
data of assignees  and patent quantity  information  is cleaned,  grouped,  
and rearranged  in an Excel spreadsheet.  
2.2. Data analysis  
The visualization  software  of Gephi and Tableau  are employed  for 
patent analysis.  The patent cooperation  network  of the AI-medical  Ô¨Åeld 
is carried out by the SNA method,  using Gephi to view the relation-  
ships among network  participants  (assignees).  Gephi is an open-source  
software  based on the Java Virtual Machine  (JVM), which can be used 
for the exploration  of complex  networks.  In the network,  the assignees  
correspond  to the collaborative  relationships,  and the patent quantity  
denotes  the weight given to the link between  assignees.  Each assignee  
is expressed  as a node, and links between  two nodes are regarded  as the 
patent cooperation  relationship.  The structural  features  of the patent 
collaboration  network  are expressed  by the SNA indicators,  such as de- 
gree, density,  and weighted  PageRank.  
The degree of a node is the number  of connections  incident  upon 
it [16] , which is a parameter  to evaluate  the signiÔ¨Åcance  of nodes in a 
network  graph. 
The density  ( D ) of an undirected  network  is the ratio of the actual 
link quantity  to the count of all possible  links within the network,  as 
shown in Eq. (1) [41] . 
D = L

where L and N are the total amount  of links and nodes in a network,  
respectively.  
Weighted  PageRank  is a graph-based  ranking  algorithm  to estimate  
the importance  of the node by measuring  the quantity  and quality of 
links to a node [9] . The amount  of Weighted  PageRank  is calculated  as 
follows:  
PR _ W (P
 i )=
 (1 ‚àí d) w(p) 
‚àëùëÅ 
ùëñ =1 w( p ùëñ ) +d ùëò ‚àë
ùëñ =1 PR( p ùëñ ) 
L( p ùëñ ) (2) 
where W ( P i ) is the weight matrix for the nodes in the network;  d is a 
damping  factor that is set as 0.85 [46] ; L ( P i ) is the amount  of edges that 
is linked to P i . 
3. Results  and discussion  
3.1. Patent life cycle 
Patent information  can be employed  to predict the tendency  of in- 
dustry development,  especially  in terms of market analysis  and competi-  
tion [29] . Patent life cycle, the change of cumulative  patent amount  via 
assignees,  has been used as an S-curve  to predict the technology  devel- 
opment  and life circle stage. Ernst [12] introduced  four diÔ¨Äerent  devel- 
opment  stages of the technology  life cycle: (1) emerging;  (2) growth;  (3) 
maturity;  and (4) saturation.  As depicted  in Fig. 2 , the technology  life cy- 
cle of AI-medical-related  patents  can be segmented  into two phases:  (1) 
Emerging  period (from the year 1972 to 2010), the technology  has expe- 
rienced  approximately  40 years of slow development.  The AI-medical-  
related patents  in the emerging  stage merely occupy 30% of the total. 
(2) Growth  period (from the year 2011 to 2017), the number  of patents  
(assignees)  rise rapidly  in this stage, from 104 (590) in 2011 to 556 
(2433) in 2017. The patents  in 2018 and 2019 are excluded,  as a result 
of the 18-month  conÔ¨Ådentiality  period of patent applications.  
The development  phases of AI-medical-related  patents  are consis- 
tent with the history of AI techniques.  Although  the term ‚ÄúartiÔ¨Åcial  
intelligence  ‚Äù was coined at a Dartmouth  conference  in 1956, it expe- 
rienced  the twists and turns development  progress  over the subsequent  
forty years, commonly  known as ‚ÄúAI summers  and winters  ‚Äù. In 1997, an 
IBM computer  called IBM‚Äôs Deep Blue, defeated  the world chess cham- 
pion in a six-game  match. However,  Deep Blue couldn‚Äôt  do anything  ex- 
cept playing  chess. In 2011, IBM researchers  utilized  the open-domain  
question-answering  (QA) system,  nicknamed  Watson,  to compete  on the

game of Jeopardy!  Eventually,  Watson  prevailed  over the two highest-  
ranked human players  and obtained  the victory.  For general  intelli- 
gence, Watson  hits a symbolic  milestone  because  it can comb through  
electronic  medical  records  and the medical  literature  (e.g. journals),  to 
make a clinical  decision  for human diseases  [ 11 , 36 ]. This promotion  
results in a signiÔ¨Åcant  breakthrough  in AI-medical  technology  develop-  
ment in a short term. After that, numerous  enterprises  or institutions  
initiate  to invest in ‚ÄúArtiÔ¨Åcial  Intelligence  for Healthcare  ‚Äùf r o m 2014, 
leading  to a remarkable  increase  in the patent and assignee  quantities.  
3.2. Geographical  distribution  
The quantity  of AI-related  patents  on the medical  Ô¨Åeld by domestic  
and foreign countries  or regions  is presented  in Fig. 3 . Domestic  patent 
Ô¨Ållings correspond  to the patent applications  that Ô¨Årst Ô¨Åeld in the coun- 
tries or regions;  foreign patent Ô¨Ållings represent  the subsequent  Ô¨Ålings 
(countries  or regions  of second Ô¨Åling). There is an obvious  heterogeneity  
across countries  or regions.  Concerning  the rate of total foreign patent 
Ô¨Åling, the top 5 countries/regions  are in the following  order: Australia  
(96%), Canada  (96%), Israel (96%), Europe (87%), and India (75%). 
The result demonstrates  that these Ô¨Åve countries,  their own national  
Research  and Development  (R&D) in the AI-medical  Ô¨Åeld are of com- 
parative  weakness.  By contrast,  the US has the lowest rate of total for- 
eign patent Ô¨Åling (14%), indicating  its powerful  R&D capability  in the 
AI-medical  Ô¨Åeld. 
Looking  at the number  of total foreign patent Ô¨Ålings, the country  or 
region ranked Ô¨Årst in the AI-medical  Ô¨Åeld is European  with 268 records,  
followed  by Japan (169 records),  China (160 records),  Australia  (143 
records),  and the US (140 records).  These are the most popular  foreign 
patent Ô¨Åling countries  or regions  in the Ô¨Åeld of AI-medical,  standing  for 
the major competitive  markets  in the globe. 
3.3. Productive  assignees  
The top 25 assignees  are demonstrated  in Table 2 , which together  
account  for 23.40%  of all patent applications  in the AI-medical  Ô¨Åeld. As 
shown in Table 2 , companies  are particularly  active, making  up about 
72% of the top 25 holders.  Other patent holders  include  4 universities,  
2 research  institutions,  and an individual.  
There are 18 American  organizations  or individuals  in the ranking,  
of which the leader is the University  of California  ( Table 2 ). France is 
ranked second with 3 organizations  on the list. The other four listed 
assignees  are from Cayman  Islands,  Switzerland,  German,  and Nether-  
lands, respectively.  It is noticed  that the top 25 assignees  are all from 
the developed  countries  and regions.  Cantner  and Rake [5] also report

that the core of the network  about scientiÔ¨Åc  publications  related to phar- 
maceutical  research  is dominated  by high-income  Organization  for Eco- 
nomic Cooperation  and Development  (OECD)  countries.  This may be 
ascribed  to the knowledge-concentrated  characteristic  of the pharma-  
ceutical  industry,  with the highest  investment  R&D intensity  [22] . 
In Table 2 , the University  of California  is the leading  institution  with 
the largest number  of patents  (around  2.19% of total), followed  by the 
Berg Pharma  LLC. and uBiome  Inc. (both with 62 patents).  Innogra-  
phy platform  is conducted  to Ô¨Ålter representative  patents  by the eval- 
uation indicator  of patent strength  [17] . There are 110 items of core 
patents  (patent  strength  ‚â• 90) in the AI-medical  Ô¨Åeld. Table 3 lists the 
core patents  of the top 25 assignees,  and the whole patent information  
can be found in the supplementary  material.  
Most patents  of the University  of California  contain  claims for the uti- 
lization  of biomarker  (e.g. methylation)  in various  cancer,  the method  
for predicting  protein  binding  from primary  structure  data, disease  mon- 
itoring.  The patents  of Berg Pharma  LLC. and uBiome  Inc. are focused  on 
their independently  developed  system and platform.  The former is used 
to analyze  the biological  process  (e.g., disease  condition,  drug-induced  
toxicity  condition);  the latter is for analyzing  a microorganism-related  
condition  (e.g., human behavior  condition,  disease-related  condition,  
etc.). Regarding  the quantities  of partners  and co-owned  patent applica-  
tions, the French public health agent of Assisance  Publique-Hopitaux  de 
Paris (AP-HP)  holds the Ô¨Årst place, of which the patents  contain  claims 
for the biomarkers  combination  for the prognosis  of hepatic  Ô¨Åbrosis  
or Hepatitis  C Virus treatment.  The AP-HP possesses  31 co-ownership  
patents  with 10 co-assignees.  The deeply multilateral  cooperation  of AP- 
HP might be in connection  with its international  strategy  that develops  
larger-scale  cooperation  projects  with other institutions,  for the beneÔ¨Åt 
of global health [3] . 
There are 14 assignees  without  co-ownership  patents,  in the top 25 
assignees.  The Berg Pharma  LLC. (a clinical-stage,  AI-powered  biotech-  
nology company),  uBiome  Inc. (a company  providing  microbiome  test- 
ing services  in the United States),  and NantOmics  LLC. (a molecular  
testing company),  despite being the critical assignees,  they do not have 
any technological  partners  in the AI-medical  Ô¨Åeld. Among  the top 25 
assignees,  Roche Inc., YouHealth  Inc., Cireca Theranostics  LLC., and 
Prometheus  Laboratories  Inc. are the only Ô¨Åve companies  that possess  
co-assigned  patents  with other organizations.  The low patent cooper-  
ation rate of companies  may be attributed  to the potential  knowledge  
leakage  risks accompanied  by collaboration,  although  companies  col- 
laborate  with partners  or co-opetitors  can bring more opportunities  for 
knowledge  acquisition  and generate  technological  breakthroughs  [42] .

Thus, multinational  corporations  (MNCs)  generally  choose to establish  
overseas  subsidiaries  or overseas  R&D laboratories,  to source knowledge  
from the host location  [35] . 
Fig. 4 exhibits  the patent applications  temporal  evolution  of the top 
25 assignees.  It can be seen that the patents  of majority  assignees  have 
been Ô¨Åled mostly since 2011. For Pandya  Ashish A, Intel, and Eastern  
Virginia  Medical  School,  the patent applications  are in the top ranks of 
quantity.  Nevertheless,  the patents  of these assignees  in the AI-medical  
domain  are all Ô¨Åled before 2008, indicating  the lack of subsequent  re- 
searches.  
3.4. Patents cooperation  network  
The collaboration  network  of patent assignees  has been proven to 
evaluate  what positions  organizations  occupy in a special technology  
Ô¨Åeld [ 8 , 25 ]. The SNA method  is conducted  to characterize  the coopera-  
tive network  of AI-medical-related  patents,  using the visualization  tool 
Gephi. Fig. 5 shows the evolution  of patent collaborative  networks  in 
the AI-medical  Ô¨Åeld, the correlative  network  parameters  are listed in 
Table 4 . Each node stands for an assignee,  of which the area has a pos- 
itive correlation  with the total patent quantity  of the relevant  assignee.  
The links represent  the cooperative  relationships  among the AI-medical-  
related patents,  of which the thickness  demonstrates  the collaboration  
strength  between  two assignees,  that is, the quantity  of co-ownership  
patents.  The low density  of the AI-medical-related  patent cooperative  net- 
work ( < 0.01) indicates  the slight collaboration.  The number  of nodes 
and links is increasing,  but the growth  rate of nodes is higher than that 
of links, leading  to a downward  trend of density  in the cooperative  net- 
works. Because  AI technology  in the medical  Ô¨Åeld is still in a rapidly  
developing  stage, and the cooperative  groups are small and unstable.  
To view the cooperative  relation,  Fig. 6 exhibits  the collaboration  
network  with nodes whose degrees  are over one, excluding  the location  
where a node without  connection  to other nodes. The color of nodes is 
related to the category  of assignees.  
Overall,  396 assignees  participate  in the technological  collabora-  
tions, and 185 assignees  occupy more than one external  partner.  The 
inter-organizational  collaboration  network  is involved  in 143 enter- 
prises, 4 government  departments,  12 hospitals,  19 research  institutions,  
66 universities,  and 152 individuals.  The corresponding  main assignees  
are shown in Table 5 . It can be seen that companies  and individuals  take 
the predominant  positions  in the network.  Nevertheless,  there are no ob- 
vious collaboration  clusters  in the collaboration  network,  which may be 
due to the fact that AI-medical-related  technology  is in the continued  
rapid development  stage. 
Table 6 exhibits  the top ten assignees  of AI-medical-related  patents  
with high Degree and Weighted  PageRank.  It is observed  that the AP-HP 
and French National  Institute  of Health and Medical  Research  (INSERM)  
simultaneously  possess  a high Weighted  PageRank  and a high Degree,

The AP-HP also has the most partners  and co-owned  patent applica-  
tions. This French medical  institution  owns 31 cooperation  patents  to- 
gether with 10 co-assignees,  including  two French research  institutions  
(CNRS-Center  National  de la Recherche  ScientiÔ¨Åque,  and INSERM),  Ô¨Åve 
French universities,  two US enterprises  (Ariana  Pharma  Inc., and Bio- 
Rad Inc.), and one U.K. enterprise  (Heron International).  Around  70 
percent  cooperators  of AP-HP are from France.  For the University  of 
California,  this US university  has Ô¨Åled 42 cooperation  patents  with three 
companies  that are YouHealth  Inc. (the US, 34 patents),  Lawrence  Liver- 
more National  Security,  LLC (the US, 8 patents),  and Guangzhou  Youze 
Biotech  Inc. (China,  1 patent),  respectively.  Nearly all of its co-owned  
patents  are in partnership  with US companies  in the AI-medical  Ô¨Åeld. 
Results suggest  that the geographical  location  of partners  plays a sig- 
niÔ¨Åcant  role in inter-organizational  collaboration.  Enterprises  and aca- 
demic institutions  locating  in the same geographic  region, cooperate  more closely in terms of patents.  Domestic  collaborations  have a ma- 
jor implication  for Ô¨Årm innovation  [19] . Guellec  and van Pottelsberghe  
[15] Ô¨Ånd that countries,  blessed  with geographical  proximity  and tech- 
nological  proximity,  are more liable to collaborate.  This is owing to the 
lower distance  among the cooperators,  the higher likelihood  of frequent  
interactions  among them [42] . Even if the inÔ¨Çuence  of geography  fac- 
tor has reduced  recently,  because  of the rapid growth  of internet  and 
transportation  networks  [13] . Therefore,  the spatial agglomeration  of 
trans-regional  patent cooperation  in the AI-medical  Ô¨Åeld needs to be 
further strengthened  to accelerate  the circulation  of knowledge.  
3.5. IPCs co-occurrence  network  
The IPC co-occurrence  network  can be utilized  to reveal novel con- 
vergence  patterns  [40] . Fig. 7 shows the IPCs co-occurrence  network  of

two periods  (1972‚Äì2010  and 2011‚Äì2019),  and the Force Atlas algorithm  
is adopted  in the layout. 
Each node stands for an IPC, and the links represent  the co- 
occurrences  of IPCs in one patent. The nodes with higher frequency  are 
located  in the center of the IPCs co-occurrence  network.  It can be seen 
that the rapid development  of AI technology  brings about a larger-scale  
of IPCs co-occurrence  network  in the recent decade.  The network  den- 
sity increases  from 0.033 (1972‚Äì2010)  to 0.053 (2011‚Äì2019).  
The frequency,  degree and PageRank  of main IPCs are exhibited  in 
Table 7 . Compared  to the period of 1972‚Äì2010,  there is Ô¨Åve new high- 
frequency  IPCs appeared  in 2011‚Äì2019,  which respectively  are G16H 
(healthcare  informatics),  G16B (bioinformatics),  G10L (speech  analysis  
or synthesis;  speech recognition;  speech or voice processing;  speech or 
audio coding or decoding),  H04L (transmission  of digital information),  
A61F (Ô¨Ålters implantable  into blood vessels;  prostheses;  devices  provid-  ing patency  to, or preventing  collapsing  of, tubular  structures  of the 
body). Furthermore,  G06K (recognition  of data) slips from 11th to 5th 
rank, and G06T (image data processing  or generation)  moves up from 
20th to 7th place in the rankings.  The PageRank  of these two IPCs has 
increased  by nearly three times over the past ten years, revealing  that 
the focus in 2011‚Äì2019  is G06K and G06T. 
Table 8 lists the primary  IPCs co-occurrence  relation  of AI-medical-  
related patents.  G01N (investigating  or analyzing  materials  by deter- 
mining their chemical  or physical  properties)  and C12Q (measuring  or 
testing processes  involving  enzymes,  nucleic  acids or microorganisms;  
compositions  or test papers therefore;  processes  of preparing  such com- 
positions;  condition-responsive  control in microbiological  or enzymo-  
logical processes)  are the most frequent  IPCs co-occurrence  association  
in the two periods.  Compared  to the period of 1972‚Äì2010,  the new IPCs 
associations  in 2011‚Äì2019  can be contributed  to Ô¨Ånd out the emerging

trends, e.g. G06T-G06K  (AI in medical  image recognition),  G06N-G06K  
(AI in medical  diagnostic  system),  G16B-C12Q  (prediction  of enzyme  
activity),  etc. The results suggest  that the application  of AI technolo-  
gies in the medical  Ô¨Åeld mainly focuses  on medical  image recognition,  
computer-aided  diagnosis,  disease  monitoring,  disease  prediction,  bioin- 
formatics,  and drug development,  etc. 
4. Conclusion  
The study systematically  investigates  the development  trend and 
technical  cooperation  of AI techniques  in the medical  Ô¨Åeld, through  the 
patentometric  and SNA method.  The results demonstrate  that numbers  
of AI-medical-related  patent applications  have been in a period of rapid 
growth  since 2011, which is attributable  to the breakthrough  progress  
of artiÔ¨Åcial  intelligence  algorithms  and the accumulation  of big data. 
America  is both the signiÔ¨Åcant  technical  innovation  country  in the AI- 
medical  Ô¨Åeld and the primary  competitive  market.  The main applica-  
tions are medical  image recognition,  computer-aided  diagnosis,  disease  
monitoring,  disease  prediction,  bioinformatics,  and drug development,  
etc. The active and key players  in the AI-medical  domain  are compa-  
nies and academic  institutions.  Furthermore,  the geographical  location  
of institutions  inÔ¨Çuences  patent cooperation,  and the major collabora-  
tive pattern  is domestic  collaboration.
